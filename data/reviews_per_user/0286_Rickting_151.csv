The Rock," I'm embarrassed to say I liked something by Michael Bay but...
","I don't like Michael Bay. He's a terrible director, with his sexism, racism, ugly visuals, mechanical storytelling and scripts which could have been written by 5 year olds. So it's embarrassing for me to admit I like this movie, but I do. It's only a 3 star movie (It's very fun but it's not desperately good in many areas) but I was looking for flaws throughout and I couldn't find that many. It's some ludicrous plot about terrorists taking over Alcatraz and planning to use chemical weapons on San Francisco. Nicolas Cage (before he became a joke) and Sean Connery team up and try to stop them. This film knows its purpose: It wants to entertain and do nothing else. With that, it succeeds. Cynical film goers may hate it, but the film is an insane adrenaline rush with some crazy dialogue, huge shootouts, a lot of big explosions and there's even a random car chase thrown in there. It's hard not to feel exhilarated, and Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery have a lot of chemistry.However, as you can expect, Michael Bay's direction is less than stellar, and the film isn't very tense and I consider tension to be the most important part of an action movie. The plot is stupid, and the villain is flat. However, it's an action film so what do you expect? This is a fun, well made although slightly overpraised movie with Michael Bay for once being given a good script to work with and it's the perfect antidote to the Transformers films and Bay's many other cinematic abominations. It's a movie which knows what it wants to be and what it should be, and for action junkies it is pretty much a guaranteed good time. The bottom line: Expect loads of fun. Don't expect anything else!6/10",7,1,2,13 January 2014
The Blair Witch Project," Important but over-hyped
","The Blair Witch Project is considered to be a landmark in horror history and terrified everyone back in 1999. Why exactly? This is the first found footage horror film (The first to exclusively use the format) and 3 annoying teenagers go into the woods to film a documentary, get lost and are hunted by the Blair Witch. That's all there is to it. I'm sick and tired of found footage as it's just a way to make money without actually scaring anyone. Troll Hunter, Cloverfield or the excellent Chronicle are all smart examples which use the format well, and this shows in other genres found footage can work. I still can't stand those stupid Paranormal Activity films though. However, at the time, this movie would have been very scary and boosted by a good marketing campaign. It's still scary today. For about 5 minutes. More an experiment than a movie, this is a very interesting film but it's became cool to hate for good reason. It's not a bad film like some say, but it's certainly not a great movie.The film has many assets. The finale at the house is very suspenseful, the way the film never shows the witch is very good as well and what people often forget is the acting is actually good (Heather Whatshername didn't deserve that Razzie) and the film creates a sense of unease and fear. But that doesn't mean it's scary. It's unnerving, patient and unique but it's about as scary as a walk in the park most of the time. Overly minimalistic, underwhelming, full of stupid decisions and deeply, deeply boring, this is one film you should never watch more than once even if you liked it the first time. There are only so many times one can stare at trees, tents being shaken and listen to weird noises before they just start to get annoyed. It's not a bad movie, just a remarkably average one hyped to absurd levels. It had a big impact at the time, but having seen many other superior horror films TBWP feels woefully unscary.5/10",5,0,0,14 January 2014
Insidious: Chapter 2," Things that go 'Ahhhhh!' in a laughably unscary manner in the night
","Insidious was an ace haunted house film although it did get a bit silly towards the end. The family are back and still getting haunted. James Wan made the excellent The Conjuring and was clearly putting all of his effort into that. So maybe he was too focused on that to actually direct this film at all. The first was excellent; yet this is a laughably awful and heartbreakingly lazy follow up. It had the same cast, same good director and some good trailers. How did this happen? James Wan has a few filmmaking tricks up his sleeve, and there are a couple of good scares. The rest of the time, it's a long, boring slog towards a monumentally convoluted and clichéd conclusion. As toys go beep beep in the night, pianos play by themselves, ghosts shriek, people stand around and explain the plot, fog obscures everything and the ghosts do more shrieking, don loads of white face paint, do their best Captain Jack Sparrow impersonations and go ludicrously over the top I nearly switched it off. And I never turn films off once I've started.Insidious Chapter 2 is like an F grade film studies exercise where the task was to make the audience jump. The film is composed of jarring jump scares which drain the tension and at times the film is unintentionally hilarious. The script is dreadful: It consists of exposition, jump scares and.... that's it. The acting is awful as well and it is difficult to get behind the haunted family when all you want them to do is head to the nearest acting class. Virtually every aspect of it is lazy, clichéd and underwhelming. Every thing in this film has been seen before and there aren't any surprises. It doesn't even want to be its own movie. It spends a good chunk trying to tie up loose ends from the first film. IC2 is one of the worst horror sequels I've seen. It's probably not one of the worst as I haven't seen that many horror sequels but this is a waste of everyone's time. Rather offensively, a third installment is on the way and this has a 6.6 rating on IMDb. LAME.2/10",3,7,11,18 November 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Unnecessary but interesting
","Thanks to Harry Potter books are constantly being split on film. This doesn't usually work and one part of the double bill or trilogy is always just a 2 hour (3 hour in the case of The Hobbit) build up. Katniss, after destroying the games, becomes a symbol for the rebellion and tries to save Peeta for the Capitol. This is the weakest of the franchise, but I enjoyed it more than others have. Mockingjay Part 1's main problem is the lack of action, but it manages to get away with it just about. Thankfully it's not another Breaking Dawn Part 1. It can feel like something waiting for happen for 2 hours, but it's a pleasant wait. The acting is excellent, and Jennifer Lawrence is a great heroine aside from an overdone nightmare waking up scene. Donald Sutherland doesn't appear that much, but he's wonderful as President Snow. It's still got politics and emotional depth which is what makes the franchise maybe the best YA adaptation series of them all, and the depth combined with the acting places it far above the Harry Potter films.It certainly comes up short on the action front, but there's enough going on to hold the attention. The trouble is that the film is a blatant cash grab and you can't help but yearn for a 3 hour finale instead of 2 films. Do we really need another hugely anticipated release in 2015? This is well made in many ways, but the endlessly drained colour palette occasionally evokes memories of Twilight and the last few Harry Potter films in a bad way. I still enjoyed this movie and it has plenty of drama which makes it very watchable, but there's too much filming political videos and not enough actually happening. They have a good twist and jump scare at the end though. A decent but disappointing sequel which I enjoyed, but without the acting this would be less bearable. I might go as far as to call this slightly underrated, but the way this is just unnecessary is fairly off putting. Still, it makes us even more eager for the final chapter.7/10",7,0,9,25 December 2014
Black Swan," Cinematic insanity
","Black Swan tells the story of a ballet dancer who goes on a terrifying descent into madness while facing the pressures of playing the lead of Swan Lake. This is a tough watch and you will need to brace yourself. This terrifying plummet into the abyss is more shocking and frightening than most horror films could ever hope to be, and it examines the dark side of fame and destructive road to greatness far better than most films do. Natalie Portman, as the lead, redeems herself for the Star Wars prequels, while Mila Kunis is surprisingly good as the lead's rival. Darren Aronofsky, who thankfully is on better form than he was when he helmed the slog that was Noah, directs the film brilliantly, and Black Swan manages not to tell the story of the psychological breakdown predictably. Developed characters, thought-provoking themes and a sharp, ferocious screenplay make this not just terrifying, but deeply upsetting as well. Black Swan may lost control of itself a bit towards the end and descend into over-the-top Gothic horror imagery, but this is only a slight misstep and it gets back on form fairly quickly. The story eventually starts to feel slightly rushed, but the finale still delivers an appropriately devastating blow. It's great that this was nominated for lots of awards at the Oscars for it completely deserved the nominations. I personally see this as a horror movie, so it's one of the best, if not the best horror films of the 2010s so far.9/10",9,1,3,29 February 2016
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not for the easily offended but still pretty hilarious
","Borat sees Sacha Baron Cohen pretend to be a journalist from Kazakhstan and travel around the USA with a camera crew in tow. Since he is interacting with people who don't know he's just an actor, this makes for a very interesting movie. Sacha Baron Cohen gives a terrific performance as Borat and creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 2000s. Be warned: Borat is unbelievably offensive. While it is a funny movie and while it does have some interesting social commentary, unfortunately Borat seems more focused on offending everyone than either of those things. Also, the film should be longer than just 80 minutes since some of the time it feels rushed and potentially great scenes end too quickly. Nevertheless, Borat provides some big laughs and I admire its showcase of a comedian doing such a brave and impressive feat as going through America dressed up as a character that's being appallingly offensive and humiliating himself repeatedly. If you know what you're getting into with Borat and understand that it's a certain type of humour, you're in for a funny comedy movie, albeit one that's more notable for its technique than for huge laughs. Perhaps its best element is its thought-provoking social commentary, so Borat is definitely one of the most interesting comedies of recent times.8/10",8,1,2,2 April 2016
The Monuments Men," How did this happen?!
","What went wrong? Good story. Great cast. Good director. Good title. It should be monumental right? Everyone was anticipating it highly. Everyone was expecting it to be a big Oscar contender. However, it's safe to say the Oscars will stay far away from it. It may even get a few razzie nominations. A great cast try to save important art from the Nazis. It's based on a very interesting true story, and George Clooney's previous films as a director were well received. Some things in the movie world just can't be explained. This isn't a completely unforgivable movie. Cate Blanchett does a good job, and the actors aren't necessarily awful. It's a good story, so there's a certain level of interest to be had while watching it. There are some good looking bits and it gets a little better as it progresses once things actually start to happen. However, I cannot be expected to wait 70 minutes for the first act to end. The truth is, The Monuments Men is like waiting for a bus which never shows up for 118 minutes.Despite it's great cast and good story TMM ruthlessly and cruelly wastes its potential with a movie so boring it feels like a parody of boring movies. It trudges along with a snail's pace and makes The Tree Of Life look like a John Woo action epic. The script is as bland as they come, and barely anything happens. The jokes feel stiff and awkward, the attempts at excitement provoke no kind of reaction and the storyline just drags on. There's almost nothing interesting about this movie at all. I didn't care about anything and the fact that much of it was juggling 4 different sets of events in 4 different places, my attention was lost early on. It's got a good soundtrack but that's about it. The trailers looked promising and they were good because despite the lack of exciting stuff in the trailers at least we didn't know everything that happens. That's because nothing much really happens and there wasn't a lot to show.4/10",4,0,0,24 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Doesn't deserve the hate doesn't deserve much love either
","The most anticipated and disappointing movie ever made. That is pretty much the only achievement of the much derided first installment of the prequel trilogy. Some hate it, some like it and some, like me, are in the middle. While the originals were powerful and hugely enjoyable stories of freedom and character, this is a misguided and wooden film about... trade disputes. Are we meant to care about the politics of the Star Wars universe?! This isn't a terrible movie though. Yes, Jar Jar and yes, young Anakin but one annoying kid and one annoying alien can't sink an entire movie (Still, oh boy does Jar Jar come close). As routine as the visuals are, the film is visually stunning and the Star Wars universe is one I am always happy to return to. The film still has some interesting characters and mythology, and some of the action sequences, especially the pod race, are very entertaining while the final Lightsabre duel is among the best of the franchise and one of the great good moments in bad movies.So it doesn't deserve all the hate. But it doesn't deserve any love either. George Lucas shows he may be good at changing blockbuster cinema but he isn't a good director. His direction is tame and uninspired, and the film consists of cardboard characters drifting across artificial CGI landscapes. What's worse is the script, which might as well have been run over by a steam roller and while the film's got plenty of style it lacks a soul. The impressive cast all either spend their time either shouting 'Yippee!', failing to show emotion, screaming, performing monologues in monotone or ruining people's childhoods; frequently all at the same time. The politics make the movie even more annoying and did we really need what creates the force to be explained to us? An average movie, hyped to ridiculous levels. Definitely the weakest of the saga.5/10",5,0,3,27 January 2014
The Equalizer," Nothing special, but it certainly delivers
","Denzel Washington launches a one man war on the Russian Mafia. Sign me up! This adaptation of the 80s TV show stars Washington as a retired black ops operative who puts the skills from his old life into action when he witnesses a prostitute he has had conversations with getting beaten and throughout the film works his way through the Russian mafia. This delivers exactly was it says on the tin and is a good, well made action movie although you'll forget in a week. Starting with the negatives. If you want to see this because you're a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz, don't bother since she's in the film for maybe 15 minutes. She's completely wasted and as she's the emotional core of a very brutal and action packed film, this was a mysterious decision. There is a sense of mean spiritedness throughout, and the violence, which at times feels like a Saw movie, often feels forced and unnecessary. The film is too long and dips from time to time in the middle, and for some reason there's an unnecessary side-plot with Denzel trying to help a friend lose weight on a regime. Um, this isn't Training Day.This is a fairly formulaic movie and one which goes the motions and lacks a sense of humanity, but it is better than you might expect. Antoine Fuqua proves himself once again a skilled director who knows how to build tension, and Denzel Washington is excellent as the main character. Chloe Grace Moretz, while totally wasted, shines in her fleeting moments of screen time. The film refuses to go into generic shootouts and fist fights, and instead moves from one old school suspenseful set piece to another. There are some interesting themes of justice, so the film does actually have a quiet power and Denzel Washington's character, although not given all that much back story, gives the film some emotion. The finale is a cut above the rest of the movie and genuinely excellent, meaning I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is quite an interesting and slightly different movie, which has some appreciated (Although really not a lot of) depth. The premise and marketing say it's Denzel Washington taking out the whole Russian gangster community in Boston. That's what we were promised. That's what we get.6/10",7,1,4,3 October 2014
If I Stay," If this had stayed any longer I don't know how I would have coped
","In the latest Young Adult weepie adaptation to hit the screens, Chloe Grace Moretz plays a 17 year old musician who is left in a coma after a car crash that kills her family and she must choose between life and death. As this is a teen drama, of course there's also a love story. If I Stay is meant to be a tear jerker, but if certain scenes have you howling with laughter, there's definitely a problem. To be honest, this movie is one big problem. While fans of sappy love stories will be entertained and the film offers a couple of heart string tugging moments and some really cool parent characters, IIS is simply a terrible movie. Watch The Fault in Our Stars instead. I'm not the target audience, but I can enjoy this kind of film if it's done properly. This one is a soppy, underdone, manipulative mess which barely raises a sob. RJ Cutler, who makes his feature film directional debut, shows no personality or imagination behind the camera, and the film hops between flashbacks and Chloe wandering around the hospital in ghost form with the delicacy of a hyperactive frog.Chloe Grace Moretz gives a weak performance as Mia. Having learnt nothing from Carrie, she tries again to play an outsider but it just doesn't work and sadly her role just feels wet. A terrible shame considering how good she normally is. Her love interest is played by a wooden newcomer who doesn't do anything particularly interesting with his character. The quality of a film hinges entirely on the script. Without a good script, any positives in a film are often for naught. IIS has a soppy screenplay where every scene exists for exposition or making people cry. It fails. The film is very boring, it sacrifices true depth for manipulation and the ending is frustrating and lazy to the point where comparisons with The Devil Inside would be justified. Phony and manipulative, IIS may not be as bad as Endless Love, but while that was just a tedious romance, this throws in loads of drama which could have been interesting but doesn't develop it. The romance itself is silly and unrealistic, the main character is ungrateful and only thinks of her ex boyfriend even though her family could be dead and it just makes you want to sleep. Hit Girl would be mortified.3/10",3,3,7,14 February 2015
Gravity," Jaws will drop
","2013 was a weak year for movies overall, but it did have this, a breathtaking and mind blowing sci-fi masterpiece which boots most of 2013's other releases into a bin liner. The plot is simple: 2 astronauts try to survive a space disaster. However, this is Alfonso Cuaron directing so it's not that straightforward. I've only seen the film once at the Imax, and I don't know if it would hold up on a repeat viewing on a smaller screen. The story won't wow anybody either, so just sit back and let it draw you in. You'll be glad you did. As the 2 astronauts Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are excellent, while in terms of visual effects space has never looked better. The film is one of the few movies that used 3D properly and actually immerses you in the experience instead of just being a gimmick which makes more money and forces people to wear annoying glasses for the whole movie. If you want to be jaw dropped for 90 minutes this is the film for you, since every single frame oozes glorious CGI and amazing photography.Some have criticized the script, but loads of development and sentimentality would have sent the film crashing down to earth, so stop complaining! As a visual experience, there really isn't anything else like it and the ending when Sandra Bullock returns to earth will make you want to punch the air. It does actually have an emotional core and it is a powerful survival story that actually pays attention to science and feels plausible. The star of the show is Cuaron, whose use of long takes, tracking shots and camera movement pull audiences right into the film and never let go. Most would argue The Conjuring is 2013's most scary film, but this is arguably even more suspenseful and palm sweating. This is the best thrill ride of 2013 and one of the most technically accomplished movies ever, managing to pack more visual dazzle, emotional power and humanity into 90 minutes than Avatar did in 162 minutes.9/10",9,4,8,17 January 2014
Se7en," Best cinematic murder mystery of all time
","Se7en tells the harrowing story of 2 detectives trying to find a brutal serial killer who bases his horrific killings on the seven deadly sins. Se7en is, in my mind, the best detective movie ever made and here's why. This is one twisted, messed-up and depressing movie, but it's not unwatchable. It's actually hugely entertaining, it's got two amazing set-pieces and it's a compelling, unpredictable story. Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats. This explores its nihilistic concepts with art and subtlety, so that the relentlessly harrowing subject matter doesn't get in the way of characters and action. Best of all, this has one of the greatest movie endings in the history of cinema, and for that alone it's worth watching. A truly great movie, which holds up very well on a re-watch, and is one of my favourite films of the 90s.10/10",10,2,4,8 May 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Another self-indulgent dialogue showcase from Quentin Tarantino
","Oh for crying out loud. When will Quentin Tarantino realize that he can't have a 2 and a half hour movie consisting entirely of people sitting around tables and talking with occasional flashes of excessive yet simultaneously tedious violence? More importantly, why do people love him so much? A group of Jewish soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, become Nazi hunters in Nazi-occupied France, with the villainous Hans Landa as their nemesis. Well, that's what I thought I was getting. Brad Pitt and co disappear for long stretches of time while characters sit down and talk about strudels, cinemas, King Kong and a lot of the time nothing whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film in many ways so I can't completely write it off. Christoph Waltz has done the performance he does here several times now, but here he is at his best and he's brilliant. Michael Fassbender is good and the rest of the acting is fine. There are good bits (Especially the marvellous opening scene) and the cinema shootout finale is quite effective. Also, you can sense Tarantino's love for cinema running through the film which makes it more interesting to watch. Unfortunately, while the writing is often good, a lot of the time nothing is happening, the film is completely incoherent and messy (Here's proof that Tarantino's movies being non-linear don't add anything to the films!) and it goes on and on and on. This isn't a bad film, but it's a very self-indulgent one which is basically lots of scenes, some good, some bad, put together in a stunted non-linear narrative which doesn't even manage to sustain the paper-thin revenge plot. As for the violence? Bland. After a strong introduction to the film's heroes and villains, soon it just becomes a lot of sitting around and talking. All in all, an arrogant, poorly constructed war movie which shows Tarantino re-affirming his status as the most overrated filmmaker working today. By the way: The Hatful Eight was better than this.6/10",6,1,3,24 February 2016
Zootopia," A good Disney movie on the whole and deserving of the 'classic' label attached to most Disney animated films
","Zootropolis (Or Zootopia, as the title differs depending on the country), is an impressive animated film overall. It takes place in a very good fictional universe, where anthropomorphic animals live in a big city metropolis and it's human society with animals. That's a very good concept and it doesn't disappoint. The world of the film is developed excellently with colorful characters, brilliant animation and lots of nice world-beating details. There's plenty of action, color, fun and charm for the kids, but a timely and relevant message, interesting political themes, emotional depth and many fabulous Easter eggs scattered throughout will keep the adults happy. This is a film the family can enjoy together and one which adults won't feel the need to sleep through. The voice acting is good as well and overall, this is a successful Disney work. It's probably on the same level as Frozen. The trouble is, it's just another Disney movie. I'll admit, I'm not a great fan of Disney animated films. They're repetitive, they're formulaic and they largely fail to take risks. This film does have political themes and no romance in sight, but don't forget it handles its themes with kiddy gloves and the same highly charming but un-artistic vibe many Disney movies do. But don't get me wrong, this is absolutely worth seeing even if it's not a ground-breaking Disney classic. 8/10",8,1,2,7 August 2017
Argo," A brilliant mix of Oscar bait and quality entertainment
","Argo is based on the declassified true story about a CIA agent who went into Iran and rescued 6 Americans under the cover of a movie producer. It won best picture 2012. I'm not too fond of the academy's decisions normally, but for once they made the right choice. Argo does deviate from the facts a bit, but that makes the film even more enjoyable. Unlike most other best picture winners, which are mainly either about history or an important issue, this is both a work of exceptionally high quality and an entertaining blockbuster that did great work at the box office. Acting wise, everyone does fine but Alan Arkin completely steals the film as a film producer and what is most surprising about the film is that it's actually very funny. The script is absolutely electric and consistently made me laugh, which I wasn't expecting at all. The film is also nail bitingly tense and that brilliantly made escape sequence is more stressful than rush hour on the tube.Argo is consistently exciting and witty throughout, and doesn't really dip much. The settings and characters are recreated with brilliant attention to detail as well, and despite the historical inaccuracies they do not detract from the film. Some backlash appears to have hit Argo but what else was meant to win? Life Of Pi was good and visually amazing but it was too long and had too many dips, Lincoln was excellent but far too slow, Zero Dark Thirty is awful and Silver Linings Playbook is too slight for the academy. It's both Oscar worthy and fun, and made 2 hours vanish. It automatically makes up for Pearl Harbour and it shows Ben Affleck is one of the best actor turned directors out there and long may he continue to get directing gigs. Overall, Argo is a fantastic mix of suspense, humour and historical detail and anyone with even the slightest interest in history should go and see it. Perhaps the most entertaining history lesson of all time.10/10",10,0,5,13 October 2014
Hostel," Does one of the nastiest horror films of the 21st century live up to the hype? Short answer, no
","Long answer: Eli Roth jettisons the satirical potential of his screenplay in favour of... not a lot to be honest. The thing is, the torture scenes, while repugnant and disgusting, mercifully don't take up too much of the film. As a result, this is mainly a film consisting of 3 repulsive guys going around objectifying women and having sex, before as always in a horror film their search for action leads to a very bad place indeed. I have heard this film described as a satire or sociopolitical commentary of some sort, and there is something there for sure. The trouble is, there just isn't an awful lot to Hostel. It's nasty and mean-spirited but mostly it's just tedious. There are intense moments but there's not enough atmosphere; basically, the film just wonders what to do with itself for an hour before exhausting the viewer with endless torture porn towards the end. It is undeniably disturbing and the acting is good for a horror film. There's definitely an element of fear, but Eli Roth, although his direction is perfectly fine, didn't quite manage to back up his ideas with a decent script. Watch Saw instead (The first one, not those awful sequels).4/10",4,2,3,13 August 2017
Green Room," A murderously intense thriller
","Green Room sees a punk rock band trapped in a nightclub after witnessing a murder. A group of violent skinheads, led by Patrick Stewart, do all in their power to prevent them getting out alive. GR is a pleasingly small-scale thriller. The budget is small, we don't find out that much about the characters, it's mostly in one location and there's virtually no humour. And that's a very good thing. All of these things add to the film, making it a nightmarishly tense and sadistically hard-hitting thriller that never pauses for breath. Thanks to the claustrophobic direction and deft acting, this really is an intense ride. It is not for the faint of heart features many shocking death scenes. It was pretty upsetting for me seeing Maeby from Arrested Development dying violently. It's not a perfect movie, just like every other film out there has its flaws. It's confusing at times and Patrick Stewart's villain isn't particularly developed, as a result feeling like a wasted character. There is an occasionally repetitive sense to the storyline as well. Overall though, if you like viscerally terrifying and brutal thrillers, this is without a doubt the film for you. A sharp, scary movie overall, which is definitely worth seeing in the cinema.8/10",8,4,11,2 June 2016
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," One of the best animated movies for adults ever
","In this hilarious, subversive, satirical and deliciously offensive romp, the South Park parents pressure the US to wage war against Canada for making an R-rated movie which they feel corrupted their children. Initially this looks like an attack on censorship, which South Park does face a lot of, but it's actually a satirical meditation on virtually every issue imaginable. With so many jokes flying everywhere, this will probably take 2 viewings to fully get and the songs don't really add much to the film in my opinion a lot of the time. It's an undisciplined and chaotic film, but in the best sense of the word. It was made when South Park had yet to reach its peak, but it often reaches the standard of episodes like Scott Tenorman Must Die, Make Love Not Warcraft and Woodland Critter Christmas with its thought-provoking story, consistently hilarious jokes and a surprising amount of action and suspense as well. This one outclasses The Simpsons Movie by some distance (And that was a very good film too) and overall this delightful comedic juggernaut turns being offended into sheer, wonderful fun. It deserves awards for that alone.8/10",8,0,0,23 October 2016
Oldboy," A brutal, haunting, dark and brilliantly twisted masterpiece
","This demented Korean revenge thriller is one of the rare movies which despite being absolutely full of graphic violence, unpleasant scenes and shocking twists is still brilliant, strangely beautiful and captivating. Oldboy tells the story of a man held in solitary confinement for 15 years, who is released without explanation and is given 5 days to find the identity of his captor and find out the truth. The truth hurts. Oldboy is a strange, powerful and twisted tale of revenge. It starts off slow and will to be too much for some to take, but it's not quite as bad as you've probably heard in terms of the violence, although the plot is brutal and disturbing. Oldboy is a hypnotically brilliant movie in almost every way and manages not to feel like mean spirited trash. Oldboy is an incredibly powerful film because of the emotions it depicts. Almost a foreign Get Carter, it's captivating due to its convincing portrayal of the extremes of human emotions and powerful performances.The various actors in the film, who I haven't encountered as I'm not at all familiar with Korean cinema, are extraordinary. The main character is flawed and well rounded, while the villain is one of the sickest and most disturbing on screen bad guys ever. It's got a twisty and unpredictable plot, leading one of the most shocking twist endings of all time. The fascinating and brilliant story is what makes the film so memorable, but Chan-Wook Park creates a visually brilliant and utterly nightmarish canvas for the story to unfold on. The film looks absolutely extraordinary and although it's not an action based film, the one take corridor fight sequence is 3 minutes of beautiful, badass combat I'll never forget. Oldoby, overall, is a twisted, haunting masterful revenge tale with the power of a hammer blow between the eyes. A true nightmare you won't want to wake up from, this is a perfect example of how to make bleak art. A masterpiece.10/10",10,1,4,10 December 2014
About Time," Rom com with charm, visual splendour and various flaws
","Richard Cutis rolls out another sentimental, charming and brilliantly British rom com with About Time. This time, it's boy meets girl. Boy can travel in time. A romantic comedy with a time travel twist, AT has various shortcomings but is overall pleasant and reasonably well done. Richard Curtis writes and directs the film, and he shows his skill as a director as the visuals are excellent. The script has other issues, but much of the drama feels real and the jokes and funny without resorting to vulgarity. The humour's fairly original and you can't see all of the jokes coming. Things are repeated thanks to the involvement of time travel but it doesn't grow repetitive. This is a sentimental film but not in an overly cloying way and some of the dramatic moments are genuinely emotional, but in a calm, unforced sort of way. The acting is good all around, but the standout is Bill Nighy as the father, who's performance sparkles with both pathos and dry wit. AT is a touching and funny film overall, but it has several problems which become more apparent in the second half.While the sentimentality is fine, it's inevitably a bit soppy. The problem with AT is that there's not a lot of point. Once the central relationship gets going there's no conflict or threat, and instead the film goes into other underdeveloped subplots. The film drifts from event to event without actually saying much or offering any obstacles to the characters, and leaves various plot holes in its wake. AT has some rather problematic messages, and the implication that the main character could not have had his successes or his romances without the time travel is a bit offensive. A lot of the time, you can't quite see where it's going. AT certainly lacks urgency or true conflict, but it's well executed and enjoyable enough for that to be overlooked and all in all it's another triumph for Working Title. Many will enjoy this and it might even be a tear jerking movie for some. It hasn't got an awful lot of logic to it but it doesn't necessarily need it. It's no Back To The Future, but it does time travel in an interesting and less formulaic way than other time travel films.7/10",7,3,4,27 December 2014
Spotlight," An awards season movie that actually lives up to the hype
","Spotlight tells the story of a team at the Boston Globe who uncovered a sex abuse scandal involving Catholic priests in Boston, and this would eventually lead to a much wider scandal. Spotlight is a very minimalistic film; dialogue driven, subtly directed and almost documentary style. Most of the film is just people talking, but it's a ruthlessly absorbing film more thrilling than many thrillers and more horrifying than most horror films. Although it's very low key, it's a strong, hard-hitting and deeply powerful tale, brought to life with excellent acting and Tom McCarthy's superbly stripped down direction. Spotlight is not just a movie. It's life. It's a real event, populated with human characters which doesn't resort to manipulation, pyrotechnics, emotional breakdowns or a load of shouting. A very worthy, engrossing and fittingly affecting drama, this actually lives up to the Oscar hype for once. It's probably too low key to win Best Picture, but I'd have no complaints if it did.9/10",9,2,4,16 February 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," Studio Ghibli rule
","I've seen 4 Studio Ghibli films now (This, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and The Wind Rises) and they are miles ahead of DreamWorks and nearly every other animated studio. Their films are just as visually stunning as the CGI ones and uniquely magical. My Neighbour Totoro is another enchanting film about 2 girls making friends with the forest spirits and having various adventures. MNT is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever and it should be. It's not as good as the other Ghibli films I've seen. It's very short and there's not that much of a plot. Therefore, it feels slighter and briefer than the others. There is a slight lack of structure. Those shortcomings demote it from a five star movie to a four star one, but there's plenty to love about this movie. The visuals are great and there is a real sense of wonder and amazement. It's colourful, dazzling and the anime looks just as realistic as Pixar's animation does. Hayao Miyazaki is pretty much the current ruler of animation, and only Walt Disney can rival him in the animated world.MNT is a very soulful and sweet movie that feels genuinely magical and enchanting. Various scenes such as the bus stop and the cat bus are awe inspiring and wondrous, and the script has plenty of sentiment but feels genuine and charming. This is a film where only the most cynical and hardened film viewers will dislike it, as the film has likability and charm in spades. This children's film lacks what many children's films are sorely lacking: A sense of innocence and elegance. It may not be the best movie by Studio Ghibli but it has some of the most memorable moments from their filmography and some of their best images. The forest spirits are beautifully designed and there's good reason why a Totoro toy appears in Toy Story 3. This is a more relaxed picture from Miyazaki and while his other movies have their frightening bits this is pretty much devoid of them. A delightful animated movie with plenty of sparkle and dazzle. Younger audiences will be enthralled, but it'll speak to adults as well.8/10",8,0,1,24 November 2014
The Terminator," Super strong sci-fi classic
","Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his most famous role, plays a brutal killing machine sent into the past to kill the mother of the resistance leader who leads the humans in the war against the machines in the future. A human soldier is sent back in time to protect her. Cue loads of sublime science fiction mayhem. The Terminator is inevitably dated due to the small budget, but it's a great time at the movies. It is a science fiction classic and completely deserves to be, thanks to the interesting story and strong action sequences. While it's a fast paced and snappy movie which hurtles along at breakneck speed, there's a moving relationship in the film and the elements of time travel give the story unexpected depth, which ensure the film certainly does not represent its iconic antagonist. Arnold Schwarzenegger dominates the screen in brilliant badass fashion and while he doesn't have many lines, he delivers them excellently and is an intimidating and threatening villain, although he's still not as cool as R2 D2 and C3PO.The brilliantly made action ensures the film crackles with high octane thrills and genuine energy. There are too many chase sequences in the film, but at least they remain fun despite some repetition. It's overall a very well made film and delivers thrill after thrill. The runtime isn't overlong and it's easy to watch and enjoy. Acting is all around good and Sarah Connor, although she really became a cool character in the sequel, isn't your typical damsel in distress. Kyle Reese is also a very good character. In General, The Terminator is an iconic and entertaining movie which has surprising depth and plenty of fun action. It's not the best science fiction film ever and can't help but look slight next to its dream sequel, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but mostly it's held up pretty well and even though the budget is relatively small the effects and surprisingly convincing. James Cameron's films can leave one cold, but he certainly knows how to turn millions of dollars into ultra cool cinematic art and put butts on seats.9/10",9,3,3,17 December 2014
The Hateful Eight," One of Tarantino's better movies
","I'm not a Quentin Tarantino fan. His movies are self indulgent, appallingly overlong and despite the fact that they're what everyone complains about- style over substance- everyone seems to love them. Reservoir Dogs is a great film, but Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, while good films in many ways, were bloated, overdone epics of nothingness. The Hateful Eight, which is a stage play style murder mystery set in a cabin in America shortly after the Civil War. 8 unlikable characters, including a bounty hunter and his prisoner, are there and soon things get tense and the blood starts flowing. This seems to be dividing audiences quite a bit. For me, this is actually better than Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. With the amazing 70mm cinematography is amazing, and Tarantino shows he's a very good director as well as a good writer. This is a pretty dark movie, and it has various thought provoking themes which work well. The claustrophobic setting and tense murder mystery narrative make this feel more focused and suspenseful, unlike some of his other films which just rambled on all over the place.Acting is typically excellent, especially from Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and since this felt thematically deeper and far more tense than some of Tarantino's other films, I enjoyed this more. It was actually about something for once. I was interested in The Hateful Eight since it was mostly in one location and had a budget of $44 million. It looked more like Reservoir Dogs, so I thought I'd get on better with this one. I did, but I also thought Tarantino might restrain himself a bit here. Not so. This movie is nearly 3 hours long and before they get to the cabin, it's pretty desperate. It's as bloated and self indulgent as ever, although it uses its non linear storytelling well. At times ugly and often featuring rambling dialogue sequences which could be done in a few lines but instead go on and on, this struggles to maintain the energy of its best sequences. As for the violence? A bit exhausting and superfluous, but Tarantino knows how to do a shootout. A decent movie; outrageously overlong but it shows Tarantino being more arty and mature as a filmmaker and writer, so it should be relatively satisfying for most.7/10",6,1,7,30 January 2016
Ocean's Twelve," Are the people who made so deluded they think we will be satisfied with this?
","There is no heist. Despite the fact it is a heist movie and a sequel to a heist movie there is no heist. In this worthless follow up to the surreally enjoyable Ocean's Eleven, Danny Ocean and his team are back and, to pay the person they stole from in the first movie back, they have to steal a Jewelled egg or...something? Steven Soderbergh is still a strong director and there is a good musical score, but the suggestion anyone would be genuinely satisfied with this is an insult to our intelligence. It's smug, stupendously stupid and totally bland. I want to see an entertaining heist movie, not a lazy, illogical comedy in which the criminals act smug, perform odd jobs and get caught by police. It's an awful storyline, with plot twists compensating for the lazy writing. They do eventually steal a Jewelled egg but the way in which it's done is convoluted and the closest thing we get to a heist is an annoying side character break dancing through lasers.To cut a long story short: The twists fall flat. The locations fall flat. Numerous bizarre scenes such as Julia Roberts' character impersonating Julia Roberts and a thief break dancing through lasers fall flat. The plot falls flat. Almost all of the jokes fall flat. The heist would have fallen flat had there actually been one. The story falls. The lack of thrills and fun falls flat (obviously). The natural charisma of George Clooney and Brad Pitt falls flat. Bruce Willis falls flat in a dire cameo. Julia Roberts falls flat, especially when impersonating herself. Don Cheadle was already falling flat thanks to his dreadful accent and now he falls even flatter. Matt Damon falls flat. They all fall flat. The ending falls flat. The locations fall flat. Lock this up in a high security vault and don't ask Danny and his team to come and get it. It doesn't deserve it.3/10",3,0,1,11 June 2014
Crash," Is this a joke?
","There are many big questions in the world of cinema. However, the biggest one of them all is not how does Michael Bay/Friedberg and Seltzer/Kristen Stewart/Adam Sandler/every other untalented person who still gets work find work? Not what happened to M Night Shyamalan? Not dos every slightly successful film get a sequel? Not why are they making another Spiderman franchise? Oh no. The biggest one is: How did this manipulative, preachy, patronizing and pretentious mess win best picture? Are you kidding me? Is this some sort of joke? Paul Haggis' directional debut is about a race relations in LA as various characters collide in different story lines. Crash takes an interesting approach: It doesn't take sides and makes us question where our sympathies lie which is a good idea, but sadly it does this with the subtlety of a Fast And Furious set piece. The acting is fantastic, with Sandra Bullock standing out in a more serious role than normal, but aside from that this is the worst best picture winner ever and the most disgustingly overrated movie of all time.Crash thinks it's deep, meaningful and emotionally powerful. It's not. It is a group of horrible characters being horrible to each other for 2 hours. That's it. Also, are we really meant to believe that these people keep bumping into each other in one of the biggest cities in America? The script is absolutely awful with all of these characters talking in ways no-one in real life talks and worst of all, the film seems to think it's being deep just because it shows the characters being nice at times and cruel at others. The direction is also dreadful, and on a cinematic level this is totally uninteresting. This is pretty much the Zero Dark Thirty of the 2000s: A genuinely abysmal movie which is only liked because it covers an important issue. From the word go the film feels forced and stupid and in the second half the never-ending stream of manipulative moments and bizarre coincidences verge on parody. We don't learn anything from this. Neither do the characters. This is just a manipulative, preachy drama which tells its audience racism is bad- all with the intelligence, depth and sophistication of a Transformers action set piece.

Spider-Man: Homecoming," The first awesome Spider-Man film for 13 years
","Tom Holland Is Spider-Man. We'll always have Tobey Maguire, but Tom Holland has the charm, the humour, the emotional depth and first and foremost, he looks and acts like a kid. So, armed with the best Spider-Man portrayal to date, the MCU brings Spider-Man swinging into cinemas- for the third time in 15 years. Rest assured; this is a good film. This is a review coming from someone who's grown pretty fed up with the MCU lately. The key thing about Spider-Man Homecoming is that it's fun. It's a witty, funny high-school movie that happens to be full of superheroes. It's also uneven, features a somewhat dull would-be love interest (Though thankfully nothing as annoying as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson- this movie's MJ is very interesting) and has a far more workman-like director than Sam Raimi or Marc Webb at the helm, but those issues don't hold the movie back. Fun action, a fast, charming, witty and ultra-cool screenplay and all-around strong performances make this a very good time at the movies, and the decision to show Spidey's emotional turmoil and coming of age instead of his origins was a masterstroke. This suggests a bright future for Spider-Man in the MCU- and it has one of the best, if not The best, MCU post-credits scenes ever.8/10",8,1,4,21 July 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Pure genius
","Stanley Kubrick this time turns his attention to the cold war. Adapting a cold war thriller to the big screen, he increasingly started to see the funny side in it and the result is Dr Strangelove, the tense, dark- and utterly hysterical- story of a war room full of generals and politicians trying to stop a general from triggering nuclear war. As this is Kubrick, everything is meticulously crafted and nothing happens by accident. Despite his other dark and disturbing movies, Kubrick's comedy is one of the funniest films ever made. The laughs flow more slowly at first, before the floodgates open and once the film gets going it never slows down. Although it's a satire, part of the films ingenuity is that there's a unmistakable ring of truth and the laughter is often bitter. The screenplay is incredible; oozing with laughs and full of clever symbolism. It also has the best use of a cola cola machine in cinematic history.The acting is great, with winsome performances from George C Scott and Peter Sellers. What's even more mesmerizing is the direction. With every shot perfectly crafted and every frame full of power and art, the film never ceases to be compelling. In general, who knew the end of the world could be so funny? While it's certainly funnier than anything Adam Sandler's recently done, the film finds plenty of laughter in its coal black subject matter and is the ultimate black comedy. With plenty of iconic moments and a sharp wit, as well plenty of ingenuity, Dr Strangelove is definitely one of the best comedies ever made and another brilliant effort from Stanley Kubrick. Dr Strangelove is something all aspiring comedy writers should watch and all sorts of people should be able to relate to it. Although it's now 50 years old, it isn't particularly dated and its themes still resonate today. It has a bit of a slow start, but other than that it hits like the bomb.10/10",10,1,4,27 October 2014
Fast & Furious 6," High octane, nonsensical, OTT, explosive fun
","Carrying on the story from Fast Five, Dwayne Johnson's scene stealing federal agent reunites the heist team to take out a team of mercenaries. Those who saw Fast Five will have sensible expectations: Not that much plot of depth, loads of ridiculous set pieces, endless explosions and a total disregard of the laws of physics. However, if you thought F&F5 was silly, wait until you see this. Dwayne Johnson and other characters jump from a speeding car onto another without a scratch. A dangerous car race is held in London which would never be able to go ahead. Some preposterous set piece involving a tank. For 15 minutes, a massive set piece on a plane takes place while the plane and several cars hurtle down a runway. For 15 minutes. Empire did the calculations: The runway is 27 miles long. The longest runway in the world is 3.5 miles long. Just go with it. F&F6 has the subtlety of a truck ploughing through an explosives factory, but that's part of the fun. Stupidity has rarely been cooler.However, this is a step down from number 5. It's once again too long, Vin Diesel is still a hugely dull lead and the script is weaker this time. There are plenty of humorous moments, but the script goes the motions and the humour is turned down this time. The plot can be convoluted some times as well. Those flaws do not spoil the experience and it's difficult not to be entertained as explosive set piece after explosive set piece lights up the screen. This is a very entertaining action film which also feels like it means well and genuinely just wants to be a great time. While in general it will be called a guilty pleasure, there is no shame in enjoying it. Justin Lin proves himself a good action director again, while the characters are still all likable and fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson is once again the highlight of the film and there are a couple of effective main character deaths towards the end. It's completely and utterly bonkers and in terms of action cinema this is definitely a good action film, and even though no runway is that long, the plane set piece is a blast.7/10",7,0,2,8 November 2014
The Expendables," The very definition of action garbage
","In The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Jason Stratham and all the other inexplicably popular charisma vacuums in the action movie industry go blow up some stuff, fight a big baddie and... that's it. I love action films but I don't automatically love all of them, and although this isn't a terrible movie and does offer some old school fun, it does feel rather soulless and lacks charisma. With explosions galore, there's plenty of entertain action junkies and there are a few inspired moments and high octane stupidity. In one of the great good scenes in bad movies, Mickey Rourke actually acts and delivers a powerful speech on a war he once thought in. However, none of the others are particularly great. Sylvester Stallone is particular has trouble changing his facial expression even once. His direction is acceptable, but also ugly and artificial at times. I have no problem with paying tribute to action films, but it'd be nice if it wasn't with the personality, depth and warmth of a Lord Of The Rings orc.The script is genuinely awful and doesn't have another humour for a film of this kind. A lot of the time it's very hard to even work out what's going on since the light is so poor. In general, the film just barrels on from one loud incomprehensible set piece to the next and even though it's meant to be a tribute to old school action it doesn't even feel that light or over the top a lot of the time and feels too cowardly to actually hit hard. When people talk about loud and noisy action garbage this is the sort of thing they are talking about. While I don't agree with those who dislike action movies, they have a strong piece of evidence here. It's a moderately watchable film and at times I was enjoying it but since the film is like a zombie walking through a graveyard of action clichés, this could be mistaken for some awful flick about zombie action heroes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis both appear, but sadly they're reduced to cameos. The Expendables 2 sounds OK, but I shudder to think of The Expendables 3 which is apparently even worse.4/10",4,0,1,3 November 2014
Scary Movie 2," Scary in its awfulness
","The thing is, Scary Movie wasn't that bad. Seriously, it was actually a half-decent spoof. This? Not so much. A spoof of haunted house movies, this starts out well with a funny Exorcist parody before descending into juvenile spoof fare that actually defies belief. How did someone come up with all these terrible jokes and see them as funny? Still, to come up with so many awful gags and stuff them into an 80 minute film must take a lot of skill, so for that the many writers should be given some sort of credit I suppose. Otherwise, this film deserves no credit at all. Ironically, the parts where it works are during the more action-based set pieces which can be quite fun. It has a reasonable cast as well, with the returning leads (Even though their characters died in the first one) giving serviceable performances. Tim Curry and David Cross are both good as well. The reason why this spoof doesn't work is because the jokes are so lame, juvenile, over-the-top and coarse that you'll find yourself nostalgically thinking of many horror films this kind of spoof parodies, since most of them are funnier than this. The truth is, it'd be a good spoof for young children since they might find this kind of humour funny. Sadly, since it's also very adult and at times pretty offensive, which clashes jarringly with the juvenile nature of the movie, the people that will go to see this are mostly just going to be annoyed. Overall, this just isn't a good movie. At first, you can sort of enjoy it due to its silly, unrestrained atmosphere but eventually it just becomes highly annoying. There are decent jokes at times, but they pop up too rarely to salvage this train wreck of a comedy.2/10",2,0,1,31 March 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," Watch without listening to the hype
","Pan's Labyrinth, Guillermo del Toro's universally adored dark fairy tale for grown ups, follows the step daughter of a nasty army officer who escapes into a mysterious fantasy world. This is very audacious as it's combining a fantasy world populated with dream like creatures with a brutal real world where war and violence reign supreme. This is a bold movie, and maybe that's why people raved about it since it works partially. For me, it just didn't click. It's a very mixed bag and while not an enjoyable film it has some strong qualities that belong in a better movie. The acting, even from the child lead, is very strong and the film has one of the nastiest villains of the 21st century. It's an interesting idea and there are occasions where a mysterious power shakes itself to life. The death of Ofelia at the end is pretty shocking and some bits, such as when she first enters the labyrinth, are well done. The acting makes the movie, and it's difficult not to admire such a bold hybrid of 2 very different genres.I don't get the hype about the visuals of the movie. The cinematography is very routine and bland. The dark lighting adds nothing to the movie. Del Toro's direction is average at best. The real world scenes are OK but nothing special. The fantasy part of the film feels half hearted and is very unimaginative. The tasks Ofelia has to complete are woefully unimaginative. It's just a war movie with a faun, a labyrinth, some fairies and a load of other creatures but it doesn't fulfil the promise of the premise as there's an uneven balance. Del Toro is clearly in love with his premise, and the way that he mixes the 2 elements and tries so hard to create contrast by throwing in a lot of brutal and pointless violence is very off putting. PL feels somewhat pretentious as a result and in general is just a bit boring. A weird, dark fantasy movie which isn't as bold or smart as it thinks it is and lacks true punch, although I'll give it a second viewing in future.5/10",5,2,6,29 November 2014
Final Destination 2," Simple but effective
","Most film reviewers probably have an anomaly; a film or film series which they shouldn't like but do. The Final Destination films are mine. While the acting and writing are painful at times, the premise is intelligent and they're more effective than they're given credit for. Final Destination 2 sees a wimpy young woman(Alex Browning she ain't) foresee a hideous car pile up. She stops various people who were meant to die from getting onto the road, but death is not happy and soon starts claiming their lives in gruesome, gory Rube Goldberg machine style freak accidents. Gore hounds, you've met your match. This is weaker than it's highly underrated predecessor and is the 2nd worst in the franchise, although it's certainly not a bad film. The FD flicks were my first horror films and I used to be a big fan. I'm not as big a fan now, but they still hold up. FD 2 is not a scary film, but with a scare tool box of a log truck, a ladder, a window, a lift, a pipe, barbed wire, hospital equipment and a barbecue it is a surprisingly effective film. With it's dark atmosphere and suspenseful tone, you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.The thing which lets FD 2 down is the acting, which is awful. Ali Larter has improved a bit, Tony Todd is in full on creepy mode (In a good way) and 2 of the survivors, a stoner and a high school teacher, and reasonably well played. However, AJ Cook is a terrible lead, and most of the other acting performances are awful. Even though these people are seeing things which would traumatize a person for life, they look like they're watching Halloween cartoon for kids. The script is weak, with a lot of exposition and the characters in general aren't as likable as the survivors in the first film. The writing, acting and predictability of the plot weigh this down, but FD 2 is still a solid sequel. It's dark, creative and often genuinely tense. While it may lack a really good finale, there's still plenty of tension throughout. The car pile up is the best car crash scene in cinematic history as far as I'm concerned, and although this sequel makes no secret of the fact it's about the deaths rather than plot, it'll satisfy the gore thirsty fans and provide plenty of ghoulish thrills for many, myself included. They shouldn't have killed off Clear Rivers though.6/10",6,0,0,14 February 2015
Alien," In space no one can hear your scream- or yawn. But mostly scream.
","Review of the Director's CutIn Ridley Scott's beloved science fiction horror, an alien gets aboard a spacecraft and goes on the rampage. It's a very simple and stripped down plot without a lot of stupidity, and it's pretty much Jaws in space. Alien is first and foremost a scare fest, but beneath the simplicity you can tell Alien is saying some deeper things. In my opinion, this is about the fear of different species and paranoia, and this is made more powerful by the fact that the film is set in space, as it explores these themes in the claustrophobic corridors of a beautifully designed spaceship. Alien is a good, solid effort for all involved. I don't love it as much as many do, but it's definitely a good movie. The slow pace can test the patience a little, as often parts such as the discovery of the egg and the face hugger segment seem longer for no reason, but the slow pace also signifies maturity. The brilliant visuals disguise a somewhat weak and overly simplistic script, which lacks real personality although at the same time it makes the films characters feel more like real people.I wasn't a huge fan of the script, but it's got many fine qualities. I'll never understand why John Hurt was nominated for an Oscar when he barely has anything to do in this, but it's a well acted film. Ian Holm is wonderful as the android Ash, while Sigourney Weaver (Believe the hype) is superb as Ellen Ripley, and is one of the best female movie characters of all time. Ridley Scott has lost his way a bit recently, but his flawless direction which fills every frame to the brim with nerve shredding tension really would be spoiled by any modifications. The production design is mind blowing and the scares and very skillful, although the famous chest burster scene is blunted in impact by being such a poorly kept secret. Alien has its boring scenes, but don't let that put you off at all. I'm not the biggest horror fan out there, so I don't relate to it as much as some do. A tense intergalactic haunted house thrill ride with the best tagline in movie history.7/10",8,0,3,25 December 2014
Horrible Bosses," Unoriginal, but well played and often funny
","Horrible Bosses is a dark comedy involving 3 friends who conspire to murder their 3 dreadful bosses. HB doesn't look too out of the ordinary, but surprisingly it works although it's far from perfect. A piece of commentary of the recession, which thankfully doesn't shove this point down your throat and keeps it as a subtle background theme, HB uses dark humour to get its laughs and initially it's difficult to get behind the 3 protagonists, but at the same time they are likable characters and the film goes in a different direction than what you're expecting. As the 3 leads, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are entertaining and relatable, while Jamie Foxx makes his mark with a small but still memorable role as a criminal adviser. The 3 bosses are fairly 2 dimensional villains; Kevin Spacey is very good and his character is an entertainingly horrible boss, but Jennifer Anniston's character is too exaggerated while Colin Farrell's character is both too exaggerated and wasted. Suffering occasionally from the mean spirited, OTT jokes which often plague adult comedies, HB also occasionally takes plot turns which just don't make any sense.HB is still funny though, and with a neat running time it's a story you can get invested in without having to pay too much attention. Many of the jokes are funny and a scene involving an assassin who turns out not to be an assassin is very funny. A certain aspect of the ending is illogical, although the conclusion is still satisfying. It's well directed and the screenplay is mostly well written and manages to be funny instead of mean spirited. The Hangover this ain't, but HB is an effective and fitfully nourishing comedy which delivers on the laughs, doesn't run out of steam and manages to keep you guessing about what's going to happen next. It won't cater to all tastes and some will inevitably find offensive. Personally, I think it's pretty offensive at times, but only in a silly, jokey way. Overall, the film is fairly safe and standard in some ways, and doesn't do anything we haven't seen before but not every film needs to be an innovator. Overall, I enjoyed Horrible Bosses. Might try the sequel despite the poor reviews.7/10",7,4,6,18 April 2015
Suicide Squad," The DC Cinematic Universe has just committed cinematic suicide
","Suicide Squad was such an exciting idea. A round-up of villains having to be heroes in exchange for shorter prison sentences in the hands of a talented director and strong cast? It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and it looked set to be the film which would save the DCEU following Batman Vs Superman. It only sent it further into darkness. SS is a total mess in every single way. The editing is incomprehensible, the action scenes are complete chaos and despite having such a colorful cast of characters the film is visually an endless pit of dark, gloomy CGI shapes getting beaten up by the characters. They're supposed to be villains, but if they are, then this cinematic universe has some of the loveliest bad guys ever. The plot is messy, confusing, lacking in depth and soul and every single underdeveloped element, especially Jared Leto's tragically wasted Joker, comes clashing and screaming together like an unruly crowd of brawling rioters with the subtlety of a machine gun helicopter blowing up a city block. Lacking in depth, soul and nuances of any kind, only an awesome soundtrack, some good performances and occasional moments where the excellence of the trailers comes to life are there to offer much satisfaction. None of that saves the film. It's pretty scary that I can't decide if it's worse than Batman Vs Superman. 4/10",4,2,4,11 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Empire Strikes Back of Marvel
","I'm getting fed up of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While The Avengers is amazing, many of the other Marvel films are just factory products and Marvel is failing to do anything bold. For example, in this movie they supposedly kill Nick Fury but then back out of it. However, I still like most of the films and this is an exceptional knockout blow and thus far, the best blockbuster of 2014. Captain America is finding adjusting to the modern world hard, and after being framed becomes a fugitive and tries to bring down a Shield conspiracy. What sets this apart from other Marvel films is that it's not just an action movie: It's a living, breathing narrative with characters we care about, a sense of tension and material to appeal to those who aren't fan boys. True, the film is in some ways just another Marvel movie and doesn't take a lot of risks, but the reveal of Shield being infiltrated half way through is genuinely shocking and the film is a dazzling mix of political thriller and superhero movie.Chris Evans proves those who say Captain America is boring wrong, while Scarlett Johansson is strong as Black Widow. As usual, Samuel L Jackson is brilliant as Nick Fury and everyone else does a good job. The MCU has suffered from bad villains but this breaks that trend, with 2 awesome villains. The action sequences are totally astonishing and despite being full of huge explosions and massive crashes there is palm sweating tension maintained throughout. The screenplay is also great, and there is a sense of character development and emotion that aren't seen in most of the other Marvel films. While Iron Man 3, Thor The Dark World and Guardians Of The Galaxy were factory products to some extent, this actually does a few new things and best of all manages to be a great time even if its not your genre. Merging the comic book world with the real world and developing characters, pulling out the rug and blowing up everything is sight with great enthusiasm, Captain America The Winter Soldier is a brilliant, mind blowing and genuinely fascinating comic book slam dunk which hits with the force of Captain America's shield.9/10",9,0,1,22 October 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Danny Ocean and his team go out on a high
","After the disaster of Ocean's 12 there was only one way: up. Therefore, Ocean's 13 inevitably improves although it's not surprising Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones dropped out. The ridiculously likable crew are back, getting revenge on a businessman (Al Pacino) who conned their friend. It relocates the action back to Vegas, where it belongs, and this time they were polite enough to actually include a heist. Concluding the trilogy in better than expected fashion, O13 restores the trilogy to glamorous, slick, stylish glory and still shines brighter than the majority of the lights on the strip. It doesn't measure up the original. Don Cheadle is as jarring as ever and there are some irritating jokes and the heist sometimes feels lost in the comedy. It can be overly confusing and it's sometimes difficult to understand where the plot is going. These various flaws don't stop it from being a solid 4 star crime flick.The characters are still entertaining and likable. This time, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are actually likable and aren't just smug. Matt Damon is still bland though. It's well directed by Steven Soderbergh and has another fine musical score. There's also a sense of finality and it wraps up the trilogy very well. It's not as surreally enjoyable as the first one, but it's humorous, slick and offers plenty of the escapist fun that the first did. It doesn't suffer from the laws of diminishing returns and does the formula of the first one without adding to it but also without copying it and doing a turd on it. This isn't the strongest or bravest second sequel out there but it deserves a lot of respect for being entertaining and learning from the mistakes of the awful Ocean's 12. Nothing memorable or daring, but O13 provides plenty of stylish and sub zero cool heist based fun. At least there's a proper heist set piece.8/10",8,1,1,28 November 2014
Interstellar," Reach for the stars
","Interstellar's divided critical response is a fairly sad thing. It shows people just can't get over a blockbuster which is actually focused on something other than mindless spectacle. Easily my most anticipated film of the year, Christopher Nolan's first trip into space ignites the stars. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a lot better than my most anticipated film of 2013 (Kickass 2). The earth has become unstable due to lack of food, and Matthew McConaughey and a team of astronauts leave earth to travel through a wormhole to find a new home. Interstellar is too long, is hampered by a weak Anne Hathaway performance and has some silly moments, but it still manages to make loads of exposition interesting which is a rare feat. Of course, no-one needs me to tell them that the film looks amazing, has a fantastic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, great cinematography, fantastic direction and plenty of deep stuff involving time, love and a fair amount of philosophy.Interstellar is all of those things. What sets it apart is that there's not actually that much action and it's a deeply moving storyline with great acting. Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy are all excellent, and the film boasts one of the decade's coolest robots. With it's philosophy, big questions and commentary of humanity itself, Interstellar goes far into territory which most other modern filmmakers wouldn't even think of going to. This is a visually amazing blockbuster which has plenty of soul and doesn't even seem to focus that much on the blockbuster elements. Interstellar is unique, deep, powerful and asks many questions, which are terms which describe few other science fiction films today. Interstellar is a very good movie, which more or less lived up to my expectations. It's a slow movie, but if people (Even critics) are too ignorant to appreciate something different, we may be beyond hope. It's got its critics, but it's destined for classic status. And that's not just because I'm a Nolan fan, since I'm not a huge fan of The Dark Knight Rises or The Prestige.9/10",8,0,3,10 December 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Loses momentum in the second half but it still hits hard
","Proving there's pretty much nothing he can't do once again (except maybe for sweet kids movies), Stanley Kubrick returns to the war genre with this Vietnam drama, which is in 2 parts. The first half is at a training camp with a foul mouthed drill sergeant terrifying the new recruits and driving one to insanity. Then we get to the war front, and it's almost a relief. From then on the film is an intense, well directed assault on the senses as the film enters the battlefields. Amazingly, Kubrick created a vivid Vietnam set in rural England. Full Metal Jacket is another display of his incredible and singular talents as a director. The first half is soul shattering and utterly harrowing; it has the best improvisation ever from real life drill sergeant R Lee Ermey and the camera work is typically flawless. The bullying and eventual suicide of Private Pyle is harrowing to watch, and despite Kubrick's typical emotional distance the first half is perfection and will leave audiences shaken to the core.The second half feels more like an afterthought since the message has been exhausted and the far less interesting sergeant Joker is given the job of carrying the film which he doesn't do brilliantly. The scenes of warfare are powerful and intense, and show the horrors of war reasonably well but we do have Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan for that. The screenplay is well written throughout and it is another fine cinematic vision of war, but the film seems to lose heart after the boot camp section ends. This is the weakest out of the 5 Kubrick movies I've seen but it's still excellent. Although the second half is weaker, it's still well directed and emotionally intense, so it doesn't drag the movie down too much. However, there is a sense of wasted potential and it would have been better to stage the entire film at the boot camp. The boot camp is far scarier than any haunted house and carries some strong thematic resonance. Although it feels like 2 different films, both are anti war films and both convey their message adequately.8/10",8,0,1,6 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Style over substance and not in a good way
","Robots hit monsters. Am I meant to care? Guillermo del Toro's latest project involves humans controlling enormous robots and beating up Godzilla style monsters emerging from the ocean. It's very satisfying that this didn't actually do that well in America, because this is just total formula. We don't need movies like this. We've seen it all before. This action garbage has silver linings here and there. Visually, it's interesting and has plenty of awesome imagery. It's got a strong colour palette. Del Toro's direction is merely acceptable, but there is a sense of wonder in the movie, and the CGI genuinely looks great. In terms of style and visuals, the movie is quite strong and not everything can be deep and meaningful. Many will enjoy this, especially if they see it on a big screen. Pacific Rim frequently feels like a loving tribute to its genre and for some it will be a dream come true. At least it's a bit lighter and less serious than some other blockbusters these days. For some this could be a good antidote to Man Of Steel.I saw this on the small screen so maybe I'm biased. The thing which lets PR down is that it's not just robots hitting monsters. There is an hour between the first and second big robot battles and the film has the cheek to try and emotionally engage us with these pathetic, one dimensional characters. Seriously? The film may look great, but it's so cartoony and flat (While pretending it isn't flat by shoving loads of meaningless backstory down our throats) it's could have been some awful 2 hour cartoon on CBBC. The acting is pretty bad and even Idris Elba isn't that good. The movie just isn't original and since it's actually pretty boring much of the time (I don't care about what happened to the female protagonist when she was a kid!). Del Toro, who also made Pan's Labyrinth, another very overpraised film, is clearly popular because he's a bit different. Difference in modern films is a great things but there's only so long I can look at creatures, dark fantasy and loads of boring weirdness before I give up and watch Godzilla instead.4/10",4,5,6,30 November 2014
Glory," Glorious
","Glory came out of nowhere for me. I was looking for something good to watch on Netflix and I decided to try this as it was meant to be good. What followed was sheer perfection. Glory is a breath-taking, heroic, almost super human juggernaut of a historical epic which is an incredibly moving and brilliantly acted movie which somehow wasn't nominated for best picture in a year when the winner was a film about Morgan Freeman driving an old woman around. This is the story of the first all black army regiment in the American civil war. It's a true story which hasn't been focused on enough and it tells it superbly. Matthew Broderick ditches all traces of Ferris Bueller and delivers a surprisingly mature and strong performance as the leader of the regiment. Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington are both outstanding and Edward Zwick's direction is fantastic. Not only is the cinematography stunning but the battle sequences are incredibly intense and truly capture the hellishness of war.The script is skilfully handled; covering a lot of stuff without excess exposition and without sentimentality and manipulation. You grow to care about all of the characters and ultimately it is a very sad and emotional movie. The deaths of 2 of the main characters at the end is genuinely upsetting. Glory is also a very useful film for history and always feels accurate and honest. There aren't many flaws with Glory and it had me hooked for the entirety of its 2 hour run time. Glory is definitely one of the best historical drama movies of all time and shows that they are certainly not boring. With its fine direction, acting and writing Glory renders an important true story in sublime detail and turns it into a moving, masterful epic. It's not the most well known movie out there but it deserves far more attention than it gets. This is absolutely monumental filmmaking and is a testament both to the talents of Washington and Freeman and the power, relevance and importance of history.10/10",10,1,1,14 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Deeply flawed, but it's better than The Phantom Menace
","10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace, a new separatist movement threatens the republic while Anakin Skywalker, now a formidable Jedi Padawan, is stuck in a hideous romantic sub plot and must choose between his Jedi duties and forbidden love. The Phantom Menace isn't a bomb, but it's something of a dud thanks to the awful writing and acting. Attack of the Clones, while undoubtedly an improvement, suffers from many of these issues. The most compelling character in the movie is CGI Yoda. Seriously. Christopher Lee is good as a new villain, although he seems slightly on autopilot, Ian McDiarmid is genuinely solid as Chancellor Palpatine and Ewan McGregor improves on his bland work in The Phantom Menace. But Jar Jar Binks is still awful, even if the writers thoughtfully laid some of the blame for the republic's downfall on his shoulders, Natalie Portman is terrible, Samuel L Jackson phones it in, Boba Fett is played by a terrible child actor and worst of all, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, who will one day be Darth Vader, is more wooden and less complex than a rocking chair and only slightly more lively.The dialogue is abominable. The love story is flat, the lines are boring, expositional and emotionally void while there are far too many scenes featuring characters standing against green screen and talking about stuff. If I wanted to see loads of people talking I would watch a chat show. Still, people are a tiny bit unfair on AOTC. George Lucas has managed to recover some of his directing skill back and the cinematography is sometimes decent. The action set pieces are genuinely pretty good although they suffer from an overabundance of CGI and as a result the film often feels like a bland video game. It takes place in a wonderful cinematic universe and the story is interesting enough (Not the love story). It's darker than TPM, and as a result it's more involving. The highlight of the film is the death of Anakin's mother and his first steps towards becoming Darth Vader. This is an enjoyable but overlong space opera. The first 25 minutes are actually really rather good, and the final 40 minutes are as well but the film keeps stopping and starting in between. Personally, I don't mind it and it's the prequel I can watch the most easily.6/10",6,1,6,14 December 2015
Romeo + Juliet," It doesn't always work but it's a beautiful and interesting take on the play
","Romeo and Juliet set in a modern day urban environment with modern updates to all of the events but still with the original dialogue. OK then. Believe it or not, despite missteps, this adaptation mostly works and will finally interest teenagers in Shakespeare which certainly isn't a bad thing. It's better than Gnomeo and Juliet Thankfully! Baz Luhrmann makes the film visually stunning, and manages to fill it with gripping action scenes and touching romantic moments. A mixture of a music video, teen romance, gritty urban drama and Shakespeare, this will be a bit jarring to many (Myself included) but the ambition of the movie is to be admired. Claire Danes is OK but a bit annoying, while Leonardo DiCaprio owns the movie. The cinematography is stunning, and the film never stops being lovely to look at.It's not perfect though. Elements of the play such as the scene where Lord Capulet is angry with Juliet and Romeo and Mecrutio's friendship are poorly handled, and the endless visual dazzle, beautiful as it is, can send the film into style over substance territory. The presentation of Romeo and Juliet and other things in the play is beautifully updated for modern audiences and while the repeated action scenes can leave drama in the sidelines, the tragic ending still has a lot of emotional punch. It's not the best Shakespeare movie of all time, but I can't dislike an urban drama which still channels Shakespeare so effectively.7/10",7,0,0,24 September 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," This superhero movie isn't a marvel but it offers retro fun
","In this superhero movie, Steve Rogers after being deemed unfit for military service is part of an experiment which turns him into a super soldier. Think your average superhero movie set in World War II, which certainly makes it more interesting than some of the others but it fails to stand out among some of the other MCU movies. This competent but routine action movie delivers punch after punch of glorious retro action without ever delivering a knockout blow, and like with many comic book films: Once upon a time someone decided that every superhero film should have a cartoony villain and a forced love story and this film really suffers from that. Hugo Weaving's villain is bland, while the love story feels forced and one dimensional.The script goes the motions, but the cast do give strong performances overall, even Chris Evans who was a surprise after the ill judged Fantastic Four movies. This movie can feel like it was written with a superhero checklist open at times, but the action is thrilling, the ending is thought provoking and there is humanity amidst the explosions. Certainly overshadowed by its masterful sequel, but this is still a good movie which used 3D well for once and puts an interesting twist on the Marvel formula although it doesn't reinvent it.7/10",7,5,13,20 September 2011
American Hustle," A great acting showcase but that's all
","The Colour Purple of the 21st century, this glamorous, super stylish albeit hollow crime drama got 10 Oscar nominations and went away with nothing. It's not hard to see why. Christian Bale and Amy Adams, 2 criminals, end up helping the FBI catch other hustlers. What follows is an endlessly complicated plot with more twists than a rubix cube, until finally we reach the end. Some of this actually happened, as the opening title card says. AH is primarily an acting showcase. Christian Bale's best actor nomination was something of a mystery, but he does more than put on weight and don a wig, and he's very entertaining. Bradley Cooper is excellent, Amy Adams is electric and is especially impressive as she has the hardest role in the film. Jennifer Lawrence steals the show from everyone and she absolutely crackles with energy. David O Russell, takes a story which doesn't need a lot of stunning visuals and fills it with vibrant camera-work while the production team do a good job recreating the 70s. Not bad for a film with some awful haircuts.Everyone loved AH at first, but it has since faced a backlash. The hype machine strikes again. The plot doesn't go anywhere, and since it constantly spits out twist after twist you never know what's going on. It is also totally style over substance and it lacks depth and purpose. The dialogue does have plenty of energy, but it does little more than prolong the scenes. It's certainly a visually stunning movie and quite a fun one at times, but did we really need to endure endless twists, aimless banter and all of that in your face style over substance for over 2 hours? Seriously? I'm glad it didn't win best picture, because if it had it would have become the new Crash. It's not a bad movie, but if you're looking for something which is actually Oscar worthy check out any of the other 8 best picture nominees of 2013. It's bizarre how people whine and moan about style over substance yet they shower films like this, Pulp Fiction, Avatar and How To Train Your Dragon with praise even though they are completely style over substance. Still, even if it's not Oscar worthy, I still enjoyed it.7/10",7,0,1,13 October 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The godfather of movie sequels
","The Godfather is one of the best films ever, so what can we expect when a follow up is attempted? A contender for the best sequel ever of course. This has 2 parallel time lines: Flashbacks showing the young Vito Corleone rising to power and the continuation of the first film showing Michael Corleone handling both business matters and his personal life. It shouldn't have been as good as it is, but it knocks most sequels ever made into a bin liner. It's not quite as brilliant as some say it is. It's a bit too sprawling and tries to pack too much in. While the length in the first was excessive but just bearable, the second one has a bit too much. It can be a bit confusing and dips, but rarely. Otherwise, this sequel has it all: Amazing acting from everyone, even better direction from Francis Ford Coppola than the first and a powerful, moving screenplay. The final hour of the film is perfection and the last shot of Michael sitting alone in isolation, having lost everyone, has more emotional power than most films would squeeze into a ten minute monologue.Al Pacino gives one of the best movie performances of all time and it is a total outrage that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Everyone else is great. Although the script is a bit sprawling, it gets a lot done and is very powerful. Many of the scenes of assassinations are suspenseful and at times genuinely heart breaking. I didn't understand what was so great about Robert De Niro's performance, but you can certainly see Marlon Brando in his acting. Coppola's direction is less subtle this time and he shows even more of his directional brilliance. Some of the scenes, visually, and utterly phenomenal. It's darker, raises the stakes and expands the story like a sequel should. It's a moving, sobering story about power and how corrupting it is. In terms of sequels we could hardly have asked for a better follow up. Aside from the excessive length and the fact that it makes the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack & Jill even more painful, this is a sublime sequel and one which set the bench marks for all other sequels.9/10",9,0,1,14 November 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Cool, fine, whatever
","I'm not a fan of the Bourne films. I don't hate them but I was never hugely invested in Jason Bourne's quest to uncover his past. Identity was boring and aside from a gritty tone didn't bring anything new to the table although to be fair to it, it has its moments and we needed it after James Bond surfed a poorly rendered tsunami, drove an invisible car and descended into self parody with Die Another Day. Supremacy has a few problems but benefited from Paul Greengrass' shaky camera-work. This is probably the best of the trilogy. Jason Bourne finds out the truth at last. It's highly regarded, but it's certainly not a great film or deserving of a place on IMDb top 250. It has the dullest action hero of all time with Matt Damon, who is no more than a zombie with muscles and although the seriousness partially works, the film often seems to suffocate itself in its own grit and at times gets rather dry.There are some good bits, notably the final chase and an interesting set piece at Waterloo Station. The building jumping sequence was over-hyped as you can't really tell what is going on, but you have to admire Paul Greengrass as a filmmaker. The script is average, although there is a human side to it. This is a decent film with plenty of good moments but after a while the grittiness and constant downbeat conversations and conspiracy become boring and the trilogy ends on a somewhat abrupt note. Unfortunately, James Bond the year after this was released was almost impossible to tell apart from Jason Bourne. Despite its overload of grit, it is diverse with several different locations and types of scene covered and it is interesting to finally find out who Jason is. A satisfying conclusion overall and a watchable well made action thriller. A little actual sunshine wouldn't have hurt.7/10",7,0,0,20 October 2014
Rush," A true rush
","It's difficult to think of something more tedious than car races. If you could only appreciate this movie if you liked F1, than this would have a very small audience. Thankfully, that's not the case. This adrenaline fuelled drama is a high octane power house with great acting, writing and directing which manages to make a boring sport interesting. It tells the real life story of the rivalry between car racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both are different characters and neither are especially likable, but they're both well rounded and excellent played. Chris Hemsworth, a promising actor who really is choosing his films well, is very good as Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl is even better as Lauda, and his performance might be the best individual element of the film. Rush is another drama film, and there are many points which feel somewhat predictable and generic, so it has detours, but otherwise it's first gear straight to the Oscars.... who decided to completely ignore it. Typical.The only other Ron Howard film I've seen is half of Backdraft, so I was sceptical but his direction and editing are astonishing. The race sequences are exhilarating and make you feel like you're in the car with the drivers. Most of the dialogue feels genuine and it keeps you compelled throughout. It apparently employs some artistic license with the real events but not enough to make it feel like total nonsense (It's no Braveheart). Rush is a thrilling and moving drama which is a superior sports movie and if Gravity isn't a British movie than quite possibly the best British film of 2013. This is predictable at times which makes it a four star movie but it's a high four stars. Despite the predictability you can't always tell what's going to happen and by the end Rush is surprisingly moving. The character rivalry and development are what make the movie so compelling, not the race sequences. Hemsworth and Bruhl should have received Oscar nominations for their performances.8/10",8,1,1,8 December 2014
Notting Hill," Not Richard Curtis' best movie but quite sweet
","Hugh Grant, a man who has a fairly rubbish love life and owns one of the worst bookstores ever has a romance with a hugely famous film actress. Richard Curtis, ever the feel good rom com maestro, launches another sugar covered love story at us with this irresistible premise. Sure, it's ludicrous, but for many this will be just escapist as many of today's blockbusters. A perfectly cast Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, and an even more perfectly cast Julia Roberts plays the actress superstar. Together, they're a dynamite romantic couple, although the film around them lacks a bit. In stark contrast to the giddy laughs of Love Actually, the loopiness of About Time and smart, razor sharp wit of Curtis' crowning achievement Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill is a bit dead. It's not particularly funny with Curtis' jokes falling flatter than usual and the film drags itself out over 2 hours, which really wasn't necessary. It's more dull than other Working Title films and populated with many offensive British caricatures. Normally Curtis' eccentric, bumbling British middle class citizens are entertaining but here it's just a bit offensive and also not very funny.NH has its many dips, but is made more enjoyable by its leads. Hugh Grant is very likable as the main character and while he's pretty much playing the same character he did in Four Weddings, he does it very well. In fact, possibly even better. Julia Roberts is the complete star of the show and she's aggressively likable as the Hollywood superstar actress, but more importantly she brings a vulnerable, insecure side of her character out too. Despite the lack of effective humour, the film is undeniably charming and the film is very uplifting and is also an original rom com. Emotionally, it more or less delivers for all of its characters and thankfully this time Curtis actually includes a bit of conflict in the story, something which is mostly absent from his other movies. It's not a great film and can be fairly dull at times, although to be fair it's possible Richard Curtis was aiming for a different tone. A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.6/10",6,0,0,27 April 2015
The Village," A load of preposterous nonsense
","The Village is where it all started to go downhill from M Night Shyamalan. OK, so it was perhaps mismarkted as a flat out horror movie and it's not as bad as The Happening or The Last Airbender, but it's certainly not a good movie. An isolated 19th century village is being disturbed by the creatures in the surrounding forest. Part horror film, part love story, this is, in a nutshell, the Sunshine of horror films. Sunshine had a good first two thirds, before a misjudged twist sent it down the toilet. The difference here is that before the twist, the film wasn't good. Actors doing their best stoner impressions and speaking awkwardly bad dialogue isn't my definition of good. The story is sort of interesting, but it's too slow and creaks along at an overly leisurely pace. 2 dumb twists bombard audiences and undo what little tension there was before hand. This film suffered from misleading marketing, but it's Shyamalan's fault at well. He can do so much better than that lame script! People forget that none of Shyamalan's twists make sense. Bruce Willis would have realized something was up since no-one ever spoke to him, the way Samuel L Jackson found Bruce Willis didn't make any sense, and why would intelligent aliens who are susceptible to water go to a planet which is 75% water? However, the twist that the village is set in the present day is just ridiculous. How has no-one found the village? Surely a plane will have passed over at some point? The plot in general is nonsensical. I knew the twist already, but it was still a jarring tonal shift. The Village benefits from some interesting social commentary and Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography, as well as a couple of the subtle, clever thrills which are the reason I like Shyamalan's earlier films. Still, TV never takes off, and from its opening it's just annoying and poorly written. This one is just silly, and in terms of logic there's no saving it.4/10",4,1,3,20 December 2014
The Revenant," Bleak, beautiful and brutal visual poetry
","The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who is mauled by a bear and then left for dead by his hunting team. Following this, Glass goes on a harrowing journey through the wilderness to find and take revenge upon the man who left him to die. The Revenant is not so much a film as a simulator. As Leonardo DiCaprio lives in the wild, we live in the wild alongside him. We remain fully engaged in his story and thanks to the stunning direction, every scene in involving and we are there with the characters ever step of the way. Want to know what it's like to live in the Alaskan wilderness? Look no further. As for DiCaprio, he needs that Oscar now. He doesn't say much throughout the film, yet he remains an emotionally devastating, engaging and fully believable force of nature through the entire movie, and as a physical performance it's truly astonishing. The Revenant is not an easy watch. It's brutal, hard hitting and unbearably intense. To add to that it's also a pretty sad movie as well. You may not enjoy it, but most will be moved by it.It's not as good as Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu's last movie, since it's too long and at times is just a bit too much. It's not necessarily a film I'd be up for seeing again, but it's a monumental achievement. The lack of plot is effective and allows the film to focus on the hugely gut wrenching survival stuff while the themes of the movie are subtle, but they're definitely there. This is deep in some ways, but thankfully without shoving it down our throats. DiCaprio is backed by several other fine performances, but even with DiCaprio's amazing acting an argument could be made that Iñárritu is the star of the show alongside cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. With some of the most amazing cinematography of recent years, and some of the most consistently involving, mind numbingly intense direction of the year, The Revenant is a visual marvel. Overall, it's a really, really good film with many incredible moments. It's bleak, breath-taking, powerful, ferocious and harrowing. And that's just the bear attack scene.9/10",9,3,5,8 February 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," We didn't really need it but it doesn't terminate the legacy of the first two
","James Cameron's Terminator films were both masterful slices of science fiction, and one of the best robots in cinema history (Played blankly in the best possible way by Arnold Schwarzenegger) left his dent in popular culture. Terminator 2 had a great ending, so we didn't need a sequel. For 11 years they managed to resist the temptation, but eventually they gave in. James Cameron wisely decided not to return, and some random director (Jonathan Mostow) directs the next chapter, as a different terminator in Arnie's shape returns to protect John Connor and his future wife from another robotic assassin. T3 does a decent enough job and could have been worse. The Terminator films benefit from an interesting storyline about fate and the apocalypse, and a surprising amount of emotion for films starring robots has kept all 3 afloat. T3 has a more distant, but still palpable, emotional core. In terms of action, the film does not disappoint and delivers many a thrilling, explosive set pieces full of well executed explosion heaven.A problem which is the main reason why none of the films got a 10 from me is that the Terminator films are too reliant on chase scenes which can become repetitive. Until the strong final third, the film often feels like an extended chase sequence and peaks too early. There's still a decent plot, but the main characters are annoying and the antagonist is just a blank female version of the T-1000. The CGI doesn't look as ground-breaking as it did in 1992, so she's lame. Plenty of entertainment weighed down by a routine script carries on, until the interesting final act where Judgement Day happens and this twist makes sure the film leaves a better legacy than it might have done. T3 doesn't need to exist, but it could have been a lot worse. Not a spectacular sequel, but still entertaining and not as bad as some other third chapters. It's not another The Godfather Part III.6/10",6,0,0,8 March 2015
The Shining," You'll be terrified of tricycles, hotels, mazes and the number 237 after seeing this
","The Shining, based on the incredible Stephen King novel, is one of the most famous horror films ever made, and deservedly so. A family of 3 look after a hotel for the winter and while the son suffers horrifying supernatural visions, the father slowly descends into madness. Stanley Kubrick directs, and he is a very diverse director who made films of many different genres. His sole journey into horror is one of the best horror films of all time, and probably the one with the biggest influence on popular culture. Truth be told, it's not the masterpiece some say it is. While the book is an extremely powerful drama and character study wrapped up in a haunted house master-class, this is just a haunted house master-class. Danny Lloyd gives one of the great child actor performances and Jack Nicholson's legendary turn as Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances in horror history but Shelley Duvall gives the worst performance in a good movie ever and I'm pretty sure Jack going mad wasn't just to do with the hotel. It's also a bit too long, which is something which is a common complaint with Kubrick.Minor flaws aside, this is the closest a horror film has come to being art. With it's brilliant use of lighting, endless silence, beautifully composed frames, terrifying tracking shots and never-ending sense of isolation, this is one of the most haunting films ever made. The script has some interesting hidden meanings and the film is open to interpretation, which adds to the experience. The chase sequences, making great use of steadicam, are brilliant, and there is an endless sense of claustrophobia. What sets this apart from other horror films (I'm not a big fan of them to be honest) is that from the beginning it's beautiful, icy and chilling, and the direction is so dazzling it draws the audiences in almost instantaneously. Kubrick has the best use of wide shots in film history (Except for maybe Terrence Malick) and his direction and Jack Nicholson's acting make the movie, although the script still has some depth and with fully lit corridors, endless silence and a snow covered maze creates arguably the scariest haunted house (or hotel) in history. While not up there with Carrie, this is a graceful, haunting adaptation which the horror genre can be proud of and Stephen King should be proud of even though he isn't.9/10",9,2,4,4 April 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'I'll Be Back.' Good!
","The Terminator is a fine film, although it feels relatively small at times. However, Terminator 2 Judgement Day completely expands the story and James Cameron crafts one of the best sequels ever made. Many years after the first film Sarah Connor is in an asylum and her son has been put into care. A far more advanced cyborg comes back to kill John Connor, while an reprogrammed terminator from the first film comes back to save John and Sarah. With a much higher budget and bigger scope, this certainly does what a sequel is meant to do. James Cameron is a director I admire but not someone who's films I automatically go and see as his films can feel somewhat cold, but this doesn't waste a dollar of its $100 million budget. James Cameron's direction offers mind blowing visuals and exhilarating action spectacle throughout, as the endlessly entertaining action scenes and surprisingly deep script leave most other sequels in the gutter. The action sequences sometimes seem to devolve as they go along, and John Connor is an annoying child sidekick, but the film achieves most of its goals in stunning style.The film is amazingly made and the thrills are utterly spell binding, but there's curious depth to the film as well. The relationship between the terminator and John Connor is strangely touching and Sarah Connor is an excellent female action hero. The story is very interesting and has one of the most terrifying dream sequences I've ever seen in a film. Although the cold colouring of the film gives it a slightly artificial feel, there's enough humanity in there to make it nearly a great movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a very limited actor, but he's good at what he does and Linda Hamilton is excellent. It's also got a very good villain and the film crafts eye popping visuals all without CGI. T2 is better than the original since it's bigger, cooler and more thought provoking. It's not perfect, but in terms of superior thrills rendered with beautiful visual mastery backed up by a strong script, there are few better alternatives.9/10",9,2,4,15 December 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," A unique and powerful love story
","I don't normally watch romantic films as you know what's going to happen. Here, if you've watched the trailer or read a plot summary you haven't already seen the entire movie. It's just a drama about 2 troubled individuals and their resulting friendship, but it feels different, unique and moving. Silver Linings Playbook combines a lot of different elements: Mental illness, American Football, romance and comedy. It's a difficult mixture to get right and there are times when you're unsure whether you're meant to laugh or be moved. However, those moments are only sporadic and the elements blend together remarkably well. It's elevated by the acting: Bradley Cooper, after the disaster of The Hangover Part II, is extraordinary as Pat, although he's overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence's awe inspiring Oscar winning performance. Even more satisfying is Robert De Niro giving maybe his only truly noteworthy performance since Heat. Every actor in the film does a good job overall.With developed characters and strong dialogue the screenplay is finely written and goes to various extremes of its elements but manages to wrap up in a moving and believable conclusion. David O Russell makes a typical formula look far better visually than it would normally, and a best director Oscar may be on the cards in future for him. Inevitably it's quite a tough film at times and isn't the most original film out there but it's better than the overrated American Hustle. SLP is a very entertaining movie throughout its runtime and the acting and humanity of the script draws you in very quickly. It looks like it may be a fairly boring movie, but it's far more interesting than expected. Jennifer Lawrence is the star of the show, but Robert De Niro's return to form is great to watch. Sadly, he went and did Killing Season, Last Vegas and Grudge Match, but we'll always have Taxi Driver. Well deserving of its best picture nomination, this is a superior drama movie and it's not your average love story. That's a good thing though. Take this over The Proposal.9/10",8,1,4,11 December 2014
Dunkirk," One of the best war films of all time
","Dunkirk tells the story of the evacuation of thousands of British soldiers from France following a military disaster. I wasn't looking forward to this particularly. After years of Christopher Nolan being idolized and trivialized by some of the most obnoxious fans on the internet- if you do a negative review of one of his films prepare for cyber-bullying- I have become fed up of hearing about his movies. As well as this, the Dunkirk evacuation didn't seem like a great war story to tell out of all the WWII stories that could have been told. Well, the doubts were wrong. Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece and better than nearly every single major release from 2016. Despite criticism at the lack of character development, for me it worked perfectly. No sentimentality. No weepy moments. No extended dialogue scenes. Here, the events tell the story and the emotional trauma of everything going on, brought to terrifying life by Christopher Nolan at the peak of his powers, are more than enough. Sure, the characters are thin, but they're brought to life by great performances- even Harry Styles is excellent. In terms of virtually every aspect of the film, it's technically masterful, while the non-linear story-telling and focus on people, not explosions, make this a harrowing and emotional experience, as well as a painfully tense one. As a celebration of courage in the face of hopeless circumstances, as a tale of unity, as a suspense thriller, as a historical reconstruction and as a cinematic work in general, Dunkirk is a real triumph. 9/10",9,2,8,23 August 2017
The Lego Movie," Everything is awesome!
","Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie. Everything. Genuinely everything. Every single little thing is awesome. The ultimate product placement movie instead becomes the ultimate 2014 blockbuster, as a likable but unremarkable construction Lego mini figure tries to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. The only 2014 movie I have seen more than once at the time of writing, TLM held up remarkably well. Some may find it annoying possibly, but for most you'll have to remove that grin from your face with a crowbar. It looks great and could have been stop motion Lego. The CGI is barely noticeable. It's also got an astonishingly good cast all giving fine performances. Even Morgan Freeman is in there. The action, humour and emotion is all spot on. The film is full of white knuckle action, gut bursting jokes and surprisingly thoughtful story lines which make it overall a very entertaining and rich animated offering for everyone. You don't even have to like Lego.The key to movie success is the script. The script is brilliantly written here and absolutely crackles with wit and charm. It's also got some very thrilling moments and pop culture references galore. It's surely one of the funniest movies of the year and although the jokes are simple they're always devastatingly effective. The characters are very diverse and likable as well, and enhance the film's likability factor which is already off the scale. As it has some very nice messages in there too, it's a surprisingly touching film and the ending is unpredictable and moving. Another key element of the film's success is creating a compelling fictional universe for the film which is full of entertaining details. As for the Everything Is Awesome song, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. TLM is a great blockbuster overall which should have been terrible but is instead a total knockout. Outshining everything DreamWorks has ever done by a mile this might be the most fun you have at the movies in 2014.10/10",10,2,7,21 November 2014
Aliens," One of the most exciting films ever
","Aliens is an absolute blast in every way. The franchise goes from horror to action, as Ripley joins a team on a mission to find out what happened to the colony on the moon where she found the alien egg. Alien was a good movie, but I consider Aliens to be superior. Aliens has absolutely everything: it's got great acting from everyone including the child actor. It has a very entertaining script with fascinating war themes and excellent character development for all of its characters. It's brilliantly directed and is one of the tensest and most terrifying films of all time. The action is staggering, but there is some drama here as well. Ripley may have been awesome in the first film, but here she cements herself as pretty much the best female movie character of all time. It's difficult to choose the best moment of the film as every moment moves the film forward and every scene, even the dialogue ones, makes you feel like you're on a high-speed roller coaster flying off the rails. It gets exhausting occasionally, but only because the sheer intensity of the film is an utter knockout. James Cameron's greatest film and something of a masterpiece. 9/10",9,1,1,21 December 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," Great acting. The rest of the film's not bad either.
","Mathew McConaughey has made an unexpected comeback after years of being something of forgettable roles, which has culminated in his Oscar win for this movie. Dallas Buyers Club, a story about a hustler trying to get medicine to AIDS patients after being diagnosed with the disease, is the kind of movie which would sink without good acting. This needs a good lead performance to carry the movie, and good supporting roles as well. Thankfully, DBC has both in spades. McConaughey pulls off a difficult role with great skill and conveys the character change and personality of Ron Woodroof brilliantly. Arguably even more impressive is Jared Leto as a trans woman with HIV, who steals the show. Leto's performance is without a doubt one of the best performances of 2013 and they both deserved their Oscars. DBC is an actors' movie, but don't let that make you forget it's also a very good film. Despite it's grim subject matter, unlike certain other films nominated for best picture this carries a sense of hope, and makes the film more powerful as a result.The direction is very good, as is the script which mixes bleakness with hope and adds some humorous moments as well. DBC is in many ways a character study and it is an excellent one. There are many emotional moments but they all feel genuine and honest. DBC is a powerful and emotional film which may in many ways just be another drama, but it's moving and without a doubt worth watching for the acting alone. It's certainly not without its flaws. The humour occasionally feels out of place, certain characters feel like two dimensional antagonists and it has a somewhat clichéd framework. Dallas Buyers Club is not a ground breaking or massively striking drama; it is another drama film, but a very good one. I've seen 7 of the 9 2013 best picture nominees and this is the 6th best, although it's certainly above the over praised American Hustle. People won't really remember it too much in a few years and it isn't a film I would be interested in reviewing but it is a very good character study and I've very pleased to have seen it. Best of all, although it's got many depressing moments it is also quite uplifting.8/10",8,1,1,28 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Thankfully, not a let-down
","Captain America Civil War is the Marvel movie I've been looking forward to for a while. I've lost interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after several forgettable films post the first Avengers movie, but this partially restores my faith. It's not a masterpiece like everyone's saying it is. I think people are just so relieved it didn't turn out like Batman Vs. Superman they're giving it ludicrously high ratings. It takes a little while to get going and the political themes are handled with the simplicity of a primary school politics lesson, but the emotional stuff is handled very well. The collapse in the Avengers alliance is believable and sad, the humour is still there, the action scenes are awesome and the Russo Brothers once again prove themselves fine directors. The performances are all-around excellent, with Robert Downey Jr. giving possibly his best MCU performance to date. I have a bad feeling that once the dust settles people will look upon this less favourably, but this is a very good blockbuster, and tells the story of a small-scale superhero conflict (In the comics the civil war seems to have been far bigger) with intelligence, humour and glorious pyrotechnics.8/10",8,5,10,8 May 2016
Saw III," The fun ends here
","Saw and Saw II are both good horror films because they were focused on twists and thought-provoking themes related to justice and morals. Unfortunately, this has one thing and one thing only on its mind: to spill as much blood as possible. The film bounces between needless, expositional flashbacks and gore-soaked, uncomfortably nasty torture set-pieces throughout a runtime of 2 hours, which is far too long. In this one, a doctor being held hostage is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while he and his apprentice, Amanda, put an unfortunate man through an incredibly brutal test. Saw III, in fairness, is powerful at times and features surprisingly good performances from those involved. However, it's just too disgusting to satisfy. There's an entire sequence giving close-up detail of Jigsaw having head surgery. Why did we need to see that extremely gruesome sequence? Why? It's just the filmmakers exposing themselves as the immature bloodhounds that they are. This one isn't even particularly scary and is more disturbing than anything else. What's worse, once you get to the end and endure a relentless bummer of an ending which kills off the franchise's 2 best characters and makes all the gruesome bloodshed you've just endured futile, you realize there wasn't even a point.4/10",4,0,0,15 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," Titanic+Saving Private Ryan should be good right? Wrong!
","The Titanic of war movies, Pearl Harbour sets a clichéd, cardboard cut out love story against the backdrop of a tragic historical event and despite blatantly borrowing from great films such as Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, it is a total misfire that fails to respect its audience or its subject matter. In fleeting moments the film shows potential: An inexplicably committed Hans Zimmer creates a very good soundtrack, while the visuals are stunning. From time to time, Michael Bay who if there was any justice in the world would be a pyrotechnics expert rather than a director, shows flashes of vision in his directing, particularly in the indulgent 40 minute attack sequence. Aside from that Pearl Harbour is just depressing. The film is like a dementor sucking your soul out as this outrageously awful blockbuster flop creaks through every badly written, groan inducing scene with glacial pacing. It takes the movie 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to the attack, which is rendered disrespectfully as a blockbuster showdown and lasts for 40 minutes, before we get the most pointless final hour of all time involving a revenge attack.All 3 of the leads are awful, while the dialogue is so cringe inducingly bad it can be funny but otherwise listening to the dialogue is a genuinely embarrassing experience which will leave you shaken for days. Michael Bay's direction is as robotic as ever and the film is, in general, a soulless, bloated bomb that deserves to sink without a trace. The final hour could have been erased easily, and with a talented director and a screenwriter who could actually write maybe this might have worked. The music is easily the best thing in the movie, and others may argue the attack sequence is spectacular but I disagree. It's loud, bloated, ugly and acts as it's some big entertaining blockbuster showdown instead of a very tragic day in American history. There are few silver linings or genuine defences for this film. Pearl Harbour is an insult to history, to war movies, to romantic movies, to sunsets, to action set pieces, to its critics, its audience and our intelligence and everyone involved should be ashamed. Especially the writer.3/10",2,1,2,28 February 2014
Inside Out," A return to form for Pixar
","After the overrated and underwhelming Toy Story 3, genuinely bad Cars 2, mediocre Brave and good but forgettable Monsters University, Pixar have bounced back with this emotional tale about the feelings inside a young girl's head trying to navigate the girl moving to a new house and school. Another excellent premise from Pixar, it is used well and the result is moving and heartfelt. While not a flawless film, Inside Out is a very good animated film and one of the more sophisticated ones from recent times. As always the visuals are gorgeous and the film is rendered wonderfully while the direction is also top form. As can be expected from Pixar the script has emotion, big laughs and thrills which it wrings out of its fascinating premise to maximum effect. There are many funny bits, especially involving the Anger character and there's a considerable amount of suspense involved to. The world inside the girl's head is brilliantly thought out and successfully brought to life.IO is not a complete success and while certainly a return to form, has been overpraised slightly. For such a complex premise, the film is too short and as the little girl, Riley, sinks into a depression the film moves too quickly towards her deciding to run away. This rushed approach reduces the emotional impact of the movie although during the third act the film hits the emotional beats and it hits them well. This is definitely going to make people cry. The climax of the film doesn't involve action which is interesting and the voice acting is excellent, but earlier Pixar films were kids movies for grown ups and grown up movies for kids. This is a kids movie for grown ups. It's too downbeat and serious for young kids to relate to properly so this is a very good film, but it's not a very good family film. Although rushed and overly downbeat much of the time, IO is ultimately an emotional success and proves that Pixar have plenty of life left in them yet.8/10",8,3,24,24 August 2015
No Country for Old Men," A triumph for all involved
","The best picture Oscar doesn't actually mean as much as it should. The films which win that award are usually pretentious, overlong, aren't actually the year's finest film and lack true punch. No Country For Old Men, which won the award in 2007, proves that academy voters aren't a load of pretentious film snobs and it's a pretty brave choice for the award. It's also the right choice. This exploration of evil, law, Religion, fate and morals wrapped up in a nail biting cat and mouse thriller is a masterpiece and one of the decade's best movies. Some will dislike it due to its blunt refusal to stick to conventions. It has something on an anti-climax. The Josh Brolin protagonist never actually meets Javier Bardem's hit man and dies off screen. Bardem gets away and the film ends with Tommy Lee Jones talking about a dream. Joel and Ethan Coen were defying convention in a very audacious manner so this doesn't undo all the brilliance that came beforehand. NCFOM will be a frustrating experience for some, but most will probably like it. It may require a couple of viewings to understand.Apparently the screenplay is very faithful to the novel and much of it was copied, but it's still a fine screenplay. Many of its themes aren't obvious without close analysis but the emotional impact and haunting nature of the film is undeniable. The direction is something else, and this might be one of the tensest and most visually stunning thrillers ever made. The Coen brothers successfully create some of the best motel scenes since Psycho and make a bowl cut absolutely terrifying. The acting is great all around, but Javier Bardem is terrifying and hypnotic as the villain. The film has a sense of humanity and depth, it looks amazing and it's thrilling and gripping from start to finish. It's an incredible movie and essential viewing for Cormac McCarthy fans. It may lack a hugely satisfying conclusion, but sticking to conventions all the time can be incredibly boring. Definitely one to watch. Just don't expect to look at a motel, a bowl cut, a coin flip or a captive bolt pistol the same way again.10/10",10,1,2,26 November 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Not the clichéd weepie you're expecting
","The Fault In Our Stars wants to make you cry. And it succeeds with a vengeance. It'll boost Kleenex sales for sure. near guaranteed to have everyone in the theatre sobbing, TFIOS is a devastating tear jerker of a movie. Grown men, you'll cry as well. A love story between 2 cancer patients played by Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, this is based on a popular book which I haven't read but would now like to. I usually avoid this kind of thing since many romantic films (Endless Love I'm looking at you) are nothing more than 2 dimensional formula sheets which aren't even remotely touching, but TFIOS is a relatively rare exception. It's not a perfect movie and is admittedly supported by a somewhat clichéd framework. Ansel Elgort's character is a bit unrealistic and very occasionally they seem to be sugarcoating the story. Also, the first kiss happening in the Anne Frank museum seemed questionable. The film believes it's subverting romantic clichés even though in many ways it isn't and this is slightly off putting.Mostly, however, this is not your typical weepie. The film is surprisingly humorous and although the key emotional moments hit hard, there is a sense of hope and lightness to the story as well. The screenplay has clearly been written with skill, and the lovers at the centre of the story, both played excellently, have very strong chemistry throughout. The visuals and direction further enhance the film and although it does go into a truly heart-breaking third act, the journey there is one of hope and celebration, managing to find a balance of happier and sadder elements. This is likely the best love story of 2014, and its target audience will love it. It's not as smart as it thinks it is, but the effectiveness of its emotions and screenplay are unexpected and borderline gut wrenching. Deservedly a very successful film, this is a love story which can appeal to those who aren't a fan of this kind of thing. Just bring the tissues.8/10",8,1,2,17 January 2015
Non-Stop," A watchable two star action flick with one of the stupidest plots in recent memory
","Liam Neeson, playing a haunted Air Marshall, starts receiving texts saying someone will be killed every 20 minutes until he transfers several hundred million dollars to an off shore account. In a very bad-ass manner, he tries to uncover the murderer and save the plane. Count me in! Liam Neeson is a great actor and manages to make being understated cool, while the premise, although preposterous, is claustrophobic and thrilling. As well as loving action films I also love mysteries so this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. And one of the most disappointing. If you saw this, do you actually remember any of it? Like, anything at all? I barely remember it and I only saw it a few months ago. A little worrying. Although this is a 2 star movie, it's not something I totally hated watching and I moderately enjoyed in some ways. Liam Neeson owns the film and brings grit and a tiny bit of emotion to a silly story. Lupita Nyong'o and Julianne Moore are both underused, but still good. It does have plenty of exciting moments, the direction is competent and it's an action film emphasizing tension over mindless thrills for once.So, it's a watchable movie and moderately exciting. But no enough. The film is style over substance but there's nothing wrong with that. But it can't decide on murder mystery or action thriller. It veers between the 2 in a very irritating manner. Although there are thrills, a lot of the time they don't go far enough and as the film goes on and it switches to brutal beat em up mode, it loses the sense of tension and claustrophobia it had at first. The primary thing that lets it down is the screenplay. This has a plot so stupid it's makes Snakes On A Plane look like a documentary. OK, so blockbusters are about suspension of disbelief but this takes action movie ridiculousness to a whole new level. But not in a good way like Fast & Furious. The plot doesn't make any kind of sense, and the plan of the main villain would have been impossible to pull off. This is total and utter rubbish in terms of storytelling and it is possible to pull off a plane set action film, but this would have worked better on a train. A ludicrous, although not totally unforgivable disappointment. Silly.4/10",4,2,4,22 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A watchable sequel that never truly takes off
","I had no desire to go and see this, but since Hercules was no longer showing this is what I went to see. This time, 5 years after the first which is the most disgustingly overrated animated movie of all time, Hiccup and company team up to fight a laughably unscary villain and discover more of the HTTYD universe. This is like many sequels: Darker (blame The Empire Strikes Back), more complex and bigger. The first was pretty underwhelming so how would this turn out? The answer is OK. What impressed me about How To Train Your Dragon 2 was how it managed to do what a sequel should in a relatively short run time. It's darker, it ups the stakes, it's bolder, it's bigger, it goes in a new direction and the characters have changed as well. It takes the first and turns it up to 11. The animation is stunning, showing it's not just Pixar who do great visuals while some of the plot is memorable. The death of the Viking chief in the middle is unexpected and powerful, while some of set pieces offer some thrills.So what didn't I like? Pretty much everything I didn't enjoy in the first one. The fictional universe is decent and beautifully rendered, but what sets it back are the characters. Hiccup has been seen many times before and has zero chemistry with his bland and irritating love interest. Aside from Hiccup's mother, all the others are either flat our plain irritating. The script is often flat and unengaging, the film is stupendously unfunny and it has generic written all over it. It's just another DreamWorks mediocrity vehicle with little to distinguish it from the other 500 kids movies out there. This may be because I'm so uninterested in the whole HTTYD world, but for me this was a strictly average sequel which never really soared and without a doubt one of the more lacklustre experiences I've had in the cinema in 2014. Like the first, it's also too montage based and feels rushed and brief. It's not a terrible film and as critics seem to enjoy animated cliché fests (How To Train Your Dragon, Megamind and Bolt I'm looking at you) and children will probably be entertained most will likely find this passable. But for me, it only took off in the second half. Too little, too late.6/10",6,4,15,21 August 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delirious fun
","This is my second Wes Anderson film, and yet another triumph for him. Ralph Fiennes in a rare comedic turn is a hotel concierge accused of murder. He tries to clear his name with the help of the new lobby boy. It's Wes Anderson so obviously it's not that simple. Mixing violence, sex, swearing, comedy, visual dazzle, drama, developed characters, a murder mystery and loads of weird and wonderful set pieces into a whole, The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been terrible. But it works very well. The visuals are incredible: With the inventive colour palette and fascinating angles TGBH creates a world of its own. Although emphasis on such a visually amazing world inevitably makes it feel empty at times and there are a couple of dips, this is a very good piece of indie cinema and it should be nominated for best picture at the Oscars this year. As both writer and director, Wes Anderson does a good job; his direction is visually stunning, humorous, gleefully stylized and at times suspenseful while his script mixes all those elements with surprising ease.The film, which was advertised with the best trailer of the year, is very well acted. Ralph Fiennes is delightful in his unusual comic performance and all the others are good as well even if many are blink and you'll miss it cameos. There's a delightful sense of nuttiness and quirk to TGBH and it's something you just don't really see elsewhere. It creates a compelling in film universe with mise-en-scene and visuals alone, and then populates it with lively characters and a rich screenplay. It's both funny, exciting and moving, and it's an nice break from the mainstream clichés which you'll often see in other comedies. This has motivated me to try some more Wes Anderson stuff. It's a really entertaining film if slightly empty and it's one of the craziest in the best possible way films you'll see this year. Expect loads of awards attention and some Oscar nods at the end of the year. It certainly deserves them.9/10",9,1,3,15 November 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A horrifically funny horror comedy
","It's not all about The Cabin In The Woods. 2 years previously, this under-appreciated horror comedy with what might be an even smarter premise came out and it deserves just as much attention. Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil centres on 2 red necks who a group of teens assume are murderers. When they rescue one of them, the teenagers think they're villains and then when the teens start trying to attack them they keep having accidents and a series of horribly unfortunate misunderstandings occur. This time, the victims are the villains. It's such a clever idea it's surprising no-one attempted it before. It feels a little slight, so this reduces its impact since in terms of scale it's a pretty small movie. Also, it's ludicrous and can repeat itself a bit too much, but don't let that put you off. On Netflix UK's awful horror film selection, there thankfully is a genuinely good horror film aside from Carrie and one or 2 other things. TADVE is great fun for horror fans, and certainly a lot more fun than watching many horror films.The film offers plenty of goofy, gory thrills and can be suspenseful, although always in a light hearted way. Despite the endlessly relaxed tone there are plenty of moderately scary moments. It's also incredibly funny, and the laughs don't really stop flowing even if certain jokes are reused more than they should be. It's original and highly clever, and while it's a film that relies on coincidences, it's so much fun you just don't care. This is a pretty gory movie, but it's not mean spirited at all. The most unexpected surprise is that the film has some nice messages about self esteem, and there's a genuinely touching romance in the centre of the film. I certainly wasn't expecting that at all, and that's why it comes so highly recommended. It may have buckets of blood, but it never feels mean spirited. It's a very fun horror comedy which deserves more attention than it gets. Seriously, give this one a look.8/10",8,2,3,18 December 2014
City of God," One of the very few must-see movies from the 21st century
","There are awesome movies and then there's City of God. Whenever you think this brutal and devastating drama about crime in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro and 2 boys and the paths they take is dropping the pace, becoming unrealistic and going into cliché, it delivers another one of its many brilliantly directed, heart- stoppingly tense set pieces. Or another one of its quiet, beautifully written and acted character scenes. Or another one of its raw, blisteringly intense emotional beats each of which knock you out with the force of an onslaught of ballistic missiles. The actors here put many far more well-known actors to shame with their convincing, brilliant performances, while the visuals are endlessly inventive and compelling. This is a drama which doesn't hold back on any level and is filled to the brim with thought-provoking moments and compelling characters. It's a tough watch, but it's not completely depressing. It has many moments of warmth and humour, and thanks to all that tension even works as an enjoyable action movie. A fantastic film which demands to be seen. There's a good reason why this is so high on IMDb Top 250, and I hugely recommend seeing this instant classic.10/10",10,2,4,27 May 2016
Gone Girl," A respectable adaptation of a superior property
","Gone Girl was an excellent thriller novel; brilliantly written and complex, it built on the suspense before undoing itself with an awful ending. Bold, but too anticlimactic. So it's pretty cheeky to promise the film with have a new ending but then not change anything. Still, Gone Girl is a solid 4 star mystery thriller. Nick Dunne tries to solve the disappearance of his wife, who he had a troubled relationship with, but everyone thinks he did it. David Fincher directs so you know you're in for something interesting. That prediction was correct. Fincher is a stylistic and meticulous director who never fails to deliver on stunning cinematography even in the most mundane scenes. He delivers once again. He and the cast are probably what led to the film being so successful. Ben Affleck is still a little muted, but this is a surprisingly good performance from him. Carrie Coon is excellent as his sister, while even Tyler Perry is surprisingly good. The show is stolen by Rosamund Pike, whose brilliant and chilling villainous performance creates one of the best movie characters of 2014. Simultaneously terrifying and sympathetic, she completely owns the film.GG is a thematically complex and relevant study of marriage and relationships, and, crafted with typical Fincher pessimism and haunting style, it is one of the ultimate 'Do not watch on a date' movies. There is a shocking scene of violence which was probably alone responsible for the 18 certificate in the UK which is handled very well, while despite the lack of action otherwise suspense is ably maintained throughout. Pulling off the novel's structure on film was always going to be hard, but the film tells the story coherently, although the mid film twist is deployed a little too early. GG is undeserving of its place in the IMDb Top 250 ultimately though. It's too long, it's detached at times and it all feels a bit far fetched. It doesn't always connect with its audience due to its commitment to relentlessly dour visuals and dialogue, while as mentioned earlier that ending is a big anti-climax. I'm satisfied with the movie overall and this is a strong thriller in general that is worth your time.8/10",7,0,2,10 December 2015
Django Unchained," Fatally overlong but completely explosive
","Quentin Tarantino, like Orson Welles, is a director people need to stop going on about as if he deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Steven Spielberg or Alfred Hitchcock. While a brilliant writer and talented visual stylist, his films (that I've seen) are indulgent and style over substance. While Reservoir Dogs was fantastic, Pulp Fiction went on and on, and this goes on even longer. This has been critically acclaimed even though it's style over substance, which is what critics moan about in a very tiresome manner. Django Unchained follows a German bounty hunter and a freed slave hunting for the slave's captured wife to free her and taking out various other villains along the way. Explosive, daring and typically subversive, DU bleeds ultra kinetic, hyper violent style from the very beginning and even through the many slow talking scenes there's always plenty of energy crackling beneath the surface. The cast does a great job overall. Samuel L Jackson, although not particularly recognisable, steals the show, with Leonardo DiCaprio giving a wonderful hateful performance and Christoph Waltz providing plenty of charisma and emotion in another fine performance, although perhaps not quite Oscar deserving, but still excellent. Jamie Foxx isn't particularly interesting or memorable as his character is less well developed but he works well with what he's given.The script is typically strong. There aren't any movies to reference as it's set in the 1800s, so the script isn't quite as much fun but it has a lot of swagger. Visually, it's a good film and Tarantino is still a fine visual stylist. The problem is DU's overlength. It's just too darn long! 2 hours and 40 minutes. That's how much Tarantino is in love with his dialogue, so much of it is filled with endless talking. Um Tarantino this isn't a talk show. This is a movie where you tell a story. Unfortunately, the story isn't told quickly enough and I eventually started to lose interest. The final fight scenes are extraordinary and stylish, but at the 2 hour mark Waltz randomly shoots DiCaprio and the film becomes an excuse to kill everyone. While this bit is still good, it does somewhat lose the ability to have its slavery themes taken seriously. DU is an indulgent, sometimes empty movie with plenty of positives and many good bits, but often the film dips between them. The second half of the movie just loses momentum, and when the over the top violence comes along it's almost a relief as something else is finally happening. Don't get me wrong though, it's a good film. Still, it needs a trim.6/10",6,0,1,21 April 2015
Drive," Exceptional and exhilarating art house action
","Drive was the best film of 2011. Not The Artist. Not The Tree of Life. This. However, many are going to frustrated with Drive as for some reason it was marketed as an action film filled with car chases. Drive is a slow, insightful art house film with brief but exhilarating bursts of heart pounding ultra violence and a lot of emotion conveyed with images instead of dialogue. Drive is far better than a car chase fest, and why it wasn't marketed as the great film it actually was is a mystery. Ryan Gosling's nameless getaway driver gets into trouble when he helps out his neighbour, who he is in love with. Drive could be seen as pretentious or self indulgent, as it refuses to stick to conventions and many shots are just characters looking into the distance. There isn't an awful lot of dialogue; the main character's lines are Harold Pinter level simplicity. Music and visuals speak louder than words in this film, but the dialogue is still very meaningful and there is plenty of emotional content here. Ultimately, the character relationships are moving, although in an understated though still powerful way.Ryan Gosling, as the main character, has a very difficult job since he doesn't say a lot, but he creates an interesting and memorable character with a minimalistic but powerful performance which allows one to sense the many complexities of his character and his emotions. Everyone does a good job acting wise. This is perhaps a style over substance film, but there is substance in the style. The style itself is extraordinary. Smooth, sleek and dazzling cinematography propel Drive, while the clever use of music adds emotion and drama to an already astonishing film. The action and violence is thrilling but because it is minimal it never loses the key element of suspense. It's such a compelling and intelligent movie it doesn't need a lot of action. The elevator scene will probably go down in history. Drive is a stylish, ultra cool work of art with plenty of depth beneath the surface. It won't speak to everyone, but it's a very fine work and one of the best movies of the 2010s so far. Only God Forgives is thoroughly inferior and shows the style completely dominating the substance. Drive shows Nicholas Winding Refn's fascinating style finding true balance, power and soul.10/10",10,1,2,23 February 2015
The Theory of Everything," Don't be fooled by the hype
","How does the mind of an Oscar voter work? What do they think makes a good movie? That is a question even Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest men on the planet, couldn't answer. Every year the Academy states manipulative and boring message movies, conventional true stories and occasionally something that actually deserves to be nominated before us and claim they are the best films of the year. The Oscars are a joke. The latest evidence for that is The Theory of Everything. It's an awards bait movie so they lapped up its true story about a man who overcomes difficult circumstances. They can never resist that. Still, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones deserved the award nominations. Jones is the emotional backbone of the movie and has to carry a lot of it, while Redmayne's performance is not only emotionally involving, it's an incredible physical performance too. Still, the true story of Stephen Hawking and his wife leaves out 2 key things: Firstly Stephen Hawking is a scientist and this has barely any science. Secondly, they sugar-coat the romance which really wasn't the fairy tale it's depicted as.TTOE is well directed up to a point and has various emotional moments. You can't help but get caught up in it occasionally and it does move you, although how a film about a man with Motor Neurone Disease is rarely ever harrowing is a baffling mystery. It's well done technically, so what's letting it down is the writing. There's no narrative arc and there's no true inspirational message. Mainly what it's about are various clips from Hawking's life punctuated by montages. Basically, the cinematic equivalent of a family photo album. I thought this was about a scientist? It's too soft and it's too long. When a movie is nominated for so many awards I expect something that deserves them. I don't expect to have my head dunked in syrup but that's what I get. Still, I've seen Crash and various other weak Oscar films so maybe I should have known. A very average movie only lifted into the 6/10 category by its 2 leads. It's got its impressive moments but if it had won Best Picture it would have been the new Crash.6/10",6,2,2,2 December 2015
Frozen," People need to Let It Go, but it's a strong animated movie
","I'm not massively well acquainted with Disney animation. I don't dislike the films at all, but I've seen fewer animations recently so I haven't seen so many. Frozen has taken the world by storm and become the highest grossing animated film ever, so eventually I had to see what the fuss was about. A princess goes to find her sister after her sister's icy powers trapped the kingdom in an eternal winter, encountering some other interesting characters along the way. Frozen didn't quite live up to the hype. It has a couple of dips and is just another Disney film. It doesn't deviate from the Disney formula that much. I agree. Let It Go. However, Frozen still exceeded my expectations. The animation, although the characters look a bit weird, is dazzling. The songs are all catchy and the scenes in which they are performed are full of energy and charisma. The famous Let It Go sequence, although I don't quite get why the song was so universally loved, is still an awesome song and has a good message.The reason for Frozen's success isn't Let It Go. The reason it's a good film is because it's an involving, affecting and well written screenplay with moving messages, some (though not many) subversions of Disney clichÃ©s- especially with the main villain- and the various moving messages throughout. The way the act of true love which saves the main character is the love between sisters instead of the love between prince and princess is unexpected and clever. Also, the film has various suspenseful set pieces and in general it's a strong storyline. It may not entirely deserve the universal critical acclaim but it's the only memorable animated film to come out of 2013 and completely deserved the Oscar. 'Some people are worth melting for' is the best line of dialogue to come out of 2013 in my opinion and Frozen is proof a secondary Disney renaissance may possibly be on the horizon. Frozen is a strong animated effort, although due to the hype it may not live up to expectations for new viewers, and will be a good winter movie in future.8/10",8,2,8,6 November 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," The Last Straw, not The Last Stand
","Comic book movies may have been done to death, but the X-Men films are interesting. Not only are they not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but they are set in the real world and feature many thought- provoking themes. They also have one of the best comic book movie villains ever; Magneto, who is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen. The first one was good, the second was better though not as perfect as everyone says it is, the prequel was excellent, this movie sucks. It actually just plain sucks. Bryan Singer has left and is replaced by Brett Ratner, who does OK but doesn't add anything to the film. Meanwhile, the script is a cartoonish, muddled mess with underdeveloped plot elements and boring scenes left, right and center. The action scenes are the only part of the film that truly work, but even they drown in endless CGI eventually. Killing off Cyclops and Professor X, 2 of the most pointless character deaths in recent memory, was just the icing on the cake. What makes things worse is the numbingly awful acting from nearly everyone aside from Stewart and McKellen. Even Hugh Jackman isn't as good as usual, while Halle Berry and Vinnie Jones are simply dreadful. It's a deeply tedious affair, and while the thematic depth that made the others work is there, it never truly shines through and the film dissolves into a CGI beat-em-up video game which is completely broken.4/10",4,0,1,7 September 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," As much fun as one of Walter's imaginings
","The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is directed by and stars Ben Stiller, who I like, as a bored man who works at Life Magazine in the negatives sector. He regularly escapes into his fantasy world, and eventually embarks on an adventure to retrieve a lost negative. Although my expectations were low, this is a very pleasant surprise. It's both exciting and funny, and an excellent excursion into visually dazzling, witty, dream like escapism. Ben Stiller shows he's one of the best actor directors at work and the film actually looks genuinely great. All but one of the dream sequences are very interesting and Walter Mitty is a character many will relate to. It's not without flaws, but didn't deserve the low rotten tomatoes rating. The 'twist' is painfully obvious, the way that Walter goes and has his big adventure slightly deviates from the point and it can be style over substance, but it's still a lot of fun. In general, it's a very entertaining and relatable movie, with Ben Stiller on full likable ordinary guy mode and full unsung awesome director mode.TSLOWM has a very satisfying and charming plot, and the adventure sequences are really well done. The romance at the centre is slightly predictable, but not overly so and adds to the film's charm. The screenplay has plenty of warmth and likability as well. This is a very enjoyable film with a surprising amount of heart. It's more ambitious than many films of its kind and certainly falls into the 'underappreciated movies of 2013' category. A very entertaining big of escapism overall, if a bit predictable and unremarkable and good viewing for the whole family. It's certainly a lot better than it sounds, and while some have complained about style over substance, there's a fair amount of substance to anchor the style in there. 8/10",8,0,0,11 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The not very amazing spider-man
","In general I like superhero films. I have little patience for boring love stories and cartoony villains, but usually these films have some good story and fun spectacle. The first 2 Spiderman movies were excellent and the third isn't even as bad as you remember. So why reboot? What could possibly be the point? Why do these movies even exist? They're about as necessary as the upcoming Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. However, these movies are here and there's nothing we can do about it. The first was a poor reboot that didn't follow the original as closely as people say it does, but is bad because it's not a good comic book movie in general. This sequel is a slight improvement. For some reason, they decided to do the Spiderman 3 formula and have Peter Parker juggle battling a multitude of underdeveloped villains while sorting out his personal life. The truth is, TASM 2 isn't really a movie. It's a compilation of advertisements for upcoming cash grabs which just sets up sequels and spin offs.The story is overlong and lacks emotional depth, the script is underdone and the film feels totally unfocused and overstuffed. Andrew Garfield is a bad Spiderman who cowers in Tobey Maguire's shadow; Jamie Foxx is weak as Electro but Emma Stone plays the definitive comic book movie girlfriend and Dane DeHaan is excellent as well. Few can argue that Peter and Gwen's relationship was spot on. As well as that, Marc Webb (Probably hired just because of his name) is a pretty strong director and the action scenes are visually stunning and often fairly exhilarating. You also feel like you're swinging through the air with Spiderman. Therefore, despite the weak narrative there's always fun to be had with the set pieces, which thankfully don't disappoint. Gwen Stacy's death, though spoiled by the internet and trailers, was still a powerful moment and far better handled than most of the film. TASM 2 is a weak albeit watchable comic book sequel that boasts some neat touches but it's totally overloaded. Maybe it's time to leave Spiderman alone for a while.5/10",5,5,12,25 July 2014
Ex Machina," One of 2015's better movies and an usually smart science fictio screenplay
","Alex Garland's directional debut sees a young programmer evaluating the human qualities of a humanoid robot. Ex Machina stands out among the many, more explosive science fiction films from 2015 simply because of how clever it is. Every meticulously written line is significant and every theme in what is a hugely complex picture is fully developed and explored. EM avoids easy answers and clichés, and makes for a full-on, disturbing, thought-provoking and fascinating exploration of artificial intelligence. While somewhat slow paced at times and occasionally confusing, this is a film which definitely stands out and deserves to be on the many Best of the Year lists it was placed on at the end of 2015. A minimalist picture, this leans heavily on Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander. All deliver excellent performances, and Garland proves himself an intelligent director. It's not a 5 star movie, but it is definitely worth a look and is further enhanced by its dark, haunting tone which ensures that it gets under your skin and stays there. It's a very good drama, and presents a scientific yet deeply human look at androids.8/10",8,0,4,26 March 2016
Mulholland Drive," Maddeningly brilliant
","I loved Mulholland Drive. Simultaneously, I kind of hated it if that makes any sense at all, which it probably doesn't. Like this movie. MD is made up of loads of random and seemingly irrelevant scenes with one rug pull after another, but the core storyline involves an aspiring actress trying to help an amnesiac find the answers behind the car crash that gave her amnesia. An art-house, surrealist movie, this only becomes more and more confusing as it goes along and trying to work out what on earth it's about is like trying to do an advanced physics exam while riding a roller-coaster while listening to heavy metal. Yet it's fantastic. It truly is. It's one of the best movies of the 2000s. The performances are superb, the direction is excellent, the screenplay is ingeniously constructed and best of all, it's not all meaningless, flat surrealism. There is a compelling narrative and emotional centre here. On a thematic level, this movie is fascinating and only becomes more intriguing- and thus more maddening- as it goes along. This is the first film by David Lynch I've watched, but with only one film he's proved that he has unnatural ability to bring avant-garde surrealism into the mainstream and make it less an exercise in unique style and more as a fascinating way of exploring powerful story lines and themes, and blurring the line between dreams and reality. I now want to see the rest of his filmography. This will annoy a lot of people and it certainly annoyed me, but it's a fantastically done movie and left me reflecting on it for days. Therefore, I have no choice but to give it my highest ranking.10/10",10,3,4,11 March 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Most overrated movie of 2014 hands down
","Marvel's biggest gamble features the world's weirdest heroes: A bunch of intergalactic criminals trying to stop a typical Marvel villain cliché from destroying the galaxy. There's a talking raccoon in there as well. It's bonkers. It's worked for most of the world, but not for me. The truth is I'm sick and tired of comic book movies being released 4 or 5 times a year. Marvel have done good in the past, but this along with Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 feel like factory products. This one is different, but it's just silly. It has its fun moments and some of the action sequences have a fun, out of this world feel to them. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista are all good. Bradley Cooper manages not to make the raccoon the new Jar Jar Binks. James Gunn's direction is OK and there is a pleasingly light hearted feel to the whole affair. The non stop flow of jokes, special effects and diversity will please many.I found the endlessly funny tone made it totally devoid of tension, and the jokes were decent but it wasn't that funny. The action sequences are nothing we haven't seen before and the visuals of the movie are so all over the place at times it feels like multiple people vomited onto a canvas. Guardians Of The Galaxy is just too many different things stuffed together and too many different conflicting elements. Subsequently, the film is the cinematic representation of an exploding turkey in the oven. It has plenty of fun elements and good performances, but there's no tension and it doesn't actually add up to anything. It's just a colourful science fiction monotone after a while and there are some half hearted attempts at emotional depth but they didn't really connect. Sadly the Marvel Cinematic Universe is entering its third phase next year and the formula will continue to be done to death. GOTG may be slightly different but it's nowhere near as fun as everyone says.5/10",8,4,10,16 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Possibly the best British movie of the year
","The Imitation Game has Benedict Cumberbatch playing Alan Turing. The film shows various different points of Turing's life: His difficult school life, his triumphs during the war and his conviction for his homosexuality after the war. The film drifts through these various timelines in a non linear way and paints a brilliant portrait of Turing. His conviction following the war could have been focused on more and Keira Knightly is a bit jarring, but TIG is unshaken by its flaws and emerges a triumphant and deeply moving historical drama. Like many Oscar baiting movies it's all about the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely outstanding as Turing and as far as I'm concerned he's the best actor Oscar front runner for 2014. Everyone else is good as well, and Keira Knightly isn't totally unbearable. The acting is what makes the film and the film might be less memorable without Benedict, but the other elements of the film are well done too.Although the script uses a line to do with people others think nothing of doing something extraordinary a bit too often, otherwise it's a sensitive, moving and well written character study. All 3 of the parts from Turing's life are very well done. The part about his school life is very powerful and sad; the war part is suspenseful and fascinating while the final part revolving around his decline following the war is incredibly moving. The direction is very good as well and injects the film with real tension and power. TIG is in general told, directed and acted excellently and it's a very interesting and moving film. It's certainly not the feel good film of the year, but it is one of the best films of the year. It also doesn't feel like it's being made just to get awards and doesn't have that off putting Oscar baiting vibe to it. Even better than Nolan's Interstellar, TIG is an extraordinary movie and really deserves to be seen. And the best actor Oscar goes too....9/10",8,7,13,23 November 2014
Saw II," As horror sequels go, pretty decent
","Saw II continues the tale of modern horror's greatest villain: Jigsaw. This time, 8 people are locked in a brutal test while a detective, the father to one of the victims, and the police try to save them. S2 is a rough, brutal ride. It has been treated unfairly by critics because of the bloodshed. That's just what it uses for scares. Some horror movies use jump scares. Some use tension. This uses violence and uses it reasonably well. It's not always enjoyable as it does get pretty unpleasant at times, but it is undeniably effective. Therefore, it's easy to write it off as a nasty gore-fest, but it counterbalances the gore with thought-provoking thematic material on morals, justice and how far one will go to save themselves. It's a nasty film, but it is effective. It's far from a perfect movie admittedly. The characters aside from Jigsaw and the main detective are weak, the drama is somewhat superficial, it's not as tense as the first one and things are a bit sillier this time. That being said, it's a watchable and reasonably thrilling horror film, although for many it will be a bit much. It's worth watching for all the twists and turns, as you will never see them coming.6/10",6,0,0,14 May 2016
The Last Emperor," Another overlong Oscar baiting historical drama with plenty of neat touches
","The Last Emperor is a best picture winner. We all know what this means. It's too long, it's about something deep and meaningful, it's light on the watchability, it's pretentious and it's probably not actually the best movie of that year. And TLE ticks most of the boxes in the best picture rulebook and it's impossible for something like this not to be critically acclaimed and awarded with Oscars. With the butt numbing run time and poor pacing which means the film half heartedly goes in and out of fascinating content I think we can all say safely 9 Oscars was a bit excessive. However, this is a good historical epic. The visuals could have come right out of an art gallery and many beautiful images are created without there being a pixel of CGI in sight. The acting is all around pretty good, and you can tell the director Bernardo Bertolucci really knows what he's doing and has plenty of experience in the film business.TLE works thanks to its sobering and moving story which has some interesting themes to do with power and yearning for power. It's fairly powerful on an emotional level and by the end one does feel genuinely moved. It's got plenty of boring moments but plenty of interesting ones as well and it feels authentic and recreates the period well. It doesn't come across as manipulative or overly sentimental and you get the impression it is telling the story accurately without artistic deviations from fact. It does meander, but it has to be admired for the powerful storytelling and amazing visuals. It's not the most enjoyable film ever but it is a very interesting one and you still enjoy it a fair amount. Overall, this is a stirring and interesting historical epic which is rather entertaining and thought provoking, although they could have made it a bit faster. Still, that's Oscar winners for you.7/10",7,0,0,22 November 2014
Jurassic World," The best of the sequels
","While most rightfully are saying this is the best of the sequels and certainly better than the trailers made it look, some are pretty unsatisfied with Jurassic World. While flawed, JW is ultimately a strong, nostalgic and well made blockbuster that avoids the flaws of the other sequels. The Lost World descends into mediocrity and lacks an interesting plot, while Jurassic Park III is devoid of a compelling story, although it has some cool set pieces later on. This one actually has a good plot, although it's a bit mystifying as to why they went ahead and opened the park. A genetically modified dinosaur goes on the rampage, giving the plot a tight, suspenseful focus and once again having the thought provoking themes of hubris the original had. It's tense, exciting and there's actually a sense of fear as this time many members of the public are involved. The trailers looked generic but thankfully this is a pleasant surprise, and most likely soon to join the Billion Dollar Club. The biggest surprise of all is that the kids are actually semi bearable.With a good story, decent CGI and plenty of tension, this is a good blockbuster, but flaws are aplenty. The action doesn't reach the heights of prior instalments and the finale has a bit too much CGI. The characters aren't done well. Although he gets through the film with one expression mostly, Chris Pratt does a fine job as the hero, but the other characters are side-lined, while Bryce Dallas Howard, despite her best efforts, is stuck with a boring, tedious and irritating character. Somewhat unremarkable and occasionally reeking of sexism, JW lacks true punch and opts for more generic CGI set pieces. More effective are the nostalgic nods to the original film. After the 22 year wait for another good Jurassic Park film, fans of the original will undoubtedly appreciate this. Colin Trevorrow isn't Steven Spielberg, but he directs the film well and more often than not borrows intelligently from Spielberg and uses genuine suspense. There are illogical plot points here and there but you're unlikely to notice them. Good stuff overall.7/10",7,0,4,16 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A deliciously dark fantasy with plenty of personality, although it doesn't match the book
","Roald Dahl is a very good children's author, and his books are definitely recommended. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of his best, centring on a boy who's one of 5 children allowed a special tour of an amazing chocolate factory owned by an eccentric chocolate making genius. The original was not a film I particularly liked although I haven't seen it for many years. This is, overall, a good, solid adaptation which has plenty of flavour and personality. Tim Burton may not be the right choice to direct, but his amazing visuals, use of quirky surrealism and interesting colour palette make the film unique and fascinating, if overly dark at times. To sum up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the cinematic representation of a visually appealing piece of dark chocolate. The child actors, especially Freddie Highmore, are actually good for once and it's an entertaining, unique screenplay as well. There's a mild emotional centre and the ending is reasonably uplifting. In general, the film brings the book to life is visually stunning and quirky fashion, and Roald Dahl would probably like this version more as it's closer to the book.There are flaws though. While the visuals are great, the film can feel fairly artificial and Burton avoids using too much CGI, but a lot of the film just doesn't look real. It brings Roald Dahl's dark humour to the screen, but at times it just feels a bit mean spirited. It's a bit too long as well, with an unnecessary epilogue which deviates from the source material as well as a dull flashback subplot which not even the great Christopher Lee can make interesting. The main let down is Johnny Depp's repulsive portrayal of Willy Wonka, which is creepy, off putting and completely over the top. The Oompa Loompas are quite entertaining, but Johnny Depp gives what might be his worst and most misguided performance. With the emphasis on visuals and dark humour, at times a sense of charm is lost. Also, it's possible Tim Burton, although a strong director overall, with his quirky visuals and darkness, just isn't quite the right choice to adapt the book. Still, this is a good film; not the best thing Burton has done but it's an entertaining family film with a dark and unique flavour of its own.7/10",7,1,2,12 January 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Noisy nonsense which isn't enough fun
","I love action movies, but I need a plot to enjoy them properly. Mission Impossible II has little plot. It's something to do with Tom Cruise's superspy trying to destroy an engineered virus. Aside from a romance sub plot there's little other plot. Mission Impossible was a boring spy thriller with a convoluted plot, but the sequel is even worse. Watching MI2 was a very detached experience. There's nothing to invest yourself in or latch onto in this movie. It's just loads of action set pieces with no plot or characters. Tom Cruise is incredibly boring and his character can do anything, so therefore isn't interesting at all. The action itself peaks early on with an impressive rock climbing sequence. From then on, the set pieces are highly artificial and often don't make any sense. Dramatically listless, blank and devoid of a human touch, MI2 is a film watching experience that has absolutely no impact whatsoever and hits about as hard as a soft feather pillow to the face.The film is admittedly well made and it's certainly not unwatchable, but it's difficult to pay attention to it. John Woo remains an accomplished and skilled director of action, but the action in this movie doesn't always suit him. He's better at shootouts and the car chases feel fairly ordinary. The film is trying its best and its target audience will mostly love it. The film requires a certain mood to be able to appreciate it, and cynical viewers may just switch it off out of boredom. A well made action film with plenty of visual splendour, but it comes up short on the screen writing front. Mission Impossible 4 was a good action film but that was because it actually had a plot and there were stakes. At least you could understand what was going on. Here, it's just noisy incoherence. The first MI movie failed because it spent too much time on boring dialogue and not enough action. Here, there's plenty of action but it doesn't deliver. It's difficult to get action films right when the lead is a zombie with muscles. I'm not too hyped about Mission Impossible 5.4/10",4,1,2,30 December 2014
The Hangover Part II," Ugly and unfunny
","I really liked the first movie, because it was very funny without being mean spirited, and had the right level of rudeness. I was excited to see this, not expecting it to be very good but expecting it to be fun at least. I was wrong. In this inevitable sequel, the wolf pack go to Thailand for Stu's wedding and after another disastrous bachelor party they wake up in a hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of last night and the younger brother of Stu's fiancée goes missing and they have to find him. Is any of this sounding familiar? If so, I'm not surprised since this is literally the exact same as the first movie. But there are a few small differences such as it's a monkey instead of a tiger and they're in Bangkok instead of Vegas. The biggest difference is that while the first was hilarious fun this is a nasty, repugnant, pathetic, numbingly unfunny, abysmally written, lazy, mean spirited and utterly unbearable stink-bomb of a sequel that's more disturbing than funny.There are a couple of funny moments and the place where they find who they were looking for feels more logical than it did in the first one. Aside from that, this is utterly woeful. The cast lose much of their sparkle, especially Bradley Cooper while the script is painfully unfunny and full of tasteless humour and flat jokes. The film is mean spirited and lazy, expecting audiences to be satisfied with a carbon copy and expecting them to laugh at these unpleasant gags. This takes all that was fun about the first and turns it up to 11. It's racist, sexist, foul mouthed and full of disturbing situations and it, in general, isn't funny. This has to be one of the laziest and worst sequels of all time and while most don't seem to hate it quite as much as I do, many will disappointed. Aside from a couple of laughs (Mainly involving Alan) this is about as fun as being punched in the face. This is evidence that just because the jokes are ruder it doesn't make them funnier.1/10",1,3,5,9 January 2014
Prisoners," One of the scariest thrillers I've seen in a while
","Prisoners may not contain jump scares, ghosts, screaming, things that go bump in the night or loads of fog but it is one of the scariest movies of 2013. This terrifying child abduction thriller is unbelievably chilling and once it has viewers in its raw, icy grip it never lets go. Hugh Jackman and Terence Howard are the 2 fathers whose daughters go missing and Jake Gyllenhaal's detective tries to find them. Both the fathers go to extreme lengths to find their children. The film goes into a lot of dark territory, and it has some very disturbing scenes. But it is genuinely, completely and undeniably brilliant. It's 2 and a half hour length was unnecessary and there are scenes which weren't needed. This doesn't blunt the film's impact overall though. The acting and cinematography make the movie. Roger Deakin's amazing cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's tense direction mean the film both looks amazing and is absolutely filled with dread. If you want to be on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours watch this. Trust me, you will be.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is subtle but excellent, and Terence Howard is very good as well. Sadly, the memory of Hugh Jackman's amazing acting in this has been obscured since I saw Movie 43 only a few days after this, but it was a terrifying, powerful and skilled performance that didn't get the attention it deserved. The mystery element is compelling and you don't guess the murderer before the end. It's very well written and none of the dialogue feels forced. None of the emotional breakdowns or freak outs feel forced either. It is too long, but there's always stuff going on and the length does not damage the film. The thrills are based on the mystery and on suspense, but when there are thrilling moments they're very well handled and have you right on the edge of your seat. I think this should have been a contender for a best picture nod as it's a lot better than American Hustle, Dallas Buyers Club and Philomena. An excellent and overlooked film from 2013 that's definitely worth your time. If you want to see Hugh Jackman lose it this is the film for you.9/10",9,0,2,29 November 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Strong, heroic superhero sequel with plenty of swagger
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the most impressive film franchises ever created and is by now a living, breathing world. Ignoring the bland villains, dull love stories and occasional quality dip, which it is thankfully easy to do thanks to the high standard, the MCU can continue for as long as it likes. Phase 2 more or less concludes as the Avengers, who are individually fascinating, combined they're cooler than Indiana Jones at the South Pole and more powerful than The Green Mile, face another villain which Iron Man accidentally creates. Avengers Age of Ultron is not a sequel without faults. Although the film kills someone off, it's no-one major and there aren't any real risks. The mid credits scene is a bit disappointing, it doesn't set up later films, especially the hugely exciting upcoming Civil War, and feels like just another all out superhero brawl and goes down the Empire Strikes Back dark sequel route but doesn't actually do anything with it. Still, Marvel shows they still have skill, and this soon to be box office juggernaut deserves to be one.Joss Whedon proves a very good director once again, and the film includes an incredible long take in the opening, smooth and coherent cinematography and many genuinely beautiful moments of superhero madness. Robert Downey Jr. is still excellent as Iron Man, while with Chris Evans it's hard to believe that's the same guy who played that tiresome Human Torch in those Fantastic Four cheese sandwiches. Mark Ruffalo is very good as well, as is all of the others. Samuel L Jackson is still working wonders as Nick Fury. The spectacle is smashing, but there is a soul as well. The superheroes are characters you care about and there are some thought provoking themes of hubris in here too. The special effects and naturally spectacular and the script is well written, although a few more of the jokes which Whedon does so well would have been appreciated. The villain surprisingly doesn't suck, the girlfriends aside from the actually entertaining Black Widow are thankfully absent and the new additions are worth it. Aaron Taylor Jonhson partially redeems himself for Godzilla. Overall, a good though not great blockbuster, and a more than adequate follow up for the excellent original.8/10",7,4,11,26 April 2015
Everest," It's got more sting than one may think
","Everest looked like a generic disaster movie made purely for the big screen in the trailers. Not so. It tells the true story of a disastrous climbing expedition which took place in 1996. Since this is a true story, there's less room for the emotional manipulation and over the top set pieces which would have been expected. The film admirably follows the true story faithfully and doesn't sensationalize events. The way in which the film was marketed was misleading. There isn't as much action as the posters and trailers suggested. It's more of a realistic survival story than a big scale disaster flick. As a result, some may leave the theatre disappointed. Everest is an unexpectedly solid movie, but it certainly has its problems. There are definitely moments where the film loses your attention a bit, while a lot of the character deaths aren't given enough impact and seem rushed. In some ways, the part involving the climb to the top is more enjoyable than the slightly underdeveloped and occasionally rushed second half focusing on the disaster.Still, this will surprise you. It's a tense movie rather than a really thrilling one, which is a pleasant surprise and shows the film's maturity and restraint. Despite the many characters, they are all developed enough to sympathise with. It's got a very good cast for a disaster movie, and they all give good performances. Even Keira Knightly and Sam Worthington are bearable. The film's big surprise is its emotional impact. This is a tragic story with one of the best- and saddest- final shots of the year. Not everyone makes it out alive. As a result, it's not as forgettable as it looked from the marketing. The direction is pretty good as well and doesn't show off the visuals, instead focusing on the suspense and the characters. Obviously it's not full of really developed characters, but not every film can be so that's not a problem. Everest is a solid, satisfactory survival film with a strong cast, tense set pieces and a surprise emotional punch, although it feels somewhat rushed despite it's 2 hour runtime.7/10",7,14,14,26 December 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," A masterpiece is an understatement
","2001 A Space Odyssey is a enigmatic and captivating journey into space, as Stanley Kubrick blasts his audience with the full force of his meticulous genius. 2001 is an abstract movie, with various segments (Covering the dawn of man to the far future) linked only by a mysterious black monolith. This is a pretentious film admittedly, and some will find it dull. That's absolutely fine. This is a classic, but one not everyone will enjoy. With its long running time, lack of narrative coherence and dialogue and refusal to give answers, why is 2001 regarded as one of the best films ever made? Because it is one of the best displays of the power of the cinematic medium ever created and it is an extremely deep movie, with a multitude of interpretations and explanations. It's a cinematic master at the absolute peak of his power; with unforgettable, hypnotic, almost hallucinatory imagery which takes us into straight into the abyss, combined with hauntingly powerful themes which question mankind's place in the universe and effective sound, this is what cinema was made for.2001 is rarely dull, and its slowness and emotional distance make it even more fascinating. As a visual experience there are quite possibly no parallels whatsoever, but there are some strangely moving scenes in the film as well, and the entire sequence featuring the legendary HAL 9000 is suspenseful and gripping. The part with the apes is less interesting, but it does end with the best transition ever: The amazing match cut where a bone turns into a spaceship. 2001 is a difficult film to describe and the extent of its power, both emotional and sensory, is difficult to explain. It is simply one of the most entrancing- and maddeningly cryptic- movies ever made and since there are so many interpretations, the film carries on even after it finishes. Some may prefer more action packed and less elusive science fiction films, and it could easily take a couple of viewings to fully get 2001. However obscure and mysterious it is, or however pretentious, the truth cannot be avoided: 2001 is a masterpiece and one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of the medium.10/10",9,1,6,12 August 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Looks like I'm the only one who didn't like it
","Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the strangest romantic dramas you'll ever see. Jim Carry, hurt after his ex girlfriend had her memories of him removed, decides to do the same only to find he still loves her and it may be too late to correct his mistake. ESOTSM was a frustrating experience for me. This is full of beautifully acted scenes which are well directed and feel meaningful. Jim Carry has never been better and probably should have been nominated for an Oscar. Kate Winslet is completely superb. Those moments are strong and enjoyable and decently directed. That's what I want to see. I don't want to see what follows, which is a load of bizarre, surreal science fiction nonsense which is just confusing but that's what I get. I can enjoy beautifully acted scenes of drama or I can watch some nonsensical inside your head rubbish which hyper-actively zips from scene to scene like Twitchy the squirrel from Hoodwinked. I cannot do both at the same time.Easily one of the most overrated films of the 2000s, ESOTSM is an interesting film instead of a particularly good one. It's well acted, though Kirsten Dunst who is well regarded for some reason is pretty weak. The direction is OK and there is some very clever writing. Sadly, it's just a great big mess. As a result of the films insistence on surreal stupidity, it loses its message and its emotional impact. As Jim Carry races through his mind trying to avoid allowing his memories to be erased, 2 other characters are trying to find him on a computer. That is like me trying to keep up with the message of this movie. To be fair, it has some promising early scenes and there are various truths about love and heartache which feel genuine and important. Thankfully, the film doesn't veer into sentimental stupidity and isn't anyway near as unbearable as many other romantic dramas from the 2000s. There is definitely sunshine here, but it certainly isn't eternal. Everyone else seems to love this movie, so it seems I am alone in my opinion. It's well acted and written at times and I may give it another go. If I can even be bothered, which is doubtful.5/10",5,5,11,3 November 2014
Avatar," The very definition of style over substance
","James Cameron, whether you like him or not, certainly knows how to make a big blockbuster and fill it with dazzling visuals and epic thrills. The Terminator and its sequel are 2 of the best science fiction films ever made, while Titanic, despite receiving what might be the biggest backlash of all time, is also a very good movie. Avatar? Not so much. This tale of a human using an avatar to live among an alien race and learn about them has by the sound of it already been done by Disney and Kevin Costner. This is a groundbreaking special effects spectacle, but not much more than that.It's a bit depressing this is the highest grossing movie of all time. There are good reasons why this one's reputation has gone down in recent years. The plot is formulaic but interesting, and the special effects are amazing to look at but the film has a lot of flaws. I don't hate Avatar, but I don't like it much. I get the impression people turned on it after a second viewing. I didn't like it the first time. I watched it again recently and my rating remained the same. It's the most overrated science fiction film of all time in my opinion, and definitely one of the weaker billion dollar movies.In terms of positives, the main thing about this are the visuals. The visual effects are brilliant, and while it can look artificial it still pulls you in. The film is stunning to look at, and most of the acting is pretty good. The standout performance is Zoe Saldana, who's excellent performance as one of the aliens didn't get as much attention as it should have. The film has some interesting themes, which are wasted in favour of visuals but the inclusion of a more drama filled story is appreciated. The scene when the home of the Na'vi is destroyed is genuinely affecting, and there are some good bits.Aside from that, Avatar is all style and almost no substance. Avatar barely feels like a movie. It feels more like James Cameron showing off how good he is at VFX with a vague story thrown in reluctantly. The screenplay is bland and lacking in emotion, while the thought provoking themes are wasted. James Cameron isn't even at full directional power, as every shot goes out of its way to show some scenery and this means some of the action scenes lose tension. Avatar is a work of art and like most modern art, it's weak, soulless and lacking in meaning. I also sure he could have coped with shortening it a bit, as 160 minutes is totally overlong. Don't even get me started on Sam Worthington.Overall, Avatar is a remarkably average film that was hyped to absurd levels and it's utterly outrageous that while The Dark Knight wasn't nominated for best picture, this was. It's a hollow and aside from the effects generic movie and not something many would want to watch more than once (Unfortunately I have). Not a terrible movie, but a huge disappointment and certainly not Cameron at his best.",4,4,6,9 August 2014
Frank," Quirky, intelligent indie fare with cinema's coolest paper mache head
","Frank follows a band led by an enigmatic and unique musical genius who wears a Paper Mache head the entire time. It's an unconventional and different type of a movie; a black comedy, a drama and musical biopic rolled into one. Many will not have seen Frank, especially not in the USA, and it's not hard to see why. I like mainstream cinema although it provokes many a rant from me, and I like more dramatic and art-house films too. This doesn't necessarily fall into either category. This is made for film critics. It's quirky, different and distant to the point of being obnoxious, and does not exist to provide entertainment to most cinema goers. Frank is a good film, but it's not a particularly enjoyable one. It's emotionally distant at times, can feel cold due to its dark humour and despite being a comedy the dark themes are not merged with humour with the same balance that the excellent and far better independent drama Calvary from the same year. It will keep many interested for a while, but unfortunately it declines into a bummer of a final act and makes the whole story seem pointless.Frank is well directed, written and acted though. The direction has a different feel to it and a sense of art, while the script has plenty of sparks and can be funny at times. The performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and others are all strong, and Michael Fassbender emits plenty of depth, humour, humanity and emotion from inside the giant head. Frank is a dark comedy and this makes it less enjoyable, but it should be admired for trying to tackle difficult themes in a movie of its type. For anyone who's interested in music this is a good film to watch, and at times the film can be interesting. Overall, it's a well done indie flick which isn't very entertaining and has a feeling of emotional distance but at the same time its unusualness can be endearing in a funny sort of way. Other British films such as The Imitation Game and Locke are definitely better than Frank, but Frank is still a decent film and worth checking out if you're it's audience.7/10",7,0,0,25 January 2015
Selma," Oscar bait done properly
","Selma got nominated for Best Picture. Of course it did. It's a story focussing on an important issue and the main character is an important historical figure who had to overcome lots of obstacles to change the world. If that isn't Oscar bait, what is? Selma didn't look like much. It's just the same type of drama we get every year, which the Academy will love while the public rightly prefer better movies that just get ignored by the Oscars. It only got nominated for 2 awards, and it's admittedly good theme song Glory beat Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie, which was not the right choice. However, with this film prepare for a pleasant surprise. Selma is a very good film. Not a masterpiece, but miles better than The Theory of Everything and Whiplash. This is what every Oscar baiting movie should aim for: a worthy, powerful movie which is also entertaining and focuses on being enjoyable to people who aren't Oscar voters or critics. Selma is something of a triumph, and a film where I genuinely wasn't bored at all throughout.David Oyelowo is excellent as Martin Luther King, and was certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Ava DuVernay's direction is flat, but in a good way. She uses style sparingly (When it's used, it's very effective) and intelligently, and keeps the film grounded in realism, letting the surprisingly strong script and memorable performances tell the story instead of a lot of flashy visuals. Selma is admittedly going the motions through historical events at times and is somewhat predictable, but its characters are believable and its dramatic moments are genuine, rather than forced. Selma is quite a hard hitting movie at times, and it manages to keep you invested throughout. It is still pretty formulaic and you know what's coming much of the time, but rather than selling a message and shoving it down your throat, it's a walk through history which sells the dramatic side of the story well without being overly sentimental. A really good film overall, and far better than I was expecting.8/10",8,0,1,27 January 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," More of the same
","Twilight is the worst film franchise ever committed to celluloid. As far as I'm concerned, these are the worst successful movies of all time. The movie camera was not invented so that this kind of rubbish could be forced upon so many people! Thankfully, after a weak but not as bad as you remember first one and then 3 horrifying cinematic car crashes (New Moon in particular is one of my 10 least favourite films of all time) it's over at last. The vampire government comes to confront the Cullens about Edward and Bella's child and they try to survive an epic final battle.... which never even happens. The dream battle is admittedly fun, but that's only 5 minutes. The whole film is 2 hours. Most have regarded this as the best of the franchise. Why? It's just as bad as before and can't really be distinguished from the others. The first 20 minutes have some unintentional hilarity as Kristen Stewart turns into an angry CGI vampire but then she went straight faced again. After that unexpected enjoyment ended, I got depressed.Bill Condon does his best with the direction, but his noble efforts cannot save what is yet another dreary, soulless, mirthless and endlessly tedious vampire soap opera which is only for fans or people who have trouble sleeping. The acting is as bad as ever, the script seems to be drowning in its own sentimentality and it lacks any true emotion, settling instead for dreary montages, painful dialogue and a washed out col-our palette which doesn't add anything to the film. So, Breaking Dawn part II is just more of the same. It's the second best of the series but that's not saying anything at all. It's decently directed and does try to add more which could appeal to non fans but any scenes which could be fun are almost always ruined by the lifeless acting of almost everyone involved. Only Billy Burke and Michael Sheen actually do a good job and the film and its predecessors have basically ruined the image of vampires forever more. To conclude: This is a terrible film. Well of course it is. It's some good elements but it's just sleep inducing. At least it's the last one. For antidotes to Twilight, I recommend The Hunger Games, Nosferatu and both versions of Let The Right One In.3/10",3,7,17,14 February 2014
Saw," Does this horror cult classic live up to the hype?
","I have finally got round to seeing Saw, one of the most popular and commercially successful horror movies of the 2000s. In Saw, 2 men wake up in an abandoned bathroom and are put through a sadistic, grisly test. While the sequels evidently ramp the gore and violence up to 11, this is a low budget movie (As is clear and not in a good way during certain scenes) which makes heavy use of just one location. Saw doesn't live up to the gore hype, but that's a good thing. It actually shows a bit of restraint. It still earns its 18 certificate though. It's a full-on, brutal and nasty horror film but here much of the horror is psychological, which makes it more effective as a whole. I rate James Wan as a director, and he directs the film pretty well even if it looks like a music video at times. The writing is a bit uneven, with plenty of bland dialogue and illogical moments while the acting really isn't great. It can feel, as a film, fairly cold and emotionless, and it takes a little while to get going. Still, Saw is a smart and twisty treat for horror fans and the famous twist ending will really get you if you don't know it (I, unfortunately, did). Saw is a pleasant surprise and an absolutely solid thriller that deserves more credit from the critics than it gets.7/10",7,1,2,7 May 2016
A Clockwork Orange," One of the most demented and fiendishly brilliant films ever made
","Stanley Kubrick, the perfectionist genius who no director will ever be able to copy, has made many great films. But nothing is quite as great as A Clockwork Orange. A sociopathic delinquent is put in prison and given controversial rehabilitation, which soon impacts negatively on his life. With themes and social commentary in every frame, ACO is a very deep and thought provoking movie. It's one of the most controversial films of all time. This is where the film shows its age, as some of its content seems slightly tame compared to modern cinema. However, ACO is a harrowing, terrifying and deliriously brilliant movie which is more gut wrenchingly frightening than any theme park attraction; not because of the violence, but because of the haunting themes and chilling relevance over 40 years after its release. It's not the easiest watch, but you will not be able to get it out of your head. From the opening shot, in which an excellent Malcolm McDowall gives you the Kubrick glare, you'll be utterly hooked.Stanley Kubrick is at the absolute top of his form with ACO. Amazing cinematography, intelligent production design and a chilling, nightmarish atmosphere make this a complete knockout on the visual front. The writing is superb, and this mixes ultra violence and pitch black humour brilliantly, and the unflinching emotional power and haunting sense of tragedy further enhances the film. ACO is emotionally cold and very dark, so some viewers will not enjoy it. It may take more than one viewing to get it. The film has an authentic atmosphere but combines it with disturbing surrealism and the brilliant cinematography makes the film genuinely terrifying at times. While no easy ride, ACO is also a relevant, powerful and fascinating film which perhaps isn't enjoyable in the traditional sense but which will have you riveted and amazed at the sheer genius of the work. Stanley Kubrick's most controversial film but also his best, this makes 2001 A Space Odyssey look insignificant in comparison.10/10",10,1,3,10 March 2015
Reservoir Dogs," A violent, viscerally thrilling and ferociously entertaining decade defining masterwork
","Although I'm not a huge fan of Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's debut is one of the best independent films of all time. A heist goes horribly wrong and the remaining criminals try to work out who the police informant is. It's set mostly in one location, and as the tension builds in the gangster's hideout the film becomes so unbearably intense it threatens to explode through the screen. Less a film, more a mind blowing, pulse pounding powerhouse, Reservoir Dogs is certainly one of the defining films of the 90s. It's quite a disturbing film at times and those who are squeamish should stay away. The violence makes the movie even more powerful, but it does get nasty at times. The film could be seen as style over substance by some and it won't be everyone's cup of tea; however, you can't really find anything else like it. Aside from Quentin Tarantino's other films of course. The film unfolds in non linear storytelling but unlike with Pulp Fiction, which was non linear just to show off, this adds to the plot and makes it even tenser.Tarantino has a very dynamic and explosive visual style which enhances the brutal action, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for all 90 minutes. His dialogue is even better though, and he should have won an Oscar for his writing. The script is enthralling to listen to, and it has fine actors speaking the dialogue as well, with Tim Roth being the highlight. Reservoir Dogs is special because it refuses to be boxed in or respond to conventions. It doesn't show the heist properly, the characters are always talking about things irrelevant to the plot and the violence is unflinching and explosive. This kind of movie just isn't seen much... well, ever. It's consistently entertaining from beginning to end (for those who can stomach the violence) and bizarrely enthralling. An extremely energetic and well made film which has deservedly influenced pop culture massively. You may hate it, but you can't deny the power of the dialogue or its originality.10/10",10,0,0,6 December 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," The most offensively overrated animated movie ever to grace the silver screen
","I am not a DreamWorks fan. At all. I get irritated when people compare them to Pixar, because when's the last time DreamWorks did anything memorable?! I've never even liked Shrek much! Most would answer my question with this: The most overrated animated movie of all time. It's about a Viking civilisation who have a on-going battle with dragons. A hapless son of the Viking chief begins an unlikely friendship with a dragon and realizes there's more to them. How To Train Your Dragon proves Pixar aren't the only ones who do great visuals, as it looks absolutely great. The story is deeper than one might expect and some of the flying sequences make you feel like you're flying with the dragons. It's a good visual experience and has a couple of good bits, but that's pretty much all I enjoyed. The main problem is that this doesn't tell me anything I haven't been told before. I've seen all these characters before. This story and moral has been done to death. When's the last time I saw animated humans and animals becoming friends? Or flying sequences? Or underdog stories? Maybe last week.The 90 minute run time is too short for an epic storyline. Too much of the film is rushed into montages and a lot of scenes feel rushed as a result. The film's emotional impact is minimal as the dialogue lacks flair and it moves along too quickly. The characters are some of the most clichéd I've seen in an animated movie, with the love interest having zero chemistry with the rather formulaic hero, although he's coolly named Hiccup. The script is so flat it might as well have been sat on by a dragon. It's not funny or particularly exciting and it feels like the same family feel good fare DW spit out at us year after year, their films like products on a conveyor belt leading out from a factory. This is not some great ground-breaking movie, rather a relatively ordinary and to be truly honest pretty darn boring affair. It looks great, but the story is irritating (Hiccup only gets accepted when he does something heroic) and everything about feels uninspired. It is another trip into cliché town from DreamWorks. The only difference is that this time we're riding a dragon. What a waste of time! 4/10",4,4,14,16 November 2014
Pulp Fiction," Am I allowed to disagree?
","The fact that an aimless, jarring mish mash of swearing, violence, gangsters, foot massages, royale with cheese, accidental shootings, interrogations, robberies, yelling and a load of characters without any actual character being badass defined the 90s show the 90s was a mixed decade from film. Quentin Tarantino's legendary drama thriller is a non linear collection of various story lines. In one, a very bizarre robbery unfolds at a diner. In another, Vincent Vega has to look after his boss' wife for an evening and they dance, she overdoses and they exchange awful jokes from a pilot she was once in. In another, Butch Coolidge gets into a lot of trouble when about to flee LA... all for a watch. And finally, Vincent and Jules assassinate a man, then have to dispose of a corpse after Vincent has an accident involving a gun and their informant. Don't get me wrong: Pulp Fiction is a good enough film it's just very over-hyped. However, you can almost see the sparks flying as the actors deliver that electric dialogue. It's a script that will make all aspiring scriptwriters jealous.Quentin Tarantino's direction is very good as well and the film draws out career best performances from Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis. John Travolta and Uma Thurman both rock. There are some good bits: The gold watch speech, the dance, the interrogation, the accidental shooting and some of the Bruce Willis segment showcase the amazing writing. However, many other scenes feel banal and unnecessary. Reservoir Dogs was utterly brilliant, so Tarantino got arrogant and made a bloated 2 and a half hour epic which could have 100 minutes. The film has little personality and lacks any kind of message. There's nothing wrong with that, but if I spend 2 and a half hours of my life watching unnecessary scenes I want there to be a purpose. Pulp Fiction is just too long and self indulgent to be a great film. It has plenty of style and is very well written but it's nothing special. Critics never shut up about modern movies being style over substance, yet this is voted one of the best films ever made when it's exactly that? 6/10",6,2,5,29 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A magic filled but unimaginative adaptation
","I love the Harry Potter books because of their brilliant writing, exciting and funny moments, compelling characters and the way that I'm hooked as soon as I pick one up. They deserved to be such a phenomenon. The films? Not so much. This starts off the adaptations in OK style, and follows Harry Potter's attempts to stop the evil sorcerer who killed his parents getting a stone which will help him return to power.This, along with the second is directed by Christopher Columbus and the first 2 often seem to be seen as the weakest. In my opinion these 2 aren't the worst, but they're certainly not that great. For some reason, Columbus decides to copy the book page for page but leave out most of its depth, wit and bite. For a Harry Potter fan this may be satisfying, but since the film is also overly syrupy and kid friendly, adults may be irritated by it. This adaptation is a mixed bag overall.The adult cast has more talented British actors than you can shake a stick at and while most of them have relatively small roles, they certainly leave an impression. John Williams' as usual provides a great soundtrack which sadly was used less in later films and while I'm not desperately keen on Chris Columbus' style, he does do a perfectly OK job at directing the film. To a newcomer and someone who hasn't read the book the film would likely seem magical and fascinating as it thankfully includes many details about the HP universe, which is one of the best fictional universes ever created.There are some genuinely frightening moments and it provides good escapism. But there are many problems. It's nowhere near as funny or fascinating as the book, which is odd as it's pretty much as carbon copy of the book although to be fair it omits the right parts of the book. It's also overlong and frequently dull, and things such as the troll, the dragon and the mirror are conveyed poorly to the big screen, although the finale is still good. The child actors are excruciating to watch at times, although they would improve in later films.Overall a wooden and unimaginative adaptation which is cinematically uninteresting and, on my last viewing, a bore to watch. This is the 6th best, and while I used to like it, now I can see it's routine, though competently executed and visually decent, adaptation with little personality. When having to deal with the wooden child actors it's even more irritating.",6,1,1,5 August 2014
The Happening," Woe is me
","M Night Shyamalan started out with The Sixth Sense, a chilling and moving ghost story. Then he made Unbreakable, an excellent superhero movie which isn't really a superhero movie. Then he made Signs, which is a good movie despite the backlash. Then he made The Village, which was not good. He then made Lady In The Water, an apparently dire film I can't be bothered to watch. Then he made this....thing. A mysterious force is causing everyone to commit suicide. This is a scary premise, right? Sadly, it's done no justice. But the film is scary. It's absolutely terrifying. Audience will be so horrified they will watch through their fingers as Mark Wahlberg tries to convince us he's a science teacher and lectures a student on science, scary scenes consisting of wind rustling the trees unfold in the most laughably unscary way, people die in a way which just isn't scary and a guy randomly rambles on about hot dogs. I could go on and on, but there is a word limit.Although Shyamalan still has a gift with cinematography, that can't save this. Mark Wahlberg gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen a film, and sends the cringe factor right up. Everyone else is atrocious. The villain of the film is revealed to be wait for it..... plants! Plants! Plants. Seriously? Mark even tries to talk to one at one point. The script is one of the worst I've heard all year, and there are literally no defences to it at all. Shyamalan flops as a director for the first time, although this film isn't quite as bad as The Last Airbender. With numerous bizarre and random scenes, as well as plenty of terrible scary moments that could be from a comedy some may find this funny but for me, while Mark's science lecture had me cracking up, it just became a bit depressing after a while to see Shyamalan waste his talent in such a way. What happened? I urge you not to watch this film. Just stay well away from this. Throughout the film, whatever the title and marketing tell you... nothing is happening.1/10",1,5,7,16 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Darker, more entertaining but still overlong and dramatically flat
","The Chamber Of Secrets is one of the my favourite HP novels, and it packs loads of excitement and fear without the padding that would affect later novels. This was one of my favourite HP movies in the past as well, but comparing it to the others, it stands out as a perfectly watchable and likable, but ultimately underwhelming adaptation. It's not bad, and certainly an improvement, but it's not perfect.This is more dark and horror like than the first film. It follows people at Hogwarts getting attacked by a mysterious creature and Harry trying to stop it. It's the closest Harry Potter comes to being horror, with its large collection of giant spiders, scary snakes, dark, shadowy locations and ghosts so naturally it's still a syrup filled kids movie. It is an improvement to the first, but a lot of what was wrong with the first one is also present here.Chris Columbus improves as a director, and there are many tense and alarming set pieces. John Williams provides another great soundtrack, and the adult cast is still brilliant. The stand out is Kenneth Branagh, who is wonderful as the annoying but hilariously so Gilderoy Lockhart and maybe the best thing about the movie. The child actors are far less annoying in this movie, or at least less noticeably irritating. It's an interesting plot, and it's more exciting and watchable than the first one.Like the first, this is exactly the same as the book, although despite this it does deviate from the novel a bit more. 160 minutes is far too long for one of the shortest books in the series, and they could have easily streamlined it. The film is enjoyable enough, but it lacks genuine bite and there's little emotional depth while in the book it was more powerful and fun. The most frustrating thing is that it was a natural direction for the series to become darker and more mature and this doesn't take an opportunity to take the series in a new direction. Some of the frightening bits aren't as scary as they could be.Overall, an improvement and the 5th best HP movie. It's less boring than some of the later ones, but it lacks imagination and style and is a missed opportunity overall.",6,0,0,5 August 2014
The Departed," One of Scorsese's worst films, but still good
","The Departed, a crime thriller about a mole in the police and undercover cop trying to identify each other while the police try to infiltrate a gang in Boston, finally won Martin Scorsese the Oscar. A brilliant filmmaker like Martin Scorsese doesn't need an Oscar to prove his genius, but at least he finally got the credit from the Academy he deserves. It wasn't for the right film, but TD is a noble, thoroughly competent effort that is probably the weakest of the Scorsese films I've seen but certainly not bad. As a thriller, TD works well. Although the film feels somewhat restless at times and can't seem to keep still, it is undeniably entertaining. The set-pieces are tense, the visuals are as excellent as you'd expect from Scorsese, the plot is tense and twisty and it remains exciting much of the time. The film also benefits from a good soundtrack (Although they play the weaker version of Pink Floyd's 'Comfortably Numb') and a terrific lead performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. Mark Wahlberg is a scene-stealer as a foul mouthed police sergeant, while Martin Sheen also does a good job. Unfortunately, the criminally overrated Matt Damon is as boring as ever and Jack Nicholson overacts. This leads into the main problem with the movie: on a dramatic level, it isn't particularly compelling. It doesn't meditate on morals or any deeper themes except for a brief line spoken by Jack Nicholson during the opening, and ultimately the movie is quite superficial. Various things don't make a lot of sense and it's also too long. Despite the excessive length, as previously mentioned the film does feel rather hyperkinetic and restless, meaning much of it is told through montage. Still, as a thriller and a showcase of strong filmmaking, TD delivers.7/10",7,1,3,1 April 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero suspense, emotion, interest. Dark, nasty, unpleasant, boring. Thirty minutes too long.
","I want to start by listing 2013 movies that are better than this film: White House Down. The Lone Ranger. Olympus Has Fallen. Cloud Atlas. Gravity. Frozen. Philomena. Saving Mr Banks. The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. Prisoners. The Great Beauty. Thor The Dark World. Pacific Rim. Star Trek Into Darkness. Rush. Her. Captain Phillips. The World's End. Elysium. The Hunger Games Catching Fire. Man Of Steel. The Great Gatsby. Iron Man 3. World War Z. Jack The Giant Slayer. American Hustle. The Purge. Fast And Furious 6. Insidious Chapter 2. RED 2. Now You See Me. Dallas Buyers Club. Monsters University. The Hobbit The Desolation Of Smaug. 12 Years A Slave. Carrie. The Conjuring. Kick-Ass 2. Is that everything? Are you sure? Zero Dark Thirty is an account of the 10 year manhunt for Osama Bin Laden so it covers a major topic, but sadly fails to do it any justice. Critics may have been raving about it, but some things can't be explained. This is a terrible movie which aside from some good performances bringing the characters (sorry, robots) to life, this has little to recommend it.This movie is very badly edited, and is literally just a collection of clips and events pasted together with the skill and art of a 3 year olds paper collage. There's no backstory or emotional depth whatsoever, it is simply a re-enactment. I could excuse that if it was well directed but it really isn't. None of the shots contain any meaning or emotional power, and the script is one of the worst I listened to in all of 2013. ZDT is more robotic than a Terminator, and it's far too long. It's hollow and totally un-enjoyable and something no-one should ever watch more than once. Kathryn Bigelow clearly can direct, but here she doesn't even really direct the film. The first 2 hours are repetitive, boring and unpleasant, with the first 40 minutes being a man getting tortured. The attack on the compound is not tense and is nothing more than cross cutting between night vision shots of other dark shots. I wasted an entire afternoon on this, and this really is an awful film which didn't deserve the critical acclaim it got. If you thought Avatar was overrated, wait until you see this.2/10",2,4,8,4 May 2014
Love Actually," A great display of Richard Curtis feel good rom com heaven- although there is such a thing as too much of a good thing
","Richard Curtis, one of Britain's most successful screenwriters, turns his hand to directing and virtually every successful British A list actor falls in love in Love Actually, a rom com of epic proportions. 10 stories unfold across the film in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with a one month later epilogue. Love Actually starts off superbly but then fails to sustain itself across its full 2 hour runtime. The cast charms throughout, with Liam Neeson giving a touching and likable performance far away from his recent action typecast role and Bill Nighy stealing the show as an aging rock star. The film is sweeter than a box of Lindt chocolate and often feels like an extended sugar rush. It's sentimental, but its' difficult not to be genuinely charmed by it. Richard Curtis, with his razor sharp humour and wonderfully British writing, gives us laughs galore, and for the first hour the film is more often than not hysterical. Although the movie devolves as it goes along, it remains funny throughout, and Curtis proves himself a good director as well.The problem with Curtis is that his films are feel good, but they don't offer enough conflict and can just feel like syrupy fantasies. Without actors like Hugh Grant, these romances might not work at all. The stories in LA don't have enough conflict and at times I found myself wondering where it was headed, as the film's only real message, love is all around, is one we've all heard hundreds of times before. It's quite sweet and there is one effective sad scene in the second half of the movie, but overall the emotional grip slackens as it all just gets a bit too much in terms of the sentimentality. Since it's all fantasy, it doesn't always feel that romantic. With good direction, an irresistible sense of charm, strong acting and Richard Curtis' sharp humour complete with his typical fine use of profanity, LA is an entertaining and likable rom com with admirable ambition, but on the storytelling side there are definite shortcomings. The Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth and Kris Marshall story lines should perhaps have made up the film with the other story lines (Which either don't go anywhere or are just a bit weaker) dropped.7/10",7,0,1,30 March 2015
12 Years a Slave," Difficult to watch but worth the effort
","12 Years A Slave tells the story of a free black man who was sold into slavery and remained a slave for 12 years before a chance encounter freed him. I love going to the cinema and in general it's a happy experience but this is easily the most depressing trip to the cinema I've ever had. 12YAS, which is in many ways even more depressing than Schindler's List, is a relentlessly unflinching and harrowing look at slavery which is crafted with great skill and brilliantly acted. Perhaps it is Oscar bait, but it genuinely deserved the awards attention it got. It's not a masterpiece or an all time classic though. It's slow and long, and there are various times when nothing is really happening and those scenes feel pointless as a result. Overall, it is a worthy film on a very depressing but important and rarely explored in cinema topic that gets most stuff right. Steve McQueen used to be an artist and it shows as his direction is excellent with a lot of stunning cinematography and effective long takes.The acting is great, with all of the actors delivering loads of emotional power with only facial expressions. Although Chiwetel Ejofor and Michael Fassbender are great, Lupita Nyong'o steals the show and very deservedly won the best supporting actress Oscar. The script doesn't veer into pointless sentimentality and stays true to the source material. Although dull at times, 12YAS remains disturbing and brutally honest throughout. I wouldn't be able to face a second viewing, but I'm very glad I got the chance to see it. The ending is genuinely tear jerking and while it may have several viewers in tears, its tear jerking moments feels genuine and truthful. In many ways Gravity and Her were better movies and this may not be seen as a great classic in future but unlike other Oscar nominated films (Crash, Zero Dark Thirty I'm looking at you) this takes an important subject and actually turns it into excellent filmmaking instead of just delivering a message in a bland and manipulative way. Just don't expect any rays of sunshine. At all.9/10",9,0,1,12 October 2014
Sausage Party," What just happened?
","I do not know what to say or think. Crude sex jokes. Endless profanity. Violence. Drugs. Movie references. Nazi jokes. Racial stereotypes. Anti-religion metaphors. Vulgarity. And most memorably of all, a food orgy. Those are the elements that make up this shocking animated movie, where supermarket food items discover that humans aren't gods taking them to the 'Great Beyond', but are actually going to eat them. This one features a huge amount of swearing, tones of puerile and offensive jokes and it's by a studio and director best known for making Thomas the Tank Engine. You have to see this one. Sausage Party works well in some ways but not in others. It's a very clever and thought- provoking film, and its metaphors and social commentary are shockingly clever. The trouble is... it's not actually that funny. Essentially, it's like a group of 5 year olds saying rude words to make each other laugh. It's far too reliant on crude dialogue and sexual jokes, and it sags massively in the middle. However, the storyline remains interesting even if it's not that funny, and the food orgy at the end is something you will never forget. Someone in my screening said out loud 'That is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life'. That should be a fairly standard reaction to this film. It's nuts. It's uneven. It's bonkers. It's definitely one to watch, to see for yourself what you think. Even if you don't like it, you won't forget it. 6/10",6,2,5,7 September 2016
Man on Fire," A punchy, intense thriller that unfortunately wastes a fair amount of its potential
","Denzel Washington is a troubled hit-man who gradually becomes friends with the young girl who he's acting as a bodyguard for. When she's kidnapped, he literally goes around killing everyone who might have been involved to find the truth. Man on Fire, from the underrated Tony Scott, is a film of two halves. In the first half, Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (The girl he's looking after) form a friendship and it's touching and well played. Dakota Fanning is excellent, while Denzel Washington once again proves a master of providing compelling performances without being hammy and loud. This has some well handled character development and Washington is a character we can get behind and sympathise with. Then, Fanning gets kidnapped and the film becomes an over the top, hard hitting, brutal revenge film which is good enough, but lacks the emotional dimensions of the first half. The first half is more interesting, even though Denzel is moderately calm and it doesn't involve him killing everyone. However, isn't Denzel going into full on badass mode the premise of the movie? Thus, MOF fails to deliver on the promise of the premise.To its credit, MOF is more emotional than many films of its type. The script is decent enough, although it lacks charisma. Throughout MOF never reaches its full potential. At first, it has some dull moments but then later on it goes overboard. Tony Scott was a good director, and he directs the film well some of the time, but even when characters are just talking or nothing is happening, MOF still looks like it was filmed inside a rave. With indulgent shaky cam, random slow motion and crazy editing which often makes the film look like a terrible hip hop music video about clubbing, you may want to bring the painkillers since this might give you a headache. It works some of the time, but it can get pretty annoying. Combined with the lack of charisma in the script, the film never hits a peak or has a proper finale either so the action can feel a bit underwhelming. Still, its intensity, punchiness and acting is to be admired, although both the audiences and critics got it wrong. 39% on Rotten Tomatoes is too low, 7.8 on IMDb is too high. This is similar to The Equalizer, which also has Denzel Washington in vigilante mode and involves a precocious child actress. This is probably a better movie, but The Equalizer is more enjoyable.6/10",6,0,2,29 April 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," I didn't see this one coming
","Edge Of Tomorrow was looking like it was going to be one of 2014's big blockbuster flops. Tom Cruise (Not a fan) in what seemed to be the most generic movie ever made. Generic science fiction shoot em up meets Groundhog Day. Really? Yet it's a genuine must see blockbuster with Tom Cruise managing to not be boring for once. A cowardly soldier is stuck in a time loop and replays the same battle over and over again, trying to defeat an alien attack. Ironically, despite being about a time loop, it never feels repetitive and is fun and inventive throughout. It's a bit long, the ending although still great fun feels more generic and at first the film appears to be about to fulfil the expectations of pretty much everyone but aside from that this box office smashing triumph is one of the best blockbusters in a year full of quality science fiction epics. Alongside the better than usual Tom Cruise is Emily Blunt, who's excellent and an awesome action heroine, while none of the other actors fall flat.Doug Liman proves himself very capable of handling a big budget blockbuster and the action sequences are suspenseful, well crafted and full of believable special effects. The script sparkles with wit and intelligence and while not deep the film is a very entertaining and subtle commentary on the repetitive nature of most blockbusters and how almost all of them are like video games. It repeats itself with the battle, but it's not a repetitive movie otherwise and actually goes in many different directions. Although the Paris finale isn't as inventive as the rest of the movie it's still fun and it's got so much more soul and swagger than anyone would have predicted. This is likely to either be in my 2014 top ten or be an honourable mention. I recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of movies as it doesn't actually feel like a video game at all and leaves The Amazing Spider-Man 2 cowering in its shadow. An awesome science fiction movie overall, and one I would be happy to rewatch despite its over length.8/10",8,2,4,3 November 2014
Whiplash," A haunting and claustrophobic musical drama more intense than any modern horror film
","In Whiplash, an aspiring drummer faces a music teacher who echoes Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. Throughout this powerful, punchy drama, the student tries to succeed while his brutal teacher terrifies him- and us- and tries to drive him to victory in the most damaging way possible. An awards season favourite, Whiplash boasts many fine qualities which will see it take home at least one award come Oscar night. Miles Teller shows vulnerability, character depth and determination as the main character, although his performance is overshadowed by J.K. Simmons as Terrence Fletcher, probably the Margaret White of music teachers. Fletcher is a very frightening character and is the antagonist of the film, but he is given depth and motivation as well. Whiplash deserved a best director nomination, and the editing and cinematography are intense and electrifying, matching the rhythm of the drum sticks beating furiously upon the drum throughout the film.The script dissects its characters and rounds them well, and neither the protagonist nor the antagonist are two dimensional. Whiplash has its problems though. J.K. Simmons is being tipped as a favourite to win the Oscar, but all he really does is shout most of the time, so he shouldn't win. Andrew, the main character, is not a very interesting character at first and while he evolves later, he never becomes someone we particularly care about. Whiplash is a claustrophobic experience as it's so ferocious, and this means it can be unpleasant to watch. Also, with a lack of anything genuinely uplifting, Whiplash is a ugly at times and is an overly depressing examination of the search for greatness. It's not a film I will rewatch, but it deserves its praise and for anyone interested in music it's a good film to watch. It's not the masterpiece many have said it is and doesn't beat the likes of Birdman, Boyhood and The Imitation Game, but it's worth seeing in the cinema and overall a unique look at ambition and pupil-teacher relationships.8/10",6,0,2,21 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A flawed but marvelous explosion of incredible insanity
","The Wolf Of Wall Street will be loved by some while others will be absolutely mortified. I'm more in the former direction. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fantastically appalling stockbroker who lives the high life thanks to making millions illegally, but soon the authorities become aware of his illegal activities. Divisive but acclaimed overall, TWOWS, with its depictions of swearing, greed, sex, drug use, moral corruption and bad behaviour does not know the art of taste or the art of subtlety, but if you can look past its lack of taste, it's a relentless, ruthlessly effective and devilishly demented black comedy which is less a movie, more a machine gun helicopter blasting its way through every tasteful movie studio around. Disregarding a short running time, a restraint on unnecessary scenes and examinations of the consequences maybe wasn't the best idea, but this is overall a slightly brilliant movie which, as a cinematic whole, has got it all. People may forget how brilliantly made it is.TWOWS is quite blatantly the work of a master. With every frame exploding with cinematic skill and precision, this movie looks amazing and there's not an arbitrary shot to be found. In terms of scripting, despite having over 500 uses of the F word it never feels gratuitous, and with amazing dark humour, clever character development and badass lines galore the screenplay refuses to be boxed in. Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better on screen, while Jonah Hill makes it pretty obvious he is destined to win an Oscar at some point. Matthew McConaughey is only in it for 10 minutes, but he makes a huge impact. There isn't really a solitary bad performance here. It dips after the halfway point before finding its feet again, and there are many scenes which aren't necessary and feel like they're prolonging the film for the sake of having an obnoxious length, which means the delirious heights the film sometimes reaches are never sustained for long enough. Even so, this is one of 2013's finest and deserved the Oscar nods.8/10",8,2,5,5 January 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A highly entertaining and sadly panned comedy from the Coen brothers
","A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s tries to recover a leading star after a kidnapping. Of course, this is the Coen brothers so things won't be that straight-forward. Sadly, audiences seem to have responded really badly to this. The main reaction seems to have been what Ralph Fiennes and Alden Ehrenreich say repeatedly in one of the film's most hilarious scenes (And the scene which formed the basis for my favourite trailer of any 2016 film): 'Would that it were so simple?'. Hail, Caesar! is a complicated movie which goes in many unexpected directions and most of the actors featured prominently in the trailers only have cameos. Admittedly, HC is a somewhat incoherent movie and there are moments where the pace slackens. But it's still a genuinely good movie. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is very pleasing without being overly flashy and the script is full of clever humour and wonderful Hollywood homages. Like always with the Coen brothers it's never superficial and there's plenty of hidden depth beneath the surface here. It's a very enjoyable, light-hearted and fun movie which I enjoyed and everyone who I went to see it with enjoyed it as well. It may not be your sort of thing, but if you know what you're getting and if the film's admittedly self-indulgent nature doesn't bother you too much you're in for a fun time.8/10",8,1,2,26 March 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A good but not great end to the Middle Earth saga
","It's been emotional. After 6 films, we presumably leave Middle Earth for good. However, while The Lord Of The Rings is the best trilogy of all time, after 3 exhausting prequels I think that's for the best. The first Hobbit film is a long slog punctuated by some exciting adventure sequences, while the second overcompensates with loads of big set pieces. This one is half character study, half epic battle. I'm not the biggest fan of the Hobbit films although I respect certain aspects of them. Battle Of The Five Armies is a good conclusion, although the second film is better. It's still too long and suffers from pacing problems, likely as a result of the blatant padding out of the source material. While the drama in the original trilogy felt well rounded and real, here some of the dramatic stuff such as Thorin's character arc is only powerful some of the time, while at other times feels constructed from clichés. There is definitely a sense that 2 films would have been absolutely fine.BATFA is weighed down by a going the motions script, but some of the character deaths are still emotional. Special effects are mind blowing as usual, and few can film chaotic fantasy action as well as Peter Jackson. The film is desperate to get to the event of the title, but it delivers on the orc smashing, barn storming, scenery destroying, blazing battle we were all expecting. Other elements are neglected, but that doesn't harm the film. It finds just enough emotion to anchor the sweeping spectacle, and therefore this tale is an emotional one as well as a thrilling one. It's a poignant farewell to Middle Earth, and this time at least it doesn't take 45 minutes to end. The first half is slightly slow, but the second half delivers on the promise of the story. A good send off overall, though not a great one. The acting also elevates it. Ian McKellen isn't as striking as he was before, but Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman are great and Orlando Bloom manages to get away with his lack of acting ability. Despite its flaws, BATFA ends the trilogy on a high note.7/10",7,2,6,22 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Best film of 2014
","Birdman's plot synopsis, an ageing film star who once was successful in a comic book movie franchise launches a Broadway show in a desperate bid to reclaim his glory and save himself, makes it sound insignificant and dull. It's anything but. It satirizes, critiques and comments on so many things; family, the media, blockbusters, film criticism, egos, fame, celebrity culture and showbiz in general. It's filmed to look like one continuous take and has an amazing ensemble cast. In general, Birdman is the greatest film of the year (Sorry Boyhood) and a masterpiece so captivating I was lying stunned and open mouthed in my seat for the whole thing. There are very few issues, aside from the fact some may find it a bit weird, and this amazing superhero movie which isn't a superhero movie is a devastating, deliriously entertaining knockout blow which has more strength than all the heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe combined. Instead of cartoony villains, boring love stories, explosions and general idiocy this is a reminder of how great films can be, and a reminder of why all these actors are successful.Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and even Zach Galifianakis are all exceptional in their roles, and Michael Keaton makes a remarkable comeback. It's amazingly well directed, and the single shot cinematography works remarkably well. The script is not only deep and clever, it's also darkly comic and bursting with raw energy. This is a darkly funny movie. It's a emotionally powerful movie. It's a thrilling and relentlessly fascinating movie. It's a hypnotic and enigmatic movie. It really has it all. This is probably too different to win best picture, but it should certainly be nominated for it. In general, this is a remarkable achievement for everyone involved and a nice break from the formulaic Marvel movies that seem to come out at least twice every year. It will speak to and entertain many people, and there's so much depth and ingenuity in this movie that I cannot wait to see it again on DVD. A must see for everyone. To be honest, a review and description doesn't really do this highly unusual and bold film justice. Just see it.10/10",10,3,9,30 December 2014
Raging Bull," Scorsese's magnum opus
","Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors to ever stand behind a camera. Every frame of his movies shows a cinematic master firing on all cylinders. Of course, his many wonderful movies aren't perfect. Hugo and Taxi Driver are a bit too slow, Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street go on a little bit and Goodfellas is a bit meandering, although all of those movies are very fine. Raging Bull is the one where nearly everything is perfect; a devastating, rage fuelled, borderline harrowing meditation on masculinity, inner demons and jealousy. It may look like a film about boxing, but it's really a character study showing Jake La Motta's battling his inner demons in the ring instead of his opponents. Although, it should be noted the fight scenes might be the greatest combat scenes I've ever seen in a film. Shot in black and white, Scorsese edits and directs RB to haunting perfection. Scorsese expected it to be his last major film and put a lot of effort into it. The result is his masterpiece.Robert De Niro has likely never been better than he is here. He may rarely give genuinely good performances now and inexplicably decides to be in things like Little Fockers, but here he lives and breathes Jake La Motta. His performance is one of the deepest and most enthralling performances I've ever seen from any actor, and he deserved that Oscar. Everyone else in the film is great as well. As a screenplay, few are so powerful and intelligent. The best metaphor for watching the film lies within the film itself. The hard hitting boxing scenes which have to be seen to be believed sum up the film pretty effectively. It's a heavy, brutal and relentless assault on the viewer, and as a result isn't the easiest movie to watch, but it's very much worth the effort. If there was a better movie made during the 80s I would be very surprised. Overall, a masterpiece and something every film fan should see. Goodfellas may be higher on the IMDb Top 250 but this is Scorsese's best film.10/10",10,1,2,6 January 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," 2 hours of nothing
","Fifty Shades of Grey was always going to be terrible. Unsurprisingly, it is terrible, yet it could have been worse. In contrast to Bella Swan (FSOG originated as Twilight fan fiction), the heroine may not be a brilliantly written character but Dakota Johnson does an unexpectedly good job. Sam Taylor-Johnson directs the movie well and the cinematography has a certain style to it. The soundtrack isn't the worst either. But don't think for a moment I'm defending this. It's not the utter, complete, irredeemable failure it may have been, but it's still a failure. Slow, airless, boring, plot free and devoid of any compelling narrative arc, it's difficult to see a point to this movie. The sex scenes, surely? Well, they don't take up that much of the film and much of it is... nothing really. There's no chemistry between the lead actors and Jamie Dornan gives a wooden, charisma free performance. Plus, it's in many ways a fairly tasteless and sexist film with many highly uncomfortable moments.So, the question still remains. What is this? Is it a porn movie? Well, no since the sex scenes don't take up that much of the film and they're not as strong as many were evidently hoping. Is it a character study? Well, some more character depth would have been appreciated. Despite the occasional interesting lines, mostly the characters are two dimensional so no. Is it a romantic drama? It's about as romantic as a torture porn horror film due to its lack of passion and emotion so definitely not. Is it an erotic thriller? Well, if you want thrills you won't get a single one, while it's really not that erotic, so again no. It doesn't even have a proper ending. It doesn't feel complete, it's outrageously, obscenely overlong at 2 hours and in general it's just a total bore. That's what FSOG is. A bore. Now we have 2 sequels to look forward to despite the fact that if you reduced the movie to its amount of actual story it'd be 15 minutes long. Overall, a dud although at least it's not as bad as Terminator Genesys.4/10",4,2,4,10 January 2016
Mother!," Well... that was interesting
","Mother! is... what is it exactly? That's the question. It's basically an allegory, so one could argue none of the film's events are real. It's nothing like anything Hollywood has put out in the last... well, have they ever done this? I won't say anything about the plot; all I will say is that if you're expecting a home invasion horror film... denied! This is a singular artistic vision from Darren Aronofsky, boasting dazzling close-up based cinematography, incredible acting (Though Javier Bardem's character felt a bit underwritten and wasn't the best use of his talents), thought- provoking themes and utterly bonkers storytelling throughout. I won't lie; it's often tedious, highly self-indulgent, completely ridiculous and not always massively enjoyable. But do you know what? That's fine. I quite like Mother. It's an intelligent, sometimes powerful and clever (To some extent) allegory, although the limited nature of its narrative would make a second viewing somewhat unappealing. It might not be enjoyable, but it is certainly very well-made and I think that if you go in knowing what to expect, you'll be able to appreciate this more. It's got enough visual dazzle and Jennifer Lawrence's usual awesomeness to keep the film afloat. It's also got one of the most messed-up scenes in any recent mainstream American movie... so there's that. 6/10",7,1,7,6 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I told you so
","I firmly believed Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice would be rubbish throughout the last couple of years. And I was right. Rather than trying to be a good superhero movie, this is pretty much an extended trailer for the DC Cinematic Universe. Hollywood evidently hasn't learnt anything at all from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or Iron Man 2. In this movie, Batman takes on Superman as he disagrees with his actions, while Lex Luthor is also involved with some complicated scheme. Oh, and Wonder Woman's in there as well. She doesn't add anything to the movie to be honest. To be fair to BVS, it's not a complete disaster. The opening scene is pretty good, Ben Affleck proves the whole Batfleck controversy was a wildly unnecessary backlash with a mature, suitably understated performance and as can be expected from Zack Snyder it looks amazing. While admittedly the film does start to feel artificial at times, it does at least look amazing. In terms of acting, Jeremy Irons steals the show as Alfred. The trouble is, BVS is a mess of titanic proportions. Multiple underdeveloped, rushed elements clash together like a hyperactive prison riot and as a result the narrative is largely incoherent. The story is poorly structured, boring, makes no sense and most of the film was given away in the trailers. This is one painfully superficial movie, since it has so much going on there just isn't any depth. It may think it's serious, dark and powerful but sadly BVS is about as sophisticated and powerful as a Flash Beat 'em Up game and makes a mess out of a killer premise. Still, that's what I was expecting from the start.4/10",4,6,12,3 April 2016
The Emperor's New Groove," Light hearted Disney fun
","In The Emperor's New Groove, an emperor is turned into a llama by his evil ex administrator and works with a llama herder to get his throne back. Certainly not the most ambitious or sophisticated of animated films, TENG is a light heated buddy comedy which runs on comic gags and energetic jokes. In terms of entertainment level it hits the mark. The animation looks good and visually the film works well, but what makes it work is the humour. The film often resembles an automatic joke dispenser as the inventive, witty and biting gags never stop flowing and the film maintains a very good pace throughout. 90 minutes was definitely the right length for the movie and it manages not to run out of steam. Another fun thing about the film is how it is timeless since it's set in the past but features many modern elements. The script oozes with laughs and is amusingly meta, with the emperor providing some amusing narration throughout the film.There are problems with TENG though. The buddy relationship at the centre of the film is cliché, predictable and rushed, while the emperor himself is a pretty unlikable character. There are dips here and there, the consistently zany and funny atmosphere means tension falls by the wayside. Ultimately, this is never more than light entertainment although that isn't ultimately a problem even if it means you're unlikely to remember the film as much as some other Disney movies. With it's entertainingly over the top set pieces and fittingly silly tone, this will entertain many kids and some but not all of the adults. Disney just strip the story down to the comedy and entertainment here and it mostly works. An entertaining movie for the whole family to watch together, TENG hits the comedy notes with skill and is a good time. It's not a lot more than that but it is a jolly good time.7/10",7,0,1,19 July 2015
Signs," Despite the backlash, M Night Shyamalan's last good film still holds up
","Before the days of a 19th century village doing their best Kristen Stewart impersonations, bizarre self indulgent bedtime stories, Mark Wahlberg talking to plants, air karate and planet nepotism, Shyamalan made 3 strong genre efforts which took genres (Ghost story, superhero, alien invasion) known for thrills and turned them into quieter, deft character pieces. It's the same with Signs. This is the last time he made a good film, although it's not as good as Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense. Signs has received some backlash following its release, but it's a flawed yet interesting work overall. It's an alien invasion seen through the eyes of a family who lives on a farm, and there are various Religious themes as well which make the story deeper than it would otherwise have been. Shyamalan's script has its ups and downs. There are some silly and awkward lines which provoke face palms while other parts of the script are more interesting. The performances are mostly OK, and Mel Gibson just about pulls it off.The film is less credible since it has a plot hole big enough to fly a UFO through: Why do aliens who are susceptible to water come to a planet where two thirds of it are lethal to them? This certainly lets the film down combined with the uneven script and lack of action, which can feel slightly disappointing. Shyamalan pretty much ditches a finale and the thrilling moments and small scale. This is a good thing overall, but a little more of a climax wouldn't have hurt. However, the Religious elements will divide people but for me they added unforeseen emotion to the storyline, and the film oozes suspense in every frame. With astonishing visuals and cinematography, the film certainly looks great and even if the suspense doesn't amount to all that much, the way it is maintained throughout the film is pretty extraordinary. It doesn't have the best storyline ever, but it's a memorable alien invasion flick a definitely worth a look. Any alien attack film which is brave enough to avoid a massive shoot out space battle deserves credit.7/10",7,2,3,13 December 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Possibly the most likable film of 2013
","Saving Mr Banks is the true story of Walt Disney trying to persuade PL Travers to let him adapt Mary Poppins for the big screen. Although we all know how the story's going to end, this is one of those films where disliking it is nearly impossible. Aside from the excessive runtime, what's not to like? The Academy snubbed SMB, but it really shouldn't have been snubbed while American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club got so many nominations. Emma Thompson should have been nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Travers, which is one of the best performances from any actress in 2013. Both hilarious and heartfelt, she absolutely owns the film. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney isn't quite as noticeable, but is still excellent. All the other actors are good as well, with a surprisingly moving performance from Colin Farrell. SMB is told with 2 timelines, one a series of flashbacks, unfolding simultaneously. This doesn't get in the way of the film overall and the flashbacks are timed well so as not to break the flow.SMB may not be full of dancing animals, syrup, endless singing, one dimensional love stories and overloads of colour but it's one of the most delightful movies Disney has ever made. It's a very funny film with loads of sharp dialogue and plenty of wit, and it's well directed by John Lee Hancock, but it's also a very moving film. Both a true story rendered in touching and hilarious fashion and a thought provoking examination of where authors get their ideas from, SMB is a wonderful film and nearly surreally enjoyable. And there's not an explosion or action sequence in sight. It'll make you laugh and quite possibly cry as well. A wonderfully uplifting movie, SMB may be seen as slight and sentimental by some, but in terms of moving and entertaining dramas there aren't many better alternatives. You don't even have to like Disney to enjoy this delightful crowd pleaser.9/10",9,0,2,11 December 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Certainly far from a Marvel
","This movie sucks. It's a shame as I quite like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and they've been consistent, but now the cracks are starting to show. There are only so many times we can see the same formula over and over again. This time, Thor deals with an alien invasion of earth and various other bland things happen. Thor The Dark World is a sequel to Thor, which wasn't a terrible film with its humour and character development, but it was a blockbuster built from anti-climaxes which devolved as it went along. This one is definitely worse and its contending with Iron Man 2 for the worst Marvel film to date. This is well acted up to a point, as Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins remain excellent. As usual, as an obscene amount of money is spent on these Marvel films, the special effects are excellent and you get the usual Marvel thrills and laughs, although in a more subdued way than normal. In a nutshell, TTDW is the Marvel formula done with far less effort.Another thing this suffers from are annoying human characters. Why on earth is an Oscar winner like Natalie Portman playing such a bland comic book girlfriend? None of the other characters are much fun either. It has a laughably bad villain who is some dark elf alien who not even Christopher Eccleston to make interesting. The action sequences are cardboard and lack any real dimension. They're just the same old stuff; plus haven't we seen enough of London getting destroyed in 2013 movies? In general, you don't feel most of the thrills and jokes and the story just goes the motions by half heartedly dumping crowd pleasing stuff such as jokes, fight scenes and special effects in there. When on earth, we get loads of annoying humans and when in space the film feels like a video game. TTDW isn't even a movie. It's a manufactured factory product coming off an assembly line, made purely for Marvel fanboys and Marvel fanboys alone. Lifeless and lacklustre, this effortless sequel takes the MCU to dark new places.4/10",4,0,1,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," They did it
","Star Wars is the best fictional universe ever created, and even when you're watching the prequels that galaxy far, far away is a place you never want to leave. JJ Abrams directs Episode VII The Force Awakens, which is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi and involves the characters of the original trilogy combined with some new, equally compelling leads. It's doubtful any film has ever had so much hype attached to it and TFA being a dud would have been... I don't even want to think about it. So, was it alright? The answer to that is it was far, far better than alright. TFA is fantastic. It's a wonderful escapist space opera rooted in nostalgia and crafted with emotion, care and art. This leaves the prequels in the dust (That's just putting it nicely) and, filled with epic space action, humour, compelling characters, science fiction wizardry and most importantly of all, heart, the force is stronger with this one than it was with Master Yoda. TFC is a thrilling tale of good vs. evil, a powerful drama, a love letter to Star Wars fans, but above all it's a thrilling, emotional, unbelievably satisfying journey like no other.It's inevitably not a perfect movie. The villains' motives aren't explained properly, how the galaxy has changed between Return of the Jedi and TFA isn't developed enough and there is at times a feeling of just whizzing through too many different scenes. It also feels like a remake of A New Hope at times, but ultimately it's an intensely enjoyable experience. It's a very well acted movie with both the old and new leads giving strong performances. Backing them up is a new adorable droid and a very strong new villain. The action sequences are stunning, the lightsabre duel is not only thrilling but full of character drama while the special effects look great. This is in stark contrast to the prequels, where actors were cardboard cut-outs moving across green-screens. It's not only a thrilling and funny movie, it's an emotional one as well with perhaps the best script the franchise has ever seen. To sum up, JJ Abrams and co did it. They created a satisfying, nostalgic and euphoric return to everyone's favourite galaxy which is simply pure joy, and to be honest the film, thanks to its nostalgia, soul, skill and the way in which it lives up to the biggest hype machine of all time is pure blockbuster heaven.9/10",9,4,25,19 December 2015
Final Destination," My guilty pleasure
","Final Destination is one of the only badly reviewed films I like, and among with its sequels it is my guilty pleasure. It concerns a student who foresees a plane crash and gets himself and 6 others off the plane, before a month later death starts coming after them in freak accidents and they have to work out how to stop death. That might be the best horror movie premise ever, and while the final product is a mixed bag it's never boring. Final Destination doesn't care about those who aren't horror fans and therefore some of the most important film elements such as acting and writing are neglected. In terms of acting, Devon Sawa gives one of the best performances of the series; Tony Todd steals the show as the creepy mortician and Sean William Scott adds some comic relief to the film but many of the other performances certainly aren't stellar. The script is the most developed and character driven of the franchise, but it's still not a great screenplay. Despite it's amazing premise, FD doesn't take the premise as far as it should and if it had done this it might have reduced the need for the now somewhat excessive stream of sequels.What people forget about FD is that despite not being scary (Then again, neither is Carrie or The Wicker Man but they're still fantastic) it is menacing, suspenseful, eerie and well directed. There is a sustained sense of intrigue throughout, and it holds up very well on multiple viewings. FD is not so much a film as a spooky, deliriously enjoyable and gleefully silly fun fair ghost train attraction, and it speeds through its eerie visuals, tense disaster sequences and Gothic thrills with admirable enthusiasm. Despite some less than great CGI, the plane crash is awesome, and the bus death scene is truly shocking and unexpected. The finale with Clear Rivers (Portrayed in an overly understated manner by Ali Larter) is also very tense, although the ending feels more routine. FD is a very fun horror film and I still hugely enjoy it although more as an enjoyable thrill ride rather than a work of actual quality. Check out the sequels (Except the dreadful fourth) for more gripping, ghoulish giggles.6/10",8,1,1,19 February 2014
The Purge," Total waste of potential
","The Purge has a great premise: One night a year all crime is legal and a family try to survive the night. There's plenty of opportunity for scary thrills and social commentary. This movie offers neither, since it's a total chicken and chickens out of actually doing anything interesting. This is a movie which devolves as it goes along, like Benjamin Button. It starts out well. Good premise, thought provoking set up, some tension and when a group of creepy villains show up at the house, you think you're in for some scary action. You're not. This is not a totally intolerable film and remains watchable throughout. It's such a great premise that it's difficult not to take some sort of interest in the movie. It's also too short and underdeveloped to do too much harm to anyone who sees it. It's not scary, but there's some very mild tension. The Purge just needed to be handled by a better writer and director. A higher budget than just $3 million dollars might not have hurt either.The main problem with TP is its lack of actual fear. The lighting's too dark to actually see anything properly and the direction is very flat. It often feels like hider in the house, and there's no real suspense. The moral dilemmas presented throughout the film aren't given enough attention and are solved with stupid writing. The script is another thing which lets it down. The characters are stupid, don't feel real and just aren't interesting. They also change their minds in very silly ways. The film is at first mildly suspenseful horror but towards the end degenerates into clichéd and numbing violence, which is the final proof that TP is in reality nothing special at all and something we've seen 50+ times before. A sequel was released this year mysteriously although apparently it was a bit better. A prequel is planned for next year. It looks like we're going to get a purge every year. Still, I'll take them over Paranormal Activity. To sum up: LAME.4/10",4,0,0,30 November 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A load of preposterous nonsense
","This 80s slasher flick follows a group of teenagers who are, as usual in slasher films, facing a terrifying killer. However, this is no ordinary villain. It's Freddy Krueger, who attacks them in their sleep. And as we all have to sleep sometimes, this is a very frightening idea. Sadly, the actual film fails to do it justice. Hailed as a terrifying horror classic, A Nightmare On Elm Street is anything but. It's not without its highlights. Robert Englund is a treat as Krueger and turns him into one of the more menacing horror movie monsters. The make up artist deserves praise as Kruger's appearance is horrifying and adds to the limited fear of the movie. The acting is good in a horror film for once (Look out for a pre fame Johnny Depp getting gruesomely dispatched in the film's most memorable death scene) and Wes Craven shows there is plenty of reason to call him the master of horror. His direction is overall pretty good and there are 3 genuinely startling moments (The fourth was spoiled by the trailer).The script is pretty lame and the dialogue is very boring. The dream sequences soon become repetitive and the film doesn't go as far as it could have done. It feels like it doesn't meet it's full potential. It's very irritating and totally ridiculous as the way the protagonist defeats Krueger is pretty lame. As usual, the killer inexplicably reappears and sets up a sequel. The main problem with ANOES is that it's not scary. It has some tense moments but it's not interested in tension or creepiness. What it is interested in is loads of fake blood, undeniably impressive special effects and nightmares. At times it feels like some laughably awful Halloween joke shop advert for fake blood and Halloween masks. It's not scary; it's just showing off how good its gore effects are and this is very off putting. Also, this is nasty, preposterous slasher fare with no real purpose. Cowering in the shadow of Halloween, Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Scream and even Child's Play, this is definitely not one of the horror genre's finer offerings.4/10",6,1,3,26 November 2014
Godzilla," A monster smash
","This seems to have divided people a lot. Some have found it to be entertaining monster mayhem while others have panned the human characters and lack of Godzilla. As for my opinion: Monster movies aren't just about smashing skyscrapers. They're meant to be intense and scary. Godzilla really does that, and it makes the monsters frightening. It also brings in some of the key themes of nuclear age commentary from the not great original. Godzilla is accidentally released due to nuclear testing and goes on the rampage, while 2 other monsters crush America at the same time. Some humans try to stop the destruction. While I disagree with many of the criticisms, it's true the humans leave a lot to be desired although to be fair so does the Japanese original. Bryan Cranston is the star of the show. He's excellent in the movie. So naturally they kill him off in the first act. The rest of the humans aren't very interesting. Aaron Taylor Johnson, despite his strong performance in Kick-Ass, plays a wooden leading man with less facial range than Godzilla who is so boring he feels like a parody of boring action heroes.The film doesn't show Godzilla much, but few have understood that that is a good thing. It makes the movie more intense and scarier. Gareth Edwards makes the transition from low budget to big budget with ease, and the movie is filled with stomping, romping monster movie mayhem. It's visually stunning and genuinely scary. The script isn't the worst ever, and it's a good monster movie storyline which pays tribute to the original while also bringing Godzilla into the 21st century. By the sound of it it's far better than Roland Emmerich's version from 1998. The movie forsakes fun for gritty thrills and this will divide people, but at least it actually felt scary and still delivered the sobering commentary on nuclear testing. It is incredibly rare that I would say this, but I prefer this version to the original since the original was anticlimactic but this version got bigger and better. Godzilla is a good movie which shows what monster movies are meant to be about yet people still criticize it for trying to be scary. What do filmmakers have to do to please the fans?8/10",8,4,7,15 November 2014
Heat," One of the best action films ever made
","I am a huge fan of action movies but they are often unaffecting and emotionally void. With Heat, this definitely isn't the case. I watched this out of interest because it was well regarded, on the IMDb top 250 and it sounded enjoyable but this story of a angst filled cop pursuing a skilled bank robber (Robert De Niro and Al Pacino- together on screen at last!) was thrilling, moving, complex and blew me away. This is one of those rare movies which is virtually flaw free. The length is a bit excessive but not a minute is wasted and the running time is full of blazing action set pieces containing one of the best shootouts of all time but the human drama is jaw dropping. Every single character is developed. The film is incredibly powerful, with the ending being genuinely tear jerking and frequent emotionally intense scenes, but what's the show stopper? 2 men having a cup of coffee.Pacino and De Niro are both amazing, while Michael Mann's cinematography and suspense scenes are mind blowing. The most confusing thing of all is why the academy didn't give this a single nomination. Even if you're not an action fan, this isn't really an action movie. It's a character study that happens to be about cops and robbers. Heat is a film so powerful yet thrilling the experience of watching it is slightly surreal and despite being almost 3 hours long it felt a lot shorter than that. Some of the characters are slightly cliché (Although developed ones) and the film could have been shorter, but it is the sort of movie which many other action directors (Michael Bay) won't be able to dream of living up to, and even though it's an action movie, it contains some of the best shootouts, character studies, LA visuals- and the best conversation over a cup of coffee- in the history of cinema.10/10",10,0,3,11 January 2014
Deadpool," Not as subversive as it looked, but thoroughly competent and often enjoyable
","Deadpool, one of the 2016's most hyped movies, follows a mercenary who is subjected to an experiment which turns him into a mutant with superpowers. Sounds like your everyday superhero movie, right? Well, no. As the rather brilliant marketing campaign never stopped repeating, this is not your average superhero movie. Swearing, sex, gore, adult humour and meta jokes add up to a very unique superhero movie which is not for kids. Deadpool is a victim of its overhyping, but it's a good time and at least a bit different from the usual superhero movies. It does have quite a few problems though. In many ways, the plot is generic and while some clichés are mocked, not all of them are. At times the film is too dark. At times the film- and the central character- are unbearably smug and insufferable. Many scenes just feel like the film trying to be as R rated as possible, and the adult nature of the film starts feeling like a gimmick as a result. Not all of the jokes hit, although quite a lot do, and it's pretty entertaining. It's not as different and unique as it looked, but it's still subversive and entertaining much of the time. It is funny, occasionally hilarious, the performances are strong and the visuals are very clever. Possibly the most subversive thing of all is that the romance actually works for once. It's probably not going to age too well and I think people will realize it's not deserving of it's ludicrously high placement on IMDb Top 250 on repeat viewings, but it's a decent enough movie with some very good lines.6/10",7,3,14,27 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," One of 2013's best and most overlooked films
","You probably didn't see this as while this underperformed at the box office, everyone else decided to go and see clichéd carbon copies which they have all seen 10 times before because no-one seems to want to be original anymore. Here however, this original and ground-breaking masterpiece emerges as the best movie of 2013 (Better than the best picture winner, 12 Years A Slave) and the 21st century's answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey. This takes 6 seemingly unconnected stories from different times and weaves them together into a tapestry of visual glory, emotional power, thrilling action and genuine humanity that will confuse and frustrate many, but it kicks the living daylights out of almost any other 2013 release. It might be one of the strangest viewing experiences you'll ever have as the film randomly cuts across the different narratives, different actors turn up in different make up and as different characters in the various story lines and all of the narratives seem almost unconnected. Yes the film is a marathon. Yes the film is baffling, indulgent, pretentious. But it is never, ever boring.The film, in the end, is about humankind and how the past shapes the future. Amidst all the action, humour and bizarre stories, the film has a genuine soul and a sense of humanity which helps keep it afloat, and as it goes on it becomes more and more powerful and you start to care about all of the characters. Whether the film is focussing on a dying sailor's friendship with a slave on a ship in the 1800s, a musician's struggle to compose his masterpiece, a journalist (Halle Berry doing maybe the only thing worthy of note she's done since Monster Ball) stopping a conspiracy at a nuclear power plant, a publisher trying to escape a nursing home, a clone becoming involved in a revolution in the far future or a post apocalyptic storyline with 2 people trying to find a remote communication station, the film is characterized by great acting especially from Jim Broadbent, fantastic direction, a moving script and a never-ending sense of humanity. Even if you don't get it, it'll still be a great cinematic experience for all and truth be told, some may even shed tears.10/10",10,4,7,31 January 2014
300," Brainless comic book movie fun
","300 follows King Leonidas as he leads 300 Spartan warriors in a battle against the Persians. As macho, loud and violent as the Spartan warriors at the centre of its story, 300 doesn't win points for subtlety or storytelling but succeeds as an entertaining spectacle that knows what it is and successfully washes out the traumatic memories of Meet the Spartans. 300, thanks to it being filmed on a digital back lot, inevitably feels artificial and video game like a lot of the time. Characterization is not the film's priority, although you do care about many of the characters and the characters seem to care about each other, so that underneath it all there seems to be human souls within the characters, which was a pleasant surprise. The 'This Is Sparta!' scene is rightfully legendary and various other good movie quotes are heard during the film. The ending works well although the beginning feels somewhat slow. The story isn't that interesting since it's very one note and only goes the way it does thanks to a pretty stupid decision.This is very much a blockbuster whose sole purpose is to entertain and give a good time. That it does, although it was likely better on the big screen. Visually it is undeniably a spectacle to behold and some of the fight sequences are brilliantly done. The film makes better use of slow motion than many films do and there are many memorable moments throughout the film. It doesn't follow a predictable plot and in general, it's a good time but not a lot more than that. I have no problems with movies just being a good time, although it should be noted that this is likely going to be pretty dull for many who aren't in its target audience. It has its dull moments and lacks the human touch that Sin City, which is similar to this, did although it boasts a good performance from Gerard Butler in the lead role. A good fantasy action film overall and worthy of its cult following. It's a good amount of fun although it never amounts to a lot more than that. Still, at least's it's memorable unlike many other films of its type.7/10",7,0,1,13 July 2015
Ran," Close to perfect
","Akira Kurosawa is one of my favourite directors and William Shakespeare is my favourite writer of all time. As can be expected, combining the two creates cinematic gold. This adaptation of King Lear relocates the play to Japan a few centuries later than the play is set. A powerful war lord abdicates to his 3 sons and 2 of them turn against him and betray him. Shakespeare films rarely capture his genius, but this one does and then some. It adds depth and complexity to an already fine play, and makes the central character arguably even more compelling than he was in Shakespeare's version. It makes some changes here and there, but it doesn't feel overly different from its source material. This isn't just an adaptation of the play; it's using the play to create a sobering, fantastically powerful and completely mesmerising meditation of loyalty, chaos and war. This is absolutely incredible cinema which shows why it is one of the most successful art forms in the world. This dazzling, earth shaking masterpiece outshines not only every single other Shakespeare adaptation but all the paintings in the Lourve combined.Akira Kurosawa's direction is near perfect: The film looks unbelievable and the battle sequences are absolutely tremendous. Every single shot looks amazing and it's definitely his most beautiful film. The acting is absolutely astonishing, and there are some particularly frightening characters in this one. It also has an incredible script; it's incredibly deep, hauntingly powerful and none of the dialogue feels forced or awkward. It's a fairly slow movie, but you don't even notice it. The final shot of the movie is utterly haunting. Ran is a very powerful and thrilling movie with amazing action scenes, mind blowing acting and a brilliant story. It's so ridiculously captivating and well made 2 and a half hours disappear like nothing. Definitely one of the best foreign language movies ever and even better than the film which put Kurosawa on the map, Rashomon. Films like Romeo + Juliet and O are good, but they can't possibly hope to match this, which is actually just as good as King Lear itself. At least they actually say what happened to the fool this time.10/10",10,0,2,4 December 2014
Cube," Complex but rewarding and under-appreciated horror movie
","A group of strangers are trapped in a giant maze made of cube shaped rooms with various deadly traps. They are trying to find their way out through the giant labyrinth of traps, riddles and twists which would make the makers of Saw jealous. The cube maze the characters are in represents this movie: Twisty, dense, complex and pretty darn confusing. This is a critically ignored movie which later gained a cult following and deservedly so. Like many B movies, it starts out shaky. Its characters leave you cold and it keeps repeating itself. It also has its various detours into generic B movie clichés which weaken the film and it goes from set piece to set piece without ever delivering a knockout punch. However, the film improves as it progresses. The characters become more developed, different layers are revealed and information is revealed in a structured and clever way. The set pieces get more and more heart in mouth and ultimately Cube gets as much as it can out of its generic but brilliant premise.A mature decision was to leave much of what goes on ambiguous and the film thankfully doesn't have a major reliance on gore. It does get rather claustrophobic although after a while we get used to the setting. Cube is one of those movies where you're in the trap for the whole thing, and no sighting of the outside world means it feels a bit more artificial but this adds to the tension at the same time. The acting improves as the film goes on and although the cast still seem to be unknown, they do a good job. The director doesn't seem to be too prolific which is a shame as there's clearly plenty of talent here. The script doesn't do anything special but it tells the story decently and spits out the many twists with admirable effort. Cube is not a great movie but it is a very interesting one and a likable albeit sadly obscure effort. If you ever get bored of watching Saw, this would definitely be a good alternative and it's good for anyone who likes puzzles. I doubt you'll be able to solve the puzzle in this movie though.7/10",7,1,2,26 October 2014
Fast Five," Unrestrained blockbuster fun
","I haven't watched the first four so this is my first F&F movie. I really like action movies and this did look pretty fun, so I decided just to start at the good bit. I have often heard people describe these movies as guilty pleasures but they shouldn't be. There is nothing embarrassing about liking this film or the sixth instalment. These are sleek, supreme, well executed thrill machines which know they're ridiculous and OTT and don't care at all. Ironically, that improves everything. By the sound of it, the others were just about car races, but this one is about Dominic Toretto and his hugely likable crew robbing a bank in Brazil. Dwayne Johnson in a career best performance is the agent who comes to Brazil to stop them. As one would expect, this couldn't care less about those who aren't action fans, and the length of 131 minutes is a bit much. The film does go on a bit, but it compensates with its nutty, jaw dropping, ballistic finale in which a safe is towed through the streets of Brazil.Dwayne Johnson is excellent, and his character easily overshadows Vin Diesel's deeply boring protagonist. The film contains the best 'One use of strong language' in a 12 ever, and the script is surprisingly good. It's humorous and genuinely fun, and the characters are all likable. Justin Lin, despite his evident lack of physics knowledge, shows himself to be a thoroughly able action director. Some set pieces work better than others (for example a car race in the middle of the film is well done while a train set piece is just a bit much) but the film nails the right tone throughout. It's got plenty of humour and never takes itself too seriously. This is just pure fun. No sentimentality. No cringe inducing love stories. Barely any exposition. Just pure, endless fun. This is the ultimate popcorn flick and is actually a bit different from other movies of its type as its set pieces are so OTT they are pretty much unforgettable. So yes it rudely ignores all of those who aren't already fans and yes it's too long and yes it suffers from the boring action hero problem that plagued the Bourne and Mission Impossible films, but who cares? It's fun. Sometimes that's all we need. Get some popcorn. Sit back. Enjoy. You'll be glad you did.8/10",8,2,3,16 March 2014
The Thin Red Line," Meandering and indulgent, but strangely moving and well made meditation on war
","Terence Malick returns after a 20 year absence. He goes into full philosopher mode with this complex, haunting war movie. A strong ensemble cast, many of who are given little to do, deal with the fight against the Japanese on the Pacific islands. They have many different arcs which are often left unsolved, ultimately adding up to a more universal portrait of the effects of war on both man and nature. If you don't like Malick, don't watch it. This is pretentious and indulgent filmmaking; when it wanders, and believe me it does wander, the film can feel lost and confused. It doesn't quite feel complete even though it's 3 hours long (A bit too long in my opinion) It's not to everyone's tastes and requires patience to appreciate. I didn't get it completely, but I still enjoyed it overall and despite the snail pace of The Tree Of Life, Malick crafts some pretty thrilling battle set pieces here which I wasn't expecting at all. This may be for very specific tastes, but it's a fine war poem to rival Wilfred Owen.Acting all around is good, even though most of the actors have little to do. The script feels confused in places, but it's well written and has a subtle e but genuine emotional power. Thankfully it's not just endless voiceovers this time. Malick's direction is excellent and the cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping, with beautiful image after beautiful image illuminating the screen. Despite how good Saving Private Ryan's cinematography was, this should have won the Oscar. It's got an interesting narrative and despite the absence of brutal combat and harrowing war sequences, it's a very anti war movie. The Thin Red Line is not as good as SPR and is too long, but it's a very interesting movie with great direction. Despite its complexity which ensures many viewers won't completely get it, there's still plenty of emotion and drama to speak to the audience. The film also has a fine soundtrack, with some great hymns from Melanesian choirs.8/10",8,4,6,18 December 2014
Spectre," It doesn't match Skyfall but Spectre is still an entertaining and thoroughly watchable entry
","It was always going to be difficult for this to match the hype. Not only does it follow the greatest Bond movie ever, Skyfall, it also features the return of Spectre after all these decades. So, how did Spectre do? It's a mixed bag but overall you won't be too disappointed. Bond, following a clue left behind by his late boss M, comes up against Spectre for the first time. This is an action spectacle that hops from set piece to set piece with a breather in between each one but basically Bond is either chasing someone or being chased throughout most of this. There's a very enjoyable car chase through Rome where Bond's fast and gadget ridden car blasts through the streets like a missile. That basically sums up the movie. The action in Spectre is tense, grand scale and epic with a fight scene on a train being a particular highlight. The opening sequence, which starts with a brilliant Touch of Evil style tracking crane shot, is excellent as well. Although the snow based action scene is less successful, overall this succeeds admirably as an action thriller.I do have several problems with Spectre. As the villains, both Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista are underused. By the way, yes Waltz is Blofeld but he doesn't make as much of an impact as he could have done thanks to limited screen time. Lea Seydoux is a passive Bond Girl who is only there to be kidnapped while Monica Belluci is barely in it at all. The song is fairly weak while the title sequence is just strange. It lacks the emotional depth of Daniel Craig's other Bond movies and simply rehashes themes from Skyfall except with far less depth. Still, at least it finally features gadgets and a bit of humour. Mr White's reappearance is well handled and Sam Mendes proves a strong director once again. Spectre is a tense and entertaining blockbuster that's certainly not one of the more memorable or important Bond outings but as the still excellent Daniel Craig seems to be wanting to move on, this is a good final Bond film for him. Better than Quantum of Solace but worse than Casino Royale and Skyfall.7/10",7,5,21,30 October 2015
Her," Weird and wonderful
","Her is about a man who starts a relationship with his artificial operating system which is designed to meet his every need. I know, I know, but don't let that put you off. It may have the weirdest relationship in movie history, yet it's also one of the most touching and compelling I have seen. Despite the fact one of the people in the relationship isn't there and is just a computer, it's still a soulful, moving tale well deserving of the best picture nomination. Not something you'll see everyday, Her is a superb, moving, smart and at times hysterical science fiction drama. It will be a bit too bizarre for some and that's fine, but get past the weirdness and you're in for a treat. Visually, the film looks great and has a fascinating colour palette. Spike Jonze directs the film beautifully and his screenplay is downright phenomenal. It's funny, daring, moving and the dialogue is both magnetic and electrifying.The film couldn't have worked without Scarlett Johansson's amazing voice acting, which makes the relationship feel believable and moving. Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent understated performance as the main character. It's never boring, although at times it's a bit uncomfortable so overall it was a film where I was more or less engaged every minute. It's a weird, surreal experience but one which both a moving study of loneliness and smart social commentary of modern technology. It's my favourite of the best picture nominees and likely to be the one people truly remember in future. I definitely want to see more Spike Jonze stuff and I feel it's a shame this is only his fourth film as he's clearly a very talented director. Her is a very clever and sophisticated drama, and you won't find anything else like this from 2013. A modern classic, and a strange, dazzling and unique trip that's absolutely worth taking.10/10",10,0,1,16 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," The film of the summer even though it's only just begun
","In a post apocalyptic world, Mad Max (Tom Hardy) helps Imperator Furiosa get 5 young women selected for breeding away from a brutal army, one of many settlements following the overall collapse of civilisation. Although this is my first Mad Max film that hasn't damaged my enjoyment of the film at all. Described as a 2 hour chase sequence, that it is, but it's a lot more than that. It may be a stunning, sensationally made action film with more destructive force than an armoured tank blasting through a power station and boast dazzling stunts, jaw dropping cinematography and break taking, bone rattling visceral thrills, but thankfully there is also a soul. While the film is called Mad Max Fury Road, the film belongs to Charlize Theron. Her strong, well rounded Furiosa is the main character in many ways, and the other female characters are strong as well. Tom Hardy is typically excellent, though fairly silent, as Max while Nicholas Hoult puts in a gleefully nutty performance as a villain who the film also gives an interesting story arc.On a visual level the film is impeccable and George Miller thankfully doesn't resort to shaky cam. The stunts are daring, the stakes are high, the explosions are beautiful and each set piece gets bigger and better than the last. The tension continues building right until the end, so in terms of thrills MMFR pulls out all the stops. The film creates a compelling cinematic world with many fascinating details, mind blowing production design and a glorious sense of insanity. Thanks to the films focus on character and story as well as action, one becomes emotionally wrapped up in the storyline and occasionally the film is even genuinely moving. For sure one to see on the big screen, MMFR is a grand tapestry of explosions, high octane thrills, humanity and post apocalyptic heaven which doesn't waste a dollar of its $150 million budget. Let's hope George Miller makes those 3 sequels Tom Hardy is signed on for as soon as possible. It'll be difficult to live up to this though.10/10",10,4,12,18 May 2015
Donnie Darko," It's a very mad world and not necessarily in a good way
","Donnie Darko is one of the biggest cult films of recent times and it really doesn't seem bothered about a coherent storyline. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a troubled teenager who keeps seeing a bunny man and has 28 days to save the world. Don't ask me to explain it any further. It's not meant to make sense. The film mixes horror, thriller, comedy, drama and science fiction with impressive skill and it is a well made movie. But it's not that well made. I didn't quite get the love for this movie. It's OK and nothing more in my opinion. I liked a few things about it, but it certainly wasn't enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhall gives an underrated and superb performance as the troubled titular character, while Richard Kelly does very well for a first time director and writer. The direction is quite good and the film's total refusal to stick to conventions and fit into one genre are to be admired. The film has a certain haunting quality to it, but if you think about it, all that happened in the whole story was that Donnie got crushed by a jet engine. That's it.The main issue I have is the plot. Many think it's smart, but in my opinion, it's a lazily put together genre mish mash with loads of ambiguities to try and cover up the fact that the film really isn't very smart. It's certainly a head scratcher, but the film didn't connect on an emotional level. The teen drama has it's touching moments, but aside from that it's totally a style over substance film. Random things which don't serve any real purpose keep getting put in for no real reason, and at the time the film feels like nothing more than a 90 minute music video to the undeniably brilliant theme song, 'Mad World'. It didn't really engage me, and it lacks heart and structure. It's definitely an interesting movie more than a particularly good one, and for some reason everyone thinks its the smartest cult film ever (That would probably be The Wicker Man) instead of saying that it's the pointless enigma that it is. If you do explain the film, there really isn't an interesting answer to the puzzle box that is Donnie Darko. Many say you have to watch this twice. I don't want to see it again.5/10",5,2,4,20 April 2014
Macbeth," A terrific Shakespeare adaptation
","Macbeth seems to have come and gone with little fanfare, but this is a rather excellent movie. It's a fairly faithful retelling of the play with Michael Fassbender as Macbeth and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. The most notable change is its unexpected side-lining of Lady Macbeth, and this is also its biggest mistake. Cotillard feels wasted as a result. The film excels the most with its depiction of Macbeth himself as a damaged warrior full of angst and grief. Thus, Macbeth is an unexpectedly sympathetic character in this version, which adds to the film's strength. It's perhaps not a film you'll want to see again. Brutal, rage filled and joyless, this is one hugely depressing movie and does get pretty harrowing at times. It's not a strikingly different adaptation like 1996's Romeo and Juliet. It's a faithful cinematic interpretation of the play which unleashes the full force of the play's emotion on the audience. There aren't many rays of sunshine here. This is full-on, ferocious stuff and this approach will put some viewers off.The lines are a bit too quiet at times, and can be difficult to understand. This is a problem, but the film leans heavily on its visuals to tell the story. And what visuals they are. Every frame is a painting here, and the cinematography is utterly mind blowing. As a piece of visual storytelling, it's brilliant. While it's pretty heavy, the film is effective and emotionally powerful, and it does convey the themes of its masterful source material. One to see on the big screen (Although this was box office bomb so sadly most won't), this is overall a very well constructed and executed adaptation. This interestingly seems to have divided people's opinions a lot. The film has a polarising quality, but I firmly see it as an excellent movie, and one of my favourite films of 2015. Easily one of the best cinema experiences I had all year, this is one brutally intense and powerful movie that isn't easy viewing, but does its source material proud and provides an amazing visual experience backed by excellent acting.9/10",9,0,2,3 February 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," Something's missing, but it's well plotted and is one of the few films that makes shaky cam art
","I was not impressed with The Bourne Identity. It's an emotionless and unfun movie with action sequences that inexplicably stop trying half way through. Interestingly, the film is set 2 years afterwards, with Bourne pursuing the people who framed him for a CIA operation gone wrong and it was almost 2 years before I could be bothered to watch the second one, so it's close to real time for me. The second film is a huge improvement, although still weak compared to Die Hard, James Bond and various other action films. What sets it apart is Paul Greengrass who may be the only director who truly turns hand-held cameras into an art form, and the film actually uses shaky cam properly. The influence of the Bourne films is unfortunate, as most action films don't necessarily know how to handle shaky filming and a darker tone, and sadly James Bond has suffered from the Bourne effect as well. This knows how to handle its elements and was the Bourne film I enjoyed the most.The plot is more interesting than normal with its themes of conspiracy and memory loss, while the set pieces seem fairly varied although there are too many chase sequences. The script is decent and in general it is a compelling action thriller with a pleasing sense of intensity and there is some sort of emotional centre in there as well. What lets it down? What lets it down is officially the worst action hero ever committed to film, who barely changes his facial expression once and has absolutely no personality. Although there's some emotion, the film can go on and it does occasionally feel like a compilation of chase sequences. I did enjoy it though and it's quite entertaining, and it's got punch for sure. I feel action films need to have humour usually to balance their ludicrousness and implausibility. The Bourne Supremacy, while not a great or especially memorable film and nowhere close to Captain Phillips or United 93, is a superior sequel and a diverting explosion of gritty, hand-held, intense blockbuster fun.7/10",7,0,1,18 October 2014
The Proposal," The reason why I don't watch rom coms
","The Proposal is one of the most clichéd and routine movie formulas in existence. A comically unlikable boss forces her assistant to marry her so that she can sort out a visa problem. This seems to be moderately popular and plenty of people seem to like it. Why?! Just why? Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds do have plenty of chemistry. They're good in the movie and although they don't seem to star in that many great movies perhaps they deserve to. It has mildly amusing moments involving dogs, getting fired and various awkward situations. It's not aimed at me at all, but the best films can be enjoyed even by those who aren't that bothered about that kind of movie. I hated this movie. I don't know quite why I hated it, I just hated it. The premise is awkward to begin with and seeing it get dragged out over 2 hours when it's better off for a skit on a comedy show is agony. The script is absolutely by the numbers and makes the film feel like a landfill of clichés, unoriginality, stereotypes, stock characters and formula.The direction is very routine and cinematically the film isn't interesting at all. It just doesn't have a lot of charm or brains, and it's so insistent on sticking to formula that you know every single thing that's going to happen 20 minutes before it does. It's just awkward situation after awkward situation but it's not funny it's just... awkward. This is an example of how stale romantic movies have become in recent times, although to its credit it's so formulaic and bland that means you don't need to watch any other romantic films as every single cliché in the book has been summarized in this. It isn't funny and it just feels annoying and the excess of awkwardness removes any real charm or surprises from the movie. Just don't bother with it if this isn't your sort of thing. If you don't like this sort of movie it'll be nightmare. Look at the poster. Watch the trailer. Read the back of the DVD cover. You've now seen the whole movie.3/10",3,4,5,30 November 2014
Alien: Covenant," Prometheus version 2
","Don't be fooled by Rotten Tomatoes. People just want to reassure themselves that this is better than Prometheus and we haven't been let down again. We have. This is just ridiculous. The Xenomorph is a movie monster. Do we need a massive franchise explaining its origins?! Even then, it seems these movies are just more and more pretentious and boring musings on Creators and Origins. Just like Prometheus, we've got dumb characters, a boring plot, no soul and a real lack of scares. This is just milking a franchise that started with a movie that wasn't even that great to begin with. Alien is a good movie, but it's just another creature feature with some iconic moments. This one looks great, has some interesting bits, covers some interesting themes and Michael Fassbender is outstanding, but it's a lazy, soulless cash grab that forgets to ever be genuinely scary and lacks the atmosphere of Alien and the non-stop, glorious thrills of Aliens. And people still call Ridley Scott one of the best directors ever, despite the fact he's made literally one great movie (Blade Runner) and a lot of terrible ones. Sadly, we'll soon be getting more of these wretched prequel movies and they'll continue to make money. Just please- at the very least make the next one scary!5/10",5,8,18,21 May 2017
Atonement," Deeply flawed but graceful adaptation of an admired novel
","In this war romance based on a critically acclaimed novel, a girl through a series of misunderstandings accuses her sister's lover of a crime he did not commit, and it subsequently changes all of their lives. Joe Wright directs, and Keira Knightly and James McAvoy star. Another successful movie from Working Title, Atonement is a unique and sometimes powerful drama with shortcomings which fail to justify the number of academy award nominations. It's a good film but it's over-hyped. The film's selling point is its visuals, which are exquisite. The dazzling cinematography never fails to impress, and the legendary single take Dunkirk sequence is a beach scene to rival Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach battle sequence. Joe Wright's steady hand keeps the film afloat and his direction emphasizes the tension and (sometimes) the emotional power that the interesting storyline conveys. The visuals cannot be faulted, although the film too often spills into style over substance territory. Still, through the direction and staging, many individual scenes are powerful.The trouble is that due to the complex narrative, the film keeps hopping between different events without coherency, which blunts its impact. The film isn't as powerful as it should be, since the love story is rushed and underdeveloped and the war scenes are just soldiers walking around mainly. Acting wise, James McAvoy does a good job and delivers on charisma and emotion with great success, but Keira Knightly, incapable of changing her voice even for one line, rarely touches the viewer. If she does, it's in a more distant way. She's not as awful as some say, but she just doesn't let her emotion through enough. As for Saoirse Ronan, she's striking at times, but too one note and emotionless to connect to the audience properly. Why she was nominated for an Oscar while McAvoy wasn't is a mystery. Overall, Atonement's script is uneven and only sometimes delivers on the emotion. Beautiful as the cinematography is, there's too much emphasis on visuals and not enough on the romance, which makes the story hard to care about at times. Still, that ending is a devastating sucker punch.6/10",6,0,1,20 March 2015
V for Vendetta," Alan Moore should be proud of it even though he isn't
","V For Vendetta looks like a stylishly violent, kinetic, ultra cool dystopian comic book movie. It's not that at all, which is why it's one of the most underrated films in the IMDb top 250. Alan Moore has distanced himself from this, but this adaptation actually worked out. V, played by Hugo Weaving who gives a strong performance despite being underneath a mask for the whole film, has launched a one man revolution against the corrupt British Government. A young woman played by Natalie Portman who is good aside from a grating fake English accent becomes his unlikely ally. VFV certainly isn't what it looks like. V kills his victims through lethal injection and there aren't many fight scenes in the whole film. It's actually quite a talky movie which focuses on its social commentary and thought provoking narrative. VFV has a little too much talking and in terms of political commentary its pretty much an adolescent version and there's not actually that much political stuff which is that relevant, although the film is still thought provoking.It does lapse into duller territory, but not that often. Most of the time, this is a surprisingly strong and oddly moving science fiction movie which is a lot deeper than you first think. The direction is visually stunning, and the few fight scenes are directed very well. They have more impact as they're used less. The script may be a bit safe in some ways, but it'll seem very deep to many as the political commentary will go over the spectator's head mostly. It's still a good screenplay and the central relationship between V and Evey is unique and touching. It's also got some incredibly pyrotechnics and 2 fantastic uses of the 1812 Overture. VFV deserves more attention than it gets; this is still technically your typical stylish comic book movie, but it has more appeal to those who aren't fans of the genre than you'd expect and a pleasing use of humour as well. Not a masterpiece, but an excellent comic book film overall and in many ways, a very mature and patient one.8/10",8,1,3,20 December 2014
Furious 7," Pedal to the metal fun and a powerful farewell to Paul Walker
","With Furious 7, it's amazing a coherent film ever came out of the gate at all. Following Paul Walker's tragic death midway through filming the movie had a very troubled production, but thankfully things have worked out and Furious 7 is the second best Fast and Furious film to date, after Fast Five. The brother of F&F6's antagonist is after the team, and after killing Han (As seen at the end of the third and sixth films) goes after the others. Some other bad guys after a ludicrous computer programme which can hack into every camera anywhere in the world. Just don't try and follow the plot. Furious 7 breaks the speedometer in terms of action but also has characters we care about. The storyline between the only slightly less blank than usual Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez is well handled, Tyrese is as hilarious as ever and there's a good level of humour to the film. James Wan makes a successful transition from horror to action, and the film remains suspenseful and tense however big the setpieces. Cars fly between skyscrapers. A man leaps off a falling bus and jumps on a drift turning car. Dwayne Johnson, as brilliantly badass as ever, battles a helicopter with the mother of all machine guns. What more could you want? However, Furious 7 definitely has its issues, as do all of the films in the franchise. The plot is a bit messy and peaks too early. The film never quite reaches the level of the first action sequence again. The LA finale is fun but a bit convoluted and confused and at times the action is getting to be a tiny bit too much. Meanwhile, Nathalie Emmanuel is terrible in the movie and slightly blunts every scene she's in. As expected, this is a bit of a mess. It is however a genuinely moving tribute to Paul Walker, which will definitely cause tears for some. I didn't notice CGI Paul Walker at any point, although some others might. As a result, this is one of the most tear jerking action films ever made. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson, who both do a good job, are underused with Dwayne Johnson spending most of the film in hospital and Jason Statham mostly just turning up wherever the team go to beat loads of people up. Overall though, it simply has to be given credit as a fun action film and us a moving tribute to Paul Walker.8/10",8,0,3,10 April 2015
The Godfather," The godfather of American cinema
","The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit cliché to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand.The direction is excellent as well, as Francis Ford Coppola's filmmaking isn't showy and visually stunning like in Apocalypse Now, but it's more subtle and restrained and draws the viewer in. The dramatic moments are handled brilliantly, and having a great script to work with certainly doesn't hurt either. What makes the film a success isn't any of the above, but the storyline. The story is perfectly structured, and gets better and better as the film progresses. Not only does it have a multitude of brilliant movie moments, it also has many jaw dropping and startling outbreaks of violence, with the multiple assassinations/baptism finale being one of the best movie moments in the history of the medium. Michael Corleone's conversion into the head of his crime family is very sad, and the movie is overall proof that a family drama can still be thrilling, moving and have people queuing around the block. I don't usually agree with the best picture winners, but this is one which totally deserved to win. Like I said earlier, it's a cliché to love this movie but it really does deserve it.10/10",10,5,7,11 May 2014
