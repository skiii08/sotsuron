The Blair Witch Project," Does Not Live Up to the Hype
","After seeing the SciFi Channel's EXCELLENT documentary on the Curse of the BW, I went into this movie with very high hopes and a positive attitude. After the first 20 minutes, I was wishing I had just left my experience with the BW at the documentary.  This is the second movie I have seen this year that left me empty and feeling cheated--the other being 'Phantom Menace'.  Had this film come thru on the promise it showed in the documentary (and even the web site!) it would have been a good film but it falls short in so many ways that I wont start listing for fear of putting off the casual reader.While I don't mind never seeing the BW, I do think they could have done a better job of explaining the curse in the movie.  If I had not seen the documentary, I would have given this film a 1 vs the 2 I did rate it.  If, despite my ramblings, you choose to rent this, I cannot overemphasize that you MUST also see the documentary on the SciFi Channel beforehand... if you don't you're cheating yourself.Bottomline:  Leave on the shelf...",2,0,1,10 November 1999
Madagascar," Best kids movie for summer 2005
","My 7, 4 and 2 yr olds all enjoyed this. There's enough in-jokes for the parents to keep you watching as well. Not a Chris Rock fan but he was very good as Marty the Zebra who puts the main characters on the road to Madagascar. Ben Stiller was hilarious as Alex the Lion but David Schwimmer as Melman the Giraffe stole the show with all the physical comedy in the background of the scenes (look what is on his feet when they are on the subway).The Penguins and Monkeys also steal some scenes with their crazed antics away from the main characters. 'Just smile and wave boys, smile and wave.'The inclusion of the lemurs works and does not distract as the Ewoks did in 'Return of the Jedi'. The 'Move It' dance scene with King Julian was a big hit with the little ones.While not as polished as Nemo, it is still a keeper. Your little ones should come away happy which is all you ask for with the cost of tickets these days!",9,2,3,1 July 2005
Notting Hill," Should be called 'Nothing Here'
","Not since 'Intersection' have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended.  I honestly don't know who was worse, Ms Roberts or Mr Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Even the one for the snack bar had better acting than this waste of film.  Aside from shamelessly borrowing from 'Roman Holiday', this film lacks a plot or characters worth caring about.  Ms Roberts' character is not worthy of pity for the situations she finds herself in as she is shallow and self-indulgent--perhaps it wasn't a stretch for her to play this part.  Mr Grant's constant stuttering and eye-blinking made me more sick than the motion sequences of 'Blair Witch Project'.  Not worth seeing or renting.  Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard.",2,2,6,2 November 1999
For Love of the Game," A Baseball movie AND A Chick Flick Rolled into One
","This was a great movie.  I went into it with high expectations because it had two things going for it in my mind:  it was based on Michael Shaara's novel and it's a Kevin Costner/Baseball movie.  It did not disappoint despite Costner badmouthing Universal for cutting some scenes.  Well worth the price of admission.  I have to admit I may like it better than 'Field of Dreams'... I'll have to watch it again when it comes on video to decide that one.  Shaara's 'Killer Angels', which was made into 'Gettysburg', makes a cameo when Billy Chapel carries it onto the plane after a game at Fenway. Nice touch and tribute to a wonderful author who sadly never lived to see his two novels make it to the screen.",10,0,0,6 October 1999
Pulp Fiction," A Modern Day Canterbury Tale
","Geoffrey Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' was a frame story:  there was one overall story/link that binded all the characters (they met at the inn on the road) which is at the beginning and end of the story but in between are mini-stories about each of the travellers.  'Pulp Fiction' is a modern version.  The frame in this case is the Diner which is where, like Chaucer's inn, the main characters meet.  In between we get mini-story's like Butch's tale (the Knight if you will), Vincent's tale (the Sailor) and Jules' tale (the Monk).  Each is interwoven with the other except that chronologically, they are out of synch (Butch wastes Vincent in his tale but Vincent is in the Diner frame part of the story).  The dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--Tarintino is notorious, like Stephen King, for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references.  Witness the scene outside Jack Rabbit Slims where Mia asks Vincent 'You're not a square Daddy-O are you?' and proceeds to 'draw' a square in the air ala Pebbles Flintstone.  This blurring of the film's reality with our reality lets you know Tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense of what 'Joe Bagofdonuts' does--he watches TV too!  Kevin Williamson's re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to 'Pulp Fiction' and it's acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days.  Rent it, buy it... the bonus cut footage alone is worth a look.",10,0,0,11 August 1999
