Deja Vu," the same movie over and over again
","I don't know why I watched this (oh yeah I do, I was in the middle of the Aegean sea with nothing to do) because Tony Scott is one of my least favorite filmmakers. When people talk about 'the crap coming out of Hollywood' they are talking about Scott. He blows stuff up, has sexy camera angles of 'hot' people, and rehashes a predicable plot we have all seen before. My brother was quoting the film moments ahead of the dialogue, that's how banal and conventional it is. One of worst aspects of Scotts work is his overuse of editing. He edits/manipulates so much it kills the chance for the viewer to think about what is going on. He just shoves it down your throat. Tony Scott makes movies for people that don't want to think for themselves. Denzel Washington reprises the same role he has played his whole career, a conflicted detective. It is the same old stupid posturing and tough guy nonsense. The film is about some young and terribly miscast detective/scientists that use a wormhole in space/time to solve crimes. In this case the crime is a terrorist blowing up a ferry full of sailors and children. But Denzel gets involved and demands to be transported back in time to save this one hot girl that has nothing to do with the actual story. 'Deja Vu' is a fitting title, its the same movie over and over again. Absolute crap.",1,11,20,26 August 2007
American Sniper," Stoking the Flames of Division and War.
","After an unprecedented stream of ridiculously bad movies, Clint Eastwood returns to his roots with another violence worshiping plunker. Here, he and his comrades fan the flames of division and war with this deeply irresponsible film glorifying American terrorism in Iraq. As usual the SEAL team occupiers are portrayed as heroic tough guys while the local Arabs are reduced to child murdering, drill-killing 'savages'. The caricatures are so backwards and silly it's hard to believe a film like this is being made in 2015. Presumably this is being marketed to the bible belt and anyone that hasn't actually seen combat. The cartoonish reductions of the people and situations involved are offensive to those that have served, let alone Iraqis. The film is so 100% paint-by-numbers that we even have scenes with the upset wife at home to break up the battle sequences. American propagandists should hold themselves to a higher standard.",1,122,263,10 January 2015
Avatar," Thoughts on a Phenomenon
","I saw it. I bowed down to the hype and went and saw the mighty Avatar in 3D IMAX. I am supposed to like this movie, right? Well, the first hour was great, the 3D effects were very trippy and the film contained the only convincing CGI I have ever seen. Up until now I have found CGI, for the most part, laughable. Once I got used to the 3D- and the hardcore corniness kicks in, I found the film almost unbearable. I know Cameron is making a film to appeal to the lowest common denominator- but some of that dialog was inexcusably bad. Sure, dumb it down for the masses- but not that far down! The repeated love affirmation 'I see you' being an example. I'm guessing he had to use terms a simpleton would use because he was already counting his dollars as knew he would eventually have to dub the movie in every real language out there. Another complaint: Even though the supposed bad guys in the movie were American military and mercenaries- I still thought they managed to glorify imperialist violence with all the 'kick-ass' bravado and the subtle inspirational music during attack on the big tree. I'm sure most kids and meat-heads in the audience were thinking 'yeah, burn that hippie tree down and its kill those Blue Man Group kooks.' Also, I can't help but wonder if people truly enjoyed the barrage of quantum psycho-babble that infected the movie like a virus. I admit that Sigourney Weavers little speech to Giovanni Ribisi about the network of energy being alive was mildly interesting- especially when found in a blockbuster. But were people really feeling the Na'vi's cross-legged arm to arm spiritual rejuvenation dance? I found it silly. I did enjoy exploring the Na'vi world and of course the psychedelic colors of the forest and dragons were amazing to look at. But as the minutes worn on and it became yet another hour long good vs. evil battle sequenceÂ… I had had enough. Been there, done that, don't need to see it again. But the nail in the coffin of me basically disliking the film was the god-awful saintly forest song as the credits rolled. Did you hear that 'music'? Did they still have to try and shove the quasi new age ideology down our throats even after the movie was over??????? I think not. I found it offensive.",3,5,7,16 February 2010
