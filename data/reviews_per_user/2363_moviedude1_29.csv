The Ring," Not much for scary movies, but this one was a good one!
","I never was one for those scary movies, but I stumbled across a recommendation for this film and it showed up at my doorstep through our rental service. I didn't have anything to do last night, so I popped it in and my significant other left the room when she found out what I was watching, she practically RAN for the other room! I thought, 'what the heck' and watched it anyway! There was a time when I would have turned it off after the first scene, but it got my attention and I sat there waiting to find out, not if they could scare the daylights out of me (which they DID), but I also found myself waiting for find out if there was some logical explanation for what was happening in the movie. (You're gonna have to watch this one, because I am NOT gonna tell you...but trust me...it really is not a bad movie at all!)",7,1,1,11 January 2005
Finding Neverland," A mother's wish, a little boy's dream, a world of imagination...
","I've never been a big fan of Johnny Depp and I never fell into the 'Pirates...' saga, but he pulls one out of the hat in this world of make believe that comes to life with just a hint of imagination.Depp plays J M Barrie, the author of 'Peter Pan.' After a flop on his last play, he stumbles upon a woman and her children in the park, where he strikes up a friendship with them (under the un-approving eye of society) and forms a bond with the children, thus basing the book on the many adventures he takes with the children.A little bit of knowledge of the lore of the book is a must, otherwise you'll never understand what's going on. Even I, myself, have never realized the connections the book had with real life, such as the crocodile chasing Captain Hook while harboring a ticking clock in his stomach, signifying how time catches up with all of us.A touching movie and one I don't think I'll be able to top for a long time. I feel cheated, because it's taken me 3 years to see it! 9 out of 10!",9,2,2,13 July 2007
Training Day," DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS MOVIE!
","Denzel Washington is, in my own opinion, in the role of his life.  Noted for the good guy roles, he now has THE chance to shine as the bad guy!The director's opening of Ethan Hawke in the family setting instills in the viewer that he's a cop who wants to make things right, ultimately, to keep his family safe.  It's not a bad premise, really, since we all want that kind of security for our loved ones.His first day in the 'narc' division is, shall we say, an eye opener. Washington's character stays focused throughout the whole film and that's what kept me on the edge of my seat.  I kept finding myself hoping that he was a good guy after all.  'Say it isn't so, Denzel!'The raid is where things screwed up.  I really can't believe that all of the 'bad cops' were willing to let Hawke walk out of there.  Washington was the ring leader, but I don't think any man has that kind of control over everyone like that.  True, I'm not from the streets, but this ain't the nineties, anymore.  You can't control how I feel!  Denzel being the boss, or not, if someone with Hawke's character were in the position to put me away for a very long time, I would make very sure that he was on my side.  The director lost me, there.But I do see a lot of realistic values in the film.  It was very well shot and I believe Washington finally had the chance to shine in this one!  I'm just sad to see it took a role like this to get all the critic's attention. Keep up the good work, Denzel, I'm pullin' for ya'!",9,0,11,2 July 2003
Kickboxer," Great for its time, but losing luster after 20 years.
","Van Damme stars as a kick-boxer who follows his brother, who's a champion. When they go to Asia to find new competition, they stumble across a strange form of the martial arts and competition in the ring leaves his brother paralyzed, whereas Van Damme swears vengeance on the man who put him in a wheel chair. The only problem is that he's not good enough to fulfill his vow and there's only one man who stands the chance of training him properly.This film was very good for it's time, but I've heard that it's lost its luster over the years. A lot of people don't think much of Van Damme anymore, but this film was made at a time when all the kungfu theater movies were dying out in the US and Chuck Norris just wasn't getting the job done. Enter Van Damme, a decent looking kid, a feeble, awkward ability to act, and what do you get? This! I remember first watching this movie on HBO when it originally came out, and I was residing in a household with several roommates and this movie was on the tube every time it came up, and yours truly was right there, watching it with everyone else. I feel Van Damme has lost some of his luster over the years, either due to bad roles or just a personal choice to sit out, but the man put out some decent movies in the 80's and 90's and this was definitely one of them! As far as the sequels, though, skip it, unless you find yourself wanting to fill your time with nothing in particular, which is what the sequels, basically, amount to.8 out of 10 stars.",8,0,0,25 January 2009
Finding Nemo," There's no time for clowning around when your son is missing...
","When Marlon loses his son, Nemo, to a diver, all of his fears about the open water prove to be within reason, but he has no time for that, because, throwing all caution aside, it's time to go after his son!This is probably one of the best movies I have seen all year!  It does not matter what age you are!  If you are in the mood to watch this kind of film...WATCH IT!  It starts out a little slow, at first, but, once the events that set the film in motion take place, I found myself rooting for Nemo just like I know all the kids do when they first watch this film.  It's one of those kind that you can sum up by the old saying, 'This is the kind of film for kids of all ages...'There was a time when I really did not care for these kind of films.  And the bad rap that Disney studios has gotten over the past few years makes me sick.  Disney stands for family values and those values have stood the test of time.  I went out the first day 'The Lion King' went on sale on DVD (I have 2 copies on VHS also) and it was my favorite animated movie of all time!  This one comes in a close second!",9,0,1,20 November 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Jobs are on the line as love takes center stage...
","This was a 'cute' movie.  It's one of those, 'will he, won't he...will she, won't she' movies where ulterior motives have priorities, but no one can keep love out of the picture.  It just goes to show you that closeness in any relationship only brings the people even closer together.But it's an average movie!  The actors don't stand out!  I thought even the dog was stealing the scenes it was in!  It almost has that part where you want to jump up and down and scream, 'YES!' and then it lets you go.  The chemistry between the two leads is great, but the reaction of the two is a definite let down.",6,0,0,13 August 2003
That Thing You Do!," What could have made this movie better...
","A garage band in Erie, PA loses their drummer to a broken arm, where Everett Scott steps in and takes over, picking up the pace on a song originally meant to be a ballad. Even though his band mates have mixed feelings on the decision, it rockets to the stars in a number one single and from there, the sky's the limit for the 'oh-nay-ders.' This is the first time I've seen this film and I wished I would have seen it earlier. I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me, but I sat down earlier this morning and watched it. Following the band was easy throughout the film and the heartache everyone faces in their respective careers tugged a little bit at my heartstrings.Hands down, one of the better movies in 1996, a time when I was trying to pick myself up and dust myself off, and a time when I should have taken the time to sit down and actually watch this film, instead of waiting almost thirteen years.Oh, and about my opening summary, the one thing that could have made this movie a little better for people just as old as me or a little older would have been a scene where the 'Bosom Buddies' co-stars, writer Hanks and Peter Scolari, could have appeared together. So close and yet so far! 8 out of 10 stars!",8,0,0,7 January 2009
Insomnia," Great Alaska scenery is the backdrop for murder...
","I thought this film was going to be one of those grisly slasher movies, but I'm glad I was mistaken!  Pacino is, as usual, on his mark!  In my mind, he's one of the best actors of all time.  This film shows why:Pacino and his LAPD partner, Donovan, are called by one of Pacino's friends to a small-town community in Alaska, where a 17-year-old-girl is murdered. Wasting no time, Pacino goes right to work, possibly wanting to take his mind off the troubles he has back home with his own affairs...The suspects dwindle, and Pacino wastes no time even further dwindling that list, but what he has left is a group of people that any one of them could have done it...or could they?Hillary Swank was the downfall to this film.  From the first time she meets with Pacino, she holds him on a pedestal, even going as far as quoting some of his previous work (even the address of a murder scene in one of his past cases).  It was obvious to everyone what a fan she was of Pacino, but they took it a little too far...Overall, this is an excellent movie!  The scenery was breath-taking (one of those, 'I wish I would have seen it on the big screen' moments) and the characterization of Robin Williams (who was billed way too high for this film, since he doesn't enter the picture until about half-way through) as a writer was pretty good, also.  In fact, I found myself asking some pretty interesting questions throughout.Pacino fans and Williams fans alike will enjoy this film.  I gave it a somewhat-generous 9 because I lost myself in the film...I could really see something like this happening!",9,1,1,26 October 2003
Spider-Man 3," Kudos to all who had input on this film...
","Tobey Maguire is back for the third time as the web slinger, fighting crime in the city of New York, while fighting to hold onto the love of his life, Mary Jane Parker (Kirsten Dunst).Among his turmoils include an inner one, created by an alien force that finds a host and bonds with that host, but creating hostility and aggression in the process; a fact that even chemistry student Peter Parker can not combat.I think that if you're a fan of these films, you will DEFINITELY enjoy this film. Another great story on the side is Mary Jane's own inner turmoil and battling her own demons, in which Dunst turns in an excellent performance.Films, as a rule, tend to fall off in their ratings when they get further and further into making sequels, but this one, like the Indiana Jones trilogy, just keeps on putting out fantastic story lines.",9,11,25,3 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'Second verse, worse than the first!'
","George Lucas brings Luke Skywalker and the gang back for one more round of good vs evil climax in the third part of the trilogy saga surrounding 'The Force,' a mysterious religion that was lost (and not-yet-explained) some time before the movie-goers came onto the scene.Overall, the film was not bad, but it was definitely the worst one of all. Plots are revealed that should be obvious when you think about it.  And the final battle scene, although different characters playing different 'hero' roles, strongly reminds me of the first movie, the one they now call 'A New Hope.'  As our hero wrestles with his conscious, his friends wrestle the bad guys in outer space and on the moon of Endor, where we meet the lovable creatures, the Ewoks, which added that comedy part to the film that we didn't see much of in the first two with the exception of R2D2, who still stole the show!",5,2,5,11 November 2003
Knocked Up," Just when you think you've seen it all, you realize you have...
","Katherine Heigl is a young woman on her way to the top. But while celebrating her new promotion, she meets someone that ends up with her overnight and morning sickness takes over eight weeks later.Along the way, the movie deals with all the phases of prospecting parenting in a light-hearted way: sex of the baby, possible names, Mom's changes during pregnancy, Dad's inability to grow up, etc.There is no way to write a comment about this movie without giving some details about it. Most of us have been there, but this is an interesting view on how someone else might get there.All in all, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours with the one you love. If you've gone through it, you'll laugh. If you haven't, you'll find it funny because you have heard it all before (just not this funny)...and it's also a reminder what a night out on the town can result in: something that doesn't necessarily end up as a good thing. My personal ranking is 9 out of 10 stars.",3,1,4,3 June 2007
The Color of Money," Fast Eddie lives!
","You know, as a young boy, I was not allowed to watch 'The Hustler' for obvious reasons.  The life that Newman led as 'Fast Eddie' Felsen took a turn of events that was not suitable for children.But, as an adult and a fan of Tom Cruise (sort of), I found 'The Hustler' on cable one night and watched it after seeing 'The Color of Money' years ago in theaters.  To re-create a role after so many years does take talent! And Newman is loaded with it!Eddie is a liquor vendor, pushing his wares in bars and pool halls.  When he meets Cruise, his blood starts to boil for the pool table like it did so many years ago until Minnesota Fats put him away.  Through Cruise's girlfriend (Mastrantonio), Newman convinces Cruise to go out and make a living off shooting pool and hustling people.  The only problem is that Cruise does not want to hustle people, he just wants to win...This film takes a few twists and turns that were kind of unexpected.  The relationship between Newman and Mastrantonio was a rarely-found touch because of the different styles of the actors, themselves.  Cruise, sometimes, it seemed, was left out in the dark, playing someone who had no idea what it was all about until someone had to take a baseball bat and beat it into his head.Overall, I gave this movie a six, because, although it was a good movie, there was not much to it.  When I was younger, I hardly got what Newman was trying to get across, but now I'm a little older and I realize that it was not about pool, it was about money.The only thing I now find myself hoping for is that Cruise does not come out in 15 years and even attempt to put himself in Newman's shoes, trying to pass on his knowledge, because, in my mind, he didn't learn a thing!",6,0,1,23 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," T1 & T2 COMBINED ON STEROIDS!
","I just saw T3 tonight and I think the one line summary is about all that needs to be said about it: T1 & T2 on steroids.  This movie will live in the trilogy.  It follows the story line enough that the true Terminator fans can make the easy predictions as far as what's going to happen or be said next, but Ms Loken does exactly what the character is supposed to do: keep coming until the job is finished.Arnold, on the other hand, once again, plays the good guy in this film.  And although I could not see him as a bad guy like he was in the first Terminator, he was a good guy who could make it believable!  Nick Stahl is an unknown to me.  I have never seen him perform before, to my knowledge, but his character portrayal is not bad!  The whole film plot is enough to make someone think, though, about two things:  1) The events that lead to the eventual destruction of mankind, & 2) the fact that someone's destiny can be changed, but weather the timeline can follow pretty much the same path or not.Sci fi strikes again in the summer of 2003.  I rate this a 9! I really enjoyed watching this film!",9,3,4,12 July 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Vin Diesel's breakthrough role...
","Paul Walker is an undercover cop from LA trying to infiltrate a street racer gang suspected of having some kind of connection with hijackings in the area.  Vin Diesel is the leader of the gang with the fastest hot rod in LA.The plot for this movie is superb!  With the headbanger's music in the background, it's the perfect setting for the younger crowd of today.  The special effects in this film is all right, but not that spectacular.  Walker makes this role work, but the only thing I don't believe is that he doesn't have some kind of partner working a little closer.  He's just a little too young for this kind of take on...but, then again, I thought Brian Bosworth was a useless piece of work when it came to the movie, 'Stone Cold.'  It really reminds me of that movie, but with a touch of the new millennium.",7,1,1,21 November 2003
Quantum of Solace," Widen the shot so we can make sense of what is going on!!!!!!
","James Bond films are KNOWN for their ability to capture great stunts on film, and from the opening gambit, there's a lot of great stunts, but the camera work is filmed from so close up, that the viewer spends more time trying to figure out what they're watching more than trying to enjoy the film, itself. Normally, I spend the money for the DVD because I enjoyed watching it in the theater, but I'll need to spend the money just so I can 'get' the plot. In the scene where Bond is fighting one of the bad guys on the ropes, I have to try and keep track of where Bond is and even had to retrace his steps once to make sure it was him who ended up where he is. I'm sorry, but the 'reality feel' to this movie is what killed it for me.As for the plot, itself, I guess he's trying to keep someone from taking over some country's water supply. Before seeing this movie, I heard he was on some vendetta against someone who killed his girlfriend in the last movie. Oh, wait! This is supposed to take place BEFORE the first James Bond movie ever came out (where Sean Connery was nothing but a high class detective for the British government), but I never saw any cell phones in use between 1965 and 1980 (or any of the computers they used, either, for that matter).I really hate to rip on a movie, especially one where I'm a big fan of the saga, itself. In preparing for this movie, I watched some of the 'In-Demand' material on Comcast cable (shameless plug...sorry) and they talked a little about the history of the character, James Bond. One of the points they mentioned was that writers and critics thought the movie line would die once the cold war was over (Judi Dench's character even mentioned in the LAST Bond movie that she 'missed the Cold War'), but I think they should have dug that time capsule back up and laid this film to rest next to that idea instead of releasing it in theaters. The critics estimate about $60 million in sales for this movie, but I think that's hoping for a little much...maybe $50 million (10 million for each star I give it...).5 stars out of 10",5,8,12,16 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," I'm not sure it was worth all the hype...
","When hunter Brolin stumbles across a drug deal gone bad, he decides to keep the money for himself. But he gets caught by some of the bad guys cohorts when he returns to the scene of the crime to get the drugs and they're already there. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie where everyone is trying to get their own hands on the money, while an aging lawman (Jones) stumbles around, trying to figure out what, exactly, is going on.This film, in my opinion, was a little on the lame side. Although a fan of Tommy Lee Jones, I am, definitely, not a fan of the Coen Bros. I thought the plot was good, but the direction the movie took, sometimes was a little sidetracked and the dialog was, sometimes, too macho. I don't live in Texas, but do they really talk that way down there? Do they threaten people and put lives at risk with such little emotion? To tell you the truth, I feel like I've put more emotion into the fifteen minutes to write this review than the 'Brothers' did in writing the whole film. Jones, alone, was the reason why this movie got six out of ten stars, and even THAT was questionable.",6,1,4,16 December 2008
Across the Universe," A bit over the top...
","Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood star as a pair of young adults from two different countries in, for lack of a better term, star-crossed lovers syndrome, who fight for what they believe in and end up fighting each other.I'm sorry, but this is definitely not my kind of movie, but I made it through, anyway. I got about half-way through the film when the phone rang, and I normally pause it for such things, but I found this film so BORING that I let it play through, only to rewind it to find out what happened in the end, anyway, so my hat's off to director Julie Taymor for capturing my attention, anyway. Does anyone else feel like Sadie and Jo-Jo were tasteless copies of Mama Cass and Jimi Hendrix? 4 out of 10 stars.",4,1,2,5 February 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Cheesy...
","This movie features all the stars returning to the familiar characters of the heroes, as Reed is about to marry Sue, the love of his life. But an alien being has different ideas, which stand in the way of that very wedding, which, in turn, begins to raise doubts in Sue.The plot is there, but I feel that Don Payne and Mark Frost could have done a better job of writing this up. The comedy between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm kept the movie on the light-hearted sides, but, like all the other sequels I've seen this summer, the plot has felt like it was FORCED! If you're a fan of the Fantastic 4, you will probably enjoy this movie, as I did, but you might not love it. I vote 6 out of 10 stars.",6,7,22,14 June 2007
Shrek 2," Second verse...way better than the first!
","I always go into writing a review for films without reading the comments that already have been posted, but this time was different and I agree with them...it isn't often where the sequels are better than the original, but Shrek 2 has seemed to accomplish that feat! Leave it alone, boys! Go out on top while you can!When Shrek and his bride get back from their honeymoon, they find that the Princess' family insist that they travel to her homeland and celebrate their nuptials there! Much to Shrek's chagrin, they make the trip and encounter some strange characters in their journey (the best one of all, Puss 'N' Boots, played by Antonio Banderas).I was a video store manager when the original came out on VHS & DVD, so it got burned out rather quickly, but it was a good burn, if you know what I mean. I'd really be happy 'burning' this one out, too, when it comes out! I'm not much for repeats, but I'm going to this one again!",10,1,1,23 May 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," 'Second verse, not quite as good as the first...'
","I'm not sure what the director was up to in the sequel to 'The Matrix,' but Reeves has his hands full being 'the one.'Right from the start, the director shows Reeves' dominance in the film by holding off 'all' the bad guys while his companions escape.  It seems the training of 'the one' is complete!  Someone, though, should have trained the director on making sequels.  The film was all over the place, but it still focused on Zion, humanity's homeworld, and the peril it was in from an invasion from 'the machines.'It seemed, at times, there were too many main characters in this film. About the time one would get into what one was doing, the director would shift the focus onto someone else, not bothering to make any connection.  I don't know...maybe I needed to pay closer attention than I did because I spent more time turning the sound up during conversations and then back down when all the special effects took over.The special effects were a little too much.  It was nice to see what a hero Reeves could be ('He's doin' his Superman thing!'), but some of the stunts were just a little too un-real!  I realize that that was what being in the Matrix was all about, but I still couldn't fathom doing all those kinds of stunts...good thing Hollywood has CGI now, eh?This film was really hyped up for it's theatrical release earlier this year, but overall, I'm glad a friend of mine borrowed me his DVD copy so I didn't have to waste money on renting it...",5,0,0,28 October 2003
The Lion King," Great movie for the entire family!
","The first time I saw this movie, it was already out on VHS back in the mid 90's.  My kids had seen it some time before that in a theater, but, only after seeing it once, my 4 year old was quoting that movie like it was scripture!This movie is not about nature, or revenge, or killing, or anything like that.  This movie is about wholesome family entertainment in the classic Disney fashion that I have come to know and love since I was my own children's age.Once again, that same magic is captured almost ten years later as 'The Lion King' is released on DVD.  As I watched it again the other night, I found myself mouthing the words to the parts that I new, but the best part of this film is where the writers take the film back to the drawing boards and re-do the movie.  Some of the parts, such as the 'Morning Report' were, I felt, unnecessary, but, as a whole, the entire movie will be here in another 40 to 50 years like 'Bambi.'",9,0,0,29 November 2003
Signs," Scared? You bet!
","This is a great movie for the sci fi fan who also likes Mel Gibson! Dealing with crop circles, former priest (but still farmer) Gibson also deals with the recent loss of his wife and raising his two children.I didn't know what to expect from this film, I really didn't.  I only paid half attention to it when the trailers advertised it in theaters and I gave it no thought at all when it came out on video.  My significant other is a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, so I settled down to watch it the other night with her.When the movie opens up we find Gibson dealing with quitting the church, the loss of his life and his dogs going nuts out in the corn field.  Although we never saw anything out of the ordinary (in the beginning), I found myself hoping that this was, like most of the other crop circle formations, that it was all a hoax.  So much for that idea!  When we finally did see what was going on, I was definitely on the edge of my seat the rest of the film! When Gibson's brother almost fell out of his chair, I was right there with him, holding my breath, waiting for the next thing to happen!",8,0,2,10 December 2003
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," I used to love this movie...
","A film that became a classic, two dopey high schoolers are threatened to be split up by one of their fathers if they don't ace the oral presentation in History. The problem is that someone else doesn't want them to part ways, and sends them on a special trip...into the past.Having recently saw this film for the 'umpteenth' time, these two 'dudes' obviously aren't that stupid in real life (maybe they watched Sean Penn's character 'Spiccoli' in 'Fast Times at Ridgemount High' for incentive on their character), but that shows how good they can really act. No one knew at the time what heights Reeves would rise to, but this film definitely begins to show what range he can achieve.If I'd written this comment and voted for it the first or second time I saw it (when it originally came out), it would probably have received a higher vote, but, alas, I have grown and my tastes in comedy have matured (No way, dude!) 6 out of 10 stars!",6,0,1,1 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic that began a long time ago...
","George Lucas has entered the Hollywood scene with the blockbuster 'Star Wars.'  All of us, at one time or another, loved this film.  The, then, state-of-the-art special effects mastered by Lucas began the saga for the Sci-fi good vs. evil that left us all standing and cheering in theaters all over the world (and I know you were standing there, because I saw this movie in 18 different cinemas).Lucas did something else no one else has, either.  On its twentieth anniversary, he re-mastered it, adding some scenes and cleaning it up to match the original version, even adding a short out take on some of the things he did at the beginning of the re-release of the 20th anniversary edition.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. (come on, George, don't make us wait much longer!)",10,0,0,11 November 2003
Click," Sandler needs more work on adult comedy routines...
","This is not a bad movie. In fact, I rather enjoyed it. But, in my mind, this is strike three for Sandler, as far as adult comedy goes. He tried (and failed) in 'Spanglish,' before retreating to what he knows best 'The Longest Yard,' which, in my mind, just made it all the worse. If Sandler would pick a line of comedy and STICK to it, he would be on the track, but he's all over the place.Sandler plays an architect with a family that is expecting just as much time from him as his boss is, who is holding a promotion to partner over his head. In the course of his daily life, even the little things seem to get to him, like all the remotes sitting on the coffee table and opening the garage door and turning on the ceiling fan when all he does is turn on the television to find some cartoons for his kids to watch.Out to blow off some steam, he turns to a department store to find a universal remote, where he meets Walken, who supplies him with a remote that can control everything around his life, including people, places, and things, not just the television, ceiling fan, and garage door.7 out of 10 is what I gave this film, because I really did enjoy it. I got lost in the movie, so I didn't really find myself thinking how it would end. Not bad, theatrically, but could have used some fine tuning in the end. I think it would be interesting to see the deleted scenes in the DVD when it comes out.",7,7,17,24 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Is it in your destiny to watch this film?
","Once again, George Lucas takes us to a long time ago in a land far, far away.  This film is a follow up to one of the biggest grossing movies of all time.  To tell you the truth, this movie was not that great.  The characters were further defined, but this film did leave enough out there to tell even the most novice of movie watchers that there was one more film to come (even if Lucas didn't tell us beforehand).I did like that touch of humanity to the film.  Bad guys DO win (once in a while), there are flaws to people that others WILL take advantage of, and we don't ALWAYS win the good fight!The second part of the trilogy gives an insight into 'The Force.'  It, sometimes, reminds me of a hokey martial arts film.  But the depth of the characters in this film became a part of history in the first one, making box office history as the number one grossing film that took almost twenty years to break.  But this film did fall a little short in my book because I did not find some of the elements of the film believable.  It was still a good film, but I still liked the first one better.",8,1,2,11 November 2003
The Pursuit of Happyness," You can feel Smith's pain...
","This movie, definitely what you would call a chick flick, has it all...love, dedication, and achieving one's goals Smith is a salesman, but one who has to push the product, himself, because he got rooked into one of those deals where he signs that contract and they send him the material to be sold, and he stores it in his apartment. Thinking of him as a loser, his wife leaves him just as he gets into something that might change his life.This movie takes place in the early 80's; a time when the economy was probably at its lowest in years at the time. Jobs were scarce and money coming into the household was even more scarce. During the film, I could feel Smith's pain as he tries again and again to get ahead, only to be beaten back down for some reason or another. Its another example (based on a trues story) of the saying, 'It's not how many times life can beat you down, but how many times can you get back up.'",8,0,0,2 May 2007
Atonement," This film is messed up...
","Keira Knightley stars as a spoiled young woman in 1930's England who tries to deny her feelings for the family's housekeepers son (James McAvoy). But when she finally gives in to her feelings, she spawns jealousy in her little sister (Saoirse Ronan), leading to false accusations.I guess it's just not my day for movies set in a different time, as this one has left me wanting more, but definitely NOT anymore like this one. I found myself watching this with only half-interest when the film kept going in reverse and setting up what the younger sister saw, then finding myself more interested as McAvoy found himself in the war, trying to safely get home. Although the plot was, finally, understandable, this film was all over the place and didn't spend any time setting anything up! 4 out of 10 stars.",4,0,2,2 February 2009
The Godfather," I can't believe it took me 31 yrs to see this movie!
","The Corleone family saga begins with Brando granting (or refusing) the requests of his friends, family, and neighbors during his daughter's wedding.  That's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name Puzo on the map.This is a very graphic depiction of the 'family' scene.  It marks the end of one's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when Pacino takes over the 'family' business.If you haven't seen this movie, yet, do yourself a favor: don't wait 30 years like I did.  Watch it!  It was on one of the premium channels the other night and I taped it.  I knew it was three hours long and I always thought I would not have the patience to watch it, but I did.  In fact, they are showing part two tonight and I am taping that to watch tomorrow night.",9,1,3,15 July 2003
