Walk the Line," Sometimes the line walks you!
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! It is a little slow paced in the beginning but the story is awesome! It is also based on a true story! Johnny Cash is a classic! The actors are excellent, and they really put themselves in their characters. Joaquin Phoenix is very convincing as the struggling singer who is struggling with his life and his relationship with Reese Witherspoon's character. I didn't know he could sing that well! Witherspoon is just as good, showing determination and enthusiasm in her character. And she is so good looking! I also didn't know she had a talent for music as well. That's amazing! The other actors play their parts well too.As you can see from all the ratings, it's a must-see for everyone!",9,1,2,22 February 2009
The Hangover," That's my grandma's ring. She made it all the way through the holocaust with that thing. It's legit.
","Funniest movie I've ever seen!!! The quote above is just one of many from this movie!! There are enough one liners to quote for the rest of the year! Well, at least according to everyone at my school. Ha ha ha! Mike Tyson even made me laugh, and not at him this time. Ed Helms is at his best for sure here! I have nothing against 'My Best Friend's Wedding' but how can you compare those two movies!?!The end was the best part though. My girlfriend's face was so red for days from laughing so hard!!!! And the bachelor party in the movie was so much better than the ones I've been to in real life!! That is pretty sad though, so take it for what you will. Most importantly, if you do not see this movie, you will have no idea what everyone is talking about!",10,3,6,3 September 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimate Bourne From Start To Finish
","This is arguably the best of the three Bourne movies, and I could not agree more. This movie is so awesome that I might just have to spoil it. There are awesome car chases and a lot of other action. Plus it's great seeing Matt Damon and Julia Stiles together. Their characters should fall in love seriously. And Joan Allen looks great for her age! The acting is great, and so is the dialogue. I won't give away the details, but we FINALLY learn who 'Jason Bourne' really is, and all about his past.There was just one thing about the movie I didn't like. Julia Stiles' new hair! If you ask me, she looked really disturbed with that new hair, even if it was meant to be a disguise.Other than that, this is definitely one of the best movies ever made. I won't spoil the ending, but you won't believe what happens!",10,2,4,5 August 2007
The Italian Job," It's payback time!
","This is one of the best movies ever! The lesson from this movie is that there is no honor among thieves. Because of that, it doesn't matter how unrealistic this movie might be. You also won't believe how the movie ends or how it gets there. Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the lead role. He is actually rugged and is a smooth actor. The other actors are all good-looking as well, and talented and in-shape. I also love the catchy one-liners in the dialogue! There are also MINI Coopers in this movie! What could be better than that?This is all I will say about the plot. GET IN. GET OUT. GET EVEN.Don't miss 'The Brazilian Job' in 2009!",9,0,4,30 July 2007
The Iron Giant," Not your typical animated cartoon (That's a good thing)
","Okay, I am REALLY NOT into animated kids movies. I was years ago, and this was my favorite movie ever way back in the day. I am embarrassed to admit that I actually watched this movie today, even though I haven't seen it in years. But it is definitely not as bad as those silly little cartoons.The voice acting is brilliant. Jennifer Aniston was amazing! And I usually hate her. Harry Connick Jr. is clever and sharp, as always. I don't know who did the voice of 'Hogarth' but that is one amazing little kid. And Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant......oh yeah!!! The story is incredible. And so are the characters. That's why I watched this movie today. I don't like it as much now as I used to. But then, I was obsessed with it years ago. Aside from the animated kids feeling, the movie is brilliant. Just not for young adults, I guess.7/10. I should rate it even higher but that would be too embarrassing.",7,1,2,16 May 2008
The Proposal," Say YES to 'The Proposal'!
","I can see why it's doing so well at the box office! No wonder everyone's been saying yes to it! It does help if you're a big fan of both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. I am for sure! Sandra Bullock does not disappoint, she's better than ever here! Ryan Reynolds has great chemistry with her and holds her own. It's also great seeing Betty White! The funniest character of all is that guy(cant remember his name haha) who is a male stripper one minute and then the guy who holds the wedding the next minute! There's a reason why The Proposal is dominating the awful Year One, and is even holding its own against the famous Hangover! Say yes to the Proposal! Just one thing though. What the hell was up with the previews? As much as I love Sandra Bullock, her next movie(based on the previews) is truly going to make me lose some respect for her! Oh well.",9,1,4,3 July 2009
