Deja Vu," a lot like minority report
","this movie is about a huge boat explosion, which kills 500+ people. Half the region in FBI is called in to investigate, in this team includes Denzel Washington (training day) Denzel Washington manages to excel in this investigation by finding the most clues, he is then offered a place into this other group with 'thermal equipment'.this equipment allows the team to view the past 5 days anywhere. they can view any place, any people, anything, at any angle. The problem is that this thing cannot be paused to right down a number, address etc. It can not be re winded either. It is a continuous stream.They also have another machine, which allows them to place any object into the scenery they are currently viewing to try and stop the major bomb explosion on the boat. Unfortunately, this does not work, and they push on to the last resort, sending a human back into the past, denzel washington.This was a good film, its all summed up and comes together in the end. Less action and more quality viewing.",8,3,5,5 July 2007
Get Him to the Greek," One of the best movies of 2010
","Me and my mate saw this movie as an advanced screening in Sydney on Sunday. The cinema was packed! But we didn't care as we were laughing from beginning to end - a fantastic consistency of laughs throughout the whole movie and likable characters should put this title to the top of your 'movies to watch' list.There aren't many sick jokes, including dirty slap-stick comedy. Which makes this easier to watch with family or relatives.One thing I found though, was that many scenes that were in the trailer/s aren't in the actual film.Overall, if your looking for a good time (and if you loved 'Superbad'), check out 'Get him to the Greek.'",8,0,2,13 June 2010
