Your Name.," Mesmerizing, has set a new bench mark for anime movies!
","I am an avid anime watcher and nothing compares to the quality of animation in this movie, it does it's best in expressing the beauty, culture and scenery of Japan, along with the enchanting music(Japanese version) the movie takes you to a whole different world, kudos to the team. The story is captivating and will keep you absorbed the entire time, the unexpected twists take you through a roller coaster of emotions, the English dub doesn't do justice to the original one, the meaning of phrases are much more deeper in Japanese, especially the final scenes, but that's the case with most of the Eng to Jap dub in my opinion. I am writing this after watching it the second time, Truly something you shouldn't miss out on.",10,3,4,1 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good Movie, but not a good 'Spiderman' movie!
","It's a good watch, if you aren't much into comics and the shows you will definitely enjoy the movie to some extent but if you really know who Spidey is then you will HATE most parts of the movie. First of all Spiderman never really relied on tech, In SMH we see peter doing all those great things because of his suit, the suit literally tells him what to do, when to sit when to talk and when to kiss like really! This isn't an iron man movie, I know times are changing and everything's gotta adapt that way but whoa really? You might as well give him an iron man suit while you're at it. Spiderman purely relied on his own abilities, we have seen him fight with his suit ripped to shreds and THAT makes him awesome. The Spidey sense is GONE! That's like Thor without his hammer. Also the driving force of what makes spiderman 'Spiderman' is uncle Ben, his vision to be a man like him in his own way, not some wannabe superhero trying to impress Iron man. Also spiderman is not DUMB he can hack his own suit, look through enemy's strategy and stuff with ease as opposed to in the movie. The cast was horrible, Flash is an average Indian dude playing quiz with the 5-6 people we see, he's pretty likable which is NOT supposed to happen with flash, Spidey's best friend is a fat Asian, the girl calling herself MJ is not really relevant until she calls herself that, the movie tries hard to stuff diversity in our faces, nothing wrong at all with this cast IF you are making any other movie but if you're gonna cast a black dude for superman or a white dude for black panther or cyborg then you're doing it wrong mate! The movie has some really bad logic, like the chitauri core doesn't seem harmful until the suit tells peter it's harmful, it's understandable after the x-ray machine but even before that it starts to act weird when it was pretty harmless all the time peter held it everywhere. The Washington monument is damaged and no one gives a f*ck why it happened no investigation nothing, if that happened the fat harry and peter would've been in custody for pretty long. Also the core which was starting to turn into a small sun, burning sheets and making the bag glow doesn't harm fat harry at all! The ship gets sliced into half with lasers shooting everywhere and no one even gets injured! What happened to green goblin throwing balls and vaporizing people into skeletons?",6,1,2,24 November 2017
