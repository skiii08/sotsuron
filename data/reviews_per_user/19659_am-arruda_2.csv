The Lobster," Aterribli horror film or stupid comedy? What is that????
","This movie are so bad that you fell ridiculous to see!!!!!! Maybe if you stay prepared to a poor comedy - a little better! The actors are great, Collin and Rachel are very good! But the movie????Jesus - 7.5 is absurdIt is a bad times to IMDb - the people don't see the early versions of many movies! The good today is very poor some years ago.And the critics are a decadent and not prepared to make a interesting dialog about the movies.Many, many terrible movies are receiving a good note! Compare this movie to SECONDS - FOR EXAMPLE:SECONDS is a suberd dark terror or horror drama! Deep in some good questions - a fantastic director - MUSIC - (no more good musics today)And Rock Hudson shows the one of the bests interpretations!Is time to peoples see the old great movies - NOT TO OLD! NO TIME FOR GOOD MOVIES!!!!1",4,2,7,7 January 2016
