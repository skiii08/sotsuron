First Man," A disappointment
","Continuous shaky camera. Too long. I was literally looking away more than half of the time. I myself a huge fan of space explorations, but I honestly couldn't bare this even though I get the intention of the director.
People, do yourself a favor and buy/ rent Apollo 13 and watch it again.",2,2,4,25 February 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," An excellent piece of art!
","Well..I don't write reviews. I often vote for the movies I watch, but usually not jump in to reviews, and I have to mention that I don't understand Spanish, I watched it using subtitles with original language spoken (which I don't like at all, but just watched it anyway because it had some good ratings here) I'm writing this because this one deserves it.Just watched it. From the very beginning I forgot that I can't understand a single word they speaking. The movie glued me into it so that I can't get my eyes out of it. At first, I thought its a same old story a person looking for his wife's murderer 30 years later. Sooner the movie turned in to a masterpiece by attaching romance, humour and mystery/thriller into it.The plot is well executed, casting was excellent, camera angles were directed 100% accurately to express the sadness, humor, fear and romance of different situations of characters. Every single frame constructed towards the final decision of the movie, as in missing a frame would result in a loss of information, and I think that final result beats the endings of Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects which I liked most. Also I think this still underrated at 8.5.If you still didn't watch it due to the language problem or any other concern, please watch it immediately. It's an excellent piece of art!",10,34,42,7 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Waste of time
","I'll summarize since it is late night. It's one of the movies with bad acting (except Johnny), bad screenplay and bad directing with lots of low graded funny events that I couldn't laugh. The movie could have been so much better than this. Animations are pretty decent, can't compare with major titles, but I'm sure your kids will love it. But if you're a movie lover, I would recommend to skip this.I'm giving an average of 5 out of 10. Without Johnny's pretty acting I might it lower to a 4.Come on guys, at least watch 'Star Dust' before making this kind of movies In the future.",5,0,3,5 July 2010
