The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Best 'feel good' movie of 2012!
","I cannot overstate how great this movie is. I'm truly sick of many of these users that think they are some high class film critic. 4 out of 10? Really? It's rare that a film encompasses so much of what it is like growing up with the social and moral dilemmas that nearly every one of us face at some point in our lives. This is literally a 'feel good' movie, that will leave you with an emotional high. It has a wonderful cast and an even better soundtrack. Stephen Chbosky (Director) did a phenomenal job bringing this wonderful book to the big screen & I look forward to more of his movies in this future! Go out and rent this movie now, you won't be disappointed....",10,1,2,3 October 2013
