Ali," What Happened?
","I thought 'Ali' was the story of a great Boxer, not the story of Sonny Liston, Malcolm X and The Nation of Islam. I was completely lost in the years and locations of the movie.   At least give us a small caption in the lower right-hand corner of the movie screen.  And what happened  to the `Thrilla in Manilla'.  Also,   Paul Rodriguez has more lines on the TV specials of `ALI' than in the actual movie.  I really didn't care to see how much of a womanizer Clay was.  And what is the big deal with the first visit to Africa, what a waste of time, another useless Malcolm X encounter. Smith and Foxx acted great, but Mann needs better advisors next time he tires to bring a great sports figure to the silver screen.  I'm more of a baseball fan than Boxing, So Please Keep him away from Jackie Robinson, PLEASE!!!.",Null,0,0,27 December 2001
Minority Report," What?
",The end totally contradicts everything explained at the beginning.  All the product placement made me feel like I was watching a commercial.  It also had that Running Man & Starship Troopers feel to it.  I hated those movies and now this makes 3 of the worst movies ever. Cruise and Spielberg are just puppets of Hollywood.  I just hope that M. Night Shyamalan and Peter Jackson stay away from these egotistic idiots.,1,3,8,17 August 2002
