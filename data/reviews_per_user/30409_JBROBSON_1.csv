","May contain some spoilers!!! The Worst Iron Man movie yet!!!!!!!!!May contain some spoilers!!! The Worst Iron Man movie yet!!!!!!!!! Robert Downey Jr plays his part well but you can only work with what is given to you. The rest of the cast preforms well but again you can only work with what is given to you. This movie promises the Mandarin and gives us a big helping of 'kill the story line' what the hell were you thinking Writers, Directors, Marvel Entertainment, Disney, and anyone who worked on this story. Shame on you all!!!!!From the beginning this series has gone way out of the box when it comes to keeping true to the story line and this one just knocks it way out of the state (forget about out of the park) if it was not for the tie in's with the overall story line (Avengers) I would not have gone to see this and would have same myself a lot of cash and time going to the movies.Can someone please read a comic or watch an animated series before putting this type of garbage on the big screen. I need to be invited to the next focus group. Instead of making more garbage like this please explore the other characters that could have graced the screen and maybe you would have had a hit, let's stop re-hashing the same old stuff over and over again and give us something NEW.",1,11,24,7 May 2013
