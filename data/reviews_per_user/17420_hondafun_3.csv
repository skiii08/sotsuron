First Man," I expected more.
","The effects and visualization were excellent, but I expected more sitting on the edge of my seat like I did for Tom Hanks Apollo 13. I know the movie was about Armstrong, but it was ALL about him. If I didn't know about the mission, I might have missed that Buzz was the 2nd one with him. There were only 2 glimpses of a 3rd astronaut and I don't remember hearing of a 3rd before. I made that remark to the person watching with me at the end of the movie and she completely missed that. It had me wondering if I actually saw it so I had to Google it. The movie was almost 2 1/2 hrs and some scenes moved so fast it seemed like it was edited for TV.",6,0,0,29 May 2019
Rocketman," More than what I expected.
","I love the way the story was told by going back and forth in time, while mixing in his most famous songs. Taron Egerton was amazing. At times it was hard to believe it wasn't Elton singing. At certain angles, he's also a dead ringer in looks too. I grew up with Elton John's music and saw one concert in the 70's. He's a true showman and it was accurately portrayed.",9,5,10,13 June 2019
Youth," I did not enjoy this movie
","Another reviewer said either you love it or don't get it. I found it boring, confusing at times and much too long. It says it's a comedy / drama. I saw no comedy at all. It was hard to figure out at times what was imagined and what was real. I did not understand why/how some of the characters were in it either. I first thought the ending was imagined because he was hell bent on not performing for the Queen. It was one of those movies with good reviews that I kept watching, hoping it would get better, but it didn't.",1,3,4,29 May 2019
