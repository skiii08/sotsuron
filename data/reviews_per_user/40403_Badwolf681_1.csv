Child 44," There are no murders in paradise....
","I remember picking up a copy of Child 44 (the novel) in a local bookstore and after a quick review of the subject on the back, I thought: Seems like a heavy read - but if they ever make it into a movie.... Well, I guess I should of read the book. The story has an intriguing premise of hunting a serial killer during the Stalin years of Kafka-esque USSR.As a film, it doesn't fall flat but it seems like its pulling you in two directions at once. I found that I wanted to see more of the 'killer' and understand all of his desires/tendencies - I was quite surprised to have his explanation for his actions whittled down to two inane sentences. It's a good movie. It is not a masterful piece of art in any sense, but you will learn something from it. It is just unfortunate that it leaves you wanting... wanting more information, wanting more connections, wanting more evidence and wanting more detail. and wanting to read the book.",7,1,3,15 August 2015
