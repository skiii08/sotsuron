Sucker Punch," My Review of Sucker Punch
","I give this movie a 7 out of 10. The Movie is about a young girl who is sent into an asylum by her evil step dad and then creates and alternate reality in her head in order to find a way to escape. Emily Browning did an amazing job at portraying Baby Doll, her real name (in the film) was not used because they were given stripper names. This was not just a normal asylum. During the film the director, Zack Snyder, used many different elements including music and camera angles to give a sense of suspense or shock during the scenes. What i think makes this such a great film is because it is very serious about a girl being trapped and misused, however in her alternate realities, Baby Doll gets to fight in many engaging action scenes throughout the movie instead of watching her dance on stage. Which also helps make the movie more about the character and not about half naked girls dancing on stage for fat old men smoking cigars.",7,4,6,31 March 2015
Elf," review of elf
","The elf is a Christmas film made in 2003. THe movie is something that can be watched by the whole family. the story is about a human raised in the norht pole who thinks he is an elf.However when he finds out he was adopted he leaves the north pole and travels through new york city to find his father. Buddy the elf (will Ferrell) fully embraces the role and is hilarious as he runs around the city making new friends and eating very weird things, like gum off the street and syrup spaghetti. The movie is also very original for a Christmas movie. Its like no other Christmas movie i have ever seen. In conclusion the elf is such a great movie and has won 2 awards and been nominated for 7 because of is great acting, originality, and comedy. This is why i have given the film a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,3 June 2015
Army of Darkness," best movie you'll ever watch
","This film embodies the greatness and beauty of cheesy 80/early 90s movies. It takes you on an adventure. An adventure that takes you back in time and through the darkest trenches filled with monsters.Army of Darkness is one of the greatest films you'll ever see and every second is worth it. You'll understand so many obscure jokes and all your hipster friends will feel threatened by the fact you even know what it is. Ash is such an iconic character. This movie is literally the most quotable movie in existence.10/10 for this piece of cinematic gold. Everyone must see it before they die. This movie is amazing! Through battling skeletons, witches and even a clone of himself he never fails. Even though these things may sound scary, the director finds a way to lighten the mood and take away the scary horror feel and adds a comedic feel. This movie will forever deserve a 10/10. Even though some other uncultured people on this site may not agree.",10,5,6,28 February 2015
Shrek," Shrek
","Shrek is a brilliant movie that appeals to EVERY age out there. Shrek has often been made into kids toys and given to kids as presents, while on the other hand is my 70+ year old grandfathers favorite movie ever. The story is about a mean ogre who just wants to be left alone. Shrek does not like the fact that the king has banished all mystical creatures to his swamp. So Shrek becomes friends with simple minded donkey and leaves to talk with the king. The king realizes that this strong ogre is the perfect person to find his princess and save her from the scary dragon. When Shrek does so he falls in love with the princess and needs to find a way to stop her and the kings wedding.I have given this movie a 9 out of 10 because it is hilarious, well written and full of great voice actors including Eddie Murphy. In conclusion this is a great movie and will be shown for years to come.",9,0,1,30 April 2015
