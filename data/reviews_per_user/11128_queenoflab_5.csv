The Perks of Being a Wallflower," #Relateable
","Do you want a film with Ezra Miller as Ezra Miller? You want to see Hermione doing a bad job doing an American accent? Do you want to see Ant man as Percy Jackson's mentor? If yes to any of these, that's a good reason to watch. What I loved most is how relatable the characters are, that's what made the movie. There's a kid with mental health issues trying to go through life like a normal kid, there's a gay guy dealing with the social negatives toward the gay community, and then there's are girl who's had a life of questionable decisions trying make it right. They may be in high school, but somehow, as someone who is in college, I found that I could still relate. They threw everything in here, not just LGBTQ & mental illness, they threw in bullying and even a hint of sexual assault. This was a lovely coming of age story of a kid who is surrounded by all of these issues, first hand or secondhand. This film is currently 6 years old and it's still relevant to what high school kids deal with today. Logan's performance was stellar, I think he has potential to do more meaningful roles like this and convey and emotional story. And Ezra, lol he's just Ezra, and he's a legend.",8,0,0,1 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Delightful experience! Die hard fan or not.
","Couldn't stop smiling. I loved TBE film. It honestly didn't feel like 2 hours at all. It was both entertaining and inspiring. I'm a casual fan of Queen, but I definitely have a new appreciation for them. Their story and the story of Freddy Mercury had me shed a few years. This film was a great tribute to the band, to the 70s, to culture, and to rock bands old and new.",9,2,3,10 November 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Celebration of the the Wizarding World
","When I first saw the film, I was nervous at first. There were so many expectations to live up to for this movie, and I didn't want to be disappointed. The movie starts off with a flash of magic newspapers, okay. Then it gets to the boat, Newt is there with his case, whispering to his creatures, hope and love in his eyes - that's when I knew. JK Rowling has done it again. I've seen this movie many, many, many times, but it always feels like the first time. My reactions are always the same, I laugh, cry, and smile at the same scenes just like I did opening night. What makes this movie so good is the fact that it's set in the wizarding world. What I loved about the Potter series has come back. Though it's a new setting and characters, somehow it feels so familiar. The new characters - Tina, Queenie, and Jacob - are so adorable and wholesome. Credence is a mystery to unfold and the cameo of Grindelwald foreshadows the dark future that's yet to come. The music just immerses me fully into the world, like Potter music always does. But what really makes the film is Newt Scamandar. He is the most sweetest, precious, angel bean cinnamon roll of a character Rowling has ever created. And as a Hufflepuff, like Newt, I'm totally in love with him. And as someone who was a fan of Eddie Redmayne before, I can confirm he was the perfect choice. With 4 movies to go and endless possibilities, this movie promises another magical adventure for a new generation. I trust Rowling with her storytelling, and I can't wait for what's ahead.",9,0,0,29 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," What just happened.
","As a science fiction film, this was truly revolutionary. The special effects were so impressive for being made 50 years ago. This film was disturbing, confusing, and mesmerizing and was a huge stepping stone in film making. It's weird story and timeless graphics sets it apart from other films of this genre. The topic of AI and space travel was ahead of its time. It may be hard to follow and the pacing is weird, but every scene was intentional and necessary. This was a unique experience, and even though nothing makes sense I recommend that everyone should watch this at least once.",7,1,3,18 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Hilariously Terrifying
","Usually when I laugh at a horror film it's because it's bad. But It: Chapter 2 was genuinely hilarious. Even the scary parts had me laughing with amusement & confusion. Not only did it bump up the laughs, it's was also way more disturbing and creepy and terrifying than the first. And at the end your hit with the feels cuz you're so invested in the squad fam ðŸ˜¢ My only complaint is that my FAVOURITE character died, but at least he shined throughout the movie, and the rest was so freaking epic. The cast was so great and the writing was just so good. Didn't feel like a hours at all. It was such a great movie. WATCH IT",10,17,31,8 September 2019
