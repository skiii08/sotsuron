Hereditary," Milking the stupid
","Seriously, what a waste of my time. Maybe this is about hollywood satanists jerking off to their lil boring mass and trying to make fun and mock the audience at the same time. That at least would make more sense than this 'story'.Really whoever thinks the Movie is kind of original or even scary probably did not see many good horror flicks. This film will be forgotten next year already. For most of the time it seem to be a (boring) social problem film about ugly, stupid and distorted people and you just think better not be like that poor guy and make children with a psycho :p <ul><li>Apparently not only a psycho but a satanist with personality disorder. At one moment trying to be a bad worshipper and have a miscarriage but at the end change her mind to have the devil his way with her son.</li></ul>A little boring graphic headcuttings and a comfy lil mass at the treehouse (what a pathetic church) will end the movie. Seriously to visit church on Sunday could not be more boring or stupid. A film for an American audience where people seem simple enough to feel clever after they manage to understand some unimportant detail and therefor think the overall nonsense might be probably more plausible.Next time if I see a movie directed by Aster I will know better and not waste my time again. He better try to understand why shining IS a good horror movie and why his piece of crap isn't.",3,1,4,27 September 2018
