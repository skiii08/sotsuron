The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beyond Incredible
",I love this film. It's the work of a true master filmmaker and it's a masterpiece. Irene Jacobs is perfect in her two roles. Her performance is truly flawless. Everything about this film is beautiful. Just the fact it exists is beautiful. The fact that it happened. Krzysztof Kieslowski made one of cinemas most important films ever. I really wonder what would have came next after the following Three Colors trilogy. This film will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. I'm taking it to the grave. I love this film on a personal level and I pretty much think anyone with a soul would. Those who agree with me should understand how masterful this film is.,Null,1,5,10 April 2015
The Exorcist," Masterpiece
",Complete masterpiece. Defining horror film. Films like this don't happen today. It's truly such an incredible film beyond what saying that typically means today. It was such a serious accomplishment to have made this masterpiece in the early 1970s. One of the most important films ever made. It's a landmark in film and more. One of my favorites. Best horror film ever made. As film critics Mark Kermode's favorite film I agree and it has high re-watch value,Null,0,0,21 September 2015
Heat," in my opinion heat does not get enough credit what do u think
",This movie is in my top 10 all time favorites. It's score is 7.9. id give it a 10. its also only 245 in the top 250 movies of all time list. It definitely beats a lot of the movies which beat It's 7.9 score. This movie is great and perfect. I see nothing that should make it only 7.9. you have to agree it should at least be a 9 and closer to 1 then 245. everything in it is perfect. The movie is perfect. it makes me made that its not rated higher. De Niro and Pacino are great in it and its one of their better movies. It's nice and dramatic. This is all just my opinion on the movie. what is yours. And what would you rate it for its score and in the top 250.,Null,9,17,3 March 2005
