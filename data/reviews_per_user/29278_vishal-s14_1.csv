Airlift," A Must Must watch film for every Indians
","What a film man! What a performance! I would like to say only one sentence that is 'Bhai_saab_maza_aa_gaya' The film is belongs to 1990 incident, You probably remember the moment you first heard of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, of Saddam Hussein, and of the incident that sparked off the Gulf War. In Airlift, he plays Ranjit Katyal, the unsung, unknown hero who masterminded the evacuation of thousands of Indians stranded in Kuwait in August 1990 when Saddam Hussain's army decided to take over. Akshay delivers a performance that is subtle and skilled. He weaves his way around the crisis, looking for center to his war-torn conscience-stricken character. When he finds that center, the actor builds a character who uses his negotiating skills as an entrepreneur to rescue innumerable lives from danger. I would say that you should go and watch the film it is extremely good and one of the best movie done by Akshay Kumar. He and Nimrat Kaur (The leading lady) gave the heart pumping performance. I'm telling you, after watching this epic film you'll definitely proud to be an Indian. #Must_must_watch_film.",10,3,5,24 January 2016
