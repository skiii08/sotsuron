Sucker Punch," Not what it's cracked up to be
","The commercials for this movie make it seem like an action packed nonsensical shoot-em-up style movie. Hot girls, big guns, and evil monsters.However, looks can be deceiving. This movie is definitely not completely action packed with a lack of story. Surprisingly, it does have a story....and a terrible one.The acting of the main four is terrible. It makes the fighting seem so fake and unexciting. The main character shows almost no facial expressions ever.Worst of all, the women are not even hot! I was expecting super hot women fighting all the time lots of blood and violence. But all I got was mediocre looking women fighting sometimes with bad acting, bad story, and no BLOOD! Don't waste your time watching this movie. You will be disappointed. You have been warned",4,2,5,15 September 2011
Armageddon," Hands down my favorite movie of all time
","Okay check it out I'm going to be real with all of you. Pardon my slang but REAL TALK! This movie is awesome. Okay lemme break it down for you. 1) Amazing cast - Bruce Willis with HAIR! Ben Affleck: He's sexay!Liv Tyler : She's HOT!!!!Billy Bob Thornton: Ya alright good old scientist dudeOwen Wilson: Funny man funny man and basically everybody is great okay next2) The story is super duper good!!!! You will totally be like, 'omg the world is going to end! What are we going to do?!?!?' Have no fear!!! NASA's got yo back! Oil drillers!! ya thats right bet you didn't expect that! Oh but they get the job done lemme tell you. I don't think Harry has ever missed 800 feet and by God he's not going to miss this one. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, you will cringe, you will have the time of your life!So watch this movie,give it the rating (10/10) that it deserves. I think we can all agree when I say that Armageddon is one of the best movie of all time! Step aside Titanic, Avatar, Casablanca! All hail the KING OF the Action Drama!",10,2,4,16 August 2011
