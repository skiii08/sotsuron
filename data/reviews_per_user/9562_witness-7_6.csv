Catch Me If You Can," disappointing execution and little concern for characters
","First, the good news. Christopher Walken fans will appreciate the one gem of his movie -- his supporting performance. After that, there isn't much to hold this movie together.Leonardo DiCaprio is mis-cast as someone who thrived on their anonymity -- while he happens to be one of the most over-exposed actors in Hollywood. Tom Hanks, along with his role in Road to Perdition, adds little dynamic to a key character -- seemingly taking a parallel to Dan Aykroyd's film career: a once-notable star playing forgettable roles, getting chubby from too much food and sitting on the laurels of former glory.There are a few moments of interesting character situations, but none of the characters made me care about them (besides Walken). Characters are discarded so frequently in the chase for DiCaprio that the movie seems as shiftless as his character's life. While this conveys the nature of his on-the-run existence, it leads to a film with more of a laundry list of brief encounters rather than any richer storytelling.There's an attempt to create a surrogate father-son relationship between DiCaprio and Hanks, but it is handled superficially and merely suggested. There's probably more they could have done to bring out an interesting dynamic between these two key characters. More also could have been done to bring out the dynamic of the real father's influence on the son.The movie employs the classic switch between past and future scenes, but there's no mystery in them other than the mundane details of how they will inevitably connect -- as the audience presumes from the start. A few clever escapes here and there, but they are hardly captivating, let alone memorable.To its credit, making a story about a fugitive guilty of fraudulent checks is hardly Hollywood sexy these days. But the entire experience left me expecting more from this movie.",6,0,2,22 March 2003
The Ring," Not bad for a horror movie
","Scary movies have had something of a renaissance over the past few years. After the devil-baby prime time of the early 1970s, the genre fell into horrible self-parody, high school squeal reflex actions, sex-and-death associations for post-pubescents, the franchising of countless sequels, and quick pocket change for many a B movie queen.But just when the self-parody-parody set in (e.g. 'Scary Movie'), so came a few experiments that worked: The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, etc. The Ring, owing to its Japanese origins free from the American massacre of the American massacre film, qualifies among them. While it falls short on a lot of levels, many criticisms stem from my improved expectations from scary movies of late.To its credit, the movie delivers the scares. There's enough to keep your interest throughout the film, and for the most part the movie rides the right side of the scary-silly line. There's a lot of good and convincing acting. There's a good plot with the right amount of the unexplained to keep you guessing -- a nice change from most American movies where subtlety comes with a sledgehammer.But therein also lies some of its flaws. In the end there are clearly too many questions and inconsistencies left behind. For every question that might be best left unanswered for effect (***spoiler*** : for example, how was Samara conceived, and what made her evil), there were multiple inconsistencies in the plotlines that left the movie feeling incomplete. Other areas were spelled out that either detracted from the plot or added nothing (***spoiler***: Did you really have to show Samara crawling out the the TV? ***non-spoiler***: And what did it add that Aidan turned out to be the son of Rachel and Noah in some kind of Darth Vader-lite plotline?).As for plotline, to its credit, many parts worked. However, some did not. There were a few scenes where I had a far greater urge to laugh (and did) at a ridiculous situation than be frightened by it. And while unravelling the mystery makes for a good story, the 40,000-ft view of this movie is little more than a fatalistic episode of Scooby Doo.Sorry, but contrary to some opinions here, the child actor (David Dorfman) who played Aidan was stiff, annoying, and wholly unconvincing. It made me realize how much of a joke 'Sixth Sense' could have been without Mr. Osment. By the end I was hoping for some kind of mythical man-month math, wanting Aidan to watch 7 copies of the tape so they could eliminate his character in a single day. But the performances by Naomi Watts and particularly Brian Cox are solid.Some scenes interestingly struck me as something lifted completely out of Japanese comic books or anime -- like the scene where Noah is first walking up to Rachel's apartment in the rain in his hooded coat, his wet hair flying about.The fact that I wrote this much about it says something. Despite all its flaws, it's a good movie (7/10). But the gaping holes and questions at the end are too much to call it a classic by any means.",7,0,0,31 March 2003
Inside Out," Why did Pixar remake the TV show 'Herman's Head'?
","If you remember the early 90s TV show, Herman's Head, you probably know about how its impact on TV was more how its cast powered The Simpsons. And if you remember the premise at all, you'd remember how silly an idea it was.Which makes it shocking that Pixar decided to essentially turn it into an animated movie about an 11-year-old girl disaffected by a family move.Minor character spoilers ahead - but nothing you wouldn't see in a movie review. The execution is generally Pixar quality. But there are some major story design flaws. Why is Joy the dominant emotion and the rest are just problems? They tried to make peace with it through Sadness later on, but it still came off as a forced attempt to validate the value of any of her other emotions. The rest is very much an Alice in Wonderland/Wizard of Oz story, which is great for kids. Good humor. Some cute staging of scenes. But the 11-year-old played by Amy Poehlers voice is very one-dimensional in her transformation. There are enough Pixar employees who capture San Francisco quite well, but this might have worked better as a kid moving to Minnesota.",6,3,22,6 February 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrix Overloaded: Great eye candy, overwrought plot
","If you haven't seen the first Matrix movie, this sequel is utterly incomprehensible. For those who have seen the first, it manages to be just incomprehensible.It seems that the Wachowski brothers took a clever original idea and infused it with a huge budget and equivalent Hollywood hype, took themselves too seriously, and allowed the cliches of other huge-budget Hollywood action blockbusters influence their decisions.On the good side, the movie oozes with style -- in character appearance, set, and in the original creation of the 'action stylist' profession. The movie works well as a series of loosely connected vignettes constructed to deliver violence, special effects, and/or character interactions.But as a whole, it breaks down under the weight of a thin plot that tries to be too heavy. The philosophy of choice is laquered on too thickly -- as if the screenwriting required emergency plot implant surgery during development. The man vs. machines theme borders too close to the Terminator franchise. The epic battle theme steals too much from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars (and in fact, during the movie's massive Zion 'rave' scene, I couldn't help but think 'Ewok party for the new millennium'). You're left thinking, 'Haven't I seen all this 20 times before?'But the eye candy is good. In fact, this would probably be a much better movie experience if I couldn't understand English. (A common theme I've noticed among Keanu Reeves movies.) This is exactly the kind of 'flying monkeys from space' American movie that Eddie Izzard quotes in his 'Dressed to Kill' -- the spectacle is so grand that you can't help but shove more money into the concession stands for a steady diet of popcorn and soda.And without adding any spoilers on the ending, let's just say that early on you can completely foresee the potential for the movie to end with parallels to what Star Wars did with 'The Empire Strikes Back' (as the second of three movies). Thus if Zion's rave scene didn't satisfy the Ewok requirement for 'The Matrix Revolutions,' I fear what vile horrors the Wachowskis are going to deliver in Fall 2003. 6/10",6,0,0,17 May 2003
The Dark Knight Rises," Tired formula needs a mercy killing
","Strip away the visuals and the cinematography, and this movie screams self-parody. There's nothing new to say in this franchise that hasn't been beaten over your head in previous movies. It's no Batman Begins or the Dark Knight, which were solid movies. But this time the franchise jumped the shark.The formula broke under the weight of its own hyperbole. So tired and overwrought, I completely lost interest. Self-important high drama, big bad city terrorism, evil trying to outdo itself with every sequel, fabricated family drama we've seen many flavors of before. Even the surprises were no longer surprises.I felt nothing watching this flick. Well, with the exception that I just wanted everybody to die in a fiery ball of neutron bomb death to end the franchise as a mercy killing.Please make it stop, Nolan.",4,2,5,5 July 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Jackson could have improved on the books' flaws
","What won't be said about this over-exposed and somewhat over-glorified movie by now?It's fantastic that Jackson completed the series in tact, with great continuity, in an engaging fantasy -- staying true to much beloved books.[***SPOILERS AHEAD***]That said, Jackson arguably missed an opportunity to develop a movie that improved upon the flaws in the source books. The much-publicized never-ending story ending is just one. Making 45 minutes out of an appendix was more than a bit of a waste. And 45 minutes of crying, hugging hobbits tested my patience far too long.At the same time, I couldn't help but feel that these characters -- who had time to develop in the movie as little more than monster-bait -- made no emotional connection to me over the past 3 movies. And yet I felt wholly manipulated by 45 minutes of tears and hugging as if Jackson was trying to get an emotional response out of me that was never there to begin with. But at least it wasn't as horrid as the Star Wars Ewok conclusion...And then there's Lord Denethor -- written into the books, but a character whose self-immolation death wish for himself and his remaining son added absolutely zilch to the story and movie. But Jackson, staying true to the books, left in what was useless storyline fodder -- fodder that should have otherwise staved off my early rush to the bathroom by being left on the cutting room floor. My kingdom for an editor...That said, what's good definitely outweighs the flaws. A very good, albeit not great, movie.",7,1,2,3 January 2004
