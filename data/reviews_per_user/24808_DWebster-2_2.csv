Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A bit below expectations
","I rated it a 6. It didn't live up to the tradition of the Star Wars films - the characters weren't well developed, and the plot could have been easier to follow.  The pod racing segment, which must have lasted nearly half an hour, interrupted the flow of the movie.  Way too much use of computer-generated and 'cartoonish' characters this time - maybe to create a larger market for toy sales?  If asked why a person just can't sit back and enjoy it for the escape that it is, I'd answer that a person can't help but expect it to be at the same level of excellence as the last three were.  >",6,0,1,21 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Excellent film, but you don't know it until after it ends
","My overall rating is 9.5 which is arrived at as follows:First 95% of the film is a 7. Its OK, but it drags in spots. Last 5% of the film is a 10.  Surprise ending brings the film up from fairly good to excellent.  And, after leaving the theater, your mind will review everything you saw, and you will want to see it a second time, just to see if everything agrees with the surprise ending.  The only movie I ever saw that got better (in my mind) after I left.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
