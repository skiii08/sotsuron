Howl's Moving Castle," Not what I expected, in a good way
","I'm not a giant fan of anime movies, I never know if I'm getting a 'tee hee' kids type or one that has a guy with 4 snake heads in his crotch. So for the most part I just kind of stay away unless I know for sure what it really is. My kids and I sat down and decided to gives Howl's Moving Castle a view. I was a fan from about 15 minutes in, very good voice casting, the music score is brilliant, and the lasting appeal was evident when my kids were watching it again the very next morning. The story was very good, kept me anxious to see what happened next. Each character is mysterious enough to get you to want to explore what more there is to them. There is plenty of beautiful scenes where the color and the landscapes pull you in, and for a brief time, engulf you in the splendor of the story. I would recommend this to anyone who is relatively new to anime movies, this one is safe for kids. Mine are 10 and 6 and both loved it. My oldest even requested the Howl's Moving Castle paperback for Christmas this year.",8,0,1,29 December 2014
