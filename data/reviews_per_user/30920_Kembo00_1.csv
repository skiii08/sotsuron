Raiders of the Lost Ark," A wonderful ode to B movies of the 20-30's.
","This movie is Spielberg and Lucas at their best. A personal all-time favorite that anyone can enjoy. All I can say is , 10 10 10 10 10 10. If you liked old action serials like Zorro, or, any of Yakima Canutt's movies, you can't go wrong with Raiders!",10,0,0,26 March 2002
