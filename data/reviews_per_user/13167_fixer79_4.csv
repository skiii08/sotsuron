Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Timeless classic
","This movie is one of my favourite pictures of all time. I got into animation mainly because of this film. Not only is the animation the best that you'll ever see, the story as well is incredibly well. In my film school, in screenwriting class,  we saw this film as an illustration of how to write a good movie script. Even though it is not the first live action/cartoon cross-over, it is by far the best you'll ever ever see. No-one will ever come close to what director Bob Zemeckis and his cast and crew did in the movie genre.I was 9 years old when this film came out. When my mother took me to the theater I actually wanted to see Rambo III but wasn't allowed. So we went to see Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I literally stayed on my seat after the film was over to watch the next screening of it.(I don't think that's possible anymore in theaters nowadays...)I didn't hear my mother complain.Other films have been made using the same techniques, like Space Jam and Osmosis Jones. Even those two films together are peanuts next to Roger Rabbit. It would be like comparing 'Dungeons & Dragons'(the movie) and 'Dragonheart II' with 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.",10,1,1,10 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great book, great film
","I went to see the movie the day I finished reading to book. It totally blew me away! Everything was so perfect, from screenplay to props to visual FX.A lot from the book was simplified or deleted, but that's unavoidable when you're translating something from one format to another. Unlike other recent fantasy films (like Episode One), the Visual FX primarily help tell the story, without overwhelming it.Anyway, This is definitely the best film of the year. Some films deserve to be hyped up!",10,1,1,13 February 2002
Batman Begins," Batman begins good
","I just saw the movie at its avant premiere yesterday in Brussels and I must say that I was impressed. I particularly liked the believability and quality of the story. It's even the best story I've seen in a comic movie since many a year, topping both X-Men and Spidey's plot. I was a bit afraid that there would be too much lame jokes in it (Ã  la Fantastic Four's 'Look at me'/'I can't'), but the film's humor was well timed and hit the spot every time. As a lifetime fan of Kane's Bat, I was happy...very happy even, with this new beginning... But will it be able to make us forget Michael Keaton and Tim Burton? I think not. Damn good try though.",8,1,2,14 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The 'Harry Potter' saga deserves all the credit it has gotten.
","I was one of those adults who were very sceptical about the hype around JK Rowling and the saga she had created. I thought it was just another childrens book. Until I actually read it. I was completely stunned by the first Harry Potter book and the way it was written. Rowling is truly one of the best authors for children. The girl's got some talent! I've read every Harry Potter book available and they get better and better.The movie adaptation is flawless as well. It's a movie where parents will enjoy it as much as their youngsters. The storyline is pretty complex (for a family movie), with lots of twists and turns. In fact I'm amazed that kids get it all. They do get wittier don't they? I remember, in my days, I had trouble getting the plot of some He-Man episodes...",Null,0,0,11 June 2003
