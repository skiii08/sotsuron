Mission: Impossible III," Good stuff
","Mission Impossible 3 did what it was meant to do - obviously no-one seeing it is expecting a deep film commenting on big issues. Good entertainment and it kept the tension as explosions erupted scene after scene. Despite Tom Cruise (who i've never been a fan of), it's definitely worth a look. Philip Seymour Hoffman is particularly chilling as the bad-guyI thought it was an improvement on the other two, so definitely worth it if you're into action movies! And who doesn't occasionally enjoy an easy to watch action with amazing technology, daring stunts and a build-up of tension?Good stuff",8,3,5,6 May 2006
