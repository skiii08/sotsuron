The Avengers," Awesome and Entertaining
","Just got back from watching this movie. This was a very entertaining movie. There are a lot of spots in the movie that refer to other superhero movies before the hero even comes into play. I love the fact that if you were able to watch all these movies, the movie ties it all together. People, I highly recommend that you watch both Iron Man movies, Captain America, and Thor before you watch this. It makes it much more enjoyable. You can still watch it without watching them, it will just make much more enjoyable. Also, I feel this movie was well balanced and engaging. HULK and Stark had me laughing. Not stop action from start to finish.",10,6,13,13 May 2012
