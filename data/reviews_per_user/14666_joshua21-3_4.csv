United 93," Out of the frightening events that occurred on September 11, 2001, this is the most emotional and heroic.
","'United 93' is the story of love, emotion, and heroism that surrounded the dreaded events of September 11.Director Paul Greengrass does an incredible job in recreating the events that occurred on that day. His shaky camera operations truly put the audience into the movie, so to speak.The film starts off with the last prayer of the hijackers of United Airlines flight 93, and then one of its accomplice's saying that 'It's time.' The passengers file onto the plane without any expectations that they would later die that day. Greengrass and his editors take the audience for a ride that alternates between the situation in the plane and the air traffic control centers dealing with other hijackings at the exact same time.Director Greengrass has commented that he feels it is time that a film can and should be made surrounding the events that occurred on that day, and I for one believe that he is right. The first step toward peace, in my opinion, is to make sure that this will always be remembered, and that such ghastly things should never even be conceived again.As for the technicalities of the film, I believe that this film, of those made this year, has an enormous chance at being nominated for Best Director, Best Sound, Best Sound Mixing, Best Picture, and Best Editing at the 2007 Oscars.Overall, this film combines an incredibly strong sense of realism and emotion as best as can be, and to truly understand how incredible it is, one should experience it for oneself.",9,5,12,30 April 2006
Spider-Man 3," WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! (also very funny although not meant to be)
","Here are a few words to sum up Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman 3': awful, terrible, awful, awful, awful, funny for the wrong reasons, piece-of-s**t, horrible, horrid, moronic, boring, fake, horrible effects, worst movie (perhaps) of all time, terrible, terrible, terrible, Ed Wood could have made a better film than this, terrible script, stupid 'emo-ness', could be better as a soap opera on TV, terrible, you shouldn't see this film for any other reason other than laughing your butt off for all the wrong reasons (and if you like it you must be the biggest moron on the face of this Earth), terrible, awful, dreadful, George Lucas writes better stuff than that...etc.",3,1,3,19 May 2007
The Departed," I'm voting for it but I can't find the 11 on the scale.
","Martin Scorcese's 'The Departed' is by far the best film of 2006. Winner of four Academy Awards, it is a work of pure genius and great film-making skills from all departments. Director Martin Scorcese shows his most thrilling and wonderful talents as director of this wonderful film. It follows a Colin Sullivan, played with much ease by Matt Damon, who is taken in by the notorious L-Street mobster Frank Costello, played by the remarkable Jack Nicholson. At the same time that Sullivan infiltrates the Boston State Police Department, a Billy Costigan, in Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, rises up in the ranks of the police and infiltrates Costello's underworld. Costigan must face the dangers of leading a double life every day as well as confrontations with Sergeant Dignam, played exceptionally well by Mark Wahlberg, and is mentored by Officer Queenan, played by the always great Martin Sheen. Trouble ensues as the plot twists and turns in every single direction. With one thrilling scene after another, this film is remarkable in every single way, and will stay that way forever.",10,2,4,8 October 2006
Sin City," Three interconnecting stories filled with lies, passion, and vengeance are beautifully put together from master filmmaker Robert Rodriguez & Frank Miller.
","This film is not only beautiful in terms of sight and sound, but also in story and symbolism. The action is again masterfully directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, and brings about a certain mystery to the entire concept as well as keeping the audience's attention. The set design is incredibly well generated, with the roof tops of Basin City appearing to be the roof tops of other large cities like Los Angeles. This film blends the perfect amount of film noir with today's standard of color films. This film is truly a treat for the eyes, ears, and minds of many across the globe, since it deals with issues that even some of the most sure-headed politicians cannot handle. You should see this film as soon as possible, because I'm sure that you will finish watching that film and reminisce about it for the rest of your life.",8,2,4,20 March 2006
