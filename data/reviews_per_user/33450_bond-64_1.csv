3:10 to Yuma," 2007 vs 1957
","Saw both yesterday (Friday). Glenn was better than Russell. Christian a lot better than Van Heflin. Foster a whole lot better than Jaeckel. Women: The women in both pictures are presented in very unflattering light. One, the bartender, is of low morals that beds Wade in 2 minutes and the other is the disapproving wife of Dan that drives him to desperate acts. The 2 boys of the Rancher: 1957 - in background only (OK). 2007 - older boy (wise, knowing, directors eye (?)) saves the day and acts as a foil to his dad (UGH). Better idea: Rancher has NO kids and NO wife and there is a male bartender. As expected, the technical aspects are an order of magnitude better after 50 years. Scenery is good. Very watchable film.The 2007 ending was more unreal (everyone in town trying to kill them and missing) than the 57 version and more of a downer. The 07 beginning has a Gatling gun on the stage which is not very effective (strange) and when the town finds out about the stage robbery there is no mention of reclaiming the Gatling gun (stranger).Under the banner of 'Hollywood just can't help itself' (Keeps the whole cast on the must INVITE list). A Pinkerton man utters the modified 'n' word and is shot. A Pinkerton man disparages the oriental railroad work crew and is shot. A Pinkerton man (Fonda) admits to killing young Indian children and is thrown off a cliff.(no such scenes in the 57 version) Wade (07) is a self realized man, looks for redemption and is close to the hero of the picture while Wade (57) shows a little gratitude for Dan saving his life and is a unrepentant sinner, but likable, to the end. Dan (07) knocks the Union because they only paid him 198.50 for his shot off leg which does not hinder him in the lease in the last reel when he jumps and runs all over town. Dan (57) is just a troubled man with both legs working.I think the problem with both is the source material... The story is just not very good and does not work from any perspective.... I would not waste time seeing either one again. But 07 was a bigger disappoint because of the quality of the whole cast that was involve",5,7,16,8 September 2007
