The Lobster," Nihlistic. emotionally numb film, with scenes of cruelty and torture
","The first 30 minutes of the movie is interesting -- with strange scenes introducing the hotel where you MUST meet your soul mate or be turned into an animal. However: later in the movie there are scenes of terrible cruelty.I came out of this movie feeling depressed and manipulated and I feel very strongly that there may be CIA involvement in the production of this movie. The CIA has helped produce movies before (including 'Zero Dark Thirty') and this movie is NOT designed to entertain. It is designed to desensitize the viewer toward to suffering of others (emotional and physical) and manipulate the viewer into viewing leftover, unattached, single people as worthless and not worthy of any compassion.",2,10,15,6 July 2016
Star Trek," Soul less, life less, CGI laden reboot
","This was by far the worst Star Trek material I've ever seen, and I've seen almost every episode of the Next Generation. The cast are portrayed as petulant, spoiled teenagers with unexplained angst. The villain is completely unconvincing and his motivation is not well explained. WORTHLESS remake/reboot.Spoiler: a time travel technique is used to completely destroy the past so that the canon/history of Star Trek is now reset to zero and they can make the new series anything that they want. Now, all of the adventures of Spock and Kirk never happened. The new reboot could only appeal to people who have never seen the original Star Trek. Everyone else should steer clear of this awful blowup doll.",1,2,4,4 August 2016
Captain Marvel," bland, formulaic, with cringey moments abounding
","Just a nothing burger movie with far LL eft, anti-male politics ...... riot grrrl type female empowerment movie..... (dog whistle for radical lesbos that have TDS) ..... Just Blahh at best ....... Sorry but this movie is a massive FAIL.",2,13,30,9 March 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Most overrated movie I've ever seen.
","Interesting movie explores contrast between fame, celebrity, prestige, and artistic integrity. It does have some good scenes, but the characters are so pretentious and ego-centric that they are not sympathetic. The scene where Michael Keaton locks himself outside the theater and has to run a gauntlet of fans, musicians, and doormen to get back inside the theater in time to do his lines --- that was the highlight of the movie for me. (This was about midway through the film). I still had high expectations for some kind of big moment of self-realization or high drama by the end of the movie. Sadly, the movie did NOT improve but became increasingly nonsensical to the point of being dishonest and manipulative towards the audience. I've seen similar movies that explore the creative process that were MUCH better than this one: 'The Big Picture' (1989) and 'Living in Oblivion'(1995). In a way, this movie reminds me of 'My Dinner with Andre', a critically successful movie that can only be well understood by theater arts majors (with knowledge of obscure works that most people have NEVER heard of). We all had to pretend to like it because we were told by the critics how great the movie was.",5,35,75,24 December 2014
