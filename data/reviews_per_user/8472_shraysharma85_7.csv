Iron Man 3," All's well except THE END!
","Well to start off, the movie had a great plot and amazing visual effects, would not even dare talk about RDJ, he is a class act and perhaps the most suited for the Tony stark role. The film almost rushes through as a joy ride, covering almost each and every aspect of Iron Man franchise- plot, emotions, brilliance in technical aspects, action, visual effects and most importantly the humorous Tony Stark.. The movie has its share of moments when you are just at the edge of street and are at times admiring the brilliance of a genius Stark possesses. What does come of as a surprise is that if you are aware of comic books, you would be knowing the looks of Mandarin, which might come out a little indigestible. Having said that it does not take away the credit that should be given to Shane Black for his effort. He has pulled off a great plot and would make you fall in love with RDJ all over again. The performances are great, Guy pearce is great in fact post Memento, to me he has looked pretty substantial NOW(That's a long time) Paltrow is impressive, whereas Sir kingsley seems a little too wasted for the movie, though he still creates an impact. It kills me to see such a class actor wasted. RDJ, let's not even discuss him, HE IS A CLASS APART. All in all a movie worth a watch and fun ride!",7,2,6,26 April 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Fast paced ride
","Initially i was a lil skeptical about watching this one. No matter how strong the cast of this is and especially all the previous racers and characters coming together, it was a SEQUEL and usually they are disappointing. But this one i bet is one of the best sequels ever.. Keeps up to the name it definitely is fast, almost throughout there is no dull moment and you just can't afford to even blink your eye! Justin lin has sketched each character so magnificently, that you just can't avoid it. Great storyline and full of past paced action, Lin keeps you guessing in this one. The action sequences look for real and impressive. Though all the previous stars are back in this one, every single one of them has an important role to play, and every single one of them looks good. But YET they all look ohh so fresh.. The background score keeps you alive, and execution spellbound. Especially the 1st introduction seen of Shaw and the car chase on Spanish highway.. But the showstopper is the finale, the climax on the military base. Every actor has looked impressive, Vin diesel is impressive love struck leader out to save his girl, Dwayne Johnson as high on muscle supercop (resembles the role of Roadblock from GI Joe), Tyrese impresses with his comic timing and paul walker is good.. Sung kang and Ludicrous are great too in the performances, but What impresses me most are Michelle Rodriguez and Luke evans as the ultimate antagonist. He looks stylish amazing and absolutely classy in his role. Probably the best he has looked so far. Overall, the movie keeps you stuck on the seat, and yes there is a bit of a surprise element by the end of this one and i am sure you would be waiting for the next installment after that.. So make sure you do watch till the closing numbers start!!! Fast was this and made surely someone else furious for 7!!",8,7,11,25 May 2013
Captain America: Civil War," This takes it to Next level
","To be true Captain America has always come out to be the most boring superhero to me after Superman so far, but with the coming of Civil Wars the perception has turned around 360.With a great story line and brilliant cinematography the movie illuminates the screen with the lights of interest. The character build up, the twist in the tale and the coming together of superheroes to fight against each other instead of the usual alongside is what makes this one stand apart. I think it would only be fair to say that it confuses the audience to choose the side you would be on. Be it the debut of Black Panther or introduction of otherwise naive but humorous Spidey or the looping in of Ant-man all credits to the script writer it blends in perfectly and seamlessly. The stand out scenes for me would perhaps be the revelation to Iron Man about his background and the Spidey take on Ant Man. Though, considering the movie standards might seem a little normal (that's probably because of the overall execution being next level) but as compared to the rest of the movies looks much better. I particularly enjoyed the clash of both the Superheroes to the core. He is my friend, So was I..!! had a bit of snappy emotion attached to it. Performances for me Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. (of course the sauciness) steal the show, Scarlett Johnson reprising the Black Widow role is a delight to eyes. Paul Rudd and Tom Holland (as Spidey) do accumulate the humor in the action sequence. Martin Freeman and Paul Bettany have been wasted as they don't have much to do in this edition. Daniel Bruhl, I feel is the weakest link in the movie, as I had expected much better from the Rush Star this time around.Russo brothers have made an impact for me definitely. But all in all I think it is a great ride throughout. Captain America : Civil war",8,2,9,26 May 2016
Avatar," An inspirational saga that is a Visual Delight and leaves you asking for more!
","Not everyday you come across a theme which not only touches your heart, but also inspires you and makes you wonder about your own existence. This has to be Cameron's best work till date. Everything inhuman about anything comes essentially from Humans. The movie revolves around a larger than life planet Pandora, epitome of beauty and a place to die for, which is under an attack from the aliens, in this case HUMANS. The Na'vi's are the original natives and its there land which is sacred to them. The land is mesmerizing with bright colorful forests and life, floating mountains, holds a lot of scientific importance. The humans want to en cash on the rich resources to become rich themselves. The execution, direction and screenplay has been exceptional as each emotion has been captured in an amazing fashion. The movie comes of as an inspiration and teaches how will can take charge over the body and how love and compassion reaches to a higher stature than any of the riches of the world. The shots and visuals are absolutely breath taking which might even get you to the edge of your seats. The scenes that create a deep impact are the ones where the Toruk Macto rises and delivers a motivational speech, sheerly for the strong lines and great background score. The scene of home tree destruction leaves an impact of sadness and despair. The effects and the showcasing of beauty is sure to leave any audience spell bound. Background score and music through out are heart touching and spirit lifting. Sigourney Weaver, Laz Alonso and Michelle Rodriguez pull out strong performances, but the show stoppers here would be Sam Worthington as a fighter with never say die attitude, Zoe Saldana as a Dream alien wife, who lives by her principals and is a die hard patriot and a passionate lover and last but definitely not the least Stephen Lang as the mean Bad a** Colonel Quaritch. For me it is the movie of this decade, stunning visual effects, heart touching music and lasting dialogs, absolute classic performances and an inspirational story line, this is sure to steal your hearts and attention. You need to watch it to believe this Cameron Visual Delight, that leaves you asking for more!!",9,2,5,12 April 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Laugh - Stock and fun in a BARREL
","Well to start of the UK accent definitely makes a few of the dialogs a bit difficult to understand. But nevertheless the fun and the mess doesn't need a lot of dialogs.. Does it.. The performances are superb especially Vinnie Jones as big Chris and Barry the baptist.. But the protagonists all of them have pulled off a superb show. Coming back to the theme, its sort of a comedy of errors where a lot of confusion, money exchanging hands takes place.. Though i loved the way the Guy Ritchie, put all the intro and the characters into perspective, what really impressed me was an equally amazing conclusion and summing up of the movie.. The direction and the execution of the movie was superb and like most of the movies with a great script loose track in the middle of the movie, this kept the pace and fun going through out.. What really impressed me was the right mix of each element at the right time, some of the most agonising and painful scenes do still make you laugh, owing to the right mix. And to top it all the background score, for sure it is one of the best i have come across! All in all a definite one time watch for fun and a lot of fun!",8,0,2,11 April 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Its a Masterpiece
","By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme.As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls.Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.",9,0,1,27 August 2013
Munich," A visit to the tragic time
","Steven Spielberg, is the most efficient director in Hollywood. It takes a classic work of art to take you back into some period and make you experience what the people would have faced. Steve has done this with perfection. The execution of the film, has been absolutely spectacular. It makes you feel as if you are in the middle of the things and makes your heart go out to them. The script has been written in a brilliant manner and the scenes of the massacre are heart tearing, I am sure a few tears would be rolling down. The music and images drill deep inside you and leave a lasting impact. From the performances point of view Eric bana stands out, has been the best suited to the role. Perhaps this can be surely called one of his best performance ever. Daniel craig looks good as an aggressive israeli, but could have been better. Geoffrey rush and other cast has done a great job too.. All in all it was an eric bana film. Perhaps, that was the only thing lacking in the film, what could have been shown as a movie for the nation with a bigger perspective, in some scenes was left restricted to a single man movie. But that definitely does not take the credit away from it being a superb movie, which should be watched by everyone.",7,0,0,21 April 2013
