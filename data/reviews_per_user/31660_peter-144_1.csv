Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Disappointing Script
","Visually stunning but appears to  have been made for an audience with an extremely short attention span. The story, and script, are, sadly, extremely weak and every place, person and incident is explained by one of the actors all the time in a slow ponderous way as if a teacher was speaking to a dim witted illiterate!! What a pity Lucas did not spend some money on the script!  Liam Neeson tries valiantly but looks like he cannot believe the lines he has been given to say. No wonder he announced his retirement from Films.",2,0,1,19 May 1999
