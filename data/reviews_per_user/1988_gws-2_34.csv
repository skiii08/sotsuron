The Devil's Advocate," Flawed Film Outstanding Performances
",Al Pacino is at his eat-the-scenery best in 'Devil's Advocate.'  Keanu Reaves and Charlize Theron also stand out in a uniformly talented cast. It is a good thing that the performances are so good because the movie is flawed by over-length and excessive brutality.,7,2,3,22 April 2000
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Tasteless and Offensive but FUNNY
","Anyone who is likely to be offended by sex jokes, anti-Semitic and other ethnic jokes, or scatological humor would be well advised to stay away from 'Borat' -- make that far away. But for those with a suitably twisted sense of humor, the movie is world class fun.'Borat' achieves a level of inspired nuttiness I had not seen since the height of the Monty Python oeuvre. There is something about British humor that allows thorough silliness but (seeming) earnestness and seriousness, too. Our protagonist, Borat Sagdiev a Kazakhstani TV reporter, comes to America to report on 'the greatest country in the world.' During the course of his adventures, Borat learns about the intricacies of indoor plumbing and vows to marry Pamela Anderson  to whom he later proposes at a book signing, promising Pamela her own plow if she will have him. And so it goes.Some reviewers have found high minded messages in Borat. I, in stark contrast, thought that it was simply a very funny guy  Sacha Baron Cohen, the star and co-writer of the piece  creating some very funny situations of an earnest but naïve visitor to our shores dealing with culture shock of a high order in a raunchy but inspired way. Messages aside, it's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended, 9 out of 10",9,7,19,3 November 2006
Training Day," Brutal but Effective Film Noir
","I had put off seeing 'Training Day' until it came to the premium movie channels on cable.  I only watched then because of the critical acclaim Denzel Washington's performance had received.  I'm glad I finally saw it. Alonzo Harris (Washington) is a murderous, delusional, manipulative sociopath but we almost like him despite ourselves.  Ethan Hawke gives the best performance of his career as the idealistic but thrill seeking, Jake Hoyt who, to his ultimate sorrow, is assigned as Harris's partner on the LAPD narcotics detail.  Some have complained that the final scenes of the film are preposterous.  While this may be so, these scenes are effective and tell an exciting and engaging story.  Harris's irredeemable sleaziness is almost too much to bear, but the movie succeeds, nevertheless.  Highly recommended, 8 out of 10.",8,0,11,24 October 2002
Erin Brockovich," Exciting Fiction -- An Oliver Stone Movie Without Oliver Stone
","'Erin Brockovich' tells a ripping tale.  Julia Roberts is appealing in the title roll and has never been more charming and charismatic.  Albert Finney as the lawyer for whom Roberts works is, as usual, masterful.  As recent press reports have revealed, however,  the interesting, exciting story the movie tells is only incidentally similar to the events it purportedly depicts.  But that's all right.  This is entertainment, not history.  As we all know, when we hear the term, 'Based on a true story!'  we should be warned that the emphasis is on the word 'based' and a whole lot of the truth is sacrificed to the needs of dramatic story-telling.  Oliver Stone has done this sort of thing a lot, most prominently in 'JFK' and 'Nixon':  good films that mix historical fact with outrageous fiction in the name of dramatic license.  8 out of 10.",8,1,1,21 June 2001
Monster," A Downer
","This profoundly depressing tale is saved -- in part -- only by the great performances of its stars, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci. Theron richly deserved her Oscar and Ricci's performance was probably her best to date.Despite these wonderful performances, I felt cheated because I could find no empathy for either character. Aileen Wuornos was a psychopathic killer. Her friend Selby was weak and manipulative. After nearly two wearing hours spent watching this film I was left wondering, 'What was the point?' People with traits like these are not promising material for a movie, it seems to me. 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,20 December 2004
Shakespeare in Love," A Beautiful Fantasy
","'Shakespeare in Love' is a beautiful, lyrical masterpiece.  Shakespeare's beautiful words, supported by Stephen Warbeck's music the beauty if its star, Gwyneth Paltrow, and its sumptuous costumes make this warmhearted and funny fantasy a pleasure from beginning to end.  One does not have to know much about either Shakespeare or his times to enjoy the movie but if one does have a bit of this knowledge, the film is even more fun.",10,0,0,24 March 2001
Finding Nemo," One of the great animated films
","`Finding Nemo' is one of the best, perhaps THE best, animated films ever made  in a class with the Disney masterpieces, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' `Pinocchio,' and `Bambi.'  It is gorgeous to look at, exciting, funny  often very funny  and moving. `Finding Nemo' is a great film, 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,18 January 2004
Milk," Much to be commended but ultimately uninvolving
","Milk has a lot in it that is very good. The cinematography, by Harris Savides, is beautiful, as is the original music by Danny Elfman. I deeply admired Sean Penn's bravura performance in the title role, his Best Actor Oscar was well deserved. Josh Brolin, as Milk's killer Dan White also gave an affecting performance.Now to what I liked less. Despite a well written screenplay, for which Dustin Lance Black won an Oscar, I found the story rather uninteresting. But blame that on me, not Milk. Milk's activism in support of gay rights was always a mixed bag to me. He was absolutely right to fight tooth and nail against the anti-gay and homophobic attitudes of Anita Bryant and her fellow True Believers who supported the viciously repressive Proposition 6. Nevertheless, Milk's harsh criticism of gays who wanted to keep quiet about their orientation always made me uncomfortable. That decision should always be a matter of personal choice and not questioned in an attempt to gain more political power, or so it seems to me. I should observe finally that Harvey Milk was a powerhouse, a charming, charismatic leader, so he was appropriately celebrated in this film. On balance, I give Milk a marginal recommendation, 6 out of 10.",6,3,9,10 March 2009
The Bodyguard," A Less That Mediocre Thriller
","Usually one can count on high production values to make even a bad Kevin Costner movie interesting.  Alas, despite having high production values, 'The Bodyguard' was a bore.  Let me count the ways:  slow plot, preposterous story, and bad acting -- particularly by Whitney Houston.  In fairness, I should say that the completely unbelievable conduct of Houston's character does serve to make her performance seem even worse than it was.  Costner does not a bad faux Steve McQueen as the existential and dour (depressed?) athletic pretty boy, Frank Farmer.  But his performance does not save the film.  Indeed, I doubt that De Niro could have saved it.  Spend two hours and ten minutes elsewhere; not recommended; 5 out of 10.",5,4,7,2 March 2002
Watchmen," A dark but brilliant near masterpiece
","I saw Watchmen today without knowing any more than the broad outlines of what it is about. Those of you who expect a comic book based movie to be a feel good epic with the superhero saving the world and getting the girl should forget about it. This is a dark and disturbing story. It's saving graces are its thoughtful nature and how beautiful it is to look at and listen to. Some of the graphics are awe inspiring and the music works very well There is much to think about here, too. In fact, I am still thinking about it.Try it, you might like it, I did. 9 out of 10.",9,4,10,8 March 2009
Cast Away," A Thoughtful and Moving Film
","'Cast Away' is, at once, both a simple and a complex film.  At its core, it is the story of a man who survives a plane crash and lives for four years alone on a deserted Pacific island.  But it also deals with the profound changes in its hero's life after his rescue, wrought by four years in isolation under circumstances that had long ago convinced all his friends and loved ones that he was dead.  In a role in which many actors might have been tempted to eat the scenery, Tom Hanks is restrained and always believable. 'Cast Away' avoids easy answers, so it is ultimately ambiguous and a little sad -- as parts of all of our lives are ambiguous and a little sad.  Not to be missed.  10 out of 10.",9,0,0,19 January 2002
U-571," Lavish Attention to Detail Spoiled by Weak Story
","I saw 'U-571' when it first came out in 2000 and posted the following comment:'I was deeply impressed by the uniforms worn by the U.S. Navy personnel in 'U-571.' They appeared to be absolutely authentic. I was, alas, a lot less impressed by the story. The heroic sailors in this epic had enough adventures for an entire war. A strong ability to suspend disbelief is needed for one to enjoy this movie. Nevertheless, the special effects were excellent and my seven year-old grandson loved it.'I recently saw it again on Universal HD and thought that I would extend my earlier comments. First, the 5.1 soundtrack is outstanding. In fact, its sound effects won the Oscar and it was nominated for its overall sound, too. The appearance of the film in high definition was also marvelous. Its weakness was how badly miscast its star, Matthew McConaughey, was. He is wonderful in light romantic comedies, where his charm and good looks can effectively be brought to bear. Here, though, he plays a hard-bitten careerist naval officer with a skinhead hair cut and no sense of humor. He simply lacked the chops to pull it off. An action hero McConaughey is not.Bill Paxton was equally miscast but that didn't do too much damage because of his relatively small role. He plays the captain of a submarine that is on a super-secret mission to retrieve the Enigma code machine from a disabled German U-boat. The always reliable Harvey Keitel plays the chief of the boat and, as usual, is very effective.The photography of the scenes inside the submarines was well done but, it seemed to me, derivative of Wolfgang Petersen's 'Das Boot.' Still, the action sequences at sea were very well done.Six out of ten.",8,1,3,31 July 2000
American Beauty," A Great Film
","I love black comedies -- but only if they are really, really good. 'American Beauty' is one of the best.  This is a wonderful movie that surefootedly avoids either mean-spiritedness or silliness, the two most common failings of black comedies.  All of the performances are wonderful but Kevin Spacey gave one for the ages.  See it, see it, see it!",10,0,0,8 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Dumb, Dumb, dumb
","Despite its stirring subject matter, 'Pearl Harbor' is a high-priced failure.  The action sequences are effective, sometimes moving, and largely historically accurate.  Nevertheless, these virtues are not enough to overcome a love story that is lame even by the standards of WW-II propaganda pictures, which it tries to emulate.  In its romantic subplot, boy gets girl; boy loses girl because she thinks boy has died a heroic death; girl then falls in love with boy's best friend.  Has boy really died?  What do you think?  I could go on but you get it.  Had I not recorded the movie on TiVo and been able to fast forward through some of its sappy excesses, I would never have been able to get through its turgid three-hour running time.  I rated it 5 out of 10, and the only reason I gave it that much was because of the action scenes, which are (mostly, but not entirely) excellent and true to history.  If you miss a movie this year . ..",5,0,1,18 July 2002
District 9," A work of genius!
","District 9 is inspired film-making. In some ways, I suppose, it is an allegorical tale, but it is NOT a Message Movie. Thank heavens for that because I detest most such films. Although I feared that this film might be a heavy handed anti-Apartheid drama, I saw instead a brilliant sci-fi film, in a class with Ridley Scott's classic 'Alien.' The protagonist of the film is Wikus Van De Werne, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley from whom I hope to see more in the future. Wikus is alternately, stupid, naive, and funny, but ultimately loyal and brave. The movie traces his assignment as the man in charge of an operation to remove aliens from a squalid camp near Johannesburg and resettle them in a remote location. How all of this is developed and plays out is fascinating and consistently interesting, trust me on this.District 9 is directed by young Neil Blomkamp -- he is only 29. This is the only film of his I have seen but he has convinced me already that he is a force to be reckoned with. He made District 9 for little money, at least by the standards of most modern special effects laden films, and co-wrote the screenplay, too boot.This is a smart film; it is also sometimes moving and often funny. Highest recommendations!",10,7,15,14 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," Mama Mia: a Glorious Mess
","The movie version of Mama Mia is almost but not quite a disaster. Despite a cast that was mostly nearly a generation too old, couldn't sing, and couldn't dance, the film mostly succeeded. The brilliant Meryl Streep was a lot of fun and could sing better than adequately, despite her nearly 60 years. The lovely Amanda Seyfreid was young enough and could sing, too. Also Christine Baranski proved that she is as funny as ever and has a nice singing voice.On to the not so good stuff. Although tasked with important songs, Pierce Brosnan was not up to that task. The guy just can't sing. Oddly, Colin Firth, who had much less to do musically was pretty good. The dancing was awful. It looked like what a group of friends at a bowling alley might try to do after 3 or 4 beers.Despite its shortcomings, Mama Mia is a lot of fun and its wonderful old Abba songs were often moving, thanks to a strong screenplay. Seeing the movie made me regret than I didn't have a chance to see the 2001 Broadway production.",7,1,2,15 October 2008
The Bourne Legacy," A worthy addition to the Bourne series
","I went into the Bourne Legacy with no expectations whatsoever. The critics' review of the film were so all over the place that I had no idea whether I would be royally entertained or bitterly disappointed. In the event, I was royally entertained. I loved the intricate backstory explaining how Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) came to be such a super warrior and the complications that came with it. I thought Renner's work here was the best he has done since his memorable performance in The Hurt Locker. The film's production values could hardly have been higher. I gave high marks to its colorful locations, fine cinematography, and brilliant ensemble cast. The producers took care to cast fine actors such as David Strathairn and Elizabeth Marvel in small roles. As usual, Rachel Weisz was marvelous, although I barely recognized her at first. It appears that she has had some cosmetic surgery, which, while leaving her still beautiful, changed her looks. No matter, she was still fine. After the, to me at least, very interesting exposition of the background of the Outcome subjects, the movie shifted into high gear, with heart stopping chases, on both foot and motorcycle, through the streets of Manilla.Jeremy Renner's Aaron Cross in The Bourne Legacy is a worthy successor to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in The Bourne Trilogy. 8 Stars out of 10.",9,3,9,10 August 2012
Million Dollar Baby," A brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death
","'Million Dollar Baby' is on its surface a story about a female boxer and the aging fight manager and gym owner who trains her, which might lead one to think of it as sort of a female version of 'Rocky.' But it is much more. At its core this film is a brilliant exploration of love, loss, and death. Clint Eastwood proved again with this film that he is one of the great American directors, in a class with his hero, John Ford. Under his direction both Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman won well deserved Oscars and Eastwood himself won two more for Best Picture and Best Director. Finally, Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.No movie is perfect and 'Million Dollar Baby' is no exception. Many of its characters are cartoonish characterizations, used as props for the more fully developed manager Frankie, played by Eastwood, His fighter, Maggie, played by Swank, and 'Scrap,' Frankie's faithful friend and employee, played by Freeman. Maggie's hillbilly family, the brutish fighter, who Maggie fought for a championship, and a couple of the hangers on in Frankie's gym are examples of the less than believable characters in the film. But don't be put off by these overdrawn characters, for they are merely props designed to illustrate the relationships among Frankie, Maggie, and Scrap, who are fully realized and entirely believable. Frankie and Maggie come to love one another as the father and daughter each has lost. Although Scrap and Frankie are each other's dearest friend, each recognizes the weaknesses of the other. These relationships are used to dramatize the anguish of a moral dilemma and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of great odds. Not to be missed.",10,3,6,2 March 2007
The Graduate," A Great Comedy
","'The Graduate' is a delight, a black comic masterpiece.  I watched it again recently, after not having seen it in many years.  It has lost none of its charm.  Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as Benjamin and Anne Bancroft's comic timing and dramatic ability as Mrs. Robinson were never better.  Bancroft's Oscar was well deserved.  Was the ending happy and optimistic or sad and cynical?  I still can't decide.",10,1,2,17 March 2001
Titanic," A wildly romantic, beautifully told story
","I saw 'Titanic' in a first-run theater in 1997 and loved it. I had not watched it again until today because I had made the mistake -- and it was a mistake -- of believing that the enthusiasm for the film came entirely from teenaged girls and desperate housewives. BZZZT! Wrong. I am a man of, ahem, mature years, and was deeply moved, both in 1997 and again today.The drama of this wildly romantic tale is greatly enhanced by the presence of the ominous tragedy that was the TITANIC disaster. Nobody uses visual images, enhanced by special effects better than James Cameron and 'Titanic' is his masterpiece, it seems to me. Every frame of the film is beautiful and reflects the $200 million that were spent in making it.Now let's talk about why I think that this film should work for everyone. First, there is no real-life disaster that was more poignant than the TITANIC sinking, so the movie rises far above the romantic disaster genre because it tells much of the real life story of the tragedy. Second, the movie, 'Titanic' is simply awesome to both look at and listen to. My enjoyment was enhanced because I got to see it on a big screen high definition TV and listen to it on a first class 5.1 home theater sound system. Finally, 'Titanic' just works. If you pay attention and think it will break your heart, I promise.",10,2,4,8 November 2005
Three Colors: Blue," Elegant but Vague
","Despite its elegance, beauty, and the talent of its star, Juliette Binoche, 'Blue' disappointed me.  It never gained any forward momentum that I could discern.  Scene after (slow) scene went by without either telling me much more about Binoche's character or making me care very much about her.  She was simply a repressed sad woman.  Maybe it's me but I cannot recommend this movie; 5 of 10, and that only because of Binoche's performance.",5,6,16,28 February 2002
The Godfather: Part III," Underrated
","I agree with the sentiment expressed by others that 'The Godfather III' is an underrated film. I suggest that the primary reason for its having been underrated was Francis Ford Coppola's unfortunate decision to cast his then 19-year-old daughter, Sophia, in the pivotal role of Mary Corleone. Sophia Coppola had neither the charisma nor the acting chops for such a role, which made her scenes painful to watch. Nevertheless, the movie was outstanding in most other respects, I believe.The closing scenes are mostly cuts between an opera and a series of assassinations. This was a good choice, because the story, written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is highly operatic  and it works. Although 'The Godfather III' is certainly not in a class with the first two films of the Godfather Trilogy, which were two of the best films ever made, it is still a fine movie.The film was made at an early enough stage in Al Pacino's career that he did not consistently overact as he has done to his detriment in too many roles since. There is nobody better than Pacino when he exercises restraint, as he did here in his portrayal of Michael Corleone. The other members of the large cast, other than Sophia Coppola, were uniformly effective, too, particularly Diane Keaton, as Michael's long suffering ex-wife and the mother of his children. 'The Godfather III' is a worthy concluding entry in the Godfather Trilogy. Highly recommended, 8 out of 10.",8,1,4,25 September 2005
The Departed," Scorsese at the Top of His Game
","Martin Scorsese has returned to the top of his game with 'The Departed,' which is his best work since 'Goodfellas.' I wondered going in whether the 149 minute running time of the film might be excessive but it is not. It is a sophisticated, complex tale, which, because it takes its time is clearly understandable. Nevertheless, it moves without a lag.The cast are uniformly wonderful. Leonardo DiCaprio, as Billy Costigan an emotionally crippled undercover cop, gives the finest performance of his career. Matt Damon, who just seems to get better and better, is also outstanding as Colin Sullivan, a state police sergeant who is also a mole for a big time mobster, Frank Costello, played by the always terrific, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is alternately funny and creepy, in a way I can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off. I had not seem Vera Farmiga, who plays Madolyn a state health professional who treats both police officers and paroled convicts. Hers is a very important role because she treats and develops a personal relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan, with fascinating consequences. Madolyn is both vulnerable and a risk taker. Farmiga made me care about her.'The Departed' is the best movie I have seen this year, and maybe in the last two years. I hope that Scorsese ends his Oscar shutout with this one. If he does it will have been a well deserved victory.",10,1,3,9 October 2006
The Green Mile," A Brilliant and Moving Film
","'The Green Mile' is a very nearly a great film.  It is funny and moving, sad and frightening, an allegorical tale that depicts good and evil, love and hate, and magic or religion or the supernatural, or something else.  It does all these things with telling effectiveness.  The performances were terrific, particularly those of David Morse as Brutal and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.  The only reason I did not give 'The Green Mile' a 10 -- I gave it a 9 -- was its three-hour plus length and extreme violence. Don't be put off, though.  Highly recommended.",10,0,1,21 June 2001
The Wrestler," The emperor has no clothes!
","The Wrestler is an overblown mishmash, saved from utter disaster only by excellent performances from Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomey. For that reason I gave it 5 Stars out of 10 but even 5 Stars was probably too high. Despite a couple of great performances, this gritty, dreary, depressing mess was a failure. Rourke's Wrestler was a quintessential loser, who I could not care about, no matter how I tried. I think I know what Aronofsky, particularly with his, umm, odd ending, had in mind here but, for me at least, it didn't work. Despite brilliant work by Rourke, his character was an unsympathetic goof who failed at every important responsibility he ever had, leaving me nothing and no one to root for.",8,7,17,23 January 2009
The Queen," The Stag at Eve
","In this wonderful film, director Stephen Frears uses a beautiful 14 point buck roaming the Scottish highlands as a metaphor for Queen Elizabeth II's troubles caused by her cold reaction to the death of her former daughter in law, Diana. The buck in 'The Queen' died but Elizabeth, like Sir Walter Scott's famous 'Stag at eve,' certainly did not.The film examines how the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the queen work out the queen's initial refusal to publicly acknowledge Diana's death in any way. It's a great story well told by Frears' ('High Fidelity.' 'The Grifters'). The screenplay, by Peter Morgan, and the acting by an ensemble case of mostly British actors were laudable. The brilliant Helen Mirren was at the top of her game here, producing a picture of a woman who was both cold and imperious, out of her depth and deeply afraid, and most important of all, sympathetic. Following her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana, the former Princess of Wales, went public with many embarrassing tales out of school about her marriage to Charles. Her conduct permanently alienated her from the royal family. But because of her beauty charisma, and media savvy Diana succeeded in portraying herself as an innocent victim, not a manipulative malcontent. When Diana tragically died in a Paris automobile accident at the age of 37, the outpouring of grief was remarkable, although it should not have been. All one had to do was look at the identical reaction to the death of former Beatle John Lennon in 1980. Although such outpourings of grief are a mile wide and an inch deep, the Queen should have known better that to ignore her people's remorse at Princess Di's untimely end. The Queen, like so many other public figures since learned the perils of the 24 hour news cycle.'The Queen' is a brilliant character study played by an equally brilliant character actress. From her tightly permed head to her slightly thickening ankles and sensible shoes, Mirren was Elizabeth II. Although she should have known better than to try to avoid addressing Diana's death, in her defense she was getting a lot of bad advice from within her palace, notably by a boneheaded, priggish Prince Phillip, played by the always wonderful James Cromwell. But Elizabeth had the wit to listen to her Prime Minister, a political genius if ever there was one, and take the right actions and say the right things to rehabilitate her reputation. Highly recommended and not to be missed. 9 out of 10.",10,5,10,11 November 2006
Taken 2," Dumb but marginally entertaining
","Taken 2, like too many Hollywood sequels, is a shameless money grab. The first Taken, while not a bastion of intelligence, was entertaining and had a semblance of suspense. For those of us who had seen the original, though, its clone, Taken 2, was entirely predictable.I decided to see Taken 2 solely because of my high regard for Liam Neeson. The always reliable Neeson did not disappoint me here. His performance lent an air of credibility to the film, which its underwhelming screenplay lacked.Despite the failings of Taken 2's screenplay, it was saved from utter failure by its excellent ensemble cast, high production values, and well done action sequences. Add to that its short runtime of 92 minutes and Taken 2 was worth the price of admission, albeit barely.",6,0,1,2 November 2012
Tombstone," A Fine Western
","'Tombstone' takes liberties with history but does a good job of depicting human emotion. Among a uniformly good cast, Kurt Russell as Wyat Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday are particularly excellent.  In fact, I believe that Kilmer's antic Holiday was the best performance, among many fine performances, of his career.  The film's descriptions of how the men died who were thought to have been responsible for the death of Morgan Earp and the maiming of Virgil Earp are uniformly ludicrous but, what the heck, this is Hollywood.  The images are stunning and the action and excitement don't let up.  Look for an early performance by a younger and heavier Billy Bob Thornton as a casino bully.",8,0,0,21 April 2000
Casino Royale," Perhaps the best of the bond films
","This is the best film in the 007 franchise since the Sean Connery era and one of the best ever. Daniel Craig brings a thuggish edginess to the role unseen in any Bond flick since Connery's tenure. I thought there was always something a little too elegant and unserious about the actors who played Bond in those years but Craig has taken care of that this time. I can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel.This 'Casino Royale' provides a combination of excitement and humor, plus some sadness, not often achieved in the venerable Bond series. In addition to Bond, I thought the elegant and beautiful Eva Green was particularly effective as Bond's love interest. She had an aurora of seriousness and quiet intelligence that served her well.This may be the best of the Bond films. Highly recommended, 10 out of 10.",10,3,12,10 May 2008
The Replacements," Wonderful Fun and a Grossly Underrated Film
","I had avoided this film until it was shown on HBO because my two favorite reviewers, Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin savaged it (both gave it only 2 stars out of 4).  I was surprised by these ratings.  This movie has many wonderful NFL inside jokes and dramatizes beautifully the stupidity of NFL owners, the selfishness of NFL players, and the greed of both.  I suspect that those reviewers who underrated this film fell into one of two camps: (1) they could not stand the entirely unsympathetic depiction of the regular players who went on strike in 1987 because those reviewers believed that anybody who stands for 'labor solidarity' should be treated kindly on film or, (this is more likely)(2) they know nothing, let me say that again, nothing about sports in general or the NFL in particular and they simply didn't get it.  7 out of 10.

Apollo 13," A Wonderful True Adventure
","To my mind, 'Apollo 13' is Ron Howard's masterpiece.  That it is a largely factual retelling of an historic event makes it even more remarkable.  I was riveted from beginning to end.  Tom Hanks, as Jim Lovell, and Gary Sinese, as Ken Mattingly, were perfectly cast.  Nobody puts images on film that tell a story dramatically and well better than Ron Howard.  In this connection, the reason that the sequences showing the astronauts floating were so effective is that the actors really were weightless.  Howard arranged to have airlines fly parabolar orbits so that a little more than twenty seconds of weightlessness could be achieved, during which time he filmed the weightlessness sequences.  10 out of 10.  Highly recommended.",10,1,1,20 August 2002
The Great Gatsby," A Ravishingly Beautiful and Highly Entertaining Film
","I very much liked Baz Luhrmann's version of The Great Gatsby. I would have been disappointed if it had not been filled with striking visual images of beautiful people but it was filled with many of both. I have long been fond of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel of the same name and this is the first film version of the story I have seen that I thought worked. Much of the dialog was from Fitzgerald's own words. The large ensemble cast was excellent. I was particularly impressed with the performances of Tobey Maguire, as Nick Carraway, and Joel Edgerton, as Tom Buchanan. As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, this time as Jay Gatsby. Luhrmann has achieved another artistic triumph. Highly recommended! 8 Stars out of 10.",10,1,5,10 May 2013
High Fidelity," A Quirky, Delightful Film
","Rob Gordon (John Cusack)owns a Chicago vintage record store.  His spectacular self-absorption is moderated by his charm.  He is verbal, boy is he verbal.  He has a top five list for everything he has ever seen, heard, or done (songs, movies, and, oh yeah, girl friends with whom he has broken up).  This odd but appealing film has a large and tremendously appealing cast, from Cusack himself to the two music nerds who work in his record store (Todd Louiso and Jack Black), to his girlfriends and ex girlfriends, too numerous to identify here.  The movie's best features are its funny surprises and believable characters.  It is clear that it is based on a Nick Hornby novel.  It is endlessly inventive and its many loopy characters are true to life to a degree rarely rarely encountered in film.  Highly recommended (9 out of 10).",9,0,1,30 September 2001
V for Vendetta," A beautifully crafted dark fairytale
","Some who have commented on this movie have extolled its 'relevance' to the current political climate. Others have been turned off by what they saw as a blatantly liberal 'message.' As one who reflexively detests 'Message Movies,' I was worried that I might fall in the later category. I didn't. I thought the political references simply served to drive this dark fairytale. It seems to me that anybody who would take any aspect of this wonderful film at more than face value is missing the point.This is a wildly romantic tale of love, revenge, and, in an odd way, redemption. It is far more focused on the human condition than it is on anything as petty as the political squabbles of the day. That's a good thing, I think. The performances were wonderful. Hugo Weaving, despite having his face hidden behind a mask throughout most of the movie was overwhelmingly effective as the tortured V. Weaving conveyed nearly perfectly the curious combination of madness and elegance of this flawed and dangerous but pitiable man. Natalie Portman's portrayal as the waiflike but mentally strong Evey was also excellent. I also enjoyed the performances of the always good John Hurt, Stephen Rea, and the nearly unrecognizable Tim Pigott-Smith as the detestable Creedy. There were many other memorable performances, too, which are too numerous to recount here.Visually, the movie was drop dead gorgeous, with scene after scene of arresting color and movement, which not only moved the story but were beautiful to look at. The writing was equally arresting, particularly V's lines. There was a music to his frequent alliteration and recitation of Shakespeare's lines.I can't remember when I last saw a film that had so much to recommend it and so little to criticize. See it, you'll be glad you did.",10,2,8,28 May 2007
