The Avengers," a ride of my life
","I don't usually write reviews and I am not an expert on analyzing all that cinematographic stuff or how god of a job director did. All I can say is that I had a time of my life. It was an amazing film with an amazing storyline and amazing actors in it. When I first heard about the avengers, I was very happy yet skeptical about it. My biggest concern was how they were going to put all these legendary characters into one film and provide them all with enough screen time to achieve some character development. Even after seeing it I have no idea how they did it, but they not only did it they smashed it. Right from the start I was taken to a ride of my life, I could not take my eyes out of what was going on. In terms of special effect, it was top-notch as it was expected no question about it. People are praising this film for being very witty and having a lot of comedy in it, I have to say I am not a fan of comedy, but this film made me laugh more than any other comedy in a very long time. Having to see Hulk smashing Loki or Capitan America patronizing Iron-man, or Iron-Man fighting Thor, was something you could have dreamt of to see on the big screen when you were a kid. But having a chance to see it done and developed in such an effective and spectacular fashion was beyond my wildest expectations, and trust me I had very high hopes for this film. Well, sorry for not being very structured and coherent about the whole thing, I just wanted to share a little bit of joy and excitement that I have been provided with watching this amazing film. It's an epic masterpiece, and seeing it on the big screen is a one of those things you have to do before you die, that's for sure.",10,10,20,11 May 2012
Unbreakable," it was a pure masterpiece ...
","I could describe this film as a mixture of fantasy/imaginary world and realistic and grounded masterpiece... I like the whole atmosphere of this film, the environment, which is very melancholic and sad. Sad, because it was made in a a very slow pace, there is no rush. Everything unfolds gradually, every single scene is elaborated and scrutinized. I disagree, that it is some sort of fiction, where we can face one more super-hero with subnormal powers, No! It is about simple family, about simple man with daily problems, who happens to be something extraordinarily special and having ability to be invulnerable, which in turn, makes him a protector of humanity. I do agree, it might sound little bid clichÃ©, but yet everything was conveyed and represented in a totally different way of what we normally see in these types of movies... And I enjoy the fact, that there we won't see boring and trite love story hidden behind everything as we can usually see in almost every film..",10,1,2,10 January 2010
Lost in Translation," Not typical love story
","This movie gained a lot of positive reviews and awards. And I think it deserved all of it. At first it might seem to be as a very simple and cliché love story, that has already been seen hundreds of times. Yet, this story has something very different, something that compels and captivates you. This story is not one of those stories where you will see happy-ending or marriage at the end of the movie.. No.. there you aren't going to hear 'I love you' or 'I couldn't live without you' and so on... No! There you will see two people, who found each other little bit too late, too late, that the love would be unfolded... However, they are not sad about it, they don't feel some sort of pain or grief. They enjoy every moment with each other..",8,1,2,7 January 2010
American Beauty," supreme film.. everyone must see this film at least once
","To start with, this film is probably my most favorite one, or at least one of it. I first time watched this film when I was 14-15 years old, then I remember, it hadn't had any effect on me.. I thought to myself that this is one ordinary, clichéd film, with no original or outstanding idea... Yet, after couple of years I saw this film again and now I saw it in a totally different way than I did first time. Frankly, I don't even know why.. maybe my comprehension and grasp on films has changed. But now, I realize the true beauty of this movie. It's about typical American family, which at first glance might seem to be perfect as they have everything: beautiful house, both of spouses have well-paid jobs and a teenager daughter. Yet, this family has lots of flaws, love between spouses had faded away long time ago.. Daughter somewhat despises her parents...",10,0,0,11 January 2010
Never Back Down," Great film, praise-worthy
","This is one more film with quite good idea. Though, there are a lot similar films that we could bracket in one group with this one. Yet, it has something outstanding. It inspires me in a way. To strive for my life-goals, never back down, no matter how hard it may be, what sort of obstacles are ahead of you.. Maybe that's the real purpose of this film? To inspire one, to be confident and persistent. At least, I was affected in this way. I presume, that this movie is suitable for those, who have a very deep and grim times, who need some sort of wake up call to evoke positive feelings to what's life.. to make one be optimistic again...",8,36,50,12 January 2010
