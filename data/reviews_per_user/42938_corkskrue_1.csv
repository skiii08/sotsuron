Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," worst in the series, but still worth watching
","I grew up watching Star Wars and have loved it for 20 years, much like most other fans of the series. When Episode I first came out in theaters, I loved it. I mean, NEW Star Wars! I watched it twice in theaters and then repeatedly when I first got it on video.Then I moved on and stopped watching it for a couple years until I began to introduce my girlfriend to the Star Wars Galaxy, just months before the release of Episode III. I decided to start her at the beginning, with Episode I. As we began watching it, I hung my head in horror as I realized how bad a movie it really was, at least in comparison to the other Star Wars films. I looked at her (about the time Jar Jar Binks was introduced) and said, 'I promise, they get better than this...' She later agreed that the movies got continually better as we progressed through the series and she ended up really liking it.Although I'm not going to spend any time on saying WHY this movie is the worst in the series, I will just say that it IS the worst movie in the series. But on the plus side, it is still Star Wars and has some great back story and battle sequences. Watch it if you want to get into Star Wars, but please, take it with a grain of salt.",6,1,2,1 July 2006
