E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET-the extra terrestrial
","I saw this film when i was eight years old with my friends. The film was excellent and we enjoyed it very much. It bought laughter,tears and many emotions and feelings of excitement and wanting fiction to become reality for us. Now at thirty-two years old,i have watched the film over and over again with my children. It brings back such happy memories for me,and lots of pleasure knowing that my children can watch an exciting,entertaining,decent family movie. My children have commented that it is one of the best films they have ever seen. I hope that this film will be around for many years to come,as it is such an excellent,family film,with lots of laughter,tears and gets children's imaginations working overtime,wondering if there really is an extra-terrestrial out there,such as ET.",10,2,4,26 December 2006
