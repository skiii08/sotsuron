The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Loved it !!!
","I got in with mild expectations, I expected it to be good but not too good since it is the first part. I found it to be too good. The story although slower than the previous movies is engaging and exciting, at no moment I felt boredom. As the movie progresses, you get in depth view of all the characters and get some back stories which is great news for a hunger games fan. Near the end the excitement rises, I left the theater trembling. I would watch it again for sure, and I can't wait for part 2!! If you are going in expecting an ending, you are going to be disappointing since the ending is in part 2. Other than that, everything was good. Can't believe I have to wait a full year...",10,23,62,21 November 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Best movie I ever watched
","Literally the best movie I ever watched. I was late in watching it and I feared that since I heard such positive reviews I would be going into it with over optimism and will be disappointed, I was wrong, it exceeded even my high expectations. You need to watch the first one to understand the second fully. The characters evolved in a very nice way. I can't wait till next November when the new movie in this series will be released. Basically the nightmare of the hunger games that has been following Katniss for such a long time actually becomes a reality again when she is forced to do it a second time, but this time the focus is not on the games but on a bigger issue.",10,1,17,30 January 2014
