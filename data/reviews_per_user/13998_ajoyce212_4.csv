The Equalizer," Hingham, MA Shipyard
","I went and saw The Equalizer opening day - 1:15pm showing at the Hingham Shipyard. Had a late lunch and a couple drinks at Wahlburgers after the movie.I enjoyed and gave a 9 out of 10, this was a movie that went by in a flash constant action, no lulls, and great music. If you are a bad guy watch your back next time you're in Home Depot! If you are a Chloe Grace Moretz fan (which I am) I have bad news for you she is not in much of the film, maybe 15%I like most movies I see so not much of a critic but the guy who does this for the Boston Herald gave a B+ & he is a ball buster. Go see this!! or rent in 6 months if you don't like the theater.",9,2,10,27 September 2014
If I Stay," I liked this movie
","I always warn if my mind is open I like the movie. 'If I Stay' was a well written and acted drama about a teenage girl who is in a car accident with her family of four. Dad, Mom, and little brother don't make it. I live in outside of Boston if you have a snow day, stay home, it's friggin' dangerous out there!!!! sorry my attempt at a little comic relief. She looks over her comatose body while her remaining loved ones visit and decides to go into the white light??? or stay??? Lots of flashbacks of her recent memories which tie the story together quite well. I recommend this one enjoy....",8,0,1,12 September 2014
Interstellar," My new scale!
","If you look at my reviews they are pretty stupid but I'm not a film critic just trying to have some fun. I think this may be cool a 5 point scale. 5 -(Best) I'll buy this Blu-Ray and add to my collection 4 - Worth watching again 3 - Average 2 - Only worth $1.59 at RedBox 1 - Sucked (Think that awful Counselor flick) INTERSTELLAR: I am assigning a five to this one, I will spend the $20+ when this comes out and watch over and over. One it was very entertaining. Two very complex. I think you need a degree from MIT to understand some of the material or I'm a dummy...This flick is almost 3 hours so don't drink a lot of water or beer before sitting down, you may miss a good part in the water closet. I'm sure you already know the plot but here goes Earth is toast and we are embarking on a mission to a wormhole to propel us to a possible new plant to live on. That's all I knew on my way to the theater. I've read some negative reviews and yeah there are some plot holes, its far-fetched, but dude its a sci-fi movie try to enjoy it!",9,2,7,22 November 2014
Nightcrawler," 2 hours well spent
","Just got home from the cinema. Most movies I like so maybe I'm easy to impress. A movie really would need to be a turkey for me to grade low and bash. The guy in the Boston Herald gave Nightcrawler an A- and he is a ball buster. Jake Gyllenhaal is Lou Bloom a real strange cat in LA who is well spoken and smart but WEIRD. Lou is say early 30's and is stealing scrap metal to earn a living. He drives by an accident and becomes intrigued by the people who record horrific stuff for the news. Think of the possibilities with this premise! Lou starts small and gets real good at this. Good story, writing, and acting.",9,1,4,9 November 2014
