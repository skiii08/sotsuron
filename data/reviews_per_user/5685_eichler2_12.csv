Blade Runner 2049," Better than I had feared, not as good as I had hoped
","I'm a huge fan of the original Blade Runner movie and the Philip K. Dick book it was based on, so it was with some trepidation that I went to see the sequel. But the film lived up to my expectations, even if they weren't all that high.On the plus side:<ul><li>The sequel does a great job of recreating the look, feel and grit of the first movie. It looks amazing.</li></ul><ul><li>The soundtrack music also does a great job of imitating the first film's score, while also sounding more modern.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot follows logically (sort of) from the first movie, but you don't necessarily have to have seen the first one to follow this one. On the other hand, the movie doesn't spoon-feed the audience, and I overheard a couple people at my showing who had no idea what was going on.</li></ul><ul><li>The film raises a lot of thought-provoking, sci-fi type questions. Just like the first movie, a major theme is 'what exactly is real, and what rights do intelligent 'artificial' beings deserve'? Some of the new elements in this one seem like they could have come out of a Philip K. Dick story.</li></ul>On the negative side:<ul><li>The movie is waaaaaaaaay too long. I have a decent attention span, and even I thought the movie dragged. It seemed like half the film played out in slow motion. It made 2001 A Space Odyssey (another film I love, but one of the most deliberately paced movies of all time) look like a taut action thriller. They took an idea that would have made a good hour long TV show and stretched it out to nearly three hours. Way too long.</li></ul><ul><li>The plot, what there is of one, is...kind of hard to buy into. Months ago I saw someone on a movie discussion group predict pretty much exactly what the plot turned out to be, and he was told by everyone else that his idea was ridiculous.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie redefines what a replicant is, although the ones in this film are later generations than the ones in the first film, so I can kind of give them a pass there.</li></ul><ul><li>Seemed like there was a gratuitous amount of female nudity. I'm not complaining really, it just seemed like most of it didn't need to be there.</li></ul>Overall I liked the movie. I'll probably watch it again when it comes out on Blu-ray. But it's not really the type of movie that the commercials and trailers are pitching it as, and I'm guessing there will be a lot of negative reviews from people who were expecting more car chases and fight scenes. There's not nearly as much action as the first movie.Oh, and it seems like the last half hour or so is designed to set up more sequels in the future. Which would be cool, but for God's sake pick up the pace on the next one.",7,7,16,6 October 2017
Source Code," Contradicts itself
","If you're just looking for a decent action/spy thriller with lots of explosions (or, rather, the same explosion over and over again), then you might like this movie. If you actually use your brain at all, the crazy plot holes will ruin it for you.The premise is that a military pilot gets 'volunteered' to take part in a program where he relives the last eight minutes of the life of the victim of a train crash, over and over again, 'Groundhog Day' style. The train was destroyed by a bomb killing hundreds of people, and the authorities have reason to believe the bomber intends something bigger like nuking a major city. Our hero has to find the bomber and report his identity so he can be stopped.(SPOILERS BELOW)Now, the movie clearly sets out that the military has developed some method to preserve the last eight minutes of someone's short term memory after they die. That's not too much of a stretch - I could see them being very interested in a project like that. Furthermore, they can 'inject' someone into those memories to relive them as if they were reality. OK, starting to reach there, but lets run with it...The problem is that once our hero gets inside the memory, he starts doing things the original person never did, seeing things they never saw, etc. So it's not just a memory, it's more of a complete simulation of the train based on a memory, including things the original person couldn't have possibly known (like where the bomb is hidden).It gets worse. By the end of the film, it's not just a total simulation, it's an alternate reality. So the good guy not only manages to stop the original bombing, but gets to live happily ever after with the girl he just met, call his father and give him closure about his death, and send an email to the technician running the military project to let her know what he did. I guess the implication is that the people who created this miracle technology thought they were only running a simulation (a fact that they state over and over again in explaining why the past can't be changed), but our hero knows better and has figured out a way to turn it into an alternate reality.Makes absolutely no sense. They should have just ended it after he reported back the identity of the bomber, but then the movie would have only been an hour long. And just what happens to the poor SOB whose body the main character takes over in the end? Too bad for him, I guess.I really wanted to like this movie, but it just went too far, contradicted itself and broke any possible willing suspension of disbelief.",5,2,3,15 January 2017
The Fifth Element," Misrepresented
","The first time I tried to watch this movie, I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I think I gave up not long after Chris Tucker's ultra-flamboyant character appeared and overwhelmed the movie.But recently it was on one of the free cable channels that show uncut, commercial-free movies, so I gave it another chance. I think a big part of my initial negative reaction was due to the original trailers and commercials for the movie, which totally misrepresented what it was. The ads made it seem like an epic sci-fi adventure movie with lots of action and attractive women. Well, it does have attractive women. And some action towards the end.But this isn't really a sci-fi movie at all. It's set in the future and borrows some visual elements from other sci-fi films (I have to admit that apart from some cheesy effects and costumes, the movie looks pretty amazing), but this is purely a cartoony, campy, over-the-top comic book brought to life. If you're going to watch it, don't take any of the characters or the plot lines seriously and you'll have a much better time.That said, this just isn't a very good movie. Or maybe it's just not what I was expecting and not to my tastes. At any rate, a second viewing 20 years later didn't really improve my opinion of the film very much.",3,1,3,2 November 2017
Barry Lyndon," Overlong, stiff, boring period drama
","I'm a big fan of Kubrick's films, so back in the early days of DVDs I bought a boxed set that contained Dr. Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon. I had never seen the last two on that list, so I was really looking forward to watching them. Lolita, apart from the intentionally creepy subject matter, wasn't bad. And then I got to Barry Lyndon.On first viewing, I couldn't believe this movie was made by the same person who had made those others. What a dull, dragging, pretentious...did I mention dull?...movie this is. Now, I can handle deliberately slow-paced movies. I love 2001 and that film is almost as glacially paced as this one. But when that slow pace is coupled with a painfully boring story and wooden acting, it makes for a nearly unwatchable movie.It probably didn't help that Warner Brothers crammed a movie that's over three hours long onto a single DVD, resulting in sub-VHS video quality. But within half an hour I was looking at the clock, wondering how much longer the movie had to go. By the time it reached the intermission an hour and 40 minutes in, when most movies would have the decency to just end, I was ready to give up. But I soldiered on and watched the remaining hour and a half...I should have just gone with my original instincts.What made me return to this movie recently was that my wife is a big fan of 18th century period piece movies, so she had watched the last two thirds of this one on TV and asked me to get the DVD out so she could see the part she missed. She liked the detailed costumes and settings, and actually enjoyed the story. So I thought maybe my original opinion had been hasty and maybe I should give it another try.Nope, this movie is just awful. Such flat, bland acting and boring direction it's like the film was given some experimental treatment to extract any emotion, action or interest from it. The main character, Redmond Barry, rises from poverty in Ireland to wealth and high society in Europe not by any virtues of his own, but mostly through stupidity, cowardice and cheating. Once he finally steals the wife of a sickly Lord, he loses any likability he had in the first half of the movie and changes suddenly into a disagreeable jerk who mistreats his wife and cheats on her while squandering her family fortune. Why exactly are we supposed to care about this guy? I guess you can't expect perfection every time, but it's hard to believe the same guy who created Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and Clockwork Orange was responsible for this mess.Maybe it's just because I prefer sci-fi to period dramas, but I can't for the life of me understand why this clunker has an 8.1 average on IMDb and so many people have given it raving reviews. I can appreciate that the costumes, dialog and settings are all very authentic to the time period, but so what? That alone doesn't make for a good movie. This film should only be taken as a cure for insomnia.",3,34,63,14 February 2016
Interstellar," Way, way overrated
","OK, first off, the movie clearly doesn't deserve 1 star - I just gave it that to try to counterbalance all the undeserved 10 star reviews that currently give it an vastly over-inflated 8.7 average.I'll try to keep this brief by just listing the good and the bad: Good:1. Some impressive visuals 2. Some interesting ideas. Kind of.Bad: 1. Bad storytelling - half the time it was near-impossible to figure out what was going on, or why the characters were doing what they were doing.2. Way too long. Seriously, this movie was easily an hour longer than it needed to be. At least.3. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Not incorrect scientific facts so much as things just being unrealistic. For example - if the future humans (or whoever set up the whole black hole library thing) had the capability to do that, why couldn't they just send us a clear message from the future to help us out? Why this convoluted plan to get Cooper into the black hole to send ridiculous messages back to himself and his daughter using Morse code, binary code, etc? 4. Way too obvious - why couldn't the characters figure out that the data Matt Damon was sending was fake? One look at the planet made it pretty clear it was uninhabitable, and I saw the whole 'he was so lonely he'd do anything to get rescued' plot line coming up. But none of our super-smart heroes could figure that out? I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the rave reviews it got, but in the end I thought it was somewhere between awful and just barely passable. And through the last hour of the movie I kept checking my watch and wondering how much longer until it was over.If you can see it cheap, it's probably worth watching, just keep your expectations really low.",1,6,13,25 November 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Remarkably, no one in this movie actually jumps a shark
","After watching the first Hobbit movie, I didn't want to think that Peter Jackson had jumped the shark, but he was certainly gunning the engine and racing towards that ramp next to the shark tank at full speed. With 'Desolation of Smaug', he's over the tank and has crash landed hard on the other side.The first movie took a lot of liberties with the original book and changed the tone entirely. The second one might as well not have claimed to be based on the book at all. It races through the few scenes that actually came from the book at breakneck pace just so it can get to the overlong scenes with characters who weren't in the book, or the scenes that beat the viewer over the head with the idea that this is a prequel to Lord of the rings, or the many, many, many ridiculous action scenes. For example, the chapter from the book that tells of the company's stay with Beorn comes and goes in what feels like about three minutes at the beginning of the movie, and bears (no pun intended) almost no resemblance to the book. Meanwhile, there's at least ten times that much footage of elves who weren't in the book beheading orcs and goblins throughout the film.As many others have stated, I watched the Lord of the Rings movies many times in the theater and on DVD, but I have absolutely no urge to re-watch either of the first two Hobbit movies, and probably won't even bother seeing the third one.Personally, I'd like to see films taken away from Jackson and given to a decent editor to see if he could make a two hour movie that's actually based on the original book.",1,104,165,23 December 2013
Gone Girl," Overrated nonsensical melodrama
","This movie was on TV this evening and I decided to watch it partly because it has a reputation as a decent film, and partly because there was a joke that referenced it on 'You're The Worst' this season and I wanted to get the backstory.Since it was on regular TV, it was obvious that some bits had been cut out and some dialog had been changed to get around the R rating, but I'm pretty sure I got the gist of it. And it baffles me that anyone thought this was a great movie.Others have done a great job of pointing out all the plot holes here on IMDb (as I did to my wife while watching it), but not many have mentioned how over-the-top melodramatic the story and acting were (as my wife did to me several times while watching it), to the point of near self-parody.Speaking of the plot holes (SPOILER ALERT), I'll just mention that my favorite is that the wife is DRENCHED in blood after killing her 'alibi', drives all the way home that way (without calling for help), is taken to the hospital, examined by doctors, sedated, questioned by the FBI and police and taken home again...and is STILL drenched in blood, finally showering it off at home what must have been hours later. What the heck? How was that supposed to be even remotely believable?But maybe, just maybe, despite all that I could have found it in my heart to give this a 5 or 6 rating (after all, it did help kill three hours of an otherwise dull evening), IF IT HAD HAD SOME KIND OF ENDING. Seriously, I was really curious about how they were going to resolve this whole thing - I expected either the husband to kill the wife or vice versa, but nope. Affleck's character decides to just live fearfully and suspiciously ever after with his psycho wife, roll credits. Wow, what an anticlimax.The movie probably still deserves a 3 or 4, but I'm going with 1 just to try to bring its ridiculous 8.4 average down a bit.",1,2,4,18 January 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," If you liked the first three and want more of the same, here it is
","A few of the reviews I read before going to see this fifth (and supposedly final) Pirates movie basically boiled down to 'well, at least it's better than the last one'. I don't know, am I the only one who liked 'On Stranger Tides' because it at least tried to do something different with the franchise? This new entry just tosses the soundtrack and best bits of the first three films in a blender, adds a new zombie bad guy and a couple youthful new romantic leads and hits the puree button. They even re-use the 'bad guys can walk through the bars of a prison cell' effect from one of the earlier movies.Yeah, some of the special effects are spectacular, there are battles at sea, lots of stuff blows up, the villains are creepy and some of the comic relief is funny (and some is painfully unfunny), but watching this movie it was hard to shake the feeling that I'd seen it all before. It's pretty much paint-by-numbers, even down to Javier Bardem's bad guy reciting the film's title line just before it appears on screen. Even Depp's Captain Jack seemed largely uninspired.On the positive side, many of the characters you've come to know from the first four films return for this one. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner shows up to help set up and resolve the plot, and even Keira Knightley makes a very brief appearance. At over two hours long I was afraid the film would drag in spots, but it moved along so quickly that I was actually a little surprised when they reached the big finale.The plot, without getting into spoilers, revolves around Will's son Henry who is determined to break the curse on his father and rescue him from the Flying Dutchman. In order to do so, he has to retrieve a powerful, magical item that is also being sought by a brilliant young woman with a mysterious map that her unknown father left to her. It soon turns out that they need Jack Sparrow's help, and of course that drags Captain Barbossa into the fray. Opposing them all is the undead Captain Salazar, who bears a grudge against Sparrow and will not rest until he's dead.There's a very short and unnecessary cameo by Paul McCartney as Jack's uncle Jack. He tells a lame joke, there's a single off-screen laugh as if even the filmmakers realized how pointless the scene was, and then the plot moves on.One bit where the film really went off the rails was a flashback scene in which we learn why Salazar hates Sparrow so intensely. Instead of hiring a younger actor to play Jack, they digitally de-aged Depp and raised his voice about an octave. The result is just...creepy. And entirely unconvincing.I don't know if it was just the theater where I saw the movie, but the picture was really dark for a lot of the film and the sound mix was terrible. The explosions and music were super-loud and often drowned out the dialog. I'm glad I didn't see the 3D version because I've heard that's even murkier-looking. At the rate movies are going, in a couple decades the theater experience will be staring at a black screen for two hours while being deafened by a continuous roar.At any rate, if you loved the earlier films in the Pirates franchise and want another dose, or if you're just looking for a big, mindless spectacle with some bits of humor, this movie fits the bill. I can't say I really disliked it, but it also didn't make me sad that it's supposed to be the last one. Or is it? Stick around for a final scene after the credits that hints at an unlikely sequel. Or maybe it's just meant as some weird sort of joke. I heard people discussing it in the lobby and no one quite knew what to make of it.",6,7,13,31 May 2017
Event Horizon," Is it a mediocre horror movie or a horrible sci-fi movie? It's both!
","Just saw this on one of those cable channels that shows uncut movies, and now I remember why I avoided seeing it for so many years.It starts out OK apart from the cheesy opening credits sequence that probably looked pretty cool in 1997 but looks really dated now (as do most of the computer generated effects in the movie). A space ship called the Event Horizon, which was presumed lost seven years ago has unexpectedly sent out a distress signal from Neptune. A rescue team is dispatched along with a scientist who, early in the film, explains that he invented the special drive that was supposed to let Event Horizon open a hole in the fabric of space-time and jump directly to a neighboring star. So far, so good - seems like it could be an interesting sci-fi movie, although there are many signs that it's actually a horror movie, including the fact that the Event Horizon was apparently designed to look like a haunted castle floating in space. And it's actually 'orbiting' within the atmosphere of Neptune. But whatever.HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER - and I reveal it only because if, like me, you were hoping this would be a decent sci-fi flick, this should put you right off it - the hole that Event Horizon opened didn't lead to a neighboring star. It went, literally, to hell. And after causing the original crew to murder each other in gory, ritualistic ways, it has come back to our universe looking for more victims.OK, say you're willing to buy into that as a horror film plot. Even then this movie is terrible because it basically just lifts plot elements and visual elements from Alien, Stargate, The Shining and a host of other, better films. And then throws in a bunch of jump scares - sudden loud noises, flashing lights, etc - and tons of gore. Nearly everything in this movie is a cliché that you've probably seen elsewhere, and if you're not able to fully predict how the second half is going to play out, then you've never watched a horror movie before.The movie really wasn't even worth the amount of time it took to write this review, but I was shocked when I looked it up on IMDb and saw people giving it 8, 9 and 10 star reviews. It is DEFINITELY not that good, even if you like horror movies. Maybe a two or three at best.",1,5,11,12 June 2017
Lucy," More fiction than science but at least it wasn't a horror movie
","Most films that are promoted as science fiction usually turn out to be some other genre masquerading as sci-fi by adding space ships or futuristic settings. It seems like 90% of the time they turn to be horror movies with the werewolf replaced by an alien or the haunted house replaced by a space ship.To Lucy's credit, it actually tries to inject a bit of speculative science, but in the end it turns out to be mostly a superhero/revenge/action movie, with flashy special effects.To buy into this movie, you have to accept Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman)'s lecture early on which reiterates the old story about how humans only use 10% of their brains. His theory is that if we could unlock more, we'd develop 'powers' like mind control, similar to how dolphins developed echolocation.His theory is proved true by Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) who is kidnapped and turned into an unwilling drug mule by Taiwanese gangsters. They surgically implant a bag of their new, experimental drug into her abdomen. Then one of the stupider henchmen kicks her in the stomach, breaking the bag open and giving her a massive overdose. The main side effect (besides apparently briefly reversing the direction of gravity) is that it starts to unlock more and more of her brain.As the percentage she can use is occasionally flashed on screen she starts developing superpowers like telekinesis, the ability to alter her appearance, the ability to see and control the flow of digital data, and eventually even time travel.The bad guys pursue Lucy as she attempts to get more of the drug to unlock more and more of her mind, both so she can get revenge and so she can transmit her new-found knowledge to mankind. Meanwhile her abilities get vaster and ever stranger as she turns into some sort of super-intelligent, emotionless robot-person.If you can buy into the sci-fi part of it, you still have to believe that most of the characters (including Lucy) can just shoot people willy-nilly with little or no repercussions. For example, there's a scene shortly after she escapes from her captors early in the film where she walks into a hospital toting a big gun, walks into an operating room, shoots the patient on the table, pushes him aside and demands that the doctor remove the remaining bag of drugs from her stomach. She even has time for a lengthy phone call with her mom. Then she just walks out of the hospital like nothing had happened. What, the hospital had no security? No one thought to call the police when a bloody, gun-toting woman came strolling in?But if you can buy all that, the movie is well put together and a visual treat. And I have to admit that I didn't turn it off (I watched it on TV) because I had to see where it was going and how it would end. The ending is actually pretty clever, although it starts to approach 2001 A Space Odyssey level obscurity for a while there.",7,1,2,12 June 2017
The Thin Red Line," An impressionist painting of war come to life...and lingering for three hours
","The title of my review pretty much says it all. I read in a movie newsgroup what a genius Terrence Malick is. So this weekend I got Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life from the library and watched both. In both cases, it was largely like watching paint dry.In Tree of Life's favor, at least it wasn't three hours long. Both movies are incredibly pretentious, overly artsy, and feature a seemingly random jumble of short scenes. Both are full of shots that look like beautiful paintings come to life. Both feature characters doing poetic, half-whispered voiceovers to explain the philosophy behind the images we're seeing. Neither movie has what you could call a coherent story, or is particularly entertaining enough to justify their bloated lengths.I think these two films are enough to prove that Terrence Malick movies aren't for me. And that film critics and movie buffs will praise anything that seems too 'artsy' for the unwashed masses.",4,5,8,18 June 2017
Spectre," Time to put Bond out to pasture
","I should preface this by saying that I'm not a huge fan of the 007 franchise - my wife is actually the Bond fan of the family. She owns them all on DVD, can't pass one up when channel surfing and insists on going to see each new movie in the theater. So by osmosis, I've seen way more Bond flicks than anyone should be subjected to, and this latest one may have been the last straw.I realize that this entry in the series was supposed to be a throwback to earlier films, and it quickly became apparent that they were trying to tie all the Daniel Craig plots together with this one, but stop me if you've seen this before: Open with a visually spectacular action sequence that puts Bond on the villain's trail. Cut to opening credits, which feature suggestively nude women writhing to a just god-awful theme song (the song was so bad this time that when the vocalist broke into falsetto I literally laughed out loud). Next M tells Bond that he's gone too far and takes him out of action. Bond goes to Q anyway and gets exactly the gadget he'll later need to save his life. Q is used to inject a bit of humor into an otherwise overly-dark movie.Next 007 visits the widow of the guy he killed in the opening sequence, and after making it clear that she hates him, she immediately jumps into bed with him anyway. From there on out it's just scene after scene of Bond being in just the right place at just the right time to get the next clue he needs to push the plot forward, while also engaging in car chases, fights with seemingly unbeatable henchmen and an insane sequence of flying an airplane down the side of a mountain.Eventually Bond hooks up with a young lady who can lead him to the villain's ridiculous lair. This time it turns out the bad guy has created an international crime syndicate and spent billions of dollars tracking Bond because...I'm not making this up...daddy loved James more than him.The young lady, after making it clear that she can take care of herself and wants nothing to do with 007, turns out to not be able to take care of herself and suddenly falls in love with Bond. After yet another unnecessarily gruesome Daniel Craig torture scene, they manage to defeat the villain and destroy his lair...but the movie's not over yet.Cut back to London. It turns out that the new C has been secretly working with the villain, a plot twist that anyone with half a brain probably saw coming an hour earlier. He conveniently falls to his death out a window. The villain is somehow still alive even though his entire lair complex blew up for no particular reason with him inside it. He has Bond's love interest trapped in a building that's going to blow up in 3 minutes. There's no way Bond can find her and escape in time...except that he does. And then shoots the villain's helicopter down with a handgun. The end.The only thing that set this movie apart from Bond films made decades ago was a sub-plot about the government trying to replace 007 with a massive surveillance program, which would have been topical if the movie had been made five years ago.I found myself looking at my watch a lot during this movie, wondering when it was going to be over and towards the end thinking 'we've already had at least two natural end points, why is this movie still going?' Don't waste your money seeing this one in a theater...in fact, just don't see it at all. If we stop encouraging them, maybe they'll finally put this dead horse out to pasture.",3,6,14,10 November 2015
