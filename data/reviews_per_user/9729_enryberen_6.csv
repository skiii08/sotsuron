Deja Vu," Entertainment that worth the price of ticket
","Despite of the title, this movie isn't anything 'already seen'. The plot tells a story never told before, even if some scenes are similar to another Tony Scott's movie, Public Enemy. However what I most like of 'Deja Vu' is the script. Unlike many others action movies, the language isn't vulgar, the story is clear though what it tells is highly improbable, and some gags are memorable ('I'll speak slowly so that those of you in the room who have PhDs can understand me.') I also liked the directing: the movie starts slowly, with a long description of the ship disaster; but then the rhythm became faster and faster and at the end, when the great Denzel is trying to change the past, I couldn't help nail-biting. Finally the last scene, where they go away and Denzel has a Deja Vu. I definitely enjoyed it, not the best movie ever, but certainly one that worth the price of the ticket. And in our time that's a huge merit.",8,1,2,19 December 2006
Finding Neverland," unbelievable! (deserved the Oscar much more than million dollar baby)
","I went to the cinema and saw 'Finding Neverland' for two reasons: the first, I loved Johnny Depp performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, the second, I was captured by the soundtrack. I didn't really know what I'd have found, but when I went out I was sure I had found it. It hadn't been that funny, that amazing, that entertaining... nevertheless I was feeling like heaven. That film, the only one which almost made me cry, had left something; something I knew I wouldn't have lost. Ever. Now I watch it once a month, or at least once a season, and every time I can't believe that's so wonderful, both I see it in my own language on in the original. Cause it isn't the script, it isn't the direction, it isn't the acting, it isn't the score... everything is perfect in this movie. Maybe because a tear is much more than one thousand ovations. Or at least that is what I believe.",10,1,2,5 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Wow-ho wow-ho!
","First of all I warn you: do not focus too much on the plot. There are some things you won't like, for the most of you a few things, for a few of you most things. But this is not a movie you'll love for its plot. You're going to love for its special effects better and better from the first chapter of the trilogy (the final battle is a masterpiece!), and because in this movie there's fun, a lot of fun: jack/johnny is irresistible, Barbossa is a great pirate and all the crew (pintel and ragetti over every other one) is hilarious. I saw it yesterday, but I'm going to see it again and again. Why? Because when you're on your seat and the light come down, then begins a show you cannot dislike. A suggestion? Enjoy it!",7,94,185,24 May 2007
The Prestige," deeper and deeper (it should have won many Oscars)
","At the beginning, this movie is like an anonymous box: you don't know what there's inside. So you open it, and what you find? Two boxes. Then you open those boxes, and find three more boxes. You go on opening and the only thing you find is more and more boxes. But, after all, aren't all the boxes part of the first one? When you wake up in the morning, you look at yourself in the mirror in front of you. This movie adds another mirror, behind your back. And then the pictures of you in the mirror become more and more; you don't have to turn back. But, after all, aren't all the pictures showing just one face? You've got a hundred-dollar bill in your wallet. This movie just turns it into five dollars'. Then into one's. And then into coins. But, after all, haven't you got one hundred dollars? At the beginning this movie is simple, ordinary, like an anonymous box, like your picture in the mirror, like an hundred-dollar bill. But then the best of all the living directors, Christopher Nolan, adds one, then two, then three more little things, and everything becomes faster, darker, deeper. And at the end you can just clap your hands: after all, isn't it just a movie?",10,9,15,16 March 2007
The Departed," they all laughed, but it isn't funny.
","People says this movie is great, wonderful, perfect... but what about the final? When I went to the cinema last week, the departed was just coming out and the seats were quite full. And when at last Di Caprio (I liked his performance very much) comes down from the flat... )who has already seen the departed know what scene I mean) well, all the people around me started laughing. Furthermore the first 2 hour are full with violence, vulgar language, raunchy scenes, and I can accepted them, but only if they have a sense! 'You're makin' nonsense at all, mate' Jack Sparrow'd say. I'm Italian but I don't understand the Italian Scorsese: why everything is so sad? Is that his personal meaning of justice? why all that violence? nothing and nobody explains it. Here in my country people use to be kind and gentle and the violence is never free.I would have enjoyed much more an happily-ever-after ending.",5,0,0,5 November 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as bad as they say
","I don't think this movie really deserve an 8/10 vote. But I neither think it deserves a 6.5 average. There's no doubt Trasformers: Revenge of the Fallen is worse than the first one. Yet it does entertain. And when you to go and see a movie like transformers you can't expect a deep and philosophical masterpiece. The first half hour is a bit slow: the prologue is even worse than the first one (and I started laugh when I heard 'Before time began, there was the Cube'!!!), and Sam's parents are less fun. Sam himself isn't that good. But as soon they reach the college, and when Sam starts to go out mad, then begins the best part of the movie: the funniest moments, the best fight (Optimus Vs Megatron & Co.), the best new entry (Jetfire) and finally the come back of one of the funniest character: John Turtutto's! He's - as always - amazing. But when the action goes off to Egypt, it's the beginning of the end. The movie becomes too slow and the final scene doesn't work as it should have. Why? Because we don't have a final battle, but ten or more little fight, especially the final standing between Optimus and the Fallen: too fast, less epic. Surely a script problem, maybe Micheal bay wanted too much, but in my opinion the real problem is another: you can't make a movie such as Transformers: revenge of the fallen in just 2 years. You don't have enough time to ponder what to do, to understand the strength of the first one and to strengthen what was weak. And, unavoidably, you reach this result: an entertaining movie, bigger but worse than its previous one.",Null,1,4,5 July 2009
