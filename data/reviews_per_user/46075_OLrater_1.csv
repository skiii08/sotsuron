3:10 to Yuma," Hi ho hi ho its off to Yuma we go.
","I had heard so many good comments about this movie, that I was excited when it came out on DVD. My Saturday afternoon was planned; entertainment and relaxation - a well spent way to procrastinate.I think I am a Christian Bale fan, and even though as a person Russell Crowe may not be great, his acting has, in the past, entertained me.The beginning of the movie was quite entertaining and I was, at first, happy with my video rental and the decision to put off my work to watch it. I like westerns and this supplied all of the facets of the genre that I enjoy.I probably would have given this movie a rating of 9 if I had turned it off just as the clock tolled to indicate that it was time to go to the train station. Perhaps it is puerile to judge a movie primarily for its ending, but that is your last impression. The ending just didn't make sense to me. I can't imagine what the writers were going for here, because everything up to this point was well done. Then, Wade decides to risk his life to get on the train (that is possibly taking him to his hanging) so that Evans can earn his son's respect. OK, I get it, personal redemption and all that, but seriously. I did have to rewind to see if I had missed something. Maybe Wade had a terminal illness and was going to die anyway. Not so, he just wanted to do something nice for someone he hardly knew.In this case, the guilt I felt over my work procrastination was warranted.",6,1,3,19 January 2008
