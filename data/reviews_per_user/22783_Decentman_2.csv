Hereditary," Creepy but dull
",On the positive side: creepy atmosphere via exceptional cinematography. Nice direction. Decent performances. But the story....All over the place. Rambles along with some creepy moments. But then...the sister gets her head chopped off along with the plausibility of the characters and the story arc. What is the point of this film? We are presented with a series of MISERABLE characters...who go through MISERABLE experiences...and some act like they're zombies (the son Peter). And the rest are either in some sort of odd trance (the weird daughter) or hysterical (the mother) or emotionally removed (the father). One serious problem is that they are ALL UNLIKEABLE. Period. From the beginning - when the lead mom (played by Toni Collette) spews venomous comments about her mother AT HER MOTHER'S FUNERAL...We are supposed to get behind her journey? And as the film progresses...we get a plethora of cliches: (1) the seance - by the way makes no sense in terms of the story structure and feels totally contrived (2) the ghostly apparitions pop in and out - also makes NO SENSE (3) the naked old people ghosts at the end - that takes the story into a final implausible area. The screenplay is a total joke. All over the place in terms of structure and focus. A buddy of mine (quoted here so I don't take credit) called in 'misery porn dressed up like a horror film'. And the audience certainly gets the misery part oh so well.,3,16,40,10 June 2018
Us," TRASH
","Ok. Okay...OKAAAAY. This film is supposed to be provocative...challenging...thought provoking, etc. As the viewer watches the narrative unfold - he/she is supposed to be SO CAUGHT up in the 'what does that mean?' mindset? The only way for that to work is for the film to have enough interesting stuff going on to propel us to want to 'figure it out'. Who wants to work THAT hard when the film bores us to tears. Nothing about it is interesting at all. Dull staging and direction. The only thing that triggers some interest is trying to figure out how Hollywood financed this drivel and how in the world did it make over 250 mil...HORRIBLE AND A TOTAL WASTE!!!!Shame on the pretentious self-serving Peele to try to infuse some sort of social message!!!",1,9,14,25 June 2019
