Catch Me If You Can," This Person Is My Hero....
","I have read the book, and find the movie delightfully entertaining. I love the fact this was based on a true story, and that Frank Abagnale Jr. was able to successfully beat our corrupt system at its' own game.However, the movie omitted a lot of events the book detailed. Such as Abagnale being asked to fly the airliner briefly, while the pilot went to the lavatory. Good thing Frank knew better to switch on the autopilot, while he was away. And being asked to deliver a newborn baby, while posing as a doctor. He was very fortunate an experienced nurse was nearby, that day. Despite Spielberg's aversion to sexual matters- the book clearly places Abagnale's exploits with women nearing 50 encounters. I admire anybody who can live this way, and not catch anything.Frank W. Abagnale, as a real-life pretender of sorts- illustrates what every young man's secret fantasy world craves; the ready ability to change and adapt to your surroundings. I applaud Abagnale's clever ability to 'socially engineer' himself so convincingly, at such a young age. Frank's message to me was clear; dress like how you wanted to be treated. I envy the fact he got away with this kind of crime in a day where it was easily perpetrated, and hard to detect. Those days are long gone. What is still true to this day, is that if you look and skillfully act the part- you can still BS anybody, into doing virtually anything.",8,2,5,2 October 2007
Alien," 'Alien' Is Among The BEST
","'In Space - Nobody Can Hear You Scream'Back in the summer of 1979- I was a high school freshman to-be, and this movie swept me off my feet, and rocked me to the core. It was truly the most frightening movie I have seen, since the first Exorcist. After the original Star Wars- I was fascinated by space, space travel, and strange beasts. This movie satisfied all those requirements- and then some. The eerie, comic-book imagery of H.R.Giger's artwork was a sci-fi fantasy come true. The Alien itself is a Phantasmagoric piece of art, in my eyes. Ridley Scott did a remarkably wonderful job of jogging our imaginations, fears, and nerves, with this classic. Hooray for Sigourney Weaver being the first female sci-fi action heroine!",9,0,1,3 June 2007
Limitless," The cause and effects of Crystal Meth....in pill form.
","In a role completely opposite of 'The Hangover,' dashing Bradley Cooper is a down-and-out, aspiring 'writer' seemingly caught in the most serious funk of his entire life. All that changes, when he stumbles upon his ex brother-in-law - a successful hustler of sorts, introducing Cooper to a life-changing event - all contained inside a small Zip lock bag.The clear, innocent-looking pill that costs an outrageous $800 a pop turns Cooper into a literal, mental dynamo...all in 30 seconds. Suddenly, everything is in sharp focus and the ability to remember and learn virtually everything becomes possible to him. He wastes no time reversing his bad luck and soon has the world at his feet...not to mention the thugs who want their stolen 'dope' back.Robert De Niro's small role is rather insignificant, in this movie. But, its Cooper who finally realizes he must make a choice for the better, and actually improves the drug itself. This movie is a fun, roller-coaster ride through the bright and dark side of drug addiction. Yet, it is still a sensationalized example of exactly what Pharmaceutical grade Methamphetamine can do to your energy levels and brain function. The morale of this story? If man made it...it will always KILL YOU.",8,0,4,19 March 2011
Titanic," Perfect Blend Of Fiction & Fact
","As much as I really want to knock this movie....I cannot. It almost made me cry- just like a chick flick. The screen writing of James Cameron is simply superb, in this movie. He obviously did ALL of his homework! The excellent CGI graphics of 1997 is still top-notch, by today's standards. The accuracy of all characters, and of the ship itself- is dead-on. I have read a lot of books on Titanic since this movie, and the realism is phenomenal. The final sinking scenes of the movie are the most riveting.I have watched this fine movie over ten times, and it never seems to grow old. I am not a Celine Dion fan- but her haunting musical score, gave this movie the full effect it deserves. Watch this movie and get a firsthand feel for what it's like to experience a turn-of-the-century steamship, and it's catastrophic sinking. A wonderful history lesson- all in one fine DVD.",10,2,3,2 July 2007
