Miracle," This was a great movie
","I saw this movie last night and I loved it. Since I born two weeks after the Olympics I did not see the original game. I did see a documentary about it on HBO and I said to myself this would be a perfect story to make into a movie. When I heard that there was a movie about it I could not wait to see it. I think that this generation knows what it is like to feel bad about ourselves, everywhere I turn there is Anti Americanism. We turn on the news and there is nothing happy (I should not say that, the mars lander was great). This movie is not about America being the best, it is about giving America hope again. This was a Miracle, hockey players from all across the country played as a unified team to beat the best team in the world. This gave America something to root for and I can relate since 9/11. I know a lot of people are saying that this movie was just America being pompous but how can it be pompous when it really happened? Is Apollo 13 pompous? Americans should not be riduculed for having national spirit.",8,0,0,1 February 2004
