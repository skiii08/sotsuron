"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Film that plays like a BBC television comedy
","My guess is that mentioning the name Simon Pegg doesn't generate any face-to-name recognition. As an actor, he has a resume that includes some 45 television and movie role credits. As a writer, his career seemed stuck in video hell with the exception of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz  two recent films that he both wrote and starred. But my bet is that if I put Simon Pegg into a police lineup, most people would be unable to identify the godfather to Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter, Apple. This is likely to change as Pegg has been cast as Scotty in the J.J. Abrams' Star Trek prequel due to be released this Christmas. In the meantime, Pegg has kept himself busy writing and starring in the David Schwimmer (Friends) new comedy Run Fatboy Run. Run Fatboy Run's story is your run of the mill comedy plot. Guy gets girl. Guy loses girl. Guy tries to impress girl to win her back. Guy gets girl. Easy ka-cheesy. This time 'round it's Dennis (Pegg) who left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the alter five years ago. In the half a decade that has passed since the groom ran down the street with the wedding party screaming his name in the background, and Dennis and Libby's lives have taken different directions. Libby seems to have done alright for herself. Granted, we never really find out what career path she has taken, but her home is quiet quaint and her lifestyle seems relaxed and at ease. On the other side of the fence there's Dennis. Dennis works as a security guard for a woman's clothing store. He lives in a basement apartment of a Mr. Ghoshdashtidar  a rotund, Indian man that later becomes integral to the 'win-back-Libby' crusade. Dennis doesn't have enough money to pay his rent and his excursions with his son usually command imaginative thinking like climbing a tree and scaring the beejeezus out of unsuspecting visitors by throwing sticks at trashcans when the walk by.It takes the introduction of Whit (Hank Azaria) to push Dennis into action. Whit is the new boyfriend of Libby. He is everything Dennis is not. He's successful. Seemingly intelligent. Well dressed and spoken. And, most notably for the films plot, he is entered into a Nike 26-mile marathon for charity.Dennis is obviously jealous of Whit's involvement in his family's life and in an effort to win back the respect of his ex-girlfriend, Dennis also finds a way to enter the marathon and begins training three weeks before the event. Most of the comedy accompanies his training. There is his jogging outfit that looks like something Mr. Bean would wear to a public pool. There is his first attempt at running that gets him to the end of his street before cramping up and calling it a day. And then there's the foot blister that caused most of our audience to squirm in their seats and many to watch the scene through the slots in their fingers covering their eyes. This middle section to the film provides a few chuckles without the belly busting laughs.By the time Dennis finally takes to the starting line alongside nemesis Whit, you can write the ending without having viewed the final reels. Sure, it was touching but the ending was never in doubt and you can draw from countless films of the same ilk to find endings of similar fashion.As a directorial debut for Schwimmer (theatrical debut, as he has done television work), Run Fatboy Run showed his inexperience. The entire experience played like a BBC television program including some bad cuts between scenes that you could imagine ending abruptly for commercial placement. The pacing was consistent, but that's what we want out of 30-minute comedies. In theatrical events where we pay a good dollar to experience, we want large highs and just enough lows to catch our breath. Instead we got a 'safe' film where the laughs are produced through our main characters reactions to the situations and people around him. Most notably are the second tier characters, Gordon (Dylan Moran) and Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel). Gordon plays Dennis' best friend and Libby's cousin and does his best to inject some humor into lines and situations that wouldn't warrant these results if the film was based on actual characters. And only the British can make lines such as 'The only serious relationship I've been in ended in a broken collarbone and a dead meerkat.'. Not classic, but the audience did render a unanimous snicker. Mr. Ghoshdashtidar steals a few laughs by acting as Dennis' Miyagi with a spatula. Together with Gordon, the two provide us with the laughs when Dennis is busy trying to get serious again with his plot objectives.The end result for Run Fatboy Run is that it is a safe and intermittently funny film that will provide you entertainment and have you forget almost everything except for a blister popping scene in the morning. It is a film that does have a heart  it just doesn't have a regular heartbeat and that what keeps it from being more than just another comedy that collects in our viewing catalogues like ties on Father's Day.www.robertsreviews.com",6,3,6,23 March 2008
The Lobster," Wha?
","This one's going to be tough to describe. The winner of the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Festival , The Lobster is the new film from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos who had me involved while scratching my head at screenings of his previous resume entries Dogtooth (2009) and ALPS (2011). I considered both decent films, but I surely wasn't put in a position to recommend either film to the average film watcher. Even the posters for his first two films were a difficult digestion.With The Lobster, Lanthimos gathers together a cast that includes Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw to introduce us to a world where all single people over a certain age must report to a hotel to find a mate. If, after a 45-day perusing and courting period, the individual does not find a mate they are then transformed into an animal (you can sign up for any particular animal) and sent into the wild.Wha? Colin Farrell plays David. David has recently separated from his wife and is therefore deemed 'single' and reports to the hotel for his search amongst the residents. Registered to become a lobster if things do not progress accordingly, David is none too accepting of the hotel's policies and he befriends a group of other disgruntleds in the woods (notably John C. Reilly and Rachel Weisz) where they discuss the unorthodox methods and ideas behind the premise. The group, named The Loners, are a weird bunch to say the least and that doesn't even take into account their names which include 'The Limping Man', 'Nosebleed Woman' and 'Biscuit Woman'.If nothing else, The Lobster is something I haven't quite seen before. In an era of men and women in tight colorful clothing running around saving our cities with their superpowers, The Lobster seemed like a breath of fresh air. But without being able to put my finger directly on the pulse, I was a little baffled and let down by the overall execution.Weisz is good and her soothing voice is a welcome both in her presence and in her narration of the film. But Farrell, Reilly and others are just too boring to have kept me interested in a truly unique story by Lanthimos and Filippou. The film is a commentary on the whole dating ritual and how the world almost forces us into finding a soul mate, but the characters fail to connect with audiences in a way that would turn The Lobster into an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Maybe I just didn't get it. Maybe the film was smarter than me and I failed to pick up on any of the nuances that helped The Lobster walk away with the Jury Prize. I liken it very much to the first Wes Anderson film I saw – The Royal Tenenbaums – which confounded me but has grown a bit on my soft side like old university ivy.Whether Farrell's plump David or Reilly's Lisping Man become something I grow affection for remains to be certain. What I do know is that I saw something original. I just don't think I liked it or will recommend it to others.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",5,22,49,20 September 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," You won't find a better movie this year
","You gotta love this Tarantino guy.  Having made only three movies in 11 years, he came back to the spotlight in 2003 with the ultra-violent and critically acclaimed, Kill Bill Vol.1.  The movie was another non-linear story about a pregnant bride who seeks revenge over the fellow thugs that massacred her at her wedding rehearsal, and in particular, the ringleader and former lover, Bill.  Now, just six months removed from local theatres comes the next chapter of the vigilante in the suitably titled Kill Bill Vol. 2.Reprising her role as The Bride (although the films were shot simultaneously, so the word reprising might not be appropriate) is Uma Thurman.  For those that remember, she awoke from a four-year coma in Vol. 1 and quickly began her roaring rampage of revenge on O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green, two of the five participants in her botched murder.That left Ellie Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and father figure Bill (David Carradine) to cross of the list and The Bride begins with Bill's brother Budd.  Not that this is where the movie begins however.  In true Tarantino style, Vol. 2 actually starts before the massacres of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita.  A black and white opening chapter takes us back to the wedding chapel where the assault takes place and we understand more of the love Bill has for The Bride and how his jealousy overtakes him.  Actually, Vol. 2 goes even further back in the past and spends a good portion of its 21/2 hour running time showing a quiet fireside moment between Bill and The Bride and later her training with a martial arts and discipline trainer, Pai Mei.  I was sure that if Tarantino had another hour from the studio, we would have seen The Bride's birth and first communion.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an extension of Vol. 1 that together showcases the best of Quentin's talent.  Where Vol. 1 had all the violence, blood and a pussy wagon, Vol. 2 has conversations about Superman, a reunion with a long lost daughter and a focus on the motivation for each character.Don't get me wrong; Vol. 2 has more than the average movie's share of action and carnage.  When The Bride first encounters Budd, she is shot with salt bullets and then buried alive.  Her resurrection then leads her back to Budd's trailer where Ellie is finishing up some business and soon the two are involved in a catfight involving swords, fists and even a television antenna.   Kept within the confines of the tight trailer space, the fight claustrophobically exciting with a conclusion that will leave you wishing you were not listening in Dolby Digital.The biggest difference between the two volumes will probably be what the average filmgoer complains about the most, and that is the dialogue. Known for character rants on everyday conversation topics like a Madonna song (Reservoir Dogs) or a Quarter Pounder in Europe (Pulp Fiction), Tarantino has always been praised on how he whips verbiage to his audience with such fluent accuracy that you marvel at it's insightful perceptions, yet it is probably no different from a conversation you would have with a friend or neighbor.  In Vol.2, he exploits his gift and whether it is Ellie reading an internet history on the Black Mamba snake or Bill telling the story about his favorite superhero we are subjected to long speeches that take their time and unfold like origami.But despite all the gibber jabber between characters, it will not be a sentence or an expression that you will remember when you leave the theatre. Instead, you will remember The Bride being buried alive and fighting her way out of the darkness.  You will remember how Ellie lost her fight and you will laugh at how she is remembered in the final credits.  And you will remember that The Bride gets her revenge even if they don't all fall as a result of her hands.To say that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is better than Vol. 2 or the other way around is to forget that they were shot simultaneously and is essentially the same movie split in two so that Miramax can make as much money as possible. Both are definitely unique in their style and presentation.  You may not appreciate Vol.2 after being so wound up after the fight with the 88's at the conclusion of 1, but give it a couple of months and watch both volumes back to back on DVD.  You won't find a more unique or better film this year I'll bet.",8,0,1,20 April 2004
The New World," How can history be soooo boring?
","My guess is that most people have not heard of Terrence Malick. Outside of film enthusiasts and those people on the Ken Jennings side of the Trivial Pursuit knowledge belt, Malick is a name that isn't as well known as say a Scorsese or an M. Night. Hell, I would even venture that Michael Bay's name would illicit more recognition on the street than Mr. Malick. But hell, when you release only five films in thirty five years, what can we expect.That's right. I'll write it again just in case the numbers got lost on you the first time. Five Films. Thirty-five years. Look it up. I'll wait.Lanton Mills, Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and now, The New World. It's a simple resume, yet Malick is considered one of the more revered directors on the film circuit. Personally, I could never understand why and with the The New World now out in theatres, I am bewildered even further.The New World is the story of Pocahontas - the version that isn't a Disney animated feature that had Mel Gibson prancing around in full Technicolor. Pocahontas is played by fairly newbee Q'Onraka Kilcher and follows her from when her tribe first meets the English settlers who land in Virginia in hopes of setting up a new colony. Pocahontas is particularly interested in John Smith (Colin Farrell) after she pleads for his life from her father  the leader of the tribe. Spared, John begins to teach her English and the two soon form a bond and a relationship that teases us for nearly 90 minutes before ending in an even more disappointing fashion.In the hands of Michael Bay, we may have put up with the lack of chemistry between the two leads as he would have had it sandwiched in-between overblown violent confrontations between the tribe and the settlers. But in the hands of Malick we get Pocahontas running in the fields, John Smith staring off into nowhere and the occasional holding of hands that is less sensual than when I pet my neighbors cat.The story does take an interesting turn in the final chapters when we are introduced to John Rolfe (Christian Bale who, interestingly enough, was the voice of a character in the 1995 Disney version). When Rolfe comes on the scene, Smith is long gone having faked his own death becausewell, who the hell really knows why. During her grieving, Pocahontas has become Westernized. She is no longer wearing native clothes, but rather corsets and shoes with heels. She has become fluent in the English language and accepts Rolfe as a husband even as she pines for the 'thought-as-dead' John Smith.Their relationship blossoms as the two actually touch, kiss and even have a child together before Pocahontas learns that Smith is still alive and accepts a trip to England in an effort to confront her feelings.We are probably past the two hour mark of the film now when the first thing that we actually give a damn about occurs, that being a meeting between Pocahontas and the long forgotten Smith where it will be revealed to the audience which one she will choose to fulfill her all too short life.Well, the result is not surprising due to how we got there in the first place, and even though you won't leave the theatre whistling a happy tune, at least we got an ending true to the story rather that a Hollywood re-work.But that in no way makes up for the meandering and lazing about we have to go through for 150 minutes before we get to the ending (which went on to an annoying musical score longer than the final chapter of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King last act). Too many of the audience's precious minutes are spent with camera shots of trees from the ground capturing the sunlight beaming down that I began to think that lying down in a forest all alone would be more rewarding than having to sit in an uncomfortably theatre chair and watch the same thing over and over and over again.So my lack of understanding as to the genius of Terrence Malick continues. I will agree that the guy knows his cinematography  maybe to a fault. But if this guy only produces a film on the same frequency as Haley's Comet, he at least doesn't have to subject us to view of the sky looking for the damn thing.www.robertsreviews.com",4,5,14,22 January 2006
Walk the Line," Haven't we seen all this before
","For the second time in as many years, an autobiography of a music legend is rushed to the silver screen after the untimely death of their star character. Where Jamie Foxx channeled the late Ray Charles to awards glory in 2004, Joaquin Phoenix tries to emulate country music legend Johnny Cash in the new James Mangold film, Walk the Line.The comparison between Ray and Walk the Line are unescapable. Both films followed the music icons from their childhood through to the height of their stardom. Both films dealt with the drug abuse that almost ruined both of their careers. And both films spend a good deal of screen time on the various women in their lives.In Walk the Line, the woman who most influences Johnny Cash is June Carter (Resse Witherspoon, Legally Blonde). After we watch as Johnny survives the death of his older brother and his struggle to cut his first record and go on tour, Mr. Cash meets June Carter at a small auditorium gig that includes Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley on the same card. Although already married, Cash is immediately smitten by June's beauty and ability to communicate to an audience. You don't need to have seen the True E! Hollywood Story to know where this will lead.In truth, knowing where things will lead is exactly the problem with Walk the Line. It has been done before. Many times. A musical artist that becomes a sensation in a short period of time, gets hooked on drugs and then becomes clean towards the end of the film. Ho-hum. How many times have we seen that in the past ten years. Two films, Ray and Some Kind of Monster took similar paths just months before and Walk the Line gives us nothing new or interesting to marvel at as we take the already beaten path.What does save Walk the Line from the mediocre are the stellar performances by the two leads (Phoenix and Witherspoon). Joaquin learned to play the guitar from scratch for the role and even does all his own singing (take that Jamie Foxx!). His walk with the favoring limp and the way Cash talked out of the side of his mouth are mimicked to perfection by Phoenix who is sure to get his second Academy Award nomination when the are announced in just a few months.But performances can only take a film so far, and Walk the Line falls short of providing us any new insight into the world of a rock star that most of us growing up wishing to one day be a part of. In fact, the film spends too much time just mulling around that when we finally get to what should be the hi-light of the film ie. the concert at Folsom Prison that became one of the best live albums of all-time, we are not jumping out of our seats, clapping to the music having enjoyed the journey to this particular historic event.Instead, we meander with a man who never gained his fathers full respect, never was a good husband to his first wife and never lived a life that was so extraordinary that people would shell out hard earned dollars just to see how a legend walked the line.www.robertsreviews.com",6,1,5,20 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Terrible Waste of Time
","In December of 2009, director Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Rocknrolla) brought us Sherlock Holmes – an action/adventure period piece starring Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role as the fictional detective created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.The film was released when a small flick named Avatar was reaping in gazillion's of dollars, but it held it's own and Sherlock was able to rake in half a billion dollars in worldwide box office receipts. With such a response at the box office, we didn't need Sherlock Holmes to uncover Hollywood's plan to bring a sequel to our big screens faster than a Watson quip.The result is Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows which opens December 16, 2011. The main components were all back for the second offering. Downey again would play Holmes, the master of disguise with keen problem solving abilities and he would be joined again by Jude Law as his trusty partner Watson, Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler and Ritchie who would again find himself behind the camera.Picking up on an open ended sub plot at the conclusion of the first film, Holmes and Dr. Watson team up again in an attempt to bring down their adversary, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). They will be aided by a gypsy, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace – The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Holmes' brother Mycroft (played wonderfully by Stephen Fry).The plot involves Moriarty's attempt to start a World War and then profit greatly with his armoury of available weapons. Standing in his way will be Holmes, who seems kookier than he did in the first film, but far less believable. Holmes' addictions are still diverse (we catch him drinking embalming fluid) and it will take all of Watson's attention (taking him away from his honeymoon) to keep Holmes from getting himself killed while the two piece together a fairly routine and uninspired plot.With little story to grip or engross, the entertainment value is going to come from the action sequences and Game of Shadows paints its scenes with a sloppy wide brush. Sequences are stopped, slowed down, sped up and shot with quick zooms which all make for exciting viewing for the first 20 seconds then becomes distracting and overly stylish for a movie meant for the masses. Artillery shells blow away trees and rapid gunfire cuts through a train, but we doubt that either scene will have audiences on the edge of their seats or leaving the theatre in absorbed conversation over the action.Robert Downey does his best (I suppose) but he has very very little to work with. Law is again a worthy partner, but McAdams and Rapace are wasted in their efforts (particularly McAdams who has so little to do with A Game of Shadows we wonder why she came back at all).Billed as an action/comedy it is important then too to address the comedic moments of the film. Very little, if any, of the humor worked on a mass scale. The packed house at the sneak preview did present a few chuckles here and there, but hardly a full laugh. The biggest laugh came when a hungover Watson was awakened by bagpipes. Yeah. We know. Hilarious stuff.With failure in the script writing, the action, the comedy and the wasted efforts of the talent attached all make for a very disappointing film. In fact, we could easily stand on our English soapbox and declare that not only does A Game of Shadows not live up to the fairly mediocre bar set by its predecessor, but it is also easily one of the worst films of the year.",1,50,121,12 December 2011
Miracle," Another feel good, lessons learned film from Disney
","As a Canadian, I sat back with much anticipation north of the border for reviews of the new Disney film Miracle, chronicling the rise and eventual glory of the 1980 USA Hockey Team at the XIII Olympics.  I knew as Canadians we would not take kindly to watching again the euphoria of a country winning at our national game.  I knew that there would be the usual flag waving that American's like to put in their sports films and I knew this would put off even the most unbiased and objective of Canadian film reviewers.  I knew that given all the above, it would be hard to find a positive review of the film even if it succeeded where most sports films fail. Unfortunately, I was right.Miracle is the story of Herb Brooks, a coach with roots in the minor leagues that is chosen to lead a group of unknown hockey players against the powerhouse of the Russian team that had not lost in international competition in 20 years.  Herb (Kurt Russell) adopts a new approach of taking the game to the opposition rather than simply defending against them. In efforts to accomplish this monumental feat, Herb raises eyebrows by taking on a group of hard workers rather than statistical players.  `I'm not looking for the best players Jim, I'm looking for the right ones' he exclaims to his assistant coach Craig Patrick.  The results are at first, disasterous, but once the team begins to build character and believe in their coaches vision, the victories begin to amass and their road to the Olympic podium begins.Anyone over the age of 35 will remember the Miracle on Ice.  Russia had just invaded Afghanistan and there was much tension between the two world powers. The Olympics were expected to be boycotted by Russia due to President Jimmy Carters harsh words towards the Russian offensive, but cooler heads prevailed and athlete's were not punished for their governments politics.  
Russia came into the Olympics the odds on favorite.  They had not lost in international competition in years and had recently beaten the best the NHL had to offer just weeks before.  The U.S. on the other hand did not even rank on the Olympic hockey radar.  The previous Olympics saw the squad being trounced by scores of incredible discrepancy.  But history was to be made in Lake Placid and American hockey was on the map.Hockey movies have not done incredibly well at the box office.  Sure, the Mighty Ducks was a small success spanning a few sequels, but if you were to pick the best hockey movie of all time, outside of Slap Shot there is not much to choose from (Youngblood, Mystery Alaska).  However, director Gavin O'Connor does a good job of telling the story of the coach rather than the team, and this seems to work under the strong acting performance by Russell. The movie does have faults.  At over two hours, the film seemed longer than it should have been and the editing of the on-ice action seemed as if it was shot by different directors, one having a flare for following the play and other wanting to show the skates and low angle shots. 
However, for anyone that remembers the series, all the elements and events were duplicated.  Who can forget the goal with no seconds remaining at the end of the first period or the fact that Tretieck, the best goalie to maybe ever play the game, was benched by Russia for the remaining 40 minutes? 
Miracle is a feel-good, bring your family to, kinda movie.  It shows you what hard work and believing in yourself is all about, and really, how many movies can honestly credit themselves with that?",7,1,2,8 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Best of the three
","I can't remember any film in recent history that has had more people 'attached' to a project than Mission Impossible III. Going back as far as 2004, there have been directors (Joe Carnahan and David Fincher) actors (Kenneth Branagh, Ricky Gervais) and actresses (Carrie Ann Moss, Thandie Newton and Scarlett Johansson) that were all slated to be involved with the project that had to pull out due to either creative differences (good-bye Caranahan) or due to scheduling conflicts as the films production continued to be pushed back what seemed like an eternity.The only things that remained certain was that the movie was going to eventually get made and that couch-jumping Tom Cruise would again reprise his role of IMF agent, Ethan Hunt for the third time.This time 'round, director J.J. Abrams (no, not the same JJ from Good Times) was behind the camera taking over the reins of a franchise that saw two big name helmers, Brian De Palma and John Woo, bring their vision to the screen in the past 10 years.J.J.'s theatrical directing experience sat at an overall count of zero. Abrams had impressed Cruise with his creation and direction of the television shows Alias and Lost, but the difference between a one-hour pilot and a $150 million dollar budgeted event film is night and day no matter how you cut it, so Abrams was a little over his head.But you wouldn't know it.Abrams works the camera like a seasoned pro and stages the action sequences as good as Michael Bay (I could write, 'as bad as Michael Bay', but I think you get my point). When the show gets a-rockin', Abrams keeps a good pace and by the end of the film, his direction outshines that of the series predecessors.Before I get too far ahead of myself, let's get back to the basics. Mission Impossible III has Ethan Hunt going up against his most diabolical villain to date, Owen Davien played fiendishly by Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Davien is in search of a weapon known as the 'Rabbit's Foot' and uses Hunt's unsuspecting wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) as leverage to get Ethan to acquire the Rabbit's Foot for his malicious intentions.In order to pull off the impossible, Ethan assembles his team which again includes Luthur, played a third time by Ving Rhames. Together, the team must simply evade authorities, fight against superior firepower, jump from building to building and basically do a bunch of stunts that would have Superman himself saying 'Too dangerous'.And while they dodge bullets, planes and rockets (Oh My!), there are IMF brass that are either for or against the operation which leaves us wondering who is pulling the strings and what double cross will come on the heels of the double cross that just occurred.Mission Impossible III does all the summer blockbuster things right. It blows things up. It has an unequivocal movie star in the lead, and it has a villain that is downright one of the best since Sean Connery was a British Secret Agent. But maybe most amazingly is that MI:III has us forget the Cruise that we have seen on every tabloid cover, every entertainment news program and every website blog since War of the Worlds premiered a year ago. By beginning the film with a high tension moment between Davien and Hunt, we immediately are engrossed in both the ruthlessness of the baddie and the plight of the victims that we immediately leave our preconceived notions at the lobby doors.Then, over the next two hours, we get suckered into following along the characters with great interest as our eardrums are attacked by surround sound explosions.There are two things that would have taken MI:III into the annals of incredible action flick instead of just a very good one. First, they could have rooted the action sequences more in the realm of reality. Like the first two installments, Ethan is a one man wrecking crew that can jump from building to building and shoot people while sliding off high rise window tops. Couple this with the trademark masking and impersonating of characters which comes across like a bad Halloween joke and you get more James Bond than you do Die Hard.The second complaint is more personal. It is that Hoffman didn't get more screen time. As Davien, Hoffman gives a performance that was as fun to watch as Travolta was in Face/Off. He is cut throat and believable without a likable bone in his body. His confidence in his schemes are his strengths and part of me actually wanted him to win (or at least survive so that we can see him again in MI:IV).Mission Impossible III has countless subplots that have all been done before. There is the unsuspecting new wife who learns of her husbands real identify only after being sucked into the plans of the evil geniuses (True Lies). There are the bosses at IMF that fight amongst each other never revealing until the last moment which one is actually on the side of our hero (just about every action film since 1980) and there is an agent that is kidnapped and requires her mentor to come to the rescue. But for all the familiarity, there is still fun to be had, and rarely does a third film ever make you not turn your nose up at option of a fourth.www.robertsreviews.com",7,0,0,14 May 2006
Source Code," Better Than It Should Be Thriller
","Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a passenger train. He is confused and disorientated as the woman across from him engages him in conversation. How did he get here? Why can't he remember anything? Why isn't he with his battalion in Afghanistan? These questions abound in his head when an explosion is heard and the train car explodes killing all on board.After the explosion, Captain Stevens wakes up in some sort of simulation chamber. He is strapped to a chair and a small video screen appears where Mission Controller Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) calmly requests that he recalls the incidents on the train leading up to the explosion. Stevens learns that he is part of a military scientific experiment wherein they can insert a consciousness into another body in the past for a span of 8 minutes. Stevens has assumed the body of a non-descript school teacher and he is continually sent back in time (much to his frustration) with the mission of determining who triggered the bomb so that future lives can be saved.We then sit back and get a mix of Minority Report meets Memento meets Groundhog Day as Captain Stevens continually travels back and encounters repeated behaviors from the passengers in an attempt to extract clues that will lead present day authorities to the bomber's capture.Upon his return visits, Captain Stevens is distracted by two involving yet distracting sub-plots. The first involves a budding relationship with Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) – a fellow passenger on the train. There is little chemistry to be compounded in 8-minute intervals, but Christina's involvement in the investigation will be paramount leading to the eventual climax.The second diversion comes with the Captain's attempts to determine his own fate. Why is he here? Did he volunteer? Why doesn't he have any recollection of the events leading up to his cooperation in the operation? Is he dead? These questions will impede his focus on the tasks at hand and cause for much confusion and stress between the Captain and the commanders running the operation (code named Beleaguered Castle).Sharply scripted by Ben Ripley (Species III) and efficiently directed by Duncan Jones (Moon), Source Code is better than it should be thanks to the combined efforts of the believable cast and the tension of a reducing timeframe in order to identify the terrorist.Dead ends do occur, but they are plausible actions taken in a live game of Clue where one query or investigation may lead to the exclusion of a potential threat. Gyllenhaal steps into a role that would likely have been cast to Harrison Ford circa 1991 and he does his best to help us forget that it's the Prince of Persia himself trying to help solve a case that will save millions of lives.The final chapters of Source Code are Inception-ish in that the ending can be argued for interpretation. Whether the laws of science and science fiction could be altered in a Twilight Zone finale might leave some groaning in non-acceptance. Add to that a few plot holes (one involving a gun) that just didn't make sense based on the parameters set by the premise, and the movie just fails to meet the mark of 'excellence' and has to settle for 'very good'.But that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying an enjoyable film that can make rehashed scenes still feel new and exciting. There is some good action intertwined with an intelligent script that doesn't talk down to its audience as he barrels its way down the tracks.www.killerreviews.com",8,0,2,4 April 2011
Deepwater Horizon," Good, just not emotionally draining
","We all remember the images of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Millions of gallons of oil spewed from the ocean floor for 87 days all captured and broadcast with a live internet feed. It was the worst oil spill in US history and BP oil has paid over $70 billion in fines and clean-up efforts.But what you might not remember is that the spill occurred when the floating oil rig Deepwater Horizon suffered a catastrophic explosion which resulted in the loss of 11 crew lives. Director Peter Berg (Lone Survivor) again teams up with actor Mark Wahlberg in an attempt to bring the fascinating and heroic story to audiences in the action-biopic Deepwater Horizon.Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who was the chief electronics technician for Transocean on the Deepwater Horizon. Scheduled to work upon the oil rig for just a few weeks, Williams along with Transocean offshore installation manager Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell) quickly identify that BP has cut corners with safety measures in an attempt to hit production targets. 'Money, money, money' one of the operators sings as his conclusion to BP's negligence.Concerns represented by Williams and Harrell do little to convince on-site BP officials to radically change course and slow operations until all safety precautions have been taken. Their disregard resulted in a high pressure methane gas explosion that engulfed the rig platform. One hundred and five crew members were on board when the explosion took place at approximately 9:45PM CMT. Ninety-Four were rescued. Eleven crew were never found.Wahlberg and Russell are both convincing in their respective roles. It might be difficult in theory to rationalize Wahlberg as an electronics technician, but the versatile actor convincingly plays a smart family-oriented blue-collar worker and the ultimate hero of the film.Much of the first reel deals with BP's neglect and the conflict with the experienced workers aboard the rig. The unflattering digs are not discreet and we imagine that BP in no way will be exultant to see how Matthew Michael Carnahan and Matthew Sand's screenplay shines the light on corporate greed. Berg does his best to try and describe the safety tests that took place aboard the vessel, but it's not until the first explosion that audiences will become engaged in the horrific ordeal.Berg is no stranger to blowing things up. We all want to forget 2010's Battleship, but it likely did expose Berg to A-Level special effects and they are on full display here. The Deepwater Horizon replica is considered the largest set ever built and Berg most have took delight in completely devastating the platform with pyro techniques and theatre rattling explosions. Kurt Russell ran through fires and explosions in 1991's Backdraft, but things are turned up a notch here.As an action film, Deepwater Horizon works wonderful well. For certain, audiences will not bored through the blasts and heroics of our protagonists. Where the film does falter is in its emotional appeal. Although we get a small glimpse into the home life of Mike Williams (his wife is played by Kate Hudson who acts with father Kurt Russell for the first time), the film doesn't pull at the heartstrings for the eleven souls lost that fateful April evening. They are memorialized before the end credits role, but they are lost in the shuffle of action packed sequences that consume the 107-minute running time of Deepwater Horizon.The film is still important. It is important that we learn from our mistakes and that we remember the fallen. It's just unfortunate that Berg was unable to take a gallant story and turn it into something that acted as historical reference, casual entertainment and emotional groundwork that would evoke change in big industry standards.",6,31,59,18 September 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," A worthy addition to the franchise
","It's hard to review a 3-D film when your screener is in two dimensions. I am not talking about the Clash of the Titans or The Last Airbender type 3-D where they tried to convert the film after production. I am referring to a movie that was meant to be in 3-D and was filmed with the proper cameras and style to appreciate the genre. I am referring to Resident Evil: Afterlife.This, the fourth entry in the franchise, picks up immediately after Resident Evil: Extinction with Alice (Milla Jovovich) continuing to travel the world in search of human survivors after the virus unleashed by the Umbrella Corporation has turned most of the world's population into ultra-violent zombies.The film opens in a blaze of gunfire as Alice(s) invade the underground lair of the Asian Umbrella Corporation. It is here, she confronts her arch nemesis Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) for the first time in the series. This confrontation leaves Alice human (do your homework) and almost dead after their getaway transport crashes in the mountains.Alice then begins her search for other humans. A search that will eventually reunite Alice with fellow kick-asser Claire Redfield (Ari Larter) who was last seen looking for human life herself in Resident Evil: Extinction. The two will travel to Los Angeles where they will band together with a small group of human survivors that include Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Bennet (Kim Coates) and Claire's incarcerated brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller).With the gang all working together to fight the encroaching undeads, the normal shoot-outs and fisticuffs will ensue – mostly in exaggerated physical sequences that are accompanied by a musical score that almost had my sub-woofer beating through the basement floor.Resident Evil: Afterlife is written and directed by W.S. Anderson, the director of the original Resident Evil, Aliens vs. Predator and Death Race. Anderson is up to his usual tricks in Afterlife. He is good (sometimes real good) at action sequences, but character development and dialogue are trailing behind in all the action. A terrible voice over to introduce the film sets the tone and you get the feeling that Anderson doesn't push his actors (particularly the pivotal character of Albert) into multiple takes until the final product is delivered in the appropriate tone.When it does come down to the action, Anderson does the franchise proud. There was a great scene involving a wide angle show of a single engine plane leaving a blood streak as it chopped through hundreds of zombie onlookers and another scene of Alice jumping off a building and the zombie faithful following her to their second deaths. Other gun fights and muscle flexings seem to continue far longer than is necessary, however, we do realize that this is what the fan base clamors for.There are plenty of scenes that look like they would project well in the 3-D format. From sunglasses being flung to a plane crash. Unfortunately in the 2-D format, we can only imagine the difference.The concluding chapters to Resident Evil: Afterlife were a bit of a letdown. After Alice seems to find a large contingent of human life, she again must confront Wesker who has become pretty much invincible. Their final battle scene might have looked good in three dimensions, but it lacked the great climax we were hoping.The final scene in Resident Evil: Afterlife strongly suggests a sequel, and why not? The film garnished $59 million of its $60 million budget domestically. But internationally, Resident Evil: Afterlife brought in $200 million more. And with those kind of returns, you can guarantee that the franchise is dead and kicking.www.killerreviews.com",7,9,19,17 October 2010
United 93," Heroes all
","Is it too soon? Are we ready? Am I ready? These three questions have been asked in just about every media outlet on the crest of the new 9/11 film release, United 93. Whether, you, I, or the world is ready to relive in graphic detail the events that unfolded on September 11th is up each individual, but whether you find yourself standing in line at a movie theatre, renting the DVD this fall or avoiding it altogether, nothing will take away from the fact that United 93 is a fantastic film that leaves you breathless and shows the world more heroes than just those that were onboard the fateful flight.United 93 is directed by Paul Greengrass, who is no stranger to fact based-documentary type shot films. In 2002, Greengrass filmed Bloody Sunday which was a dramatization of the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops on January 30, 1972. Bloody Sunday was one of the best reviewed films of the year and ended up on many (including yours truly), Best Of lists when the year was recapped.Based on this previous outing of success, Greengrass was the perfect choice to direct United 93 (note that the studio did not 'choose' him but rather, he pitched it to the executives).United 93 tells the story of the fourth airplane to be used in the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The story of that plane came to us slowly while we were still digesting the horrors of the attacks on New York. As it was recounted through phone recordings and conversations between the passengers in the air and their loved ones of the ground, the plane was taken over by terrorists with the expected goal of using the flying tube as a weapon, quite possibly flying the plane into the Nation's Capital.As family and friends spoke to those on United 93, the passengers began to hear of the stories of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon and they knew that the intention of the terrorists was to martyr themselves, taking the passengers and crew with them.The passengers fought back. And their mark in history was recorded.United 93 does a spectacular job of keeping us on the edge of our seats even as we know how the film will eventually unfold. Greengrass does this by spending much of the time with the stories that we weren't completely aware about. The stories about the ground controllers, the FAA staff and the army all grappling with the unfolding events and determining the next course of action. We relive the events as they lived them  on the front line of events that changed forever the world to which we live.We learn amongst the chaos that the army had difficulty getting authorization to scramble fighter jets and that those that did eventually make it airborne were unarmed and headed in the wrong direction. We learn that those on the ground in command centres were ill prepared for the events and had problems with communication both internally (trying to determine if there were other flights hijacked at the time) and externally (trying to get an open communication channel to the army). We learn that one man  on his first day on the job  made the executive decision to ground all planes in lieu of any government intervention.United 93 tells these stories while jumping back and forth to the passengers aboard the plane and we watch as they learn and accept their fate and then react in a manner that would thwart the hijackers intentions as the plane flew into an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.United 93 is an emotional punch to the stomach and a jaw dropper to boot. I sat amazed as these people figured things out based on limited intelligence and made decisions of universal impact. All this occurring while I stood dumbfounded in front of an office computer watching streamlined video of the event almost five years ago. I was reacting when then were acting. Heroes all.You will leave United 93 exhausted, and during water cooler discussions that follow you will not be able to remember a characters name or backstory. That is because their isn't any. Greengrass doesn't follow the typical rules of an event film and keeps to the real time facts - not singling out any one person or institution, but telling the story of how the group of heroes both on the ground and in the air forever etched a mark in our long term memory.www.robertsreviews.com",9,5,10,3 May 2006
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Good, But Fails to Meet High Expectations
","I have long been a fan of director Timur Bekmanbetov's work. I was lucky enough to see his 2004 film Night Watch on the festival circuit that year and I was immediately taken by the visual styles and effects that Bekmanbetov brought to the screen. My admiration continued when Timur worked on his first English language film, Wanted, starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman. The film was hokey (a loom - really?) but the effects and action sequences were enough to drive the film to a $350 million worldwide gross.I was excited then to see him attached to the adaptation of Seth Grahmae-Smith's novel Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. I hadn't read the book, but just the idea behind the title and Bekmanbetov's involvement were enough to ensure my opening week-end attendance.The premise is neither complicated nor historical. The film opens with the introduction of a young Abraham Lincoln who witnesses his mother being bit and subsequently dying at the fangs of a vampire. We flash forward many years and Abe is a travelling assassin looking to bring justice to the undead blood sucker who took his mother's life. But his first confrontation is more than what the young would-be President can handle and only thanks to the intervening of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) does he survive the encounter.In a quick and forced moment during his recovery, Abe learns that there are countless vampires – particularly in the Southern United States – and he agrees to heed the advice and follow the rules of the knowledgeable Henry in an effort to help rid the world of vampires one blood sucker at a time.Time continues to pass and we watch as Abe falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), becomes President of the United States and challenges both his constituents in abolishing slavery while strategizing against the vampire presence lead by head vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) and the deadly wonderful Vadoma (Erin Wasson).Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter is being released in the highly contested summer blockbuster season so expectations for both a rewarding return on the production investment and a potential franchise are on the block. There is plenty of good in Timur's tale to warrant praise. A scene where Abraham Lincoln and vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) chase and fight amongst a stampede of wild horses was a highlight. So too was a finale that included a speeding train and a wooden bridge set afire.As the adult Abraham Lincoln, actor Benjamin Walker, is believable as an axe wielding vampire killer with a grudge to settle. But he doesn't command the same dominant presence when the movie shifts to more of the political undertones of the 1800's.Unfortunately, the film has just as many negatives as it does positive to result in only a moderate recommendation. Henry Sturgess' character is a tad underwritten, and the final confrontation between Abraham Lincoln and Sewell's Adam is anti-climactic and over far too easily.Many of the action sequences are well choreographed. But the slow-motion revolving camera technique that then speeds up right before a blow is administered is repeated a little too often and offers nothing new in terms action ingenuity.It felt as if the final third of the film was dragging and at 105 minutes and I could have easily have suggested cuts in the editing room to chew off some fat. Abraham Lincoln – Vampire Hunter therefore ends up being a bit of a disappointment. It boasted a $70 million production budget. It had Tim Burton listed as a Producer. And it had Timur Bekmanbetov at the helm and his unique vision in bringing action sequences to the large screen. But with all these factors combined, the movie failed to arouse anything in me outside of a mild understanding that my time was not completely wasted and I at least enjoyed my experience even if I wasn't circling the internet search engines with high anticipation for a continuance in the story.www.killerreviews.com",5,2,6,24 June 2012
Finding Neverland," One of the best of the year
","Johnny Depp has been having a very good year. An Academy Award nomination for his role of Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean, voted one of the sexiest men alive in almost every newsstand magazine in 2003 and he even beat out such Hollywood heavyweights as Steve Martin, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken for the title role in Tim Burton's highly anticipated remake of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Johnny Depp has been having a very good year. So, with the world his oyster, Depp opted for Finding Neverland, the story of Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie in a film that supposes his experiences and influences in writing the famous children's adventure. Directed by Marc Forster as his follow-up to the widely raved Monster's Ball (2001), Finding Neverland is an enchanting tale that details the life of J.M. Barrie and his relationship with a lower classed family headed by Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) who is left to rear four children after the death of her husband to cancer. Finding inspiration through each of the four children, Barrie seems to draw particularly on young son Peter (Freddie Highmore) who has been forced to grow up beyond his years due to the death of the father and the illness that befalls mother Sylvia. Through the sad eyes of Peter, Barrie dreams up the details of Neverland  a place where children can go and never grow old, and asks the young lad for permission to use this name as the title character of the elaborate play.There is not a lot going on in Finding Neverland and its simplistic approach to storytelling is greatly appreciated. There are the leering eyes of the community as Barrie spends more time with the children that with his own wife. There is the theatre owner (played by Dustin Hoffman who ironically played Captain Hook in Steven Spielberg's 1991 misguided effort, Hook) who continues to believe in Barrie even as his plays continue to weaken in content with each new opening. And where would a story lead if not for a villain, in this case, played by Sylvia's mother who thinks of Barrie's involvement with the family as intrusive and undermining. However, much to the writers and director's credit, none of these tributaries are distracting and in fact, they push the story closer and closer to the inevitable conclusion.At the screening there were countless families  young children aged 6-8 and I would suggest to parents that this is not a movie which will keep them entertained for any length of time. Although there is no violence and stronger language can be found on any SpongeBob Squarepants episode, there is nothing really there for the young tots either. The film tries to tackle serious topics such as societal pressure, marital relationships and the death of a parent and although it might have a Peter Pan backdrop for a script, it is probably too heavy handed for the youngins on the family.For those of us that are old enough to enjoy a period piece about an author set in early 20th century London, you are in for a real treat. The film is sweet yet powerful and Depp puts in yet another convincing performance nailing a foreign accent without the distraction of say Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Although the ending might seem hokey and reminded me too my of the Michael Keaton film My Life, it still was a rewarding experience that I would recommend to just about anyone over the age of 20 and certainly for anyone who ever thought about what it would be to remain a child forever. One of the best of the year. www.gregsrants.com",8,0,0,20 October 2004
In Bruges," All over the place
","I headed into my screening of the new Colin Farrell/Brendan Gleeson film, In Bruges wanting to like the film as much as any film I have travelled a distance to experience this year.I am one of the few that think Farrell's interviews over the years have been far better than any of his performances, but Gleeson is someone that I have admired since he stole a few scenes from Gibson and the gang back in 1995's Braveheart.Putting the two Irishmen together in a film ripe with violence and humour was as welcomed into my day's itinerary as that favourite uncle that always came to the house bearing gifts.But when the full experience came to a close, I was left feeling like I opened up the gift only to find a rattle rapped inside a knitted sweater.In Bruges stars Farrell and Gleeson as Ray and Ken, two hit men hiding out in the Brussels town of Bruges after Ray's first assignment suffers some collateral damage. The two couldn't be more opposite. Ken is the elder, father-like figure that would spend his days traveling the city and taking in the historical sites and buildings. Ray, is the cynical partner (and comic relief) that prefers to chase skirts and head to the local pub for a pint or two of local lager. Together the two are Frick and Frack. Murtaugh and Riggs. Lee and Carter.With not much going on in the small town, the two seem to squeeze their entertainment value out of the locals thanks to large consumptions of beer, some cocaine and quirky acquaintances that provide leisurely distractions to both Ray and Ken as they await further instruction from crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Particularly small man Jordan Prentice as Jimmy. As a midget on location in Bruges shooting a dream sequence in a film, Jimmy provides all the laughs that don't come from Ray's adolescent behaviour.The fun and games take a turn for the serious when Harry orders Ken to off Ray as punishment for the hit that resulted in complications. Unfortunately, this is also where the film turns predictable. You know just know that Ken is not going to kill his apprentice Ray and that Harry would end up having to come to town himself to rid himself of now two problems.And this all takes us to a bloody finale that should have been more fun that its conclusion and more satisfying than its ending.I definitely cannot fault the writing via a screenplay from director Marin McDonagh who at one time had more Oscars (with one) than Martin Scorsese. When Ray utters such non-politically correct phrases as 'If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded, Bruges might impress me, but I didn't, so it doesn't.' I could imagine Farrell and Gleeson sitting around a script reading table laughing uncontrollably over the audacity of the lines that are played with quick witted precision in front of the camera.But the film from top to bottom confused me and left me bouncing off the walls trying to figure out what type of film it was trying to become. It started off with the black humour and utter ignorance of a Payback, then went into a Lethal Weapon buddy/buddy film only to change pace and go incredible serious leading up to the final chapters that were more bloody than most of the horrors I have seen in recent weeks.For all that, I cannot give In Bruges a recommendation. It is one of those few films that I do expect to watch again on DVD and I hope I can be swayed into seeing the film for the individual parts even if they don't flow together cohesively. But in the meantime, I recommend that you don't go to Bruges, but you stay at home and do a virtual tour on the internet instead.www.robertsreviews.com",4,8,32,4 March 2008
Friday Night Lights," Simply put, the best football film ever
","Football movies. What would you consider to be the best football movie of all time? The Longest Yard? Rudy? Maybe Remember the Titans tops the list. Unlike baseball, football doesn't have the same rich history with Hollywood. Although there are superior films like Brian's Song and Any Given Sunday, it is movies like Field of Dreams and The Natural that always find themselves on top when discussions of the greatest sports films of all time comes 'round.There could be countless reasons for this oversight, not least of which would be that baseball has a broader appeal due to its less physical confrontations. With football comes pain, the goal of infiltrating a core of linemen and tackling to the ground any individual with a ball in the most destructive way possible. It is a rough and tough sport that is played in any weather. No excuses. Baseball is more of a family sport. Take the kids. They will be board, but at least you don't have to explain why a stretcher has been driven onto the field to take a player to the dressing room.Recent football movies have tried to focus away from the game to keep a diverse audience interested. Varsity Blues for example put a bunch of pretty kids in a high-school situation and spent as much time off the field as on the game. Unnecessary Roughness tried to become the Major League for football and The Replacements portrayed them as buffoons who bond together to win it all. A few minutes of the football match in M*A*S*H provided more drama than these duds.But then H.G. Bissinger wrote Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team and a Dream about the Permian High School Panthers football team in the 1988 season. The story was focused on the game rather than the off field antics of young high schoolers. It was an instant classic and not only did Sports Illustrated and the talk show circuit begin to rumble about the story but also did his cousin, Peter Berg sign on to direct the motion picture simply titled Friday Night Lights.Friday Night Lights follows the team for one season under new coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) who tries to restore the glory of the team's rich history. Gaines comes to the city at a high price, but his credentials leave the town encouraged and optimistic about the upcoming season. He is a coach unlike most we see in sports films. He doesn't try and reinvent the wheel, he doesn't give inspirational speeches that would bring a tear to Tony Robbins' eyes, and he doesn't get involved with the teenagers personal lives. When an overly abusive father (played with incredible poise and gusto by country music star Tim McGraw), storms onto the practice field to berate his sons ability to hold onto the ball, Gaines doesn't jump between them or try to help the young sufferer with advice or being a secondary adult influence. Instead, Gaines sticks to what he knows, and what he knows is how to coach a young football team.Director Peter Berg does a wonderful job in keeping the movie on the field. As director of the misunderstood Very Bad Things and The Rundown, you can still classify Mr. Berg as fairly new to the other side of the camera (he has acted in over 25 projects), but you would think the camera was in the hands of a seasoned veteran as he captures the mood, the pulse and the crunch of high school football with the accuracy of the Elway bomb. Berg does have some side plots involving a dysfunctional family and a star runningback who injures his knee and fights with doctors and coaches to get another shot at fulfilling his passion, but for three quarters of the film, we are kept on the field  right there in the huddle and on the sidelines as the team fights its way through to the State Championships played at the AstroDome in Houston.By keeping it simple, Berg has given us maybe the best football film ever. We feel the pressure of the young kids to grow above their years and compete against behemoths in a game that can leave you paralyzed or worse. We find out little about their backgrounds, but we are nonetheless interested in their progress and the outcome of the 'big game'. So move over Field of Dreams and The Natural and try to hang on All The Right Moves, for there is a new football frenzied film that will find itself on lists in years to come and it is simply called Friday Night Lights.www.gregsrants.com",8,0,2,21 October 2004
Gravity," In Space No One Can Hear You Scream
","Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, 'In space no one can hear you scream' Alien's 'In space no one can hear you scream' tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuarón's latest thriller, Gravity.Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.Alfonso Cuarón is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.Bullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.With only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.Gravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.Cuarón incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.With still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.www.killerreviews.com",9,344,684,14 September 2013
Train to Busan," Great Thrill Ride
","No genre has suffered from volume overload as the zombie genre. Zombie television shows, zombie movies both theatrical and straight to video, city zombie walksÂ….zombies are everywhere. Because of the glut of flesh eating walking dead, no genre has suffered so much with overkill. Zombies themselves are not particularly interesting beasts. They don't have any character. They just run (or slow walk) bite and run (or slow walk) again. You won't find many reviews on the thousands of zombie films that will go into detail about the complex layers of the zombie's inner mind.With what seems like an endless parade of zombie films each week being offered across various platforms it's a nice surprise when a film such as Train to Busan offers what feels like a fresh take on an exhausted premise.Train to Busan is a South Korean zombie film brought to us from writer/director Sang-ho Yeon. The idea is commonplace â€“ a zombie apocalypse is underway â€“ but the setting adds to the drama. The movie takes place almost exclusively on a train where the passengers are stuck in in a speeding bullet. And when an infected individual boards the train, the group's only safety will be in the various train cars free of the blood hungry hordes.The group of characters that face life and death to zombie situations are an eclectic band of heroes and villains including a father and daughter team, a pregnant woman and her husband, a young teenage baseball team and various train attendants. Their survival is hanging on the notion that if the train full of zombies can reach the Busan station where the military is lying in wait.Although there are plenty of been there/seen that moments in Train to Busan, the film still offers a fresh feel largely due to the claustrophobic setting. There are some fresh ideas â€“ such as what happens to the zombies when the train enters into a tunnel â€“ and these ideas coupled with zombies that run like Olympic qualifiers and above average special effects lead to a heart pounding rollicking good time.One could not fully review Train to Busan without discussing the ending. Starting with an unexpected train crash the final few reels are filled with one surprise after another. And the ending is almost heart-wrenching in its execution.Train to Busan is a thrill ride. A thrill ride that was a rousing crowd pleaser when it screened at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. But it is more than just a genre festival favorite. It is one of best zombie films every produced and might just be one of the best movies of any genre in 2016.",8,17,44,16 October 2016
Monster," Not a bad film, but Charlize was too distracting
","Usually, when I go see a film where I know that an actor has radically changed their appearance, my interest is peaked another notch.  And for good reason.  Tom Hanks shut down production for almost a full year so that he could lose weight and grow a beard for his role in CastAway and who can forget Robert DeNiro's packing on the pounds for his role as Jake LaMatta in Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull?   So when I first saw the trailers for Patty Jenkins' new film Monster, I was amazed to see the transformation of the lead character played by Charlize Theron.  Sporting fake teeth, no make-up (or so it looks), stringy hair and enough extra weight to make three super-models, Charlize Theron transformed herself into the physical appearance of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.But the fact that Charlize looks nothing like Charlize is actually a distraction for most of the movie.  Such press has covered her transformation that when you first see Aileen Wuornos, you can't help but try and look for Ms. Theron under all the ugliness.  The best way for me to explain it, is to have you think of Mel Gibson's character in Man Without A Face.  Audiences were turned off or confused by Mel's new look and the movie grossed only $25 million domestically.  We just couldn't get over something so beautiful looking so hideous.And all this is unfortunate, because Monster is not a bad little indi-film. The movie is based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos who was responsible for the death of seven men, including one police officer, in Southern Florida.   Aileen, we learn, comes from a tragic home life, where she was abused by a friend of the family and beaten by her father.  This leads Aileen into a life of low self-esteem, prostitution and a hate for the male species that continues to deteriorate.Then, in only a scenario where the planets would have aligned perfectly, Aileen falls in love with Shelby Wall (Christina Ricci) and the two run off together. It is within this relationship where Aileen falls deeper and deeper into her dark self as she resorts to a life of murder and crime to support Shelby's desire to live free and travel the world.    All this comes crashing down when Aileen mistakenly kills a retired police officer and soon her life on the run ends in her capture and eventual death penalty sentence (Aileen was executed in Florida in 2002).Typical to the indi-film experience, there are few characters in Monster, and that works to the films advantage since the movie was so brilliantly cast.  Charlize towers over the smaller Christina and that helps us understand the power over the big eyed, naïve Shelby Wall.  Where the film fails however, is in its attempt to elicit any emotional attachment between Aileen and the audience.  When Aileen says good-bye to Shelby and puts her on a bus back to Ohio to protect her from the eventual capture for their wrong doings, you are not tugged by any heartstrings or feel anything for a character that so brutally murdered seven helpless males.  Writer/director Patty Jenkins tries too hard to convert the audience into having sympathy for Aileen due to her abusive background and her compassion towards a nervous, first-time john that refuses to have rough sex with her.
Most of the focus of this film will be on Charlize and her new-found look, but it is Christina Ricci that really holds her own as the innocent lesbian lover that runs away from home and lives by the success and failures of Aileen's crimes.  Christina's adoring stares and adolescent exuberance are a refreshing change of pace from the main characters heavy breathing and mothering tendencies.So a small thumbs up for Monster.  I just wish I didn't know who Charlize Theron was before the transformation.  Maybe that way I would be more interested in the character and less interested on how much she looked like Jon Voight in drag.",6,0,0,7 December 2003
The Impossible," Strong Emotional Journey
","Another of the many World Premieres showcasing at the Toronto  International Film Festival with hopes of Oscar glory is, The  Impossible, the true story of a family's struggle to reunite after  being violently separated when the tsunami hit the beach of sun soaked  Thailand in 2004.  The film stars Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as the two parents of  three young boys that were vacationing in Thailand over Christmas when  the tsunami devastated the country and shocked the world.  With a prerequisite set-up of the main characters, the tsunami hits  early in The Impossible and packs an incredible punch. As the wave  crashes through the hotels pool area and sweeps away the five members  of the family, we watch in terror as Maria (Watts) and Lucas (Tom  Holland) struggle to stay above the raging water and within arms  lengths of each other.  Once the water settles, the badly injured Maria and Lucas begin a  journey of survival without knowledge as to the fate of the missing  three members of the family. Lucas is forced to mature beyond his years  and assist in getting his mother to a hospital for immediate emergency  attention and is the key to the more emotional scenes that conclude the  film.  The Impossible is only the second film made using new 3-D sound  technology (the film is in 2-D) and the crashing and fast flowing water  sequences can be heard, and almost felt, throughout the entire theatre.  When not fully engrossed in our characters' plights and emotionally  tied to their survival, we are thoroughly repulsed by the graphic  scenes of bodily destruction that blood soak the screen. Director J.A.  Bayona is no stranger to horrific make-up effects as he was the genius  behind the camera for The Orphanage (2007) and he pulls no punches  here. Some audience members were seen turning their heads unable to  ingest the graphic nature of effects and few were even seen exiting  while the scenes played out in long detail.  Thanks to the trailers, we know (generally) how the movie concludes.  But just like Ron Howard's masterful Apollo 13, J.A. Bayona still keeps  us at the edge of our seats even with an ending that is both clear and  true to the original story.  The Impossible does have its shot at some Awards glory. Watts and  McGregor pull off incredibly emotional and physical scenes and films  that deal with real life tragedy and the human spirit that overcomes  those tragedies usually find favour with award voters.  But whether or not The Impossible gets any gold plated hardware it does  not take away from the tiring and emotional journey that audiences will  take with their characters. The Impossible is the best depiction yet of  the Indian Ocean tsunami and the horrors that succeeded it. It is also  one of the best movies we have seen so far this year. Packed with equal  scenes of tearful drama and graphic horrors. And although the wave is  the catalyst that propels the plot, the characters are so strong that  the big wave that hits the resort will hardly be the thing you most  remember.",8,60,102,11 September 2012
Argo," Get Ready To Hear 'Argo for Best Picture'
","No movie being showcased by this year's Toronto International Film  Festival caught our interest as much as Ben Affleck's directorial  follow up to The Town. Argo, based on a true story and starring  Affleck, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Adam Arkin, tells the  astonishingly true story of how a CIA exfiltration specialist attempts  to free six Americans who have taken shelter in the home of the  Canadian Ambassador during the Iranian hostage crisis.  The story opens on November 4, 1979 when Islamist militants took  control of the U.S. Embassy in Iran. 52 Americans were taken hostage  and held for 444 days until their eventual release. But six American's  were able to sneak out of the Embassy and find refuge unbeknownst to  the Iranian rebels. The CIA, lead by agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck)  hatched a plan to rescue the house entrapped Americans by posing as  producers of a fictional science fiction film. The idea was that Mendez  would land in Iran and then convince the six Americans to assume roles  as screenwriters, directors and co-producers of the film and they would  all fly out of the country together once location scouting was complete  in 48 hours.  In an effort to have the mission legitimized, Mendez recruited  Hollywood producer Lester Siegel and Special Effects man John Chambers  to green-light the script and give the entire project credibility.  If the entire notion of the plan sounds like something that only  Hollywood could come up with  well, you're half right. But Affleck  sticks to the facts of the true events and ravels a bite-your-nails  type thriller that is guaranteed to be rewarded with year-end  nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and most certainly Best  Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin.  Every note, every frame of Argo looks authentic. Affleck, who received  incredible support for his last directorial effort, The Town, ups the  ante and films Argo with the confidence of a maestro at the top of his  game.  The movie shifts between locations of Iran, Hollywood and both the CIA  Headquarters and even the White House in this brilliantly crafted  adventure. Each scene and character oozes with atmosphere and purpose  and Affleck confidently and flawlessly directs himself as the expected  hero of the film  a man who risks his own life and career for the  lives of six strangers.  Towards the concluding chapters of the film, audiences are sure to be  on the edge of their seats  even if they are aware of the historically  recorded outcome (shades of Apollo 13). Once the rescue attempt his its  apex, the audience at the Toronto screening erupted in an applause  never before experienced by this reviewer in his thousands of  theatrical screenings. That reaction is a testament to Affleck's  direction that grabbed audiences by the emotional drawstrings keeping  us involved in our character's fates and caring for their safe return.  Argo is not only an important piece of history that many of us were  completely oblivious  but it is also one of the better films of this  or the past few years.",8,187,352,9 September 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," At least I wasn't bored
","The last 20 years haven't been kind to the pirate movie genre.  Audiences have rejected such forgettable films as Pirates (Roman Polanski, 1986), The Pirate Movie (Kristy McNichol, 1982), and who can forget the one of the biggest flops in film history, Cutthroat Island (Renny Harlin) that sank an entire studio.So when Jerry Bruckheimer, the production money behind such hits as The Rock, Top Gun and Black Hawk Down decided to put his name and efforts behind a big budget summer pirate film, I wondered if he finally lost his marbles, or if director Gore Verbinski had nude photos of Jerry in a dress.Also working against a return of capital was the running time.  At 133 minutes, I wondered if a swashbuckling movie could hold an audience captive  especially the target young ones  for over two hours.Well, all my thoughts and reservations meant nothing after first screening. The story is rather simple.  The movie opens at the conclusion of a pirate attack on a ship and the lone survivor by the name of Will Turner is rescued.  A gold medallion around his neck is taken by his rescuer's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, and a band of pirates lead by Geoffery Rush are out to get the medallion and return it to its original resting place, thus lifting the curse set upon them of being undead.In one of the funniest entrances in movie history, Johnny Depp arrives as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and immediately his pirate ways lead him into jail.   But when Elizabeth is taken hostage upon the pirate ship the Black Pearl, the townspeople look to Jack Sparrow to rescue her and bring order back to the city.It isn't long before mayhem and sword fights ensue, and it is in the final act that the film has its most incredible visual.  The cursed pirates are visible in skeleton form when exposed to moonlight, and in a swordfight between Jack and Barbossa (captain of the Black Pearl),  the two battle in and out of the moonlight beams shinning down into a cave.  The transformation of skeleton to human to skeleton again in the blink of an eye is movie magic at its best.On paper, the movie had everything going against it.  Its running time of 140+ minutes.  It's director, Gore Verbinski, who had a hit last year in The Ring', but was still new to the fold with only 4 movie titles to his credit.  Johnny Depp in a leading role was even a gamble since he had yet to prove to be a box office juggernaut.  However, everything comes together in true Disney style.  The special effects are top rate, the story is long, but energetic, and the villain (usually the most important character in this genre) was superb.  Geoffery Rush gives us the most charismatic villain since Jack Nicholson in Batman.  I should note that the supporting cast also does its best with the material. Elizabeth and Will are played with just the right amount of enthusiasm and playfulness, by Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom.If there was once complaint I would say that the humor doesn't come off as well as they would have expected and Johnny Depp, although tolerable, seems like he is trying too hard in his role that was a cross between Errol Flynn and Liberace.But forget its small drawbacks and the history or pirate movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a good movie where everyone seems to be having fun.",Null,1,2,5 November 2003
Green Room," Evil Patrick Stewart Shines
","I'll admit it – Green Room wasn't so much on my list of movies to screen at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) as it was just a film that fit my schedule. Searching for a film to fill a gap in my schedule after Sicario and before Black Mass, I swept up tickets to the screening more due to convenience than interest.But that was before I did a little research. Director Jeremy Saulnier would hardly have been a name to which I would have recognized in conversation even though I had both seen and enjoyed his two feature films Murder Party and Blue Ruin. Couple his involvement with a facially recognizable cast that included Patrick Stewart (X-Men), Anton Yelchin (Fright Night) and Imogen Poots (Need for Speed) and I found myself more drawn to a film that I had no knowledge of prior to the delivery of the TIFF Program Guide.Green Room is not as complicated as Saulnier's Blue Ruin, but it surely is more fun. A punk quartet from Virginia are touring the country when they take a gig at a dive where their booker warns them to not 'talk politics' during the set. This warning is held in just as much regard as the three rules to owning a Magwai as the band stands in front of an audience of skinheads and neo-Nazi's while belting out the tune 'Nazi Punks F Off' by the Dead Kennedys.Miraculously, the group gets through their set with their arms and legs still attached, but it is when one of the members heads backstage to the green room to retrieve a cell phone. A startling revelation turns gig-night into a nightmarish where the group barricades themselves in the green room much to the violent chagrin of the bald and tattooed bar patrons that could care less about the group's survival.The film quickly takes a grab-a-weapon-and-try-and-survive turn and although this takes Green Room from accepting the final award of the night at this year's Oscars, it makes for some grand entertainment which is surprisingly cut among some smart and snappy dialogue. There are plenty of good kills and surprise jolts and the concluding scenes had our TIFF audience vocal in their glorified acceptance.Patrick Stewart doesn't get to play a bad guy all that often, but much like Ben Kinsley showed us in Sexy Beast, the Brit can turn on the bad when given an out-of-type role and Stewart was a marvel to watch leaving his Captain Picard nice guy persona at the door. He's not 'pure evil' but he is the wheel that turns the gears as the situation bottoms out for our poor survivors.There is so much to enjoy in Green Room that we don't want to let the dead white supremacist cat out of the bag, but let' just say that the unique use of a confined dingy setting, believable performances and a menacing cast made for a wild ride and puts Green Room squarely in the sights for the Midnight Madness Audience Award at the festival.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",6,5,20,20 September 2015
The Notebook," Touching and poignant, this movie has a heart
","The Notebook is a chick flick.  I just wanted to get that out of the way rather early in the review.  So anyone who is thinking of seeing The Chronicles of Riddick and then sneaking in to see the Cassavetes new tear jerker, you should be told before hand that you are not the target audience for both films.  The Notebook is a surprising, emotional powerhouse of a film that had the theatre in tears in the simple telling of how two people met, fell in love and lasted until the end.  Set in the 1940's, the story is about two young opposites as read from a notebook to an elderly woman who's memory is victim to Alzheimers.  The film chronicles Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams), a high-class, well-off teenage female who meets and soon falls in love for the wooing of Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling), a blue collar worker that makes forty cents an hour dragging and pulling bark off logs.  The two young-ins couldn't be more opposite and couldn't be more in love.  But love, as we learn can take time to reveal its destiny and the two are forced to deal with such obstacles and protective parents, war and eventually their biggest enemy, time.  Sob.I was not surprised to find that writer Nicholas Sparks has penned two other hanky flagging films in the past few years.  A Walk To Remember and Message in a Bottle were both fluff, but fluff that can induce one to take a few extra swallows to get rid of the lump in your throat.  The Notebook stays true to this course.  The endings (I say it plural cause there was a fade away that could have been an ending only for one more tear jerking act to play out upon fade up), were heart tugging and had I had access to hammer, wood and nails, I would have started to build an Ark and get to of every animal on board quick for there was not a dry eye in the screening.
Like any movie that tries to evoke an emotional response from its audience, we have to buy into the characters and their situations and it is here that The Notebook rises above Spark's other writing efforts.  Gosling and McAdams have true chemistry together and sparks fly from the time the two lie on the road to watch the street lights change color right to the ending that I can not bring myself to reveal in this review.  Their affection for each other is so real that a simple glance by Noah or a dimpled smile by Allie can relay to the audience more than any written word could express.  
Brilliantly shot by Director Nick Cassavetes with the help of memorable visuals by cinematographer Robert Fraisse, the film takes us to a time of enchantment where hundreds of ducks can accompany a romantic boat ride or where a reading on the dock at sunset can fill one with nostalgia. 
This was Cassavetes next film after the misguided John Q with Denzel Washington in 2001, and like Q, Cassavetes throws a lot against the wall in this film in hopes that most of it sticks.  We are given scenes of war in Europe, an engagement, the re-building of a house, the death of a father and the revealing of secrets by a parent.  All this kind of makes you feel as if you were standing in front of a Schwarzenegger machine gun getting hit with just about every possible scenario or experience that two people could ever encounter.  But thanks to the great acting and the shifting from the young teenage characters to their elder selves, it allows us breaks every once and while to catch our breathes and savor the love that these two had for each other.I couldn't help but think at the conclusion of the film that if this were a movie set in present day with a Jennifer Lopez type character in the lead female role, how awfully contrived and manipulating this movie would be viewed and I suppose this is the same realization the studio had to release the film amongst the summer blockbusters.   For all its small shortcomings, The Notebook is a refreshing bit of air in a summer of Ogres and talking cats.  James Garner gives a touching performance as the elder man who reads the notebook to Gena Rowlands (Cassavetes mother in the factual world), and when his heart is broken at a relapse of her memory, we cry alongside his anguish.  So I have to give a strong recommendation to The Notebook with just one word of advice.  That is to take lots of tissue or at the very least, buy a big bag of popcorn to hide your face from your date so she doesn't see you have a soft side.www.gregsrants.com",8,0,0,14 June 2004
The Girl Next Door," Reminds me of what teen films used to be
","Oh, to a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert.  Not that my neighbors are bad. Want a cup of sugar?  Just knock.  Want help will the ball cock in your toilet?  Ring next door.  All of this is incredibly beneficial, but oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!Elisha plays the 'girl' in the new teen film The Girl Next Door directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal).  Her name is Danielle and she arrives just when neighbor Mathew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is writing a speech in hopes of getting a scholarship for his portrayal of moral fiber.  But one look at the stripping Danielle from his bedroom window to hers leaves every fiber pointing in a different direction.This small act of voyeurism leads to all sorts of trouble as Danielle notices her admirers' gazing and immediately heads next door to confront young Matthew.  The result of their new courtship would lead to public nudity, breaking and entering, skipping school, taking drugs and everything else that we used to brag about without merit in High School.
And just as everything seems to be going extremely well for the young Matthew, one of his geek buddies reveals her true identity, that of an up-and-coming porn star.  This revelation comes shortly before the arrival of her pimp film producer Kelly (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) who throws a wrench into the infatuational plans of the two neighbors and leads Matthew down a path that jeopardizes his endeavor to win the scholarship.   Soon, Kelly and Matthew are attending strip clubs, meeting in Vegas and eventually, the two are involved in a robbery where Matt tries to win the freedom of the young Danielle.Much has been made of The Girl Next Door's resemblance to the 1983 Tom Cruise film Risky Business.  Truly, the comparisons cannot be more obvious. Instead of hookers, we have porn stars.  Instead of a house party, we have a prom, and where there is a family heirloom in play with Cruise's film, Hirsch must pull out all the stops in order to obtain a $25,000 bank account that was amassed to bring a Cambodian teenager to America.But with all these comparisons evident, I enjoyed The Girl Next Door more. The High School situations have been updated, and I believed in how Matthew could be easily drawn into his world of love and admiration, something I didn't feel with Cruise and DeMornay.Don't get me wrong, The Girl Next Door will not have the impact of Risky Business nor will it be the catapult for either Hirsch or Cuthbert that Business was for Cruise.  But it still was a rather enjoyable film.  Not filled with situations bordering on the asinine (see American Pie's 2 through 3), The Girl Next Door was a smart film that resembled a John Hughes film of the early 1980's.  I enjoyed all the characters from the geeks who are trying to find their sexual niche to the awkwardness and mature awakening of Matthew through the ordeal of following his dreams.  Whereas adolescent films recently have skewed into gross out comedy in such entries as The New Guy, American Pie and Van Wilder, The Girl Next Door gives us something fresh, a progressive out of character plot backed by the love of a beautiful woman.All these funny and interesting struggles lead to the senior prom where the result might seem far fetched, but at least it seems as if the director meant it not to be taken with any notion of seriousness.  We understand the good guys from the bad guys and the movie makes no attempts to throw a surprise or two our way.  Maybe in its simplicity, it has found the answer to rejuvenating the youthful film movement.So, back to my original blabbering.   Oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!  First noticed wearing pink panties in the 2003 popular film Old School, she is something to behold.  But can she fix a ball cock?  Don't answer that!",7,150,190,11 April 2004
Oldboy," Grand Prize Winner
","I first had the privilege of viewing Oldboy at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2004. I knew nothing of the film and even less about the actors or the director prior to the screening, but I somehow ended up with tickets for the late night viewing. The local newspaper quoted the tagline, 15 years forced in a cell, only 5 days given to seek revenge, so I was expecting a violent indulgence (and let's get one thing clearÂ…Asian violence and Hollywood violence are two separate entities). What I wasn't expecting was a movie that would stick with me days later and end up as one of the best films of 2004.Oldboy opens by introducing us to Oh Dae-Su as he gets wisped off the streets and is imprisoned in a holding cell for what will amount to 15 years. The cell has a bed, bathroom and television, but there are no windows. A steel door with only a small opening at the bottom so that food can be delivered is all that connects him to the outside world. Gas is emitted into the room periodically to subdue Dae-Su allowing a crew to provide medical attention where necessary or attend to any housekeeping agendas. Dae-Su's next decade and a half will consist of watching television and staying fit in hopes of an eventual release and identifying both his capture and the reason for his incarceration.That day finally arrives when Dae-Su awakes in the middle of nowhere. The world around him is foreign and the movie takes just the right amount of time showing us how Dae-Su appreciates new smells, communications with others, cigarettes and even new swear words.A cell phone found ringing in his jacket pushes the story to the next chapter. The voice on the other end of the line is that of his former captor that reveals that a game is about to be played and that Dae-Su's job is to figure out the who's and why's that reasons Dae-Su's captivity. Dae-Su seems numb to the voice but passes out soon afterwards only to awaken at the house of Mido, his waitress at the restaurant at the time of his collapse. Their relationship will take center stage as the two new acquaintances try to unravel the mystery man behind the wizards' curtain that seems to be pulling all the strings.Revealing any further information about Oldboy might take away from the pleasure of letting the story unfold, so I'll stop here. But what I will tell you is that through Dae-Su's journey towards various reveals we are treated to memory etching scenes including the self mutilation of one's tongue and an absolutely invigorating scene involving Dae-Su's battle with an Asian gang down a narrow corridor armed only with a hammer and utter determination.Oldboy has just enough of all the right elements to make a good film better. The mood, pacing, lighting and even the music punctuate through the screen to create an atmosphere of dread, sorrow and desperation. But what separates Oldboy from the pack is that it paints a picture of a character that thinks he can walk through the violent world of the Asian underground with reckless abandon on the notion that nothing can be done to him physically or emotionally that could compare to the hell of his 15-year imprisonment. But in the final act, director Chan-wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) turns the table on our protagonist and forces him into the realization that as a pawn in the sick and twisted game, he is not the cold and fearless seeker or truth, but rather a vulnerable and forever imprisoned character that pleads his own life in order to maintain a level of secrecy over the final revelation. The payoff is one that you just won't see coming no matter how seasoned a veteran you may be to films of this genre, and it incaptures everything that Hollywood films would steer clear of if originally presented the script in raw form. And the result was the Grand Prize of the Jury award at Cannes in 2004.Bravo.",8,10,102,31 March 2005
Spider-Man 2," Good, but I expected better
","Writing a review about an endeared comic book character is harder than you might think. You don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the hero that most people who are taking the time to read the review, already know. You can talk about the history of how the film produced a sequel, but movies such as these have so much fanfare before they hit the big screen that by the time they are released, everyone is sick about turning on their television or looking out their office window to see yet another advertisement. And going into the details of the character as not seen in the movie but rather between the pages of an illustrated magazine, forgetaboutit! One small miscue, and the comic book convention guys are all over you petitioning your house and threatening your children (granted I live in a condo and have no kids, but it's possible). So when the event movie of 2004 hit theaters in June, I wondered how I was going to introduce the review. So for inspiration, I climbed through the attic and found a box labeled 'Old Clothes 1976' and pulled out my old Spider-Man underoo's. (To be fair, I should mention that they were not really underoo's just underpants and a t-shirt that my father had drawn webs on with a black marker). In full gear, I sat in front of my computer and started to type.Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to the multi-million dollar grossing Spider-Man released just two years earlier. Back at the kick of the proverbial second can are actors Toby McGuire and Kirstin Dunst as Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Mary Jane Watson, and director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead). SM2 picks up a few years after Spider-Man had rescued Manhattan from the evil deviance of the Green Goblin and things have changed greatly for the web-slinger. The oddly contorted swinging from building to building that was present two years ago has now been perfected, and variations of web constructions have improved for the betterment of mankind. But where thing have improved for Spidey, things have taken a turn for the worse for Peter Parker. He has lost his job, his woman, his friends. Hell, he can't even get a free drink or appetizer at a high-class gala. Also standing in his way of living happily ever after is none other than Dr. Otto Octavius (or Doc Ock for those of us who feel we have earned the right to be on a nickname basis). Played perfectly by Alfred Molina (Species), Doc Ock and his tentacles of terror strike a deal with Harry Osborn to deliver Spider-Man in exchange for the trillium he needs to complete his scientific experiment. So, Aunt Mae, Mary Jane and half of New York (including an El-Train?) are subjected to the terror that these two adversaries cause atop the tallest structures of the inner city. The special effects for these battle scenes are an improvement on the first installment, following the sequel rules that everything must be bigger and louder. Buildings are destroyed, cars are thrown at will and a riverside dilapidated structure is destroyed which will probably get Spider-Man credit for cleaning up the waterfront. Of course, like the first film (why change a winning combination), there is a love story at the heart of SM2 that runs cold then hot then cold then hot again. There are so many volleys back and forth between Toby and Kristin that I felt like I was watching Martina Navratalova and Jimmy Conners during a US Open tennis match. But where the Spider-Man had sparks fly, SM2 drags it out over too many scenes and doesn't capitalize on an emotional scene at the beginning of the film where the two speak with but a fence between them.But love story, blub story. Who cares, right? Are things blown up? Yes. Are the special effects cool? Yes. Is the movie better than the first one?I am not so sure. I wasn't completely enamored by the original and the second one had too many dry spells to keep my interest for the full two hours. Although the sound was incredible and the visuals stunning the story and dialogue lacked a great deal of substance and final climax between web-head the Octavius was anti-climatic in terms of what was building up to be a phenomenal finish. There is a good deal of humor in the SM2 and that is a good thing. A scene in an elevator between Spidey and a passenger was good fun, and the violin player outside the theatre house was worth a chuckle or two. But all the snickers in the world couldn't keep me from ignoring some incredibly inane dialogue. The final words as uttered in the film from Mary Jane to Spider-Man ('Go get 'em, tiger') got laughs when it shouldn't and that is not the way you want to remember a film. And don't even get me started on Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head or the Here Comes The Bride musical treats.When you get down to it though, this is the ultimate summer flick and it will make wheel barrels of money no matter what any of us say. The young women will like it due to Toby's presence, the young men will be happy that Kristin gets wet again near the end while wearing a tight outfit, and teachers and theologians will talk on the storyline of how Spider-Man suffered through a mental condition that affected his web slinging ability. Oh yeah, I guess the kid target audience will like it too due to the violence and cartoon action. Me, I was indifferent. Glad I saw it and will probably buy it on DVD in 6 months. I just expected a little more.So there you have it, I can finally take off these stupid Spider-Man underpants and go back to the normal boxers (which also have cob webs.unfortunately, real ones). With Spider-Man 3 more than hinted at the conclusion of the second, I just best not put the Old Clothes box anywhere it can't be easily found.",6,4,13,30 June 2004
"I Love You, Man"," Another home run comedy
","Last year, Paul Rudd appeared in Role Models  one of the flat out funniest films I have seen maybe in the last decade.Last year, Jason Segel appeared in Forgetting Sarah Marshall  a film from Judd Apatow that was funnier than the two more popular Knocked Up! and Superbad films.This year, Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are together in I Love You, Man. Surely, we can't expect these two comic underdogs to hit yet another one out of the park.Yes, we can, and Yes, they did.I Love You, Man's plot is detailed in the two minute trailer. Rudd, who plays Peter is getting married but doesn't have that close male friend to call upon as Best Man at his wedding. Peter then undergoes various 'man-dates' in hopes of finding a male best friend. Enter, Sydney Fife (Segel). The two meet innocently enough at a home showing and immediately, Peter is in awe of someone as honest as what Sydney appears to be.The two end up meeting at a bar and over fish taco's, a friendship is born. All they have to do is keep things on an even keel before the wedding. This being a comedy, there is fat chance of that.I Love You, Man is a much stronger story and far funnier than Knocked Up!, although it still sits in the shadow of last years more gut busting, Role Models.It does fall into the new trend of adult comedy which over the years has progressed from college humor antics to strong characters making realistic life choices. We can thank Judd Apatow for this movement, even if his name is not attached to this gem.Much like Apatow's Superbad and Knocked Up!, some of the best laughs and strongest characters come from the supporting cast. J.K. Simmons and Jon Favreau continue their streak of stealing scenes with limited screen time. Favreau in particular does a good job playing Barry, a crass and arrogant friend-in-law of the Peter and Zooey (Rashida Jones), keeping him interesting even through his white knuckle ignorance.Like most comedies, the final chapters become predictable with an even more conventional break-up/make-up of the central characters. I Love You, Man would have been better served to produce a Badder Santa type of ending rather than trying to fairy-tale it all up.But that is small consequence in a film that brings the goods for nine tenths of the films runtime. And Rudd and Segel can now brag that they have another home run on their resume. Even if this one barely cleared the fence. www.robertsreviews.com",8,1,4,22 March 2009
Alexander," Oliver, Oliver, why have you forsaken me
","I go into every film with an open mind. As someone who is going to be bold and sometimes cocky enough to express their opinion on film, you have be objective. When I was in transit to see the new Oliver Stone directed film Alexander, I was incredibly optimistic. After all Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and all coming out when the Oscar funny season begins, come on! So there I was in line, ready to hand out a five star rating like a large sized chocolate bar to the cutest kid on Halloween. Here's how it worked out.Standing in line awaiting the theatre opening and watched the trailer for the movie on the various television screens that greet the paying customers  Five Stars.Before movie began, Six (count 'em SIX!) commercials. One for Radio Shack, two car commercials, one for movietickets.com, one for Playstation 2, one for a rather large Mr. Big bar. Knowing that the movie was already just short of three hours and that I still had countless trailers to sit through, I was already getting perturbed. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.Credits roll almost 14 minutes later. See Oliver Stone's name and remember only his good films like Platoon, JFK, Salvador and Wall Street. Add ½ Star. Total = 5 Stars.Hear Angelina Jolie's Elvira accent for the first time and it was enough to have me chuckle. Kilmer and Jared Leto's not much better. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4.5 Stars.Watch as the young Alexander grows up and becomes the man that is played by Colin Farrell. Seeing Colin in the blond hair makes him look like a big Toy R Us doll. Minus ½ Star. Total = 4 Stars.First 45 minutes spent telling us the history of the Alexander. His relationship with his mother. His budding relationship with his gay lover played by Leto, and his level of comfort around snakes. Lots of snakes. By the time the movie was over, I realized how drawn out and milked the Jolie was, how unnecessary towards understanding Alexander's motivation that the Leto character provides and how the snakes were probably brought by Ms. Voight herself just to get her to agree to play the role as Olympias. We see young Alexander tame a wild horse and are expected to believe that not only did he do this in sheer minutes, but it was also a sign that he would be a great ruler. Whatever. Minus one star. Total = 3 Stars.First battle scene about to start and Alexander tries to rally the troops with an excessive speech. The speech wouldn't motivate me to shake my friends hand let alone lead me to lie down my life for a purpose. Thought back to Braveheart and how William Wallace's speech was inspirational. Longed for Braveheart. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.The opening of the battle scene takes an eye view from a hawk in the sky. Incredible scene. Had me think of the trend setting Stone of yesteryear. Got heart pumping and ready for what was expected to be a bloody and lengthy battle. Add one star. Total = 3.5 Stars.The battle begins and bodies and blood flow. People get stabbed, impaled, gauged, hammered and shot with arrows. But battle scene is under cloud of sand dust and the two sides are too hard to determine. People yell at each other, but couldn't figure out what they were yelling and trying to relay. Didn't know who I was rooting for. Battle scene was lengthy and well choreographed, but when the smoke cleared and the bodies lay on the battlefield, I still couldn't tell who lost more men. Add one star for the battles bloodbath, but minus one star for not knowing what was going on. Total = 3.5 Stars.Alexander goes into Babylon where he takes a wife played by Rosario Dawson. She has a nude scene that made the final cut for one reason only. When the three hours were over, Dawson's character is one that I could have done without  or at least toned down to save me on crossing-the-leg-time (referring to trying to refrain from using the 'facilities'). Her accent too is casting couch-ish. Liked Dawson in The 25th Hour and thought she was rising talent. Uncertain of my previous judgment. Minus ½ Star. Total = 3.0 Stars.Movie then goes back 8 years. BACK! Maybe inspired by Tarantino, Stone plays with the timeline for no apparent reason. The storyline tells us how his father was killed. Again, another 20 minutes that could have been shown in either a dream sequence or within the timeline in about 5 minutes. Thought it was out of place when story looked like it was getting momentum. Like playing snakes and ladders, we just hit a snake. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.5 Stars.Listen to Colin give speech after speech. Don't really understand (or care) for his motivation. Can't really tell if his people are for him or against him. Beginning to get bored. Minus ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.Get to India and another battle scene about to take place. It's in the jungle and I remembered how well Stone did last time he was in a jungle shooting (Platoon). Adjusted myself in my seat to get ready for the fast and furious. Battle begins and it is worse than the first. I have no idea who is stabbing who. I know the ones on the elephants are not on Team Alexander, but that is about as far as my referencing can go. Battle scene fought in red tones. Whaaa? Incredibly frustrated even though fake blood keeps hitting the camera lens. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.Excellent scene where Alexander and his horse go on hind legs against an enemy and elephant doing same. Arrows fly, spears are thrown and Alexander falls. Scene is slow motion and was very memorable. Add ½ Star. Total = 2.0 Stars.Alexander falls to ground and has one of Stone's dream collage sequences that were so out of place in Nixon and U-Turn. Don't get it. Don't need it. Don't want it. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.Alexander is not dead however. Heals and becomes strong enough to make more speeches. His male lover lies dying in a bed and this seems to be the perfect time to star out at the city and talk about how great everything could be. Felt like I was being talked down to. Leto's character dies in the background and I don't care one bit. Minus ½ Star. Total = 1.0 Stars.Movie finally concludes with some overacting by Jolie. Anthony Hopkins who started the movie with a narration ends it with the conclusion to the Alexander saga. Was actually surprised that the movie did not feel like its 170+ running time suggested. For having me not look at my watch constantly, I reluctantly give it an extra ½ Star. Total = 1.5 Stars.On the ride home now and thinking of how I am going to write this review. In no way would I recommend it to others, but thought that my 1.5 Stars was a little harsh and try desperately to get it up to a two star rating. Can't. Final tally = 1.5 Stars. For the love of Zeus I didn't enjoy this movie. www.gregsrants.com",3,6,10,25 November 2004
Constantine," Confusing and convoluted, but action was good
","Looks like our world is in peril again. It would seem as if The Incredibles and Spider-Man didn't rid us of all the evil in our midst last year and we have to turn to ole stand-by Keanu Reeves to again come to the rescue of us mere mortals.This time round, Keanu plays title character John Constantine, a supernatural detective who is anything but your quintessential hero. John drinks, chain-smokes and generally is not the most approachable person in the world (think of him as like your in-laws on valium). But John does have a gift  the ability to see the demons and angels walking amongst us, and John uses this gift to try and gain acceptance into Heaven by deporting these evil spirits back to Hell.See, God and the Devil seem to have made a wager for the souls of mankind. Their only real rule is to have no direct contact with humans, just influence. That meant that demons and angels are our neighbors, our cashiers and our business partners. They are all around us.It also just so happens that the son of the devil himself is attempting to encroach our world by using the demons to directly impact the lives of certain humans required for the rebirth of Lucifer Jr. As they say, rules are made to be broken.This plan is brought to Constantine's attention through detective Angela Dobson (Rachel Weisz) who is investigating the suicide of her twin sister. Angela is in denial about her sister's decision to jump off the roof of her hospital and solicits the aide of reluctant Constantine to help assist with what was obviously evil intervention. Or something like that. The two then put together the evidential pieces bit by bit which leads to the eventual climax full of shouting, screaming, shooting and suicides.Sounds exciting, huh? Wonder why it wasn't.Constantine is a mess of a movie that gets by on style and special effects. Based on the comic book 'Hellblazer', it is yet another movie based on a hero of the illustrated page that you would be excused if you had never heard of it (following Hellboy and Punisher). The problems with the film are that it seems as if there is one scene of action followed by an explanation followed by another scene of green screen madness then more revelations as to why what just happened happened. If the film isn't explaining itself it is preparing and setting up another scene of our enlightenment. And when things can't be explained, well, then there is the Devil's bible which contains passages not found in the standard King James version or high level angels and demons that seem intent on revealing important plot points without as much as a feather to the underfoot as necessary truth inducing torture.All this made it more confusing than a film of this nature should be. With strong roots and references of Catholicism I couldn't help but think anyone without better than basic religious knowledge might be even more confused or uninterested than I was. It was kinda heavy fare for a movie who's trailers lead me into the theatre expecting to see great action and demonic exorcisms.Don't get me wrong, the action sequences were above average. In fact, the introduction to Constantine as he exorcises a demon from a young girl was high tension and very well crafted. So to were other scenes of fright and fancy that you can get the gist of through any of the commercial advertisements. The design of hell, the ripping of Angela through an office building and a demon made of cockroaches and snakes were all original which allowed me to forgive the mass annihilation of demons at the local hospital which seemed ripped directly from the first Blade movie.Giving a movie two and a half stars out of five means we could go either way with our verdict. With Constantine, I am giving it a small recommendation even if there seems to be more negative words than positive in the review above. This 'recommendation' is based on the performances (specifically Weisz who looks to be pretty interested in the material even if it probably made no sense on the scripted page) and the special effects. That doesn't mean that Constantine is a good film, but you could do a hell of a lot worse.",6,32,63,20 February 2005
Troy," Troy falls by the weight of its faults
","Labeled an adaptation of Homer's epic Iliad, Troy is the second of the 2004 summer blockbusters to hit theatres in as many weeks. Unfortunately, Troy ends up being ever the same disappointment as Van Helsing was one week earlier. Troy is directed by Wolfgang Peterson who is no stranger to the blockbuster genre or the impact of star power within his celluloid vision. The Wolfman was behind the camera for such big screen bonanzas as The Perfect Storm with George Clooney, Air Force One with Harrison Ford and In The Line Of Fire with Clint Eastwood. A director who first took our notice in 1981 with the multi-nominated film Das Boot, Peterson has been consistent in bringing a high level of entertainment to the general masses. So when he decided on Troy as his next venture Hollywood began lining up to secure roles in what was surely to be a summer spectacle that would whet the appetite of those gladiators and warriors that have been left salivating since 2000's Gladiator. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana (Hulk) and Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) signed up before the contract ink was even dry (Brad even leaving the long limbo'd The Fountain) and lesser known character actors like Brian Cox (The 25th Hour) and Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later) were happy to don metal skirts in the desert heat to help bring this reported $200 million epic to all those who waited for the movie instead of reading the poems. Unfortunately, plotting the pros and cons after the film, I found more entries in the right hand column than the left. Brad Pitt's chiseled bod gets notice. The set design and location shoots seem authentic, some of the battle sequences are above average and I would be remiss if I didn't mention how good it was to see the blue eyed Peter O'Toole standing stoic among his young protégés. But unfortunately, that is where my love affair with the film ends. I can't blame the story. A love and war epic where the Trojans are pitted against the Greeks after a young Paris (Bloom) steals Helen away from her husband Menelaus. In an effort to save face and seek revenge, Menelaus then requests the aide of his brother, the ruthless Agamemnon, who has aspirations of world dominance and uses the uncontrollable Achilles (Pitt) to assist him the conquering of nations. Combined, they sail 1,000 ships to Troy in attempts to extract Helen from her new love while writing their name in history for conquering an army that has long defended its walls.Even typing the story in summary, I am given goose bumps with the potential of the undertaking. But for a scattering of faults throughout the elongated 160-minute running time, Troy becomes as forgettable as each of the hard to pronounce names of its characters. And that's where it is really too bad, for it is not one glaring thing that sinks this aggressive attempt, but rather, the little things that just build up or keep annoying you.We can start with the dialogue that just doesn't fit in the era it is suggested. When Achilles rages that 'Before my time is done I will look down upon your corpse and smile', I couldn't help but think that the DVD outtakes reel will show the actors breaking up with roaring laughter when the director yelled cut'. Pitt in particular is given enough cheesy lines throughout his screen presence that I honestly felt bad for him knowing how much work he put into his physical appearance and how all I will remember at the end of the experience was that he was not the heroic orator of battle speeches as say William Wallace in Braveheart.And when there was no dialogue, I was equally annoyed with the musical score. Wolfgang Peterson rejected the original score by Gabriel Yared and I wonder how much worse it could have been than the cross between the Islamic sounds of Black Hawk Down and the tense moments of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan that James Horner put together. But let's face it, we see the trailers and we expect epic battles and it is here that Troy really disappointed. It is not as if the sequences were not well engaged, it is just that they have all been done before and better. The first battle sequence on the beaches of Troy between Achilles and his men and the Trojans seemed so meticulously choreographed that I expected Fred Astaire to jump in and perform a little soft shoe. The battle sequences that had been done so well in Braveheart and perfected in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was nothing new in Troy if not for maybe a wider camera angle. Even the speeches before the battles to the troops were hollow and couldn't inspire a kindergarten class to begin colouring let alone ask thousands to lay down their lives for their country. It has been well documented in the media how difficult this movie was to make. The war in Iraq, various weather mishaps and an injury to Mr. Pitt ballooned the budget and dragged the film on longer than anticipated. The result of these delays may be the reason why the elements don't work as a whole. Some of Pitt's scenes seem rushed and Brian Cox overacts and he looks annoyed as if maybe he was doing a scene months after he had said good-bye to his character. I expect Troy to be a success with the general public. There are enough male heartthrobs to keep the women lined up and enough expected violence to keep the men holding their hands. It's just too bad they couldn't adapt what was such an interesting story into something that David Lean would rise from his grave to but a ticket for. It is now the second week of the summer blockbusters, and I hope that Shrek 2 is the Trojan horse.www.gregsrants.com",5,1,2,16 May 2004
Spotlight," Exceptional Movie About Reporters Reporting
","The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",8,85,166,20 September 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," A true summer film that doesn't promise more than it offers
","Whenever you go to see a Roland Emmerich film, you know what to expect and at what level to set your expectations.  Whether it was Stargate, Independence Day or Godzilla you know that you will leave the theatre remembering the destruction and special effects, but one day later, you will hardly remember a characters name, any dialogue or even any of the side plots that are always thrown in to get the movie to a two-hour screening. 
Roland's latest feature is the disaster flick The Day After Tomorrow which stars veteran actor Dennis Quaid as a climatologist who first identifies and then stands back in horror at the effects of global warming on the earth's environment.  Of course one can't say Â‘the effects of global warming on the earth's environment' in an Emmerich film without expecting buildings to tumble, cars to fly in the air and the sheer destruction of a major American city.  On this level, The Day After Tomorrow fulfills its destiny handsomely. 
You will no doubt have seen many of the advertisements for the film in trailers or on television spots over the past few weeks.  The ads show a giant tidal wave hitting New York, tornados in Los Angeles and the aftermath of the storm, a snowed in and frozen Statue of Liberty.  Like most of Roland's films, the best scenes are always in the trailers and are just drawn out longer in the screen version.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just want everyone to remember that they should not expect to see anything of a spectacular sort that hasn't already whetted your appetite enough to get you to buy a ticket in the first place.The Day After Tomorrow does boast some incredible visuals.  It has been only 8 years since Twister rumbled our theatre seats, but TDAT perfects the tornado devastation scene.  When multiple funnels appear in Los Angeles, they glide with ease through streets and buildings leaving absolute chaos in their wake without the needless humor of any flying cows.  And when a giant wave hits Manhattan, the special effects crew of 1999's Deep Impact probably even bowed in appreciation.  For its two hour running time, what may surprise you is how quickly the time goes by.  The weather anomalies happen about 45 minutes into the film and the rest of the movie surrounds a group of New Yorkers trying to survive and the Dennis Quaid character trying to get from Washington to New York to help rescue his son.  There are a few other plot points including a female that needs medicine, one of Quaid's entourage that sacrifices himself for the good of the team and a temperature drop that will kill anyone exposed to the conditions in less than 30 seconds.  But we don't really care about all that stuff do we?  If someone met you at the work water cooler on Monday and asked you how was the movie, I doubt you would ramble on about how Sam really wanted to tell Laura that he is in love with her.  What we do care about is the attention given to the effects.  The bang for the buck.  And for the record, there is bang.  Lots of it.  The Day After Tomorrow takes the disaster film playbook and makes sure it hits every note. Other than the obvious Twister and Deep Impact similarities, you will also find takes on The Poseidon Adventure and even 1974's Earthquake if you were unlucky enough to remember it.  But I have to hand it to Roland, for all the unoriginal thought, he has produced an enjoyable summer movie.  You don't really connect with any of the characters, but he doesn't give them any ridiculous dialogue either and that, I consider a saw-off.  There is the stereotypical authoritative figures that refuse to listen to the climatologists before things get out of hand, and a who cares (sorry) story about a young patient in a hospital that has been left behind by the evacuation of the city, but since these are not pressure plot points, it really doesn't impact my review of the film whatsoever.The Day After Tomorrow is really critic proof.  Whether I or Ebert or any of the number of editorial snobs like the film or not is not going to affect the turnout on opening weekend and throughout the films' international run. We are far enough removed from September 11, 2001 that we can now see buildings falling and being destroyed again, and thank God there is someone like Roland to give us what we want.So I give The Day After Tomorrow a reasonable recommendation.  You will remember the action sequences, but by the day after tomorrow you will be hard pressed to remember anything else, and isn't that what summer films are for?www.gregsrants.com",6,0,0,28 May 2004
Silent Hill," Too long and uninteresting
","Question: When should a horror movie be 2+ hours? Answer: Never With all apologies to the Fangoria readers and McFarlane figurine collectors, scary films should not be pushing the envelope with our patience and extending past the magical two hour timeline.The reason why should be as clear as the nose about to be hacked off the front of your face. It is too hard to keep things hopping, keep thing haunting and keep things gruesome for that extended length of time. That, and keep any of the audience's interest. Hell, even a dreaded visit to the in-laws loses its shock value after two hours. So how long can you sit through stabbings, decapitations and the usual bloodletting before you just feel exhausted or start to edit the movie in your own head thinking of scenes that could have been left of the editing room floor allowing you the extra time to make Smores before settling in for a night of an Extreme Makeover : Home Edition marathon.This theory seems to have been lost on the producers of the new video game turned movie, Silent Hill. Instead of thinking about maintaining suspense and producing thrills within the control of a good paced film, they instead have put together a mess of film that stretches 127 minutes from curtain up to lights on.Since it would seem that the screenwriter didn't spend much time on the script, I won't spend much time on its description. In short, a young girl has nightmares about a place called Silent Hill, a town ravaged by fire many years ago. The mother then takes said child to Silent Hill (who wouldn't?). The child goes missing. The mother must enter into the bowls of hell to retrieve her daughter while up against a coven of Silent Hill refugees.At least that is what I think what happens. As these movies go, this one is a little confusing. That, or I lost interest in trying to figure it all out between highlighting my watch to see how much of my evening was consumed.For you horror fans, there is some bloodshed to keep you entertained, and for those of you that like weird creatures a la the video game world, there is plenty of that too. What there isn't is interest. I didn't care about the young girl and I sure as hell didn't care about the fate of her mother Rose (whose name if uttered repeatedly as if the writer had a word count commitment on the script and used it as filler). By the time the movie begins to reveal a few things and we find that we are watching less the outtakes from Constantine, but more a cross between The Crucible and The Village, I didn't have feeling in my neck that was struggling not to find a nice shoulder to nap on.Silent Hill was directed by Christope Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) who looks to have plenty of ideas, but no idea of how to put it all together. His use of color was interesting having the town all covered in a grey soot and the townspeople in fabrics that that shied away from anything that might be found on a rainbow. But this might be more of an adaptation of the game which I have never seen rather than from Gans frontal lobe.What he isn't able to do is develop any kind of character (his use of Sean Bean is still puzzling), pull off anything remotely terrifying and most importantly, keep a pace that will want us to sit through the scenes between skin pullings and burning at the stakes.That makes Silent Hill a typical early spring horror flick. It will open big, lose 70% of its audience in week two once word gets out and finally end up on DVD shelves where the young teenagers will eat it up.www.robertsreviews.com",3,3,9,23 April 2006
Ocean's Twelve," No meat with the potatoes
","I could just see the studio execs sitting around their cozy meeting room, drinking their triple mocha cappuccino's and reacting to the producers' pitch. I imagine the producer saying, 'I have an idea for a movie that will have George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Don Chedale, Andy Garcia and Elliot Gould together again. And this time I even got Catherine Zeta-Jones to join the cast. Oh yeah, Steven Sodebergh will direct and I have even convinced Bruce Willis and Topher Grace to do cameos..And did I mention that this is a sequel to the $450 million worldwide grossing Ocean's 11 and that the stars are willing to negotiate back end deals in order to keep the budget the same as the first film?'I imagine there would be a pause. Not a pause to consider whether or not to greenlight the project, but a pause so that they could picture themselves naked in a mountain of money or maybe a pause just long enough to let the adrenaline run through their bodies and the goosebumps and hairs on the back of their necks a chance to return to their normal state. Well, whatever the conversation, the boys are back (sorry Julia and Catherine) again in Ocean's Twelve which is also a follow-up to the remake of the 1960 movie staring Rat Packers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. Ocean's Twelve picks up a few years after the original ended. If you recall, in their first crack at collective crime, the group elaborately emptied the Bellagio, The Mirage and the MGM Grand casinos' vault in Las Vegas of about $150 million. Well, for some reason, that just didn't sit well with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who not only lost the casino's money a job for which he was responsible - but also his girlfriend Tess (Julia Roberts) to the mastermind behind the group, Danny Ocean (George Clooney). Thanks to an anonymous tip (that really makes no sense when revealed) , Benedict has been given the location of all eleven thieves responsible for the original heist. Benedict seems to be holding a vindictive grudge that is rather hard to understand, really. The insurance covered the losses, and Benedict never even lost his job as a result of the debacle. But for some reason, he is willing to put his life on hold until a personal vendetta is resolved. After tracking down each character individually (and did we really need to see the bit characters being visited one by one by Benedict and his entourage of men without necks?) Benedict reveals that they have two weeks to return to him the money they stole plus interest. Just one problem. It has been a few years since the heist and everyone has bit into their nest egg leaving them over $90 million short. So, they put their collective minds together and decide to do what they do best, steal. This is where the movie should have gone into overdrive, but instead it gets muttered in its own stylish format. They first decide to steal a trade ticket worth about $2.5 million (which would only leave them with 99% of the total still to be recovered). Of course, it's again an elaborate plan consisting of an idea that is so ridiculously improbable that if not for the confusion I felt trying to understand the hows and whys of the plan, I undoubtedly would have chuckled out loud in my theatre seat.But this was only an audience diversion to introduce us to The Night Fox who is a competing thief looking to wear the heavyweight belt as undisputed crook of the millennium. The Night Fox is able to get a message to Danny Ocean and after a brief meeting, agrees to pay the marker owed to Benedict if Ocean and his puppy dog posse can steal a jewel studded egg before him. Ahhh, is there no honor amongst thieves?So with the plot now spelled out like a spoonful of Alpha-Bits, all that is left is the star power banter, a twist or two to keep us interested and enough screen time for each cast member to keep us at arms length from any kind of character development whatsoever. In fact, never have so many A-list stars wasted so much opportunity by trying to be cool or volleying the ball to the next A-list star, none of which seem capable of spiking.Not all was a bust mind you. Catherine Zeta-Jones was an interesting character although very underdeveloped and lacking any clear motivation for her actions. And Julia Roberts has the only memorable scene in the film when she pretends to be a particular diva in a hotel that is so tongue-in-cheek I felt like I was coming down with the measles. Director Steven Soderbergh is a good director, but I can't help think that he is overrated and it is his relationships with the stars that has kept him on the hot list rather than his filmography. Since Erin Brokovich in 2000, he has had under performer after under performer including Solaris and Full Frontal. But still, Julia Roberts and George Clooney seem to praise him on every talk show or awards dinner spewed out of Hollywood, California. In hindsight, I can see why actors must like him so much and that is because he doesn't seem to be that demanding or envelope pushing. Ocean's Twelve is the perfect example of keeping a bunch of stars happy and somewhat occupied without putting any meat beside my potatoes. Instead of trying to dwell on one or two characters and develop a sub-plot or storyline of any interest, he decides instead to allow each of the actors to leave their back room poker games to eat up screen time that is shot with an independent sense, even if no common sense follows.Anyone who watches television will see anyone of the stars either separately talking to someone behind a desk or collectively as a promotional vehicle for the film, talk about how much fun they all had together during the shoot. The practical jokes, the European experience and even staying at George Clooney's villa where poker games were a daily ritual. It's just too bad that none of this same fun could have been transformed on screen for the benefit of the audience that, in my screening, seemed bored to a point where illuminated watch faces glowed like firefly's as uninterested patrons were collectively counting down the films running time. With all the star power and the international appeal, Ocean's Twelve will no doubt make poop-loads of money and it won't be long before Ocean's Fourteen (Thirteen is bad luck) will be drafted and in front of the ensemble for review and schedule juggling. I just hope next time, Soderbergh decides to sit that one out and only produce while a script provides us with more than cute dimples and starring glances for two hours.www.gregsrants.com",4,4,8,12 December 2004
Crash," Powerful and Provocative
","It might be too early to being talking about one of the best films of the year, but if the shoe fits, then Paul Haggis' new film Crash feels like that pair of shoes at the back of the closet too comfortable to throw away. Ironically, comfortable is about the last thing you are going to feel by the time the end credits roll.In the vein of P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, Crash follows multiple characters through various story lines that intercept during the course of two days in Los Angeles. The common thread between all the players is the deep rooted bigotry and racism that each person exhibits. Whether it is the L.A.P.D. cop who's frustration with a black medical center clerk leads him to take out his anger on a black couple during a routine stop or the white socialite who reveals her distrust with the Hispanic locksmith, Haggis weaves an angry tale of people of all races that are have stereotype opinions on nationalities not their own.Although there is no particular plot line that is at the epicenter of the film, Don Chedale as Detective Graham does get the most screen time. Starting the film investigating the murder of a young man dumped at the side of the road, we follow Graham through his arms length relationship with partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito), his involvement with a white police officer that has shot and killed a corrupt black cop and his rise through the department thanks to the Assistant District Attorney, Rick (Brandon Fraser) who extends an offer of title to Graham more for the color of his skin rather than his achievements in the field.But maybe most interesting is the storyline with Matt Dillon resurrecting his career as Officer Ryan. Responsible for his aging and ailing father, Ryan follows a path of self destruction and ends up violating the rights of a young black woman (Thandie Newton in one of the many standout performances in the film) only to later have to come to the aide of the same woman after a traffic accident the following day. Ryan is a man in conflict. His lack of understanding why the world could be so unfair leads him to lash out at other cultures. But his duty to serve and protect in the time of need reveals a man who sees no color only a responsibility based on his oath of uniform.No nationality is really let off easy in Crash. Whites, blacks, Middle Easterners and even Asians are seen as cultures that would seem to prefer to live in a world that consisted only of their own kind. They argue amongst themselves about how they are perceived by different races, and do not relent in their bias towards anything different.Crash is, in a word, provocative. You can't help but want to talk about the film at its conclusion, and that is probably the best compliment that Paul Haggis would want to receive. As ugly as each character is portrayed for their hatred, each situation is explained without being condoned. Like the black television director that is bombarded with comments on his loss of blackness his wife through to the producer of the show. Of all the characters he has the biggest change of view from beginning to end as he forgoes his own life of harmony mentality to take on the police and other blacks who try to rob him of his dignity.No easy task for a first time director, but Haggis gets the best out of his ensemble. Sandra Bullock in her small role as the ADA's wife is the best she has ever been and rapper Ludicrous and Larenz Tate as the two car jackers show great range and offer the few lightened moments in a film heavy on theme.Movies released in the first half of the year, rarely get noticed come golden statue hand-out time, but Crash should follow in the footsteps of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind and at very least get a best screenplay nod.But in lieu of any formal recognition, one thing is certain. Paul Haggis on the heels of his writing of last years best film Million Dollar Baby and now with Crash in his directing debut, is the new hot ticket in Hollywood and we will be hearing about him for a long time to come.www.gregsrants.com",9,21,48,24 April 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Visual feast for the eyes
","If there is one thing I can guarantee with this review it's that you will not see another movie like Pan's Labyrinth the rest of the year. In English or in Spanish.With its dark imagines, brutal violence and terrifying fantasy creatures, I challenge you to find a film on par with Guillermo del Toro's vision of a young girl in Spain circa 1944 who endures the growing pains of a new family while imagining a world where creatures that would give Stephen King nightmares surround her and coax her into various tasks of passage.Pan's Labyrinth is a movie almost too complex to explain. There are two tributaries of plot. One involves the real world where Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother travel to their new home amidst the violence of the Post-war Fascist repression. While adapting to new father whose penchant for sadism is wiggle-in-your-theatre-seat cruel, young Ofelia takes comfort in her mother's arms. But when her mother has complications with her pregnancy, Ofelia quickly finds retreat with the unusual characters including nymphs and fairies that lead her on three tasks that suggest the offer of reclaiming a throne.The second story surrounds this journey into fantasy and I have yet to find the words two hours after the screening to describe the various characters that include a huge toad with a secret key hidden inside its belly and a creature that eats young children and has eyes on the palm of its hands.Creepy stuff. Think Big Fish is written by Clive Barker.Writer and director Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) spins a whimsical story that is as engrossing as it is repulsive. The war scenes are brutally realistic with bullets not being spared for the long suffering, and a torture scene that includes utensils marked for your father's toolbox gave me the heebie jeebies a la Hostel. Guillermo is able to walk a thin line with confidence and with this entry, he secures his spot as one of the most interesting directors working in the mainstream today.Pan's Labyrinth received a 22 minute ovation when appearing at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006. I can't in good conscious share the same enthusiasm. But on the other hand I can't deny that this was an incredible spectacle that definitely deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate the beauty amongst the violence and the creativity of the storytelling among the dark corners where creatures lurk and adventures await.www.robertsreviews.com",8,6,10,22 January 2007
Knocked Up," One of the funnier films of the year
","There's nothing funny about getting someone pregnant after a one night stand.Or is there? Knocked Up, the new comedy from the creative mind of Judd Apatow who brought us the very funny The 40-Year-Old Virgin just over a year ago, is funny, touching, hilarious and in one scene  gross, all culminating in what is the funniest movie since.well, since The 40-Year-Old Virgin.The premise is summed up in the two word title, but let me try and expand on it just a little bit. It all starts when the beautiful Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) meets the Shrek-ish Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) at a bar where she is out with sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) looking for nothing more than a good time and a few laughs. The good time and good laughs come alright, but so does copious amounts of alcohol that eventually lead the two opposites back at Alison's house and where a miscommunication regarding the usage of a condom leads in a revelation some eight weeks later.The movie drifts between high emotional drama and belly laughs as the beauty and beast try and get to know each other while friend and family influences on both sides of the argument voice opinions and trade quips leading to the eventual birthing scene in the films final reel.There is so much to like about Knocked Up that it is hard to know where to start. Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow is able to make the audience genuinely care for the characters and their plights while surrounding them with a supporting cast that adds to much of the humor quotient of the film.What I liked best about the film was the dialogue between the characters. There is joy, confusion, anger and happiness all scattered in and around situations that every day folk like ourselves can relate to (as opposed to say, Ocean's 13). For instance, the sheer shock of hearing that Alison is pregnant, Ben retorts, 'With a baby?' Sure, it may sound stupid, but think of what the first unsuspecting words might be coming out of your mouth if slapped in the face with a life changing occurrence.And if I liked the dialogue I really really appreciated the supporting team, in particular Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who play sister-in-law-to-Alison Debbie and her husband Pete. Mann is a quick witted, sharp, tongue spearing pessimist that thinks her husband is cheating on her. Her biting words remind me of a young Elizabeth Perkins and Paul Rudd does a fantastic job of giving us a character that is vulnerable and trapped in a family of children and responsibility.For all my praise, there are a few drawbacks which keep the film from accepting a 4+ star review rating. A sequence including magic mushrooms at a performance of Cirque in Vegas could have fell to the cutting room floor without much impact and at two hours and twenty nine minutes, it is hard for the comedic punches to maintain their open wounds.But, if you get through the roller-coaster ride and find yourself still invested in interest by the time the crowning scene rolls along, you will undoubtedly have enjoyed yourself and in the mix of explosions and car chases this summer, that is a definite good thing.www.robertsreviews.com",7,1,4,6 June 2007
The Polar Express," Amazing
","Amazing. I know that the typical format for a film review is to spend ample time writing about the story, the background, the making of the film and maybe even some history on the actors or the director before getting to your opinion. But in the case of The Polar Express, I wanted to save you a lot of time so that maybe you can use the extra minutes to grab a paper and check out the local play times. The Polar Express is nothing less than a stellar achievement in film-making that will instantly become a modern day Christmas classic. Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, the story surrounds a mysterious train that arrives on Christmas Eve to take young boys and girls to the North Pole to help him again believe in the magic of Christmas. With a screenplay written by William Broyles, Jr. and director Robert Zemeckis, the film perfectly casts powerhouse Tom Hanks in no less than five separate roles including the conductor, a hobo, a father, scrooge and even the big man, Santa himself. As a computer animated production, you may raise an eyebrow when I write that Hanks was perfectly cast, but The Polar Express incorporates a new animation technique that allows an actor to act rather than just provide a voice over. This new system has the actor dressed in a suit with strategically placed computer chips that feed back into a computer. Known as 'Performance Capture', this process can capture live action movement, odd angles and even facial expressions that are digitally aped bring us an actor's performance instead of a simple vocal range. What is most surprising is that the actor's animation works so well that you would think that it has been mastered from years and years of evolvement with the process. From every smirk on the conductors face to every hair on the young boys head you get lost in the incredible detail of the production and by the ten-minute mark you will likely completely forget that you are watching a CG-crafted film.But it is not just the actor's movement and expressions that are a crowning achievement in this Christmas classic. The special effects and sound are equally spectacular. Two scenes, one including a ticket that blows out the window and interacts with everything from an eagle to a pack of wolves before magically finding its way back into its owners hands and a visually effective scene of the train trying to outrun the breaking ice of a lake are fascinating and more exciting than any live action perils seen in such summer fare as The Day After Tomorrow. But no highly visual picture can survive without a strong story and The Polar Express stays true to the book in adapting the journey of a group of children to see Santa's lair. The movie focuses mostly on a young boy who has grown older and is at that pinnacle where he no longer truly believes in the magic of the holiday season. His adventure includes meeting a ghost-like hobo that aides him on his quest, a scary cabin car that houses toys to be recycled and three must-be-seen-on-the-big-screen-to-be-enjoyed roller coaster type scenes that are effective enough to have you leaning to the right and left as the screen follows the tracks. This is not the first time that Zemeckis and Hanks have teamed for some movie magic. They have collaborated twice before on Forrest Gump and Castaway and this newest venture makes them the quintessential go-to team in Tinseltown. So whether they work together again in the future or not, at least we can savor their latest venture. The Polar Express is one of the best films of 2004 and can stand beside It's A Wonderful Life as a seasonal classic.Amazing.www.gregsrants.com",8,3,5,7 November 2004
Closer," Should have been titled Eyes Wide Open
","Imagine your partner has cheated on you and you get the chance to confront them and have them openly answer all the questions that just rip your heart out of your chest. Not the standard questions that we all see on television dramas, but the questions that will induce deep emotional wounds. 'Was he better than me?' 'Did you have sex in our house?''Did he make love to you differently?'These are questions that should remain in an impermeable vault. No response will be satisfying to the inquirer. But these are exactly some of the questions that are thrown at the audience when two of the four major characters in Mike Nichols new film Closer admit to their infidelity. The film focuses on four individuals, Alice (Natalie Portman) who meets Dan (Jude Law) after being hit by car on a London street; Anna (Julia Roberts), a divorced photographer who ends up meeting Larry (Clive Owen) in a way that is far too interesting to reveal here. In fact, this movie is so character and story driven that it benefits the viewer from watching it play out rather than spelled out, so I don't intend on offering many plot points as part of this review. What I can say is that this is a good film that gets great performances from all its leads. Clive Owen in particular gives us a suave dermatologist with fits of rage that border on the violent. His performance is mesmerizing and his presence is commanding in along any of the other three more commonly known stars. When he confronts Anna after coming home from a business trip, he is enraged, hurt, inquisitive and broken hearted. Being able to convey a cavalcade of thoughts and emotions in such a powerful scene reminds us of the promise he conveyed in his first mainstream film, Croupier back in 1998.And while Larry works out what is to be his new life of bachelor ship, Alice equally confronts her betrayer with raw emotion and a lack of understanding.Natalie Portman, like Owen is on the brink of stardom that should have both their trophy cases full of statues before their careers are over. Asked to hold her own amongst strong actors twenty years her senior, Portman matures in her role as Alice and becomes the pin-up 'girl to watch' for the next decade.Based on a screenplay by Patrick Marber (adapted from his own play), the movie plays out like a stage performance. There are primarily only four speaking parts and very few sets and location shots.The result is a very strong-dialogs film. Very strong. Those that see the trailers and expect to see Oscar contenders Roberts and Law have flightless banter, be warned. Director Mike Nichols incorporates explicit details about their sexual encounters with every foul word in George Carlins dictionary being paraded in rapid-fire progression.But hell, we're all adults here, and if you can get beyond the utter deception that almost every character tries to hide, yet reveal, yet hide (you'll have to see it to understand), you will find a real good movie that could have been titled Eyes Wide Open. So, I can't recommend this as a date film, but if you are in the mood for a movie about betrayal, love, obsession, sex, pain, lust, fear, loneliness, commitment, jealousy and honesty, this might just be the Christmas movie you are looking for.",8,22,33,5 December 2004
We Are Marshall," About 15 years too late
","It's hard to believe that a story like We Are Marshall had yet to receive the Hollywood red carpet treatment. For an inspirational sports tale, you would be hard pressed to find a more compelling story than the account of the 1970 University of Marshall team that perished in a frightful plane crash and how the town rallied behind a their new team the following year.Without even taking dramatic license, the story sounds like a Disney tear-jerker.So what happened? The tear-jerking is still there. In fact it is almost forced upon us with various 'Remember the Marshall's' speeches. Even when the plane crashes with hardly a character we have come to invest our interest, the reaction of the townspeople who grieve, cry and hug put lumps in my throat (well, it might have been the overstuffed hand of popcorn that I tried to shove down my mouth, but you get the point).The football scenes are there. People get hit, thrown while they catch balls and fall to the ground as good as any other football movie in the past ten years  Friday Night Lights setting the standard.The rallying is there too. People show up in mass to support the team. First in support of the almost canceled program, then at the first home game where the result should not be in doubt.So what happened? Even the good looking actors were there to lend their support to director McG (Charlie's Angels) vision. Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox (TV's Lost) do their best in polyester to smile and smirk at the camera to remind us that even in tragedy, sexy men are still sexy men.So what happened? Easy, Friday Night Lights, Remember the Titans, Miracle, Invincible, Gridiron Gang, Rudy, Hoosiers.happened. We have been inundated with sports movies that all have interchangeable parts. There is the letdown, the takeover usually in the form of a new coach, the training camp and then the one game that will have us leaving the theatre inspired. They are as formula as any Friday the 13th entry.This doesn't make We Are Marshall a bad movie. It just makes it about fifteen years too late.www.robertsreviews.com",5,3,13,2 January 2007
The Aviator," Scorsese and DiCaprio back on track
","'And the winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Director is.Martin Scorsese' Why not? After all, he has been nominated five times before. Adored by critics and hailed as one of this generations finest film helmers, Marty has yet to walk to the podium to accept his due. Ben Affleck has one. Eminem has one. So why not in the same year that saw Phil Mickelson finally whip his own demons and walk away with a Master's Championship, and the Boston Red Sox overcome the Curse of the Bambino, should Martin Scorsese not be able to put a lifetime of film-making into an honor that has him take home the coveted golden statuette. Martin's 2004 crack at the can comes courtesy of The Aviator, a film that chronicles the life of movie director and multi-millionaire aviator, Howard Hughes. For any of us that have seen an E! True Hollywood Story or A&E Biography on the eccentric Mr. Hughes, they would most remember his final years. He became a paranoid recluse that bordered on the insane. But Scorsese only dabbles in Hughes final years and the slow deterioration of this playboy's exile. Instead, he shows what a shrewd businessman and compulsive obsessive aviator Hughes was in his younger years and how he single handedly, due to either his genius or incredible stubbornness, didn't allow Pan Am to buy his Trans World Airlines to create a one-airline option for the American public. Playing the role as the anomalous Howard Hughes is Leonardo DiCarpio in his second collaboration with Scorsese in as many years (Gangs of New York). I have written for almost five years now how I have not understood the DiCarpio fascination. He was just OK in good films  Titanic, Catch Me If You Can  but gawd-awful in movies that he could have elevated  The Beach, The Man in The Iron Mask. Before The Aviator was even viewed for critics, DiCaprio was garnishing nominations as Best Actor and his salary intake based on one monster making film and countless teen magazines was just mind-blowing to me. Until now.As Howard, Leo does his best work to date and any non-nomination by the Academy would be robbery. This will be the role that defines DiCaprio. A role where he plays both a man with a vision and a child that locks himself in a room in self quarantine. As a naked Hughes in his red screening room, he drinks copious amounts of milk, lines up his bottles of urine and fends off an aggressive takeover bid by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). It is a scene upon which the succeeding chapters strongly rely and in the hands of a less talented actor, could have turned the movie into parody. But DiCaprio turns it into gold and although we are not talking about Tom Hanks type consistency yet, we definitely have seen a maturity that leads to as much more promise than say Gangs of New York did just one year ago.Clocking in at an unnecessary 169 minutes, the movie's first quarter focuses on the making of Hughes' film Hell's Angels from 1927 to 1930. The film was a visually stunning epic, which before production wrapped, buried three stunt men, was shot twice to incorporate the new innovation of sound in motion pictures and came in at a cost of almost $4 million. Sure that type of money might not even pay for Bruce Willis' baggage handler in today's economics, but back in 1930, it was almost 4 times the cost of the average big screen production. This lavish spending on a film that that would be almost impossible to recuperate, brings Noah Dietrich (always reliable John C. Reilly) into Hughes life as his financial voice of reason and head of Hughes' inherited tools manufacturing business. Together, these two would meet on screen throughout the years as Hughes would always be looking for money to fulfill his dreams while looking to Dietrich to find the money.After the opening of Hell's Angels, the movie begins to take a turn and follow the two loves of Hughes' life  aviation and women. In his aviation career, Hughes was a perfectionist that garnished grants from the government during wartime to build an airplane to better provide troops and equipment overseas. The plane, nicknamed the 'Spruce Goose' was completed after the war ended and was never used for its wartime intention. And as his empire grew, Hughes also started Trans World Airlines and began the quest of traveling to Europe and beyond. This would consume Hughes in his later years as conspirators in both rival airlines and the government tried desperately to dissipate his dreams.When it came to women, Hughes was labeled 'The World's Greatest Womanizer' back in the 1950's, but it was his love for Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) that the film reveals most prominently. They had a tumultuous relationship where fame and pressure would ultimately be their demise. But that didn't stop Hughes from putting a lovely woman on his arm each time he went out on the town. Hughes was attached to Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow and various times during his adult life and was the Scott Baio of their times. The last few chapters of the film deal with Hughes battle with government and his own internal demons as he edges into a world of insanity. This was an important footnote in the life of this public celebrity, but Scorsese probably draws it out 20 minutes more than is necessary. When the film is over, it is hard not to be overwhelmed with the contributions Hughes made to the future in both film-making and aviation. Without his battles with the government airlines like Southwest and Continental might never have ran a tarmac and he pushed the envelope with such violent or sexual in nature films as Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw (1941) that caused the MPAA to review its processes. The Aviator will lead the nominations parade throughout 2005. Scorsese, DiCaprio and Best Picture are all strong possibilities and rightfully so. The Aviator was a step back in the right direction for both director and lead actor and was one of the top 10 of 2005.www.gregsrants.com",9,5,15,19 December 2004
The Italian Job," Good movie - Too bad Mark Wahlberg was so distracting
","There is a scene at the beginning of The Italian Job that let me know I was seeing something different from the average action, heist caper. During the opening chase sequence, a boat goes flying in the air and lands aground without exploding into a great ball of Hollywood pyrotechnic fire. This may seem obscure or insignificant to most, but after viewing such biennial action films as Bad Boys II and Terminator 3 this past year, where everything including a kitchen sink was blown to pieces, it was refreshing to see an explosive opportunity passed on by such a young up-coming director. That director by the way is hit and miss F. Gary Grey who had success in 1996 and 1998 with Set It Off and The Negotiator, but came back to earth pretty hard with the gawd-awful Vin Disel vehicle, A Man Apart in 2002. To his credit, the fact that Paramount would hand the reins to such a young director to bring to the screen a remake of a Michael Caine 1969 film that is still revered by many today, is an indication of the talent he must contain. And the result, is a fun heist yarn that gives you your monies worth for two hours. The similarities to the original film are minimal. Mark Wahlberg takes over the role by Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, a thief who has assembled a team to help steal a shipment of gold stolen from them years earlier. The assembled crew all come with new cool 21st century names and talents. Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is the daughter of former slain crewmember John Bridger and is an expert at cracking safes. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the getaway driver, Lyle (Seth Green) is the computer expert and Left Ear (Mos Def) is the explosives expert that got his name due to a botched explosion in his youth. Together, they conspire against Steve (played by Edward Norton) who assisted in the original heist then turned on his team and confiscated the gold leaving the others for dead in the frozen waters of the Italian mountains. As caper films go, The Italian Job zips along at a fast pace and keeps us entertained with its thought process on how to pull of the perfect crime. In homage to the original, there is an extended chase scene by three mini-Coopers through the Los Angeles subway system and into rush hour traffic that might not make the best of list that contains such classics as Bullit and To Live and Die in L.A., but does offer an entertainment value of exceeded expectations. All this culminates in a concluding chapter that is both enjoyable if not foreseen. The Italian Job's biggest drawback however is the incredible cardboard acting of its lead, Mark Wahlberg. Consistently the weakest link in better than average films (Three Kings, Boogie Nights), Mark falls this side of Ben Affleck as one of the worst actors that get plumb roles in new-Hollywood. On subsequent viewings of his filmography, I can't help but think of the lack of talent presently being exploited on screen to moderate success. Ashton Kutcher, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just three more examples of why we still stand in line to see Jack Nicholson play himself over and over again in films like Something's Gotta Give. But I digress. The review in hand is The Italian Job and despite its inferior lead actor, the movie does deliver on many levels and if it's domestic box office is any indication (over $100 million), audiences tend to agree. Thumbs up.",7,0,1,29 December 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A good, but not memorable way to conclude the trilogy
","Matrix: Revolutions will be one of the hardest movies to review this year. Filmed at the same time as Matrix: Reloaded, but theatrically released six months apart, the Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) intended for the movie to be critiqued as one long film with an extended intermission.  The problem is that if you tease an audience months earlier with a film that ends in a cliffhanger and then make them wait half a year,  their expectations will be through the clouds.  People will expect Revolutions to be greater than Reloaded simply because we are conditioned to seeing sequels that turn up the violence, body count, special effects and anything else that can be improved upon from the original.  But let's think about this for a second.  At the time of release, the two Matrix films really had no equal.  Back to the Future II and III were filmed back to back in the 80's, but they were released in two separate calendar years with stories that went in two different directions.  Other than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which has yet to screen the third in the series, never before has a franchise shot one complete film and then split the whole into separate parts.  So as a lone film in the series, Revolutions does disappoint compared to the groundwork laid in the previous two.  Where the original and Reloaded had cutting edge special effects and fight scenes never before caught on 70mm, Revolutions goes through the motions of showing us the exactly what we have come to expect, just for longer and in different locations.  And where the first two films brought surprises around every corner, you can see Revolutions play out before the characters do.  Also adding to the disappointment is the lack of recurring characters in Revolutions.  The previous film brought us such new and interesting characters as The Keymaker, Persephone, The Architect, and Merovingian, all of which are either missing or have such little screen time in Revolutions that by the time you remember their name, they disappear forever.  And the two electrifying twins from Reloaded, become the Boba Fett of the fantasy film vault (i.e. being one of the most intriguing villains to get no screen time in the concluding film). This disappointment aside, the movie has incredible visuals.  The scene where the Sentinels breach Zion and begin their destruction of human kind is a feast for the eyes.  Humans don walking metal gun ships and put up a fight that would make even George Lucas ask `how'd they do that' questions.  There is more humor in this film that the other two combined, and the final act does contain a few revelations and a non-Hollywood style ending that is always refreshing in genre films. But, what makes it hard to review is that if the movie was indeed played as intended viewing by the directors (4 hours of mind and bum numbing action), we would all be praising the film for being the most cutting edge, special-effect laden film of all time.  Instead, we spent weeks speculating, anticipating and formulating ideas as to how good the third one must me to close off the series.  Maybe it will play out better on DVD.",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
The Thing," One of the best horror films of the last millennium
","Watching John Carpenter's The Thing, I was reminded of how good a filmmaker he used to be.  In the 1970's John brought us Assault on Precinct 13, Elvis and one of the most profitable and copied films of all time, Halloween.  In the 1980's he was involved with no less than 8 films including Escape from New York, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China and Starman.  However, it was his 1982 release of The Thing that is most revered in the new millennium and now it is re-mastered and re-issued on home DVD.Based loosely on the original 1951 film, Thing From Another Planet, John Carpenter set out to remake the film keeping only a few of the original ideas in tact.  To ensure success, John assembled an A-list of B-list stars including Wilfred Brimley, Keith David, Richard Mauser and Richard Dysart and circled them around best friend Kurt Russell (Escape from L.A.) in an isolated compound in the Arctic. The film begins with an encounter with a Norwegian group of men who are trying to shoot and destroy a dog from their helicopter.  The chopper is soon destroyed and the Norwegian killed, so Kurt (Mac) and the others set out to discover the origin of their visitors.  Upon arrival at the Norwegian camp, they discover dead frozen bodies and a block of ice that seems to have transported something to the compound.  Outside, they find the burned remains of a creature that has human-like qualities and they inevitably bring this hideous piece of flesh and bone back for examination.  
It's not long before the dog they took in exposes itself to the group as an alien lifeform that can take on the identity of another being, and soon one by one, the humans become victims and hosts to the alien's intentions. 
Shot almost 23 years ago, I am amazed at how the special effects still hold up today.  The creature effects by Roy Arbogast (Jaws, Return of the Jedi), have not been bettered by new technology and the scene where Norris (Charles Hallahan) has his chest collapse and literally loses his head and we watch it grow spider legs and run out of the room, is as potent and memorable as John Hurt's creature birth in the original Alien.This movie had a lot of things going against it in 1982.  It had a cast that consisted of only men (not one woman appears in the film), it had effects deemed too gory for the times and most importantly, it was released the same year as Steven Speilberg's cute alien movie E.T.  However, where E.T. ,upon present day viewing, shows signs of dating and blue screen special effects, The Thing continues to show like it was made just yesterday with precision and craftsmanship.  The movie has a sense of claustrophobia and urgency and its end, which is far from Hollywood typical, might leave room for a sequel possibility, but not with the same cast of characters.  I also appreciated that John Carpenter did not fall prey to the typical horror film ending that we are now so accustomed, where just when you think it is all over, the killing entity gets one last cheap fright out of the audience.The 90's and post 2000 have not been kind to Mr. Carpenter.  He has directed such stinkers as Ghosts of Mars and Escape to L.A. and Body Bags, and John's reluctance to work under the Hollywood umbrella of a major studio and budget now show with his cheesy effects and locations.  However, he and Kurt Russell can look back proud to the summer of 1982 when they put one of the best horror films in history on celluloid.",8,1,2,12 November 2003
The Village," An unfortunate mis-step, but I hope its part of the directors DVD collection in about 15 years
","Expectation: ex.pec.ta.tion. noun: the act of anticipation. , a looking forward with hope or pleasure , a reasonable chance. (Source: New Concise Dictionary)Expectations, when it comes to a Hollywood production, rarely result in matching the height of its publicity. I think back to Godzilla, The Matrix Sequels and Planet of the Apes as just a few films in recent recollection that burst onto the scene amongst a glut of television promotions, newsstand headlines and fast food tie-ins. Their mass marketing teams were good enough to grant each of these films good opening week-ends and each may even have made money for their studio bosses, but average Joe Public was duped and word soon got around about the disappointment of the venture. So when M. Night Shyamalan's new film The Village started to hit theaters with teasers and trailers throughout the spring months I was immediately hit with an expectation based on the directors track record alone. The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable were all exceptional films, two of which have their standing in the top grossing films of all time. M. Night has become the Alfred Hitchcock of our day in his manipulation of an audience and his revelations in the final chapter. The particular allure of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was brought by the final pages of the secretive script and people in mass began talking to friends, family and co-workers about the 'I didn't see it coming' endings. The trailers for The Village looked as promising as any other summer scare. Lacking the big names of Willis or Gibson, M. Night instead went with a familiar if not paparazzi hunted group of talented actors. Joaquin Pheonix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are ordinary villagers in Covington Pennsylvania who live their lives in a Little House on the Prairie environment. They eat dinners at long tables, bake their own bread and eat their own livestock. It is a peaceful place, a tranquil settling. Or is it?At the village border is a forest marked with yellow flags, burning torches and lookout towers. Teachers impart the history of the village, frightening the youth with stories of creatures that embark upon the woods.'We have always had since the day we settled here a gentle understanding with a the creatures who live beyond our borders. We do now sway into their woods, they do not come into our village. It is a truce.'Also forbidden is the color red (for reasons not particularly clear, but a between the lines explanation can be found) and the rules of the village are upheld no matter the cost. When a young villager dies, Lucius (Pheonix) offers to leave the town in search of the next village where he can find medicine for those that are ill. But the elders are not willing to risk the life of someone traveling into the land of the creatures and they hold back young Lucius from attempting his journey.However, an accident of jealousy leaves a villager in desperate need of medical attention and this time, a young blind woman named Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard in an exceptional performance) petitions an elder to go into the woods and trek to the nearest doctor. Her wish it granted and the movie runs from a state of paranoia to a M. Night does Blair Witch Project. Writing a review for a M. Night film is like reading a who-dunnit book and stopping before the last chapter. We have to pull ourselves from revealing anything that the audience might not foresee to give them the same sense of revelation as we felt days earlier. Major plot points are kept from the writing as to not sway you into finding out the films secrets and we dance around the issue with anything but grace or agility. I can say that The Village does have two twists, both of which you could probably figure out since you know to look for them as soon as the drapes reveal the theatre screen. I actually found it a distraction trying to connect the dots one step in front of the director's imagery instead of enjoying the film as a whole. That said, I was not overly impressed with this production and maybe I can go as far as to say that I was disappointed on how it resolved. The premise and the director gave hope that this might be one of the scariest movies to hit the screen since The Exorcist, but instead, I felt teased like someone was tickling my foot with a feather Â– enjoyable but ultimately annoying.In this crazy world of special editions and director box sets, I think it might take about 15 years and 9 or so more films before this one is accepted for anything more than a good attempt that failed to win over a mass audience. When M. Night is given the royal treatment of a directors set much like Stanley Kubrick, I like most will hope that The Village is part of the collection. For like Kubrick's The Shining, this film was not one of the best, but it wouldn't seem like a complete set without it.In the meanwhile, my disappointment will have to stew and hopefully, M. Night can follow the great Hitchcock model and quickly erase our memories with a better effort.",5,0,0,1 August 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," A very good remake, although I can't remember the first one
","I am always at a crossroads when a remake of a movie comes out and I can hardly remember the original (if at all!). Do I rent the original so that I can compare? Or do I stay away and let the remake attempt to formulate an impression on me before revisiting the past? Decisions, decisions.Well, when it came to The Hills Have Eyes, I decided NOT to see the original again before the screening of the new 2006 edition. Although I am sure that Wes Craven did an 'admirable' job 30 years ago with the original, it couldn't have been that good since even seeing the movie poster and reviewing the plot outline couldn't initiate any memories whatsoever.In retrospect, this was a very good decision.The new Hills Have Eyes comes to us via Alexandre Aja, who shocked North American late night audiences with 2003's High Tension (also known as Haute Tension, also known as Switchblade Romance). In that film, Aja brought us back to the bloody horror films that we enjoyed so much back in the 70's and 80's as Cécile De France played a cat and mouse game with a serious sociopathic serial killer (.or did she? Ha Ha).So when I heard that Aja was helming a film that would not be poorly dubbed and consisted of the terrorizing of an American family by a group of psychotic and radiation deformed stalkers in a desert, well, damn, I said 'sign me up!!!' And while you are at it, sign my friends up too, for The Hills Have Eyes is a good film in a genre that struggles to produce consistency in a world where the local news provides more terror than producers can hope to duplicate without fear of an NC-17 rating being slapped on their finished product.The Hills Have Eyes stars Ted Levine (Monk) and Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo 13) as two members of the Carter family that are traveling through New Mexico when their truck is forced off the road via the ole 'spikes hidden on the road' trick. That then leaves the California dreamers (consisting of mom, pop, three children, a son-in-law, a newborn and some dogs) stranded in the middle of nowhere, and this nowhere just happens to have some mutated flesh-eating murders hiding in dem der hills.The result might be typical horror film, i.e. family gets picked off one by one while getting a few of the baddies along the way, but Aja has a unique way of getting us there with true scares, gore galore and atmosphere which is usually the most lacking in entries of this type. Note, the atmosphere does come at the expense of thriller time and the movie does have faults in that it has large lapses between action, but it's a small price to pay and rest assured, you will get your fill of blood and guts before looking over your shoulder while navigating back to your car after the showing.There is a rape scene that now takes the award for making me feel the most uncomfortable away from the pedophiles in Running Scared, and there are enough axe swings to make Paul Bunyan's arms sore. If it's blood you crave there was enough in The Hills Have Eyes for two films which is probably why the producers had to lobby to ensure the film only got an R-Rating.So while every other week it would seem that Hollywood is rehashing a Japanese director's celluloid sneeze, The Hills Have Eyes was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was good, scary - at times frightening and the perfect compliment leading into the big budget bullcrap we are about to get once the season changes.",7,12,26,5 March 2006
Cold Mountain," A good movie - not a great movie
","I find it a little ironic that Cold Mountain took an English Director (Anthony Minghella), a British Actor (Jude Law), an Australian Actress (Nicole Kidman) and a supporting cast that primarily showcased a Canadian (Donald Sutherland) and an Irishman (Brendan Gleeson), to bring to the screen the best movie set during the American Civil War since 1989's Glory. Don't get me wrong, Renee Zellweger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have probably the two most memorable roles within the movie's 155-minute frame, but it's the southerly-accent-challenged that get the most screen time. 
Cold Mountain is directed by Minghella (who has worked with Law and Hoffman before in The Talented Mr. Ripley), who worked from a script he adapted from the best selling novel by Charles Frazier.  The story surrounds a young woman named Ada Monrow (Kidman) who falls in love with the town handyman Inman (Law) right before the breakout of the American Civil War.  After a horrific battle with the Americans, Inman is injured and decides to dessert the army to travel back to his true love.  Back at the ranch (literally), Ada is finding the times hard.  Her father has died and Ada is unable to maintain the farm and garden.  Enter one Ruby Thewes (Zellweger) who hears of Ada's plight and attempts to show her how to cultivate the land and groom the animals in exchange for free room and board and the eating at the same table as the owner.Time goes on and the movie weaves between the lives of the two central characters.  Inman continues his odyssey back to Cold Mountain, evading those that hunt deserters and running into an eclectic bunch of characters that include a sexual promiscuous priest (Hoffman), a woman and a child left lonely by the war (Natalie Portman) and a hillbilly type character (Giovanni Ribisi) that lures Inman into his self-indulgent web.In contrast, Ada and Ruby continue to work the land and Ada soon becomes capable of sustaining the property on her own. We watch as they build fences together, grow crops and hunt for food.  They become friends and no sooner does Ruby confide in Ada of her abusive father, Stobrod (Gleeson) than he shows up caught in food trap on their property. Stobrod and his daughter begin to rekindle their loving relationship of old  But where would a movie be without a villain, and Cold Mountain has a few in a posse of men that are out to get back land once theirs and to rid themselves of undesirable deserters within their midst.  When the posse crosses paths with Stobrod and his band, Stobrod is killed and when Inman finally returns to the warm embrace of Ada, a gunfight ensues with nary a man standing its conclusion.Cold Mountain is one of those films that does everything an Oscar contender should.  It takes a bunch of good-looking, previously nominated stars puts them in a big budget war/drama/romance film with a love story that is multi-generational.  Minghella does his best with a multi-layered novel and brings to the screen characters that are both believable and enjoyable. But it is the relationship between Ada and Inman, or the lack of it, which is at the core of Cold Mountain's problems.  These two characters share but a kiss and rarely have any scenes together, so it is not very credible that they would pine for each other as they do throughout the film.   This suspension of belief alienates the audience from connecting with the two leads.  Everyone involved with the film is well cast (even and including Jena Malone as the Ferry Girl), but it is Renee Zellweger (who was a colored woman in the novel) stands head above the rest in her portrayal as the rough around the edges Rudy.  I heard one critic say that `Cold Mountain is a good film, not a great film', and I can't think of a better way to describe it.  The battle sequences you will admire in the trailer play a small part in the overall production so be prepared more for a dramatic romance rather than the fight for ones true love.  That said, Cold Mountain should do quite well come Oscar nomination time.  Kidman and Zellweger are Academy favorites and Minghella has won before with The English Patient.   In a year where the best films have all been about dark and dreary subject matters (21 Grams, Mystic River), Cold Mountain may stand above them all in late February with a bunch of non-anatomically correct statues in its hand.",8,1,1,30 December 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," Brilliant
","I loved this movie.I know it is odd for someone to put their opinion in the first sentence of their review, but why wait? Why go through the history of how the film was made, what actors are playing what roles, how it was cast and all the neat tidbits that might have gone on behind the scenes. Why go through all of that just to get to the one line that reveals the overall impression by the writer of the viewing.So, I loved this movie.Premiering at January's Sundance Film Festival, Little Miss Sunshine picked up incredible buzz and critical praise. By the time the week was over Fox Searchlight bought up the distribution rights for the film for $10.5 million  the highest price ever paid for a film premiering at the festival.From there, it was a game to see if it would take longer to get the film released than it did to get it made (it took five years for various reasons to get the product on celluloid).Little Miss Sunshine brings to the big screen one of the most dysfunctional families you are bound to see in a movie that doesn't star Robin Williams. There is Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is trying to become the poor man's Tony Robbins, Olive (Abigail Breslin) the 7-year old daughter, Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who has an affinity towards porn and heroin, Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence for the past nine months, Frank (Steve Carrell) who is a gay, depressed Proust scholar who is on suicide watch after breaking up with his boyfriend and Sheryl (Toni Collette) the mother who's flaws are so overshadowed by the dominating indiscretions of the others that her sanity is the glue that holds the family together.Together, they set out on a road trip adventure to California where Olive has been given the opportunity to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant due to a disqualification of another contestant. Along the way, their obstacles will include a death, a vehicle that won't work unless started n third gear, a disappointing revelation that will crush someone's dreams and an encounter with an ex that would suck the oxygen right out of the sails.Little Miss Sunshine is directed by Jonathon Dayton and Valarie Faris who's previous resume was stationed in music videos and television commercials. But their lack of experience sure didn't show as they put together a road movie that is touching, funny and downright fun to watch.Just how hard is it to put a road movie together? Well, Harold Ramis had some moments of success with Vacation, Jim Jarmusch tried it last year with Broken Flowers and Robin Williams comes to DVD with his road movie RV this week. In fact, for every Lost In America, there are ten Brown Bunny's. So the feat was a major undertaking with the chips stacked against them.But the cast and characters they portray separate this film from the others and even if you can't relate each character to someone in your own family, you are engrossed in the struggles of an ordinary family just trying to survive.Even the ending which you could figure might result in the family coming together in some weird and awkward way was done with brilliance. When Olive takes the stage to perform her dance routine that she had been taught by her Grandpa, we hold our breathe in hopes the young lass is not laughed off the stage, but ten seconds into the routine, it is the audience that is laughing off their seats as the scene plays out.This won't be the last time you read about Little Miss Sunshine. Steve Carrell's career is sizzling thanks to the NBC show The Office and his theatrical vehicle The 40-Year Old Virgin that put him on the map. His turn as the serious, suicidal brother Frank shows his dramatic range. Abigail Breslin who was also brilliant in 2004's Keane shows that Dakota Fanning is not the only young talent in Hollywood. Little Miss Sunshine will be referred to going forward as the launching pad for these two remarkable talents and we will talk about them and the movie more when it appears on critics Best of Lists at the end of the year.www.robertsreviews.com",9,3,7,13 August 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The best of the action films this summer
","The summer of 2003 will be known for two things in Hollywood.  The year of the sequel and the year that movie titles forced theatre owners to run out and buy more letters for their marquee.  Between Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, movie listings read more like a novel than a short listing of start times.Enter Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, the third installment of the Terminator series that sent Arnold Schwarzenegger to stardom and made a household name of James Cameron before he decided to spend his life looking for a shipwreck. In this third time around, gone are Director Cameron, stars Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, and even liquid metal man Robert Patrick has been replaced.  Enter Director Jonathon Mostow (U-571), new John Conner, Nick Stahl (In the Bedroom), Claire Danes (Romeo + Juliet) and new Terminator villain Kristina Loken.  Oh yeah, Arnie is back too.The movie begins with a grown up John Conner describing to the camera how he has lived his life since we last left him.  He has no address, no phone, no home. 
Soon, a motorcycle accident puts him in the same room as Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), just as the new female terminator, T-X, shows up with the intention of killing both humans. Ok, enough story, let the special effects begin.   Just 15 minutes into the film, we see the new and improved Terminator make weapons with her arm, turn from liquid into human form and show strength beyond the skills of Terminator 2's, T-1000. Even Arnold says that she is an upgrade that has made him obsolete and defeating her will be unlikely.  But that doesn't mean we can't have fun along the way.A chase scene through the streets of Los Angeles between a pet clinic truck, a fire engine and a wide load crane was brilliantly choreographed as the Terminator tries to thwart T-X's attempts to kill John Conner and in doing so takes out countless cars, trucks, and even a glass building. T3 might not be as original as the first films, but it does stay true to the timeline and more importantly, it continues the story of the fight against the machines. We find out the fate of Sarah Conner, learn more about Skynet and how the machines took control, we see the first terminators activated and it is revealed that Arnold's character kills John Conner in the future. But who cares.  We want to see the two terminators do battle and we are not disappointed.  From the first moment that the T-X gets run over by Arnold's truck, to a spectacular fight sequence in a men's room (hey, who wouldn't pay to see Schwarzenegger hit a woman over the head with a urinal?), to the final confrontation at the Skynet lab, the action is unrelenting. There are a few faults with the movie.  Nick Stahl could have better cast and there are too many coincidences (John and Kate just happen to be together when the T-X arrives, Kate's father works for Skynet etc.). However, the franchise is kept fresh with an interesting story and loads of humour (Arnold shows up naked at a bar during Ladies Night) and inside jokes (the cat requiring attention is called Hercules).  It's even nice to see Earl Boen back as Dr. Silverman for a third time. So it's not a great film.  So what.  Things go boom and people go splat. Bring it on!",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
"I, Robot"," Not bad, but when is Will going to grow up?
","When I hear that Will Smith is connected to yet another summer blockbuster, I have to take a deep breath and simply hope that this was just another 'get it out of the way when I am young' roles for the now 35-year old. Bursting on to the film scene in 1993's wonderful Six Degrees of Separation (for those of you about to e-mail me, I do realize he was in Fresh Prince on television and was also in the Ted Danson flop Made in America - that is why I said 'bursting'), Smith showed us plenty of talent, loads of good looks and demonstrated an acting ability that had many believe that this possible up-and-comer might be the next black acting star and help take some of the torch bearing burden from Mr. Denzel Washington.Well, that was ten plus years ago now and perusing up and down Smith's filmography are films like Men in Black (I & II), Wild Wild West, Bad Boys (I & II) and Independence Day. Giving credit where it is due, there was also an Academy Award nomination for the 2001 biopic Ali, but outside of that one anomaly, it doesn't look like Mr. Smith will be putting on his jogging suit and reaching back for Denzel's torch any time soon.Enter the 2004 summer campaign and Will is at it again with the sci-fi thriller I, Robot. In the film, adapted from a short story by Isaac Asmiov, Will plays Del Spooner, a Chicago Police Detective who is called in to investigate the murder of an employee of the U.S. Robotics company which manufactures these life sized human robotic aides capable of almost anything a human can realize. Want your dog walked? My wires-in-his-head robot is your solution. Need someone to take the kids to school? Domo-origato, Mr. Roboto. Want someone murdered? Well..The robots have three laws to which they have to abide. Law #1: Robot cannot harm a human being or by action allow a human being to be harmed. Law #2: A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law and Law #3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws. Taking into account that these rules are hardwired into every robot manufactured, there is no room or reason for suspicion when the creator of the robot force is found at the bottom of a high-rise building the result of what is first expected as suicide. But Detective Spooner doesn't trust the robots for reasons to be revealed later (and to be believed much much later), and he pursues the possibility of a robot with violent behavior against the wishes of his department chief and on the eve of the largest distribution of robots in history.Uh-oh, this can't be good.I, Robot was a surprisingly entertaining film in a summer where blockbusters last for an opening week-end and fade from memory before we get our bank statement detailing our ticket purchase. Will Smith doesn't really have much to do except flex his muscles and react to what was probably a tennis ball on a broom stick until the CGI guys did their part. However the special effects that are included are top rate. The robots attack like ants in the hundreds and are more effectively used in their battle sequences that say the droids used in the past two George Lucas films. They are ruthless, yet vulnerable which at least gives the human race a chance and doesn't give us the feeling that the attempt at fighting back is futile. Directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City), I, Robot takes its time trying to figure out what kind of film it wants to be. Part science fiction, part adventure/thriller and part who-dunnit, the film takes us in many different directions and lucky doesn't have us lose interest along the way. Accredited can be a smart script by Jeff Vintar that aside from the usual smart ass comments every film hero must now find variations ('Somehow 'I told you so' just doesn't quite say it.'  Yeeaaasch!), is unique and zips along at a good pace. Think Minority Report with more wires and plastic.Granted the film does have its share of missteps. The humor is hit and miss with more miss than hit and a scene where a mob of humans armed with bats and chains (in the years 2035, I might add) set out to rumble on the streets with a robot army, was just too stupid and ill advised to take seriously. Luckily the action scenes such as a demolitions robot destroying a house or robots jumping from their transport onto the detectives car are good enough to help you forget the pitfalls. In fact, not since A.I. have I wished a film had less humans and more of the robotic creations to carry the story.So in a summer of alright films, I, Robot finds its place amongst them like a sapling in the forest. I just wished Will Smith wasn't it in. Not that he doesn't do his best, but I am tired of waiting for that once so promising spark, and until you grow up, I guess Denzel will have to pin his hopes on say, Jamie Foxx.",6,0,0,15 July 2004
The Alamo," Two hours of foreplay for a PG-13 battle
","As a Canadian, maybe I was at a disadvantage watching The Alamo.  In school we were primarily taught Canadian History so my American historical knowledge is pretty much extracted from what I saw on television or seen in the movies over the years.With this void of reference, the movie was a bit of a surprise for me.  The Alamo actually fell to the Mexicans?  I had no idea.  Davy Crockett was killed at the legendary battle? But what about his television show? Did the Mexican's really attack just one day before their big cannon was to arrive? With each passing scene, I seemed to be more out of touch with what I thought or understood about the infamous 1836 standoff.What I did know however was all the Hollywood shuffling that took place during the production of the 2004 version.  Made widely public last year was the fact that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe were set to direct and star, but there were arguments with Disney and both dropped out.  I also knew that this movie was set to be released in December 2003 for Oscar consideration, but the studio pushed back the release explaining that director John Lee Hancock was still editing the film (yeah, right). With all the negatives about the film found weekly on Entertainment Tonight and in Entertainment Weekly, the film was starting at a disadvantage before the lights even went dim in the theatre.  Add to the mix that the historical geeks would be all over the film for inaccuracies (as they are with any film based on a factual event), and viola, instant we-can't-win cinema.This Alamo tells the story through four central characters.  There is the roughened James Bowie (Jason Patric) who has the respect of the men but is slowly succumbing to consumption; the young unrespected-at-first William Travis (Patrick Wilson) that is responsible for leading the troops against their formidable foe; the chiseled war veteran Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) who is legendary in the eyes of the Mexican army; and of course, not donning a raccoon hat is the popular and charismatic Davy Crockett played wonderfully by Billy Bob Thornton.  These characters are known to anyone who has studied Texas history, but to us ignorant folk, we were at the mercy of director Hancock to educate us, and I must be completely honest here, I wonder just how many liberties the guy took.For instance, did Davy Crockett really play his fiddle one night resulting in the respected non-action by the Mexican army for the first time in almost a week?  Did Sam Houston actually refuse to help the Alamo only later to become a hero in folklore?  And was James Bowie that ill that he fought Mexican soldiers from his deathbed?  All could be true, and if so, I will be very embarrassed for my comments, but on the surface, it seemed unlikely.What I have uncovered since my viewing is that these four characters were incredibly interesting.  They all had huge egos and even larger drinking problems.  Each had no luck with women (or women with them depending on the slant you want to put on things).  They were a group that didn't particularly like each other, but rose to the occasion to defend the Texan frontier. I wondered if spending time on the clashes these men might have had between each other would have been better than the gibberish each of these men orate while the audience awaits a form of battle.  Not just gibberish I should add, but gibberish set to arousing music.  The movie seems to be one rally-the-troops speech after another and there is a roaring musical score when anyone does anything other than speak.  Sam Houston walks out of a tentqueue the music.  James Bowie does up the buttons of his uniform from bedqueue the music.  I go get more popcornqueue the music.  In fact, I haven't witnessed such gross placement of a films score since John Rambo accompanied an orchestra into Vietnam.All this leads to an eventual battle, that quiet frankly, doesn't even live up to the production values of Braveheart some ten years earlier.  We see explosions that throw people through the air, we see gunfire and bayonets, but I guess being Disney, there was no blood in the storage room beside Mickey's ears to use on the battlefield.  It made me feel like I wasted $13 on something that could have been seen on afternoon television.
But it really wasn't so much the battle as it was the 2 hours of foreplay we are given that bothered me the most.  The trailers had me enthused thinking I was about the see some heroic war where the little guy stood up the bully and lost but not without a fight.  Instead, I was subjected to long talks, fireside speeches and the deteriorating health of a major character. Compelling, but then why call the movie the Alamo?  I think Texans Who Await Death, would have been a more apt title.  So, remember the Alamo?  I have pretty much forgotten it already.www.gregsrants.com",6,1,6,11 April 2004
Disturbia," Rear Window meets the 'burbs
","The opening tragedy in Disturbia hit me like a head-on crash (wink wink nod nod). When the film opens with Kale (Shia LaBeouf) and father Daniel (Matt Craven) fly fishing in a remote river, I settled in for a slow start to what will eventually end up being a Rear Window-ish type thriller as advertised in the television spots. So there I was, nestled in my chair, comfortable, with my fingers interlocked with my date expecting a slow start to the introduction of our main characters.Then it happens, and whammo  an expected heart thump that threw my hand back into my lap so that the Misses could put her hands over her eyes. Welcome to Disturbia, the new film by D.J Caruso (no, not David) who is better known around these parts for his television series direction than his big screen efforts.Disturbia is an ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window (whether it wants to garnish the comparison or not) that is taunt, fun and exciting even if it offers us nothing new.The premise is set when Kale pops his Spanish teacher after a comment is made about his father. This results in Kale being put under house arrest for three months that includes an ankle bracelet that alerts the local authorities if he strays further than 100 feet away from the monitoring system.House arrest is something that most high school brats would welcome with open X-Boxes. Between the cable television, the porn and the constant parade of video games being thrown into the big screen television, it is a dream come true for the underachiever.But when party pooper 'mom' steps up to the plate and hits a triple off the right field fence by cutting the cable to the television and cutting the internet options, Kale passes time by watching the neighbors and coming up with interpretations based on his observations (think Tom Hanks in the 'burbs without the humor).At first, it is just simple suburbia type behavior. People going to work, possible affairs occurring in their absences. Kale's new interest is in watching new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) as she takes dips in the pool, dresses and undresses in the bedroom and suntans on the roof of her home. Kale has so much fun in his adolescent perversion that he soon has friend Roonie (Aaron Yoo  think Harold of Harold & Kumar without the humor) coming over to partake in the perversion peeking.As expected, Ashley catches the two horn dogs spying and soon she is re-enacting a scene from The Girl Next Door (without the humor) by coming over after a swim and confronting the two homeboys. Welcoming herself into the house and up to Kale's room, Ashley appreciates the snooping on the unsuspecting neighborhood and soon adds fuel to the rumor fires  especially in regards to neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse, acting like David Morse without the humor).It would seem that Mr. Turners actions are just a tad bit suspicious and recent news about the disappearances of a young female leads the three peepers to connect dots that may or may not be relevant.These suspicions lead Kale, Roonie and Ashley into full Magnum P.I. mode where they follow Mr. Turner, break into his house and investigate a la Cody Banks (with more humor).Is Mr. Turner a killer or is he just a strange old man that fits the clues for convenience? Well, without revealing more than the trailers already suggest, Kale and the Gang (like Kool & the Gang only cooler) fight time, the law and even an aggressively irate Turner in an attempt to solve the crime and put an end to his possible reign of terror.Disturbia is one of those movies that has been stripped from countless other films from both the thriller/suspense and the teenage coming of age type genres yet still works on many levels as it maintains a taunt schedule and still keeps the thrills and humor coming at a pace quicker than a Johnny Cochrane defense.By the time we get to the action packed ending we are engrossed in the mystery ourselves and we duck with every swing of a bat and swish of a blade. When Mr. Turner goes off, we root for the good guys and luckily we are paid back in our investment with characters that seem smart enough to make the right moves (i.e. running from the bad guy instead of towards him) in an attempt to ultimately survive the night. Even the underused Carrie-Anne Moss acts like a mother would and should if put into the circumstances that eventually will put her in peril.The ending of Disturbia is interesting if not a bit of a stretch in comparison to the rest of the film, but hell, if a guy is going be accused of killing women I will be damned if we don't get an ending that concludes in a dark and dank basement.None of the above makes Disturbia a classic, but it does rank up there with Red Eye of last year as a film that delivers the goods even if the goods are pre-packaged.www.robertsreviews.com",6,1,4,15 April 2007
Van Helsing," Hollywood tries to cheat and pack in the familiar faces
","If there was any truth to the notion that Hollywood has run out of new ideas and even less unique characters, one has to look no further than the recent crop of box office fodder we have been fed over the past few years.In efforts to rip our hard earned dollar from our pockets with once proven yet stale characters, the cinema has tried a new approach of coupling these faded franchises into the same story.  One only needs look at Freddy vs. Jason, Aliens vs. Predator or even the notably bland League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to see the newest trend of familiar characters against a common enemy.The recent attempt at this warfare tactic is the biggest and boldest risk yet in Universal Studio's Van Helsing.  With adds swarming about a one man's crusade against the Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein it's a way of almost tricking the audience into thinking they are getting three movies for the price of one.  Add Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde who makes a rather large cameo early on in the film and you have seasons one through four of the X-Files minus any alien abductions.For those of you who may not be aware of this almost a quarter of a billion dollar adventure (this number includes the lucrative advertising budget and sequel rights), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in the X-Men franchise) plays the title character who is commissioned by the church to rid the world of the evil creatures it harbors.  After a memorable chase with Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing is dispatched to Eastern Europe to stop Dracula and his gang of monsters from channeling the efforts of Dr. Frankenstein and bringing to life the dead offspring of the Count and his wives.Conceding that this is not enough to propel a blockbuster film, we also are introduced to the lovely Kate Beckinsale (who no doubt was still wearing the same wire harness she perfected in last years Underworld) as Anna Valerious, the last in a line of hereditary challenges for the Dracula family.  Van Helsing's role is then quite clear, he must save the Valerious family and set them free from purgatory, foil the plans of the count, hide his decision to save the Frankenstein monster from his superiors while trying to race against time and find not only the answers to his own legacy but also to inject himself with a cure for the Wolfman curse to which he has been infected.  Whew!You would think that with all this going on, all these familiar evil characters that we grew up on with Saturday afternoon matinees, that we would be in for a roller coaster ride of the can't fail variety.
If you thought as did I, you are in for a disappointment.As a critic, it is always easier to pick out the bad in films, so let me start there.  Even though writer/director Stephen Sommers has given Universal an incredibly lucrative franchise in The Mummy (followed by The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King, the three combined for nearly $850 million at the worldwide box office), he has never been one much for character development.  A master of the special effects and CGI action, I would expect that when storyboarded, this film must have looked incredibly fun with the studio licking its chops at the theme park possibilities. However, when put on the big screen, the characters were all bland. Dracula was never frightening, Frankenstein was a wimp (granted if you read the book, it stays true to his good nature), and only the Wolfman offers any kind of real peril.With the supporting cast as backdrops, the hopes would be that the leading crew of Jackman and Beckinsale would rise to the occasion, but together they offer not one ounce of chemistry and although human fighting the supernatural they seem to be able to fall from incredible distances or get thrown into walls without as much as an Advil for back pain.  If these characters don't seem to falter after being manhandled by creatures ten times their strength, then where is the adventures?  Where is the sense of urgency?Granted, I am not blaming the two leads for this mess.  They really didn't have anything to work with.  The whole cast are forced to not show smiles while uttering such as `I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately, but you kind of stick out in a crowd' (said to Frankenstein) or `Too bad, so sad' as orated to Van Helsing to by one of the Counts evil brides.  Even when they are trying to be funny, they don't seem to hit on any consistent cylinders.  It actually reminded me of The Mummy Returns in 2001 when I witnessed what I still profess today to be the only movie that has over 50 attempts at humour and does not hit one note.  Van Helsing is just as bad. When a friar walks into a room just vacated by the Wolfman, he asks rhetorically, `What smells like wet dog in here?' and when Igor is asked why he tortures the Wolfman he says, `It's what I do' in a very annoying accent. When these and countless other expected catchphrases were thrust upon the audience, I swear, you would hear crickets in the background where the director paused in the action expecting laughter.To give the film its chops, I will say that the production values and the special effects are top rate.  In fact, that is the only reason why the film will be a success and not end up on cable as quick as LXG.  The Wolfman was evolved to a point where watching even An American Werewolf in London might now finally seem dated.  And it was more 21st century to see Dracula turn into a six-foot bat instead of a flying rodent that we were used to in the old Bela Legosi films.This movie is however critic proof.  Fans of the genre have been awaiting it with bated breath and the 2004 summer film fleet is now aligned and firing with this early entry.   It is just too bad that they couldn't have done more or in looked at previous attempts and done less.  If Daredevil and Electra fighting Bullseye and The Kingpin were a benchmark, Universal should have taken a page from this lesson to learn that more sometimes isn't always better.All this said, I am developing a script for Pee Wee Herman vs. the Star Wars Jawa's that I hope you buy into next year.",4,0,0,9 May 2004
Collateral," Another feather in Mann's cap
","There are few directors that I would consider to have a resume that is flawless. Not Steven Spielberg (sorry, Hook and Always jump off the page too quickly. Not Ridley Scott (1492 and Legend bring back nightmares) and even the great Stanley Kubrick had his Eyes Wide Shut. However, there are a few directors who have yet to have that career back step due to a colossal misjudgment. Michael Mann is one of those directors.He might not be a household recollection, but with credits including Heat, The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans and now Collateral under his legacy belt, it is only a matter of time.Collateral stars Tom Cruise as Vincent. We first meet Vincent in an airport when he discreetly exchanges briefcases with another unsavory character. Vincent is not the Tom Cruise that we have come to know. Here, the character has gray hair and a matching beard. He wears a gray suit and his eyes look locked-in to his objective. We first meet Max (Jamie Foxx) in his cab as he picks up fares and shares dreams of an island getaway. Max is a 12-year veteran of the Los Angeles' taxi force and can ramble off directions, streets and ETA's quicker than most of us can name our own family members. He has dreams of starting up his own limousine fleet and the night had started like any other.Max and Vincent both meet innocently enough. Vincent is looking for a ride, and Max just became available. Vincent reveals that he has five stops to make and offers Max $600 to rent his services for the evening. Although against company policy, Max accepts the more than gracious offer, and an evening rampage is then born.At their first stop, Max is minding his own business when a body falls on the roof of his car from a 4th floor window. Max's emotional confusion over the event is tempered by the calm demeanor of the now reappearing Vincent. In but a few moments, Max puts the pieces of the murdering puzzle together and realizes that he has been driving a killer to his prey. This realization transforms Max into a victim who is essentially kidnapped and forced to drive from kill to kill until the evening's work is complete. The movie then follows the travels of the two participants as investigators and feds try and get a jump ahead of the contracted killer and as Max tries desperately to free himself from his abetting actions. On paper, the storyline might not jump out and bite you like a Discovery Channel shark attack, but in the hands of director Mann, this movie sizzles with action and with as much mood as I have seen on screen since Kill Bill Vol. 2. Tom Cruise continues to take on roles that are completely opposite from his preceding film vehicle, and as contract killer Vincent, he is a force to be reckoned. His fast draw hands and his ruthless and unemotional attachment to his victims would give Hannibal Lector cause to write him fan mail. When two street thugs take Vincent's briefcase from the cab, his resolve is quick and decisive, leaving both men dead, one being shot as Vincent is already walking back to the taxi and focusing on the jobs still to be carried out. As educated as he is implacable, Vincent justifies his actions to Max by comparing Rwandan villagers who were slaughtered to his one take down of a known criminal and how our Western lack of physical reaction to the news of tens of thousands being wiped out in other countries makes us a form of hypocrite. Ying to his yang, Max is the conflicted 'good guy'. He is pressured without a successful exit strategy into helping Vincent on his evening killing spree and when efforts to escape fail, he beings to inquire as to the mechanisms behind the killers intentions in almost an innocent way of passing the time while taking ones mind of his criminal involvement. Max eventually reaches a breaking point that is a believable reaction to a night of extraordinary circumstances and soon after he finds himself as the only one between Vincent and the final target. Watching Cruise and Foxx banter and bludgeon, I could not imagine any other pairing to successful pull this thriller off as believable. Early reports were that Russell Crowe and Adam Sandler were both in consideration for Vincent and Max, and thinking of those two behemoths of Hollywood in the similar circumstances, just doesn't work with even the most inventive imaginations.Much like Mann's Heat, there are great face-to-face confrontations, secondary characters that don't become overbearing and actions sequences that explode in Dolby Surround Sound. Where Heat had the DeNiro/Pacino talk in the restaurant, a cheating wife and a shootout that still stands as one of the best ever filmed, Collateral counters with a great conversation between Vincent and a jazz bar owner, cops who don't smother the screen in their revelations and a shoot out in an L.A. hot spot that had the audience squirm towards the edge of their seats. In a summer that has been better than expected with an eclectic group of theatrical entries, Collateral might just be the best of them all. Thrill seekers can revel in that week over week, we have bettered the format in bringing The Bourne Supremacy, The Manchurian Candidate and now Collateral to our local playhouses. Collateral in all likelihood will not garnish any trophy consideration come the end of the year, but that is not due to the product. Mann has cast perfectly and directed through an evening in Los Angeles with the precision of a brain surgeon. And now that Collateral has offered him another feather for his cap, I think he can finally make that Indian headdress that other directors can only dream of.",8,39,70,8 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Potter just keeps getting better
","I don't read books.  I have mentioned this in reviews before, but every time a Harry Potter movie comes out, I feel embarrassed that I am one of what seems only a handful of people that have never cracked open a J.K. Rowling experience.It's not that I can't read or that I don't have the time, it's just that I find it simpler to have a director tell me a story on the screen from their interpretation of a book or screenplay.  The best books and stories are usually purchased by Hollywood anyways, so by the time I finally get to the back cover of any purchase, the movie version would be nearing the end of its multiplex run anyhow.So when I went to see the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I immediately felt out of place with the young pre-teen kids in the line both in front and behind telling their parental guides what their best parts of the book were and what scenes they are most looking forward too.  They seemed to be foaming at the mouth in anticipation while my lone spark of interest was the fact that the reins of the franchise had been turned over to director Alfonso Cuaron who also is accredited with the wonderfully, 2003 Oscar nominated film Y Tu Mama Tambien.  Such a curious choice as the first two Potter films had been incredibly successful under the watchful eye of Chris Columbus who was known for his family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone.  Cauron, on the other hand, has a much darker side as evidenced in the sexually driven Tambien and his 1998 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations.  I was then peaked when it was announced that Cauron vision would be applied to the next Potter film and thus my standing in line with a group of rabid looking kids who I had no doubt will cheer as soon as the theatre lights dim.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third of the Potter books totaling five and this installment follows the growing Potter gang as Harry is faced with the threat of convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison and is expected to try and kill our young Potter as per his former masters' wishes. Of course, the books and movies would not be as popular as what they are if it wasn't for an array of magic, special effects, and mythical creatures and maybe even a plot twist or two to help keep us on our toes.  And rest assured, this adaptation has them all.  The special effects are top rate including the Dementors who are sent to protect Hogwart's and the tree outside the school, that later plays a big part in the climax, is both fascinating and provides some humor.  There is a creature in the film that is a cross between a horse and a bird that was too Harryhausen for my tastes, but I am sure it made for a wonderful character in the book and therefore I can't complain that they kept things consistent.Pretty much every actor in Britain plays a role in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Emma Thompson, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon (who steps into the role vacated due to the death of Richard Harris), and the Julies (Christie and Walters) all show up on screen at one time or another.  I guess anyone that couldn't get work in Altman's Gosford Park joined a collective and put their efforts into this film.  Gary Oldman is one of the newbees to the set and he does the best with what is a very limited and understated part.  The three main characters of Potter and his two best friends are back, and it will be interesting to see them in the next Potter movie as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are now in their mid-teens and no longer the young wizards they were just three years ago.It's always hard when it comes to the third film of a franchise.  Return of the Jedi is more of an embarrassment each time I watch it (sorry, Ewoks), The Lord of the Rings and the Matrix third entries also were a disappointment.  But the Potter films seem to be getting stronger each time. I will no doubt agree that the change of director this time round was instrumental in bringing a darker storyline to the table, but to continue to better your achievements in both story and screen presentation each time is a feat not often achieved.     Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a delight.  It was a children's movie with adult situations and effects and the story was complex enough to even have me wondering to myself how it was all going to tie in together in the end.  Now, I won't pick up the next book just because of my recommendation here, but I will ensure I have a ticket for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire due out in 2005.www.gregsrants.com",7,0,1,6 June 2004
Saw III," Not as good as Saw, but it does have its moments
","It was about an hour after the screening of Saw II when myself and two friends were sitting around a small bar table drinking already a ridiculous amount of alcohol when I asked the question. 'What was the last third installment of a horror movie that was any good?' No sooner did the question flow off my intoxicated tongue when the music in the bar stopped playing, all patrons and workers froze in their tracks and crickets could be heard from the field across the road. My friends sat there stunned like a Gibson in squad car headlights.So we started rambling off films each one met with uproarious laughter or headshaking acknowledgement. The Exorcist III, Friday the 13th (in 3-D no less), Jaws III, Poltergeist III, Halloween III. No, no, no, no, no. Oh the hours that have been wasted watching such trash (although, we all admitted that if any of these flicks showed up on our telly late at night, we would probably sit transfixed through the end credits).Granted, not all was bad. Nightmare on Elm Street : Dream Warriors was alright. Alien III was also given a passing grade. But in all, we agreed how hard it is to maintain the same levels of fright, awe and excitement three times over.That brings me to Saw III, the latest installment of the very popular franchise that follows the infamous Jigsaw killer as he puts his prey through some of the most elaborate killing challenges ever put on screen.Saw III starts where the last Saw left off (note therefore that it is of great value that you have seen the first two films if you want to be able to follow the bouncing ball). Without giving too much away, there is a darkened bathroom, a police detective chained to the wall and a saw. Think you know what's coming? You're wrong.The opening sequence of Saw III sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is gory. It is loud. It is graphic and it will make you wonder if you would have the same passion to do whatever it takes to release yourself from your shackles.Barely able to take a breath from the opening, we are on an express train of squirm. As we watch through squinted eyes, a man is tortured with flesh piercing chains (take that Hellraiser) and a woman gets a breast reduction with a contraption so elaborate, Einstein himself wouldn't have been able to make it if you spotted him the supplies and blueprints.It was after this flesh ripping horror that I finally got a chance to dip into my popcorn vat for some air. While I sucked the salt and butter off the popped kernels, we get reintroduced to the Jigsaw killer (once again played by Tobin Bell). We are reminded of the frailness of his physical state and the reliance he started in Saw II with Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Jigsaw is dying, and there is an hour of film run time left.The movie then shifts gears and follows two separate story lines. One has the father of son who was killed when hit by a car being given the Jigsaw opportunity to save himself or exact vengeance upon those involved with his sons death and the trial for the accused driver.The second story line follows a doctor named Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) who has been kidnapped by Amanda and outfitted with a contraption that if Jigsaw's heart was to stop, her head with also cease to remain on her shoulders. The movie then shutters back and forth between the two unlucky participants in the Jigsaw game of terror leading to an ending that will bring all parties together and will seriously (SPOILER ALERT!) affect how Saw IV might evolve.Saw III did something that the first two only hinted at. It brings the blood and violence level to new highs. Where Saw and Saw II had more implied guts and gore, Saw III goes for the jugular. Throats are slit, people are ripped to shreds and actors are shot and covered in pig entrails. Joy oh joy oh joy! By the time we get to an unlucky man who is literally twist to death, we have seen enough bones and blood that I wondered how the movie escaped the dreaded NC-17 rating.Horror films should be enjoyed without expectations, so as I normally do in my horror reviews, I will leave most of the details of the plot and death to be experienced by the paying customer.But what I can report is that for those of you who have been disappointed time and time again by the rehashed installments of horror franchises, Saw III sits on the side of Nightmare on Elm Street : Dream Warriors and Scream III. It is a worthy approach to continuing the story of our favorite characters while providing us with all the red soaked gunk that we pay to see every Halloween.www.robertsreviews.com",6,5,9,28 October 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Too many people to satisfy leave the film hollow
","Hollywood has provided us with some magical movie pairings in its history. Martin and Lewis, Astaire and Rogers, Lemmon and Mattheu, to name a few. Our familiarities with these actors and their various characters have resulted in the multitudes lining up around the block for the next installment of their mischievous adventures.Usually, the pairings are put together because they are perceived as nice people who are bettered by someone of equal stature. Though Lewis was the laughs and Martin was the straight guy, the two worked in harmony and were never better than when teamed together. But a funny thing started happening in Hollywood in the new millennium. People started accepting opposites teamed together to fight against a common cause. Blade II had our title character teaming up with the same vampires that so craved his demise and in X-Men 2, our heroes joined forces with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as they fought an ever-growing threat to their existence. (*Please don't e-mail me to belabor the point that films such as Frankenstein vs. The Wolfman have been around before color film was even created). With audiences launching these new duos into number one weekend box office stature, it was no surprise to see two baddies in Freddy and Jason do battle in 2003. With a $100 million in box office bonanza and the opening of the door to other potential bad vs. badder films I thought it wouldn't be long before we saw Godzilla vs. King Kong, Critters vs. Gremlins or Bigfoot vs. Jaws (granted, I will agree that the logistics behind getting a land creature and a water dweller to stand battle are remote, but one can dare to dream). But maybe the easiest to team in the present future were the Predator and Alien from their respective titled films. These two creatures had already fought in their own comic book series, did battle in trading cards, and threatened to wreak havoc on the world in a video game. Their progression to a duel on the big screen was therefore inevitable. For those of you who may require an Extra-Terrestrial Reminder 101 course, Predator is the same creature that had the two Governors (Schwarzenegger of California and Ventura of Minnesota) do battle with the beast with dental issues in 1987. He has brute strength, the ability to become invisible and an arsenal of weaponry that can slice, dice and skin someone quicker than any of the late night infomercial giveaways. Mr. Predator has appeared on our planet twice, once thwarted by Arnold and another by Danny Glover in the 1990 sequel. Alien has had a better string of sequential life. Well known directors such as Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher have all collaborated in bringing Sigourney Weaver's nightmare to the screen no less than four times.The Aliens are a fast multiplying populous that use humans as hosts for their breeding. They have a razor sharp teeth and a jaw that jettisons like a cobra towards their intended prey. Their blood is a form of acid and their hunt is usually carried out in packs. The world has been lucky to avert bringing these creatures to our earth. Lucky that is, until now.Alien vs. Predator is an interesting film concept for many reasons. Maybe most interesting is that the two title colliders don't speak -which can be both a blessing and a curse with these kinds of films. In order to try and explain the plot and to add some kind of pleasurable facials to the screen, director Paul W.S. Anderson constructed a story that included humans intertwined with the blood feud between these two species (to be true, the comic book stories had humans as go-betweens as well). As outlined, an archaeological expedition in the Antarctica reveals a pyramid that might date back eons before that of those in Egypt. As the team of explorers, led by moneybags Charles 'Bishop' Weyland (Lance Henricksen), enter the fortress, they soon find themselves between three young Predators that have come to the temple as a sort of training exercise to earn their right to Predatorhood (?). It's kind of like when Luke Skywalker went to Dagobah to be trained by Yoda, 'cept in this instance, there isn't a cute green puppet who talks like Kermit on helium. Instead, we have creatures that fight to the death, rip each other apart and although they don't have facial expressions, we get the immediate impression that these two species really don't like each other.The second interesting detail in the film is like the Freddy and Jason clash, audiences will be split in who they root for. This isn't as clean cut as say Spider-Man vs. Doctor Octopus. Legions of fans have followed the career paths of both alien creatures and alliances have been formed. Although my audience tended to vouch more for Predator than Alien, I figured that it is probably a 50-50 split down the middle if Angus Reid ever decided to waste more of our country's time. So now comes the easy part, the review. Alien vs. Predator, for all it's history, back story and the length of time it has taken to get these two faves in front of a mass audience, fails on so many levels. To critique everything that is wrong with the film would take much more of your (and my) time than should be licensed, so I'll just try and hit on the major pitfalls.First was the violence factor. Movie aficionados can correct me if I am wrong, but the Alien and Predator franchises always carried the R-rating due to their excessive violence and bloodletting. 20th Century Fox, I suppose, has tried so hard to get a wider audience into the de-clenching of wallets and purses everywhere, that the film has forgone the way of the thrill and the spill and instead left us with a lot of jumping, running, yelling and off screen violence (I guess creatures killing creatures is less of a issue for the MPAA than having humans as the major dietary choice).Secondly, I have to say that for the dialogue that the humans do get to orate, they do so with humorous results, and this is not intended as a good thing. Where their predecessors had such cool lines as 'I ain't got time to bleed' and 'Stay away from her you BITCH!', AVP offers 'You're one ugly motherf****r'. Yawn. I was conflicted when thinking of how to evaluate the performance of the human actors in AVP. Although pivotal to the story they were not really developed. They help us understand the situation, (ex. 1,000 miles from help on the most isolated place on earth) but when one of the crew happens to read a few wall scribbles and utters 'This is all starting to make sense', I wondered how could anyone in their right mind be able to put these pieces together so quickly. That said, the humans are primarily a food or carnage source, so maybe I should take it easier on them.Where I can take pot shots is with director Paul W.S. Anderson. Responsible for also the story and screenplay, Anderson just doesn't seem to be the right person to helm such an anticipated franchise, and maybe his lack of experience is exactly why almost every scene in the movie I thought was a rip off from another. The recruitment scenes reminded me of Sphere, the setting reminded me of John Carpenter's The Thing and the ending reminded me of every horror film ever made that wants to spin off to another sequel. Although I have no doubts that Anderson probably loved both these characters, I think he tried to tread too much water and keep the comic book people happy and the respective fans of both aliens. This, therefore he didn't allow for a lot of wiggle room in terms of story and Anderson doesn't go out on a limb and favor one species over another. Too bad. But it was maybe the camera work that was the most disappointing (that and the fact they are in the Antarctica and no one seems cold nor has breath that is visible due to the temperature). The shots are all jumpy and the scenes of the two creatures doing battle is so quickly edited that I had a hard time figuring out who was on top of whom. You would think that with all the money they saved by having nary a familiar face in the cast (Lance, notwithstanding), that they could have used their budget to give us a battle scene that we would remember rather than one hard to follow.So now that it is said and done, I am thankful that I don't have to read on movie message boards everywhere that this movie was in some sort of a development phase. However, now that it is completed, I do question how much development actually went into the film and it's final result.",4,0,0,16 August 2004
Meet the Fockers," As good as the first
","Back in October 2000, Jay Roach teamed Ben Stiller with Robert DeNiro in the comedy Meet the Parents. The film was about an average man with an anything but average name that meets his girlfriend's parents for the first time. Expectations for the film were optimistic. DeNiro had hit box office gold teaming with Billy Crystal in Analyze This just one year previous and Dreamworks was hoping that their $50 million plus investment on a family comedy would pay dividends. No one expected the $330 million worldwide gross.So, since money makes studio executives dance un-rhythmically around the Hollywood sign, it is no surprise that four years later we are again following the misadventures of Gaylord Focker (Stiller) in the apt titled sequel, Meet the Fockers. Now in order to have a successful comedic sequel there are a few details on the checklist that need to be addressed:Number one: Get the original stars back for a second go-round. Check. This didn't seem to be much of a problem other than finding scheduling time amongst two of the hardest actors in Hollywood (DeNiro has been in 9 movies since Meet the Parents and Stiller 10 with 6 titles this year alone). The rest of the cast including Pam and Dina Byrnes (Teri Polo and Bylthe Danner) are thrust so far into the background, that they could have been replaced without notice. As an added bonus, director Jay Roach (Austin Powers) was back behind the camera, thus making the first day of production like a reunion rather than a workday.Number two: Advance the story. Check. At the conclusion of Meet the Parents, Focker was able to convince Jack Byrnes (DeNiro) of his sincerity towards his daughter  even though he had to go through a lie detector test to prove it. This time around, Focker introduces the two families before the wedding. Now that he has gained acceptance, can his parents win them over?Number Three: Try to strengthen the appeal with new characters, preferably Hollywood talent. Check. In what was a real coo for the producers, the Fockers are played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand who along with DeNiro make this movie the showcase for award winning performers. Also joining the cast is a small baby that speaks sign language and a dog that will be the fodder to the Byrnes' toilet flushing cat.And finally, number Four: Don't sway too far from what made the first film successful. Check. Unfortunately this is a check I wish the film didn't receive. The comparisons to the original are too blatant. The lie detector kit that was so prominent in the first installment is now a truth serum in the second. A pick-up football game replaces the water volleyball game and both pictures felt the need to show us bloody noses for some reason. About the only recurring idea that worked as fresh as the original is the variations of how to use Fockers in a sentence. Most of the laughs in Meet the Fockers comes from the parental Fockers. Although it is always good to see Streisand back on screen again (especially in a role that she seems to be having the time of her life portraying), it is Hoffman's weird and wacky Bernie Focker that elevates the film to any status. Whether he is lying in front of a mobile home in protest, wiping charcoal under his eyes before the final play of a football match or explaining how the toilets work, Hoffman hasn't been this good or this funny since Wag the Dog back in 1997. But where the strength of the bit/new characters are refreshing, it is the recurring characters and the unnecessary sub-plots that really divert this movie from rising above the crowd. And when Jack is able to go to his CIA office hidden below the bed in the mobile home, the movie sinks to a level of almost slapstick when the rest of the movie around it is better than that. Meet the Fockers was a welcome breath of fresh comedy during the final month of the year when heavy hitting drama vow for our spending dollar. Just don't to be expecting sidesplitting laughter. Instead, you will get a warm, meaningless comedy that will without doubt produce a trilogy if the movie makes anywhere close to the money of the first.

Seabiscuit," Inspiring story about the little guy that could
","When it comes to sports themed movies, there are more strikeouts than touchdowns.  For every Field of Dreams, there is a Major League; for every Brian's Song, there is an Unnecessary Roughness; and for every Slap Shot, there is a Slap Shot II.  So when Director Gary Ross (Pleasantville) seeked $80 million plus to bring the true story of a race horse in the 1930's to the big screen, studio execs must have been squirming in their seats like a Buffalo Bills fan before the SuperBowl.  There was some comfort to be taken in the casting of Toby McGuire (hot off his Spider-man) role and Chris Cooper, who nabbed an Academy Award for his role in last year's Adaptation, playing both jockey Red Pollard and horse trainer Tom Smith, respectively, but would a mass audience have a desire to see a story about a Depression era horse?  The answer is a simply, yes.Seabiscuit is one of those rare films that tells a remarkable story of achievement against the odds and does so with precision writing, extraordinary camera work and just the right dose of character quirkiness and humor to keep the audience rooting for the underdog.Seabiscuit begins with the obligatory introduction of characters.  Red is introduced as a hotheaded young man who has a knack with race horses, but as jockey's go, he is probably about 2-feet too tall for the job.  Tom Smith is a countryman who has a sheer admiration for animals, and soon, both men meet stoic Charles Howard (played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges), who buys the underachieving horse Seabiscuit and employs the help of Red and Tom in efforts to turn the horse into a competitor.  And boy, do they ever!It doesn't take long before Seabiscuit is setting records at the local racing track and seeing the marketing possibilities, the ever-opportunist Charles Howard sets his sights on a race with the Triple Crown winner in eastern America named War Admiral.   After repeated dismisses, the owners of War Admiral finally agree to a match race on their terms, but a freak accident breaking the leg of Red Pollard leaves the race in jeopardy. But as if Red knew that someday a movie would be made of his achievements and life decisions, Pollard requests that the race proceed with an adversary jockey at the reins, and history was now in the making.Seabiscuit is one of those unique sports themed, character driven movies that really works, and can be appreciated by anyone - even those that know nothing of the sport or have never attended a race.  Director Gary Ross keeps things simple and uses constant voice-overs to keep the audience in tune with what was happening in the world around them at the time of Seabiscuits rise to stardom.  The camera work during the individual races scenes are astounding and audiences will feel like they are on the track with the jockey's racing Seabiscuit to the finish line.But what is most surprising about the film is that the horse is really a secondary character.  Seabiscuit is filled with warm and rich performances from everyone involved, most notably the supporting turn for William H. Macy who plays Tick Tock McLaughlin, the host of the racing journal.  Macy's character brings great laughter and energy, and it is in excellent contrast to Jeff Bridges' character that is more mature and in constant mourning over the death of his young son years earlier.With the screenplay also written by Gary Ross, he had an incredible story to work with.  There is the loss of a child, the revelation that Red is actually blind in one eye, the triumphant victory at Pimlico, and the subsequent injury and return to glory for America's favorite horse and jockey, all packed neatly in under two hours.Seabiscuit captivated audiences in the summer of 2003 for the tune of a $120 million domestic gross.  Surrounded by loud over-bearing summer entries, people clamored to see a move about a horse that was too small, a jockey that was too big, a trainer that was too old and an owner that was too dumb to know the difference.  Big thumbs up.",8,0,0,23 December 2003
28 Days Later...," Eerie!
","Imagine this.  You wake up in a hospital after an accident and no one is around.  No people, no nurses, no one.  You pull the tubes from your forearms and pay little attention to the room's door which has been barricaded.  You stumble into the hospital lobby, and again, no people.  You walk out onto the usual busy streets of the metropolis and there is a deafening quietness.  You see cars abandoned on the road and money is flying through the air like pollen on a windy day.  Again, no people.  You walk into a church and see piles of bodies piled one on top of each other rotting in a disgusting stench.  You see everything, but signs of life. Imagine.28 Days Later's protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) finds himself in this very position after waking up from a car accident only to find that a virus spread by monkey's infected with rage' has overcome the city.Crafted by Trainspotting director Danny Boyle on a budget of only $8 million dollars, 28 Days Later became 2003's Blair Witch Project wherein word of mouth spread quickly that this was the' scary movie to see this summer, and audiences spilled out $10 million on opening week-end on-way to an impressive $45 million haul.The film itself is not entirely original.  A virus spreads making zombie like creatures out of anyone who is contaminated with their blood, and a group of non-infected individuals fight with mighty arsenals to defeat the ravaging brood.  Scary, huh.The story follows Jim as he tries to adapt to his new environment and look for additional signs of controlled life and hope.  Along the way, Jim buddies up with a female survivor and later with a father and his young daughter who are safely protected in a high rise apartment building.  After hearing a broadcast over a transistor radio, the group goes out in search for others, fighting zombies and the disease at every stop.It is when they reach the army base that the movie begins to slip a little into familiar and unfortunate genre clichés.  Although heavily armed and secure in their location, the new family unit begins to fight amongst themselves and soon they are addressing their animal desires for sex and dominance.   It's hard to believe that when they are all that is left in the world they would sacrifice some for the pleasure of others. 
But let's give credit where it is due.  Although lacking in premise originality, the film is generally entertaining due largely in part to the eeriness of the films backdrop of roads and cities completely vacant of any moving person or object.  And where as most zombie films seem to have creatures crawling out of their graves, 28 Days Later gives us a realistic story as to how the disease originated and how it could spread so quickly.I guess what ultimately makes 28 Days Later so scary is how believable the notion of a disease wiping out all of humanity could occur.  Look no further than Mad Cow Disease, AIDS or SARS in the last couple of years and you wonder how close to this reality we might actually be.  Scary indeed.",7,1,2,5 February 2004
It Follows," Unique
","Unique. That is the word that first comes to mind after a screening of  David Robert Mitchell's It Follows which has now shown twice to  accepting audiences at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.  It Follows is the story about a sexually transmitted haunting. Let me  repeat that sentence so that in sinks in a little bit. It Follows is  the story about a sexually transmitted haunting. The haunting is all  too real for teenager Jay (Maika Monroe). After a brief sexual  encounter with a new boyfriend, Jay is haunted by ghosts that only she  can see. Their intentions are not clear, but an opening scene of a  disfigured young girl on the beach reveals to the audience that the  ghosts are violently inclined.  The carrier that inflicted Jay with the haunting reveals to her and her  inner circle that the ghosts will be relentless until they kill Jay. He  goes on to disclose that the ghosts can only walk to their prey. So if  you can run, drive or speed away from them it might buy you minutes,  hours or even days until they catch up. The only way to pass on the  haunting is to have sex with another and this knowledge torments Jay  while intriguing the two male suitors that are part of her friendship  ring.  Whether Jay can pass on the hauntings enough so that she herself is  safe and whether her friends will play a part in her survival is the  crux of the film that hearkens back to the glory years of horror where  blood and guts were not paraded out in gore porn glory.  Director David Robert Mitchell confidently maintains the integrity of  the story without the lure of upping the body count for the purpose of  appeasing a microwave horror generation that wants its blood and wants  it thick.  In fact, the body count is so low in It Follows that a leper can count  them on one hand. This lack of blood and guts however only adds to the  atmosphere that is thick and complimented by one of the best musical  scores for a horror film that we have relished since the early John  Carpenter years.  The idea is truly original and its execution is brilliant in its  simplicity. An experiment which attempts to destroy the ghost reminded  us slightly of 1981's The Entity (in which Barbara Hershey was raped by  a sexually abusive spirit) but It Follows maintains its originality to  the end.  In a Hollywood world where horror films are stereotypically deformed  serial killers who randomly kill high school students on the brink of  sexual revelation, It Follows is a breath of fresh air that is worthy  of a high recommendation. Unique indeed.",8,141,281,10 September 2014
JFK," One of the Best of the 1990's
","It was with 1991's JFK that director Oliver Stone began to show us his true directing style.  Whereas Platoon and even Born on the 4th of July were mainstream-by-the-unwritten-rules kind of filmmaking, JFK began to show both a directing and editing style that would become his benchmark years later. With dramatic moments intercut with images such as racehorse hoofs churning up dirt or close-ups of coffee swilling in a cup, Stone began offering films that were a jolt to the senses. 	 JFK was also the first of the Presidential entries into his filmography (Nixon and the executive produced The Day Reagan Was Shot), and follows the investigation of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and the suspicious circumstances  surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas 1963.Garrison is played by Kevin Costner, a year removed from his breakout directorial debut, Dances With Wolves, and follows the DA as he re-opens the case questioning the findings of the Warren Commission three years later. Leading a team that includes actors Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight and Jay O. Sanders, Garrison tracks down old eye-witnesses and follows leads left behind by the F.B.I., in hopes of finding the conspiracy that he feels so passionately has been covered up.  Along his odyssey, Garrison meets various degrees of opposition and soon fears for the safety of his team and family in hopes of uncovering the truth. 
JFK was filmed at the height of Stone's popularity and that can be seen on how many famous faces lined up for a role  no matter how small or trivial  in this 3 hour epic.  Just glancing at the cast listing and you will see names like Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones just to name a handful.  They are paraded out in rapid fire style and range from quick cameos to larger plot point characters.  Stone does well to manage the various egos that were involved and keep the story on track, undistracted from the ever present star power.The screenplay for JFK was taken from various sources including Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison.  Coupled with various liberties by screenwriters Oliver Stone and Zachery Sklar, the film ventures down various possibilities as to the mastermind behind the plot including the C.I.A., Cubans & even the Vice President.  With all the assumptions and suggestions put forth by the director, Stone achieves the goal of leaving the audience with a notion that there were too many possibilities as to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and was nothing more than the patsy' he professed. 
The courtroom scenes near the conclusion of the film are riveting entertainment and offer edge of your seat conclusions as the facts pour into the audiences lap for interpretation.  Stone flashes between actual footage and court scene descriptions to fill the final 45 minutes with a recap of the information obtained by their various sources.  Not until A Few Good Men did a courtroom scene offer such drama and tension.JFK was also a political statement for Stone.  Vocal through the late 80's and early 90's on the government and the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, you can tell by watching JFK that Stone would believe anything but the fact the government's findings may be correct.  This however does not take away from the impact of JFK, but does lead to some interesting discussion at the end of the film.   Labeled by many as one of the best films of the 1990's, JFK is a treat for film goers, conspiracy theorists and even  to some extent  historians, and should not be missed.  Being nominated for 8 Academy Awards and winning two is a testament to this masterpiece.",9,3,16,15 February 2004
Insidious," Creepy, eerie fun
","When it comes to horror directors, there are only a handful of them out  there that produce consistent quality. There is Eli Roth, but his  resume is still in its infancy (Cabin Fever, Hostel and Hostel II).  There are the Spierig brothers who brought us Daybreakers and the  Undead, and Rob Zombie who has the Halloween franchise under his belt.  But again, each are still fairly new and are still trying to experiment  with the genre to find their niche.  Then there's James Wan. Saw, Dead Silence and Death Sentence are were  shot with Wan behind the camera and Saw's II, IV, VI and the new Saw  3-D were all executive produced by the budding horror star.  For the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, James Wan brought his  new film Insidious to the masses in what was a generally crowd pleasing  tale of a family and their fight against evil spirits.   The film opens with the introduction to the family. Josh and Renai  (Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne) head a family of three children with their  eldest being Dalton (Ty Simpkins) at an approximate age of around 10.  The family has just moved into a new house and are still in the stages  of unpacking when strange things begin to occur. Things begin to move  around the house and noises can be heard in rooms where the children  sleep. One night, Dalton goes investigating in the attic and falls and  bumps his head. The next morning, Dalton falls into a comatose state.  The family takes Dalton to the hospital, but doctors are dumbfounded as  to why Dalton is not responsive. Months later, the situation has not  improved and Dalton is back at home where he is tended to by his mother  and a day nurse. But unexplained things continue to occur in the house.  Doors open and images of ghosts are seen by Renai. But when a red blood  handprint shows up on Dalton's bed sheet, the family moves in fear that  their house is haunted.  Their new home brings them no less troubles and we learn that it is  their son that is haunted, not the house. An expert and two  scientists/assistants run tests and reveal to the family that Dalton  can astral project himself and he has done so and lost himself in a  place known as The Further. Now, with the help of the psychic and  Josh's comparable abilities to project, they attempt to find Dalton and  rescue him from a ghastly hoofed tormentor that wants to use Dalton's  human body for evil.  The comparisons between Insidious and 1982's Poltergeist are too  comparable to ignore. Both films have a haunted child. Both have a  psychic and assistants who have weird gadgets in an attempt to capture  evidence of the unknown. And both films employ a solution wherein a  parent must travel inside the spirit world to find their child.   The first two thirds of Insidious have great scares and moments of  spine-tingling suspense. Wan didn't want to use normal conventions in  the film so there are no cats jumping out of closets or images  appearing in bathroom mirror reflections when someone tries to put  their toothbrush back in the medicine cabinet.   Instead, the scares from the experiences with the family. Think of it  as Paranormal Activity shot with multiple cameras and with a budget.  Some of the scenes were downright frightening like when the psychic  sees the face of the evil spirit (which looks like Darth Maul) hissing  at her behind Josh's head.  But in the final acts, Insidious could not keep pace with the momentum  of the first half and we lose a little of the eeriness when Josh enters  The Further and dry ice and ghosts become the setting. The creature  which has abducted Dalton has great powers and strength, but we are to  believe that he uses cheap, breakable chains to entrap his victim? And  when the creature does get screen time, he is hardly as scary as the  description and flash images we had leading to his formal introduction.  Still, Insidious delivers the goods enough to be a recommendation. A  strong recommendation. Wan knows how to manipulate an audience and  doesn't try to bite of the hand that feeds him. He puts humor in all  the right places and doesn't dumb things down too much for the genre  loving audience. There was a lot about the final 20 minutes that could  have used tweaking (and please tell me there was a better ending for  the film that will show up on the DVD), but still, I challenge you not  to be creeped out by events leading to the final chapters. Seriously, I  dare you.",7,39,75,16 September 2010
Ghost Rider," Average Comic Book Adaptation
","Fantastic Four. X-Men. Spider-Man. Superman. Daredevil. Batman. Hellboy. The Hulk.The past few years Hollywood has dipped their money grabbing hands into the comic book hero cookie jar and have pulled out pure chocolate chip glory. From the more popular and well known characters such as Spider-Man to the obscure independent titles like Constantine and Spawn, it seems like every month a new title is being released to the masses. And due to the built-in audience these characters bring with them like traveling luggage, it almost guarantees the studio a strong opening week-end no matter how good or inferior the product.This month's release is Marvel Comic's Ghost Rider which stars Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage as the Johnny Blaze by day  Ghost Rider by night crime fighter.Ghost Rider might be a little more obscure for the casual comic book character fan so let me get you caught up to speed on the skeletal hot-head.Johnny Blaze was a young hot shot motorcycle stunt man with his father when he makes a deal to sell his soul to the devil, Mephistopheles (played in the film by Peter Fonda) in an effort to save his fathers life. Johnny later finds that the deal has more side effects than prescription medicine for hair loss. For 'in the darkness, in the presence of evil, the Rider takes over', transforming Blaze into a skeletal beast with bones and skull afire that rides a hell bent pimped out motorcycle that would give the guys on American Chopper an erection.The evil villain in the film is none other than Blackheart (Wes Bentley), son of Mephistopheles, who looks to overpower his father and turn our world into a hell on earth. Think of it as if someone from Hell was a designer on Trading Spaces.In an effort to bring his bleak and death sucking vision to us unassuming humans, Blackheart solicits the aide of three interesting but otherwise useless supernatural beings representing the elements of earth, wind and fire (Great! Now I can't get Let's Groove outta me head!).Of course, complicating matters is Blaze's old flame Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). Simpson is now a local reporter and she and her cleavage (which I might add should have their own listing in the credits as they transfixed my eyes more than any of the characters that graced the films running time) just happen to be executing a bit on Johnny Blaze when things start to go the way of Hades. As this is a comic book movie, there is no doubt that Roxanne will be used against our flaming skull hero in some manner before the story comes to a close and director Mark Steven Johnson who went from Simon Birch to Daredevil and now Ghost Rider, does nothing to deviate from this formulaic plan.When the sum of all its parts are calculated and reviewed, Ghost Rider barely gets by with a recommendation. Maybe if the film was pre-Spider-man and X-Men, the film might have been more interesting and inventive, but with such a paved path already laid, Ghost Rider feels like you are walking barefoot on cobblestone.One of the main successes of any superhero fantasy comes in the form of the villains and it is with these characters that Ghost Rider falls short. Don't get me wrong, the villains are all fascinating and some might even argue terrifying, but they are beat so easily by the Ghost Rider that you don't get a chance to even recognize their powers before they are sent back to wherever it is these beings go after being defeated. I don't think they collectively had a page of lined script before each one is individually eliminated.That leaves the Blackheart character that is the least interesting and terrifying of the bunch. Wes Bentely looked more like some kind of character from a Dawn of the Dead Saturday Night Live sketch than he did a menacing Lord of the Underworld.Ghost Rider did have its good points though. Some of the special effects were well done (I do mean 'some' as others seemed too cheesy to be enjoyed) and the camp is played out like Snakes on a Plane from last year where the dialogue and situations are so-bad-its-good.Nicolas Cage  who was such a huge fan of the comic that he got a Ghost Rider tattoo years before even being considered for the role  looks as if he is having as much fun as a root canal recipient in the lead role. Maybe he should have taken a lesson from Halle Berry who is another Oscar winning actor that looked embarrassed when donning the leather tights for the Superhero film Catwoman.This leaves Ghost Rider in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall product from a comic book character film production. It is certainly higher than The Punisher and Elektra, but a far cry from the superior X-Men and Spider-Man franchises.www.robertsreviews.com",5,1,2,17 February 2007
Hellboy," Ho-hum boy
","While watching Guillermo del Toro's new film Hellboy, it was easy to see the influence of preceding superhero films in the past five years, specifically the success of Spider-Man in 2002.  Spider-man was a commercial success and critics praised the film for its mix of action and the backdrop of an outcast yearning for the love of a friend.  Hellboy looks to have taken much of that script and morphed it into a darker, more sinister type of adventure.  In a paragraph, Hellboy is a creature spawned from a portal opened by Nazi's in 1944.  He is then raised by humans and released from his underground dwellings to fight the evil unleashed upon mankind.  So when the Nazi's conjure up wickedness yet again in 2004, Hellboy and the other freaks of the Department of the Paranormal are all that stands between Armageddon and human survival.  There is a lot going for Hellboy.  First and foremost is the remarkable casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  Perlman is no stranger to being outfitted in latex and costume having starred as Vincent in the television hit Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's.  In fact, his role choices of Blade II, The Island of Dr. Moreau and Star Trek: Nemesis, might not have you immediately recognize him if you met him on a street corner.  Only in action films playing the bad guy (Romeo is Bleeding, Alien Resurrection) do we ever get the see the true mug of this behemoth.   Second notch of the belt has to be director del Toro.  Previous helmer of such Blade II and the Devil's Backbone, del Toro has proven to be a successful storyteller when the subject matter is dark and sinister. 
Third is the interesting Dark Horse comic book character that the movie surrounds.  Hellboy doesn't have the human secret identity where a pair of donned glasses trick everyone into believing there could be no commonality between the geek and the hero.  Hellboy doesn't have that luxury.  He is a giant amongst humans with red skin, shaved down horns protruding from his forehead and a tail hidden only by his fashionable trench coat.  He chomps on cigars and blatantly goes against his father's wishes.  In short, he is the anti-Peter Parker.  But for all the pros, there are quite a number of cons in Hellboy.  First and foremost being the running time.  At 133 minutes, I could not remember a film where I watched so many scenes that I thought should have hit the cutting room floor.  I felt as if del Toro thought he might not get a green light for a sequel, so he decided instead to make a long movie that should have been sniped by about 45 minutes.  Between lining up for tickets and popcorn and then sitting through countless commercials and trailers, I was exhausted before the 2+ hour movie even began.  Maybe I was in a bad mood, but I really hadn't counted on spending my entire afternoon to watch a summer-fare type flick.Also holding back Hellboy from my long term memory banks were the routine special effects.  Routine I say because there is nothing new here.  Hellboy jumping from building to building was done in Spider-man.  The return to ashes demise of the creatures was too similar to the death of vampires in the Blade franchise.  And the creature effects on a whole reminded me of what Rick Moranis transformed into in Ghostbusters.  So although I won't go as far as to say that the special effects weren't well done, they have just all been done before.Lastly, I didn't buy the love story.  As mentioned, I thought this was a cheap way of trying to copy what made Spider-man so appealing, and it just didn't work.  Hellboy and his devil looking sneers and the innocent eyelash bashing of Selma Blair's Liz Sherman.  Plllee-eze!On a whole for every plus, there was a negative which probably makes sense based on my rating of **1/2 stars.  The powers of the freaks' were interesting including the David Hyde Pierce voiced Abe Sapien, who can see into the past and eats rotten eggs, but the character of Jeffery Tambor was completely unnecessary and uneven.  The humor too was hit and miss.  Hellboy fires off more quips that Clint Eastwood did in The Rookie and only about half of them hit the mark.  In all, I give Hellboy a small recommendation.  I wouldn't stand in line for a great deal of time, nor would I expect too much out of a comic book adaptation, but if you go in with the right frame of mind, you may walk out thinking you got your money's worth.  Me, I couldn't help but think of all the promise I saw in the Hellboy trailers.  It looked to be an action filled adventure with a smart ass hero who is outcast by society. Instead, I got a film that was just long, sometimes confusing and now a forethought, was only slightly better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

The Incredibles," Valiant, but off the Pixar mark
","Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life. Heard of them? Well you don't need to have kids to have a strong recollection of these computer-animated gems. The fact that all four of them are in the Top-100 grossing domestic films of all-time prove that there is both an audience and a lucrative back end for the studio's to keep pumping these out with some regularity. In fact, while the four earlier mentioned titles represent films from Pixar Studio's and Disney, other animation sects like Dreamworks (which has given us both Shrek films) and Fox Studio (Ice Age) have jumped on the bandwagon. No less than eight computer animated feature films are in the top 100-grossers of all-time. It's a statistic that can't be overlooked. And now with the new Disney/Pixar release of The Incredibles, it won't be long before The Sound of Music (1965) falls down a rung to number 101. The Incredibles is the sixth film to be produced through the rocky relationship between the Disney and Pixar studio's, and although this film has its moments, it can also be accredited as the weakest to date. A mixture of The Fantastic Four, Get Smart, James Bond and the X-Men franchise in animated form, writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) brings us the story of a superhero family that goes into the hero-protection program after a series of lawsuits cost the city too much money to enlist or endorse their services. Promising to keep their powers a secret and never again perform super heroic duties, they are given new identities, jobs and a suburban life that is made even more monotonous by the fact that they could be saving lives or flying the skies like the glory days of yesteryear.It is with their everyday lives that the movie has its sharpest moments. Seeing Mr. Incredible and his hulking size squeezed into an office cubicle and dealing with an interfering boss and needy customers was a subdued delight and much more interesting than when he dons the costume and begins again to fight crime. Watching the children try and contain their powers in the pressures of everyday school life was also an interesting premise that I had hoped the film would have spent more time. However, it is the action that puts bums in seats and although the story might not be as interesting, there is plenty of fast paced chaos to keep the average moviegoer from napping. After Mr. Incredible gets a taste of the heroic life he once lead its like a shark to blood or me to a buffet table. He just can't get enough. However, all this is done behind the back of his wife and family who only come to the revelation of his alter-life when he is captured by the evil Syndrome (voiced by Mallrats' Jason Lee). In an effort to find their father and ultimately rescue mankind, the family lead by Elasticgirl and including children who posses the powers of speed (Dash) and invisibility and force fields (Violet) set out to a remote island that would have Ian Fleming grinning from ear to ear to take on the bad guys.The action sequences on the island are quite clever and include razor cutting ships that chase the children through the forest and enough machine gun fire to earn Pixar their first ever PG rating. But for all the menace and action that ensues, the villain might be the major problem with this venture. As the evil Syndrome, the tyrant doesn't really have any character and comes off as boring and as plain as any enemy of James Bond during the Timothy Dalton years. As the focal point to the second half of the movie, this weak development holds the film down like an anchor in a canoe.But, for all its small issues, this is still a valued effort. Pixar is still a force to be reckoned with and the movie will made bags and bags of money. It's just that put side-by-side against its peers, it just doesn't have the same humor, originality and tempo. Too bad.www.gregsrants.com",6,2,5,8 November 2004
Wimbledon," Average, to a fault
","To further alienate myself from my target audience, I will admit that I am not much of a 'tennis' guy. Football, baseball, hockey and even golf all take up precious hours not spent watching the latest theatrical release and I don't seem to want to spend the time to get to know the sport that is as rich in tradition as any of the above. That is not to say that I don't understand or respect the court. Throw me names like Agassi, McEnroe or Sampras and I would be able to pick them out of a line-up. But the sport on a whole just doesn't turn my crank. Surprising then my anticipation for the new tennis themed film Wimbledon hitting theaters this weekend. Maybe it was the catchy tagline 'Wimbledon Serves Love'. Maybe it was the marketing which promoted the film as 'From the creators of Notting Hill' or maybe I'm so shallow that seeing Kristin Dunst running around a court in a short skirt that had me check my local listings. Who knows? Wimbledon is story developing around two tennis stars whose careers could not be heading in more opposite directions. Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) was once ranked 11th , but at the ripe old age of thirty-one, now stands at 157th on the players standings. As Wimbledon begins, he announces his retirement to an uninterested room of reporters. However, then Colt meets Lizzie Bradbury (Kristin Dunst).Lizzie is an up-and-comer American superstar. Her looks and play have the paparazzi following her like a celebrity. She is a favorite to win the tournament and she comes to England with an over-protective father that will try everything within his power to keep his daughters mind focused on the task at hand. When Lizzie meets Colt sparks fly immediately. Colt has accidentally walked into Lizzie's hotel suite where she is taking a shower. She walks out and smiles with that glow and dimple bearing grin that Dunst should paten. Their awkwardness over the situation is overshadowed by the unmistakable chemistry the two lead actors emit towards each other. Before the first serve, the two are engaging in couple activities. They are running from the press, hiding from her father and ignoring that they are on the eve of the most prestigious tennis event in any calendar year. The relationship's effects on the two are also varied. Lizzie falls to some bad luck early, while Colt surprises even himself with his steady play and a win streak that puts him into the finals. Convinced that their relationship is the reason for both of their fates, Dunst runs back to her father's arms while Colt stays in pursuit in an attempt to express his true feelings for the American superstar. The ending is to be left to the paying public, but let's face it, happy endings sell. If I could use one word to sum up my Wimbledon experience, it would be 'nice'. Wimbledon is a 'nice' film. Never daring or overly interesting, it keeps pace by switching between the excitement of the court action and the heat of the romance on the streets of London. Never offending, but never taking any chances to be different from the hundreds of other films that try to be average either, Wimbledon satisfies the palate but gives us nothing to remember on the way home. Maybe it is because for every pro there is a con to counter its progression.For every bit of humor like the brother who likes to bet against his sibling with the local bookies, there is the lack of humor in the agent played by Jon Favreau  a role that was written for its expected humorous output. For every close up angled view of a tennis match that let's you feel like you're truly at the game, there is a love story that continues to spark without setting the screen afire. One minus one plus one minus one equals average. And with a tag line and an opening credit scene that made me chuckle just in its simplicity, I find that a fault indeed.www.gregsrants.com",5,2,4,20 September 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Move over Raging Bull, you have a sister
","With the release of Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood has officially entered the sweepstakes for golden statues in 2005. Already nominated for Five Golden Globes including Best Picture and Director, expect the same when the Academy announces its category finalists on January 25.Written by Paul Haggis (a Canadian that has spent most of his time writing for the small screen) and based on stories by longtime boxing manager and cutman Jerry Boyd (under the pen name, F.X Toole), the story surrounds boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes on a persistent female boxer named Maggie (Hilary Swank).The start of the film is textbook storytelling and you can see most of what is going to happen before it unfolds. Dunn is the reclusive manager that is reluctant to take on a female as a client believing that boxing is a sport for the Y-Chromosome's only - 'Girlie tough is not tough enough' he mutters.But when a career waitress with aspirations of making a name for herself in the ring shows up in the gym with a work ethic that continues long after the lights are turned out, Dunn becomes intrigued by her determination and takes her under his tutelage.It is here that that Million Dollar Baby begins to separate itself from the formulaic. Although there is plenty of ringside action, the movie somehow is able to have the gruesome boxing matches as only a back drop for what becomes a budding relationship between the two leads. Match after match and day after day, Dunn and Maggie become closer, sharing each others hopes and dreams and inviting each to share in family experiences.But just when you think you have figured out where Million Dollar Baby is headed, it takes a sharp turn. One of those turns that we as critics like to see but hate when we have to review. The last third of the movie revolves around the consequences and situations of the device and it would be a disservice to anyone reading a review to have it revealed.So, we focus on the positives of the first two-thirds. The wonderful understated performance by Morgan Freeman (together again with Eastwood after 1991's, Unforgiven), as former boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, for example. Freeman is the driving force of the growing relationship between the two leads and pushes the story along with such subtlety and effortless motion as to put him also in line for a golden nomination.Even the tiny little subplots work well to create atmosphere and build character. The characters that participate in daily training at Dunn's gym, Maggie's trailer-living family and Dunn's estranged daughter are all crafted masterfully by director Eastwood into telling a moving story that will haunt you long after you leave the theatre.Client Eastwood struck gold with Mystic River last year and hits the same vein with Million Dollar Baby. It is his 25th attempt behind the camera and he just gets better with experience (I will forgive him for Bloodwork, but barely). I think this new career high for Eastwood is because he simply 'gets it'. He understands that life doesn't have happy endings all the time. That movies don't have to put an aging acting icon together romantically with a young budding actress in order to get audiences to take notice. And that movies can just end when they should, not all wrapped in a bow.It is surprising for this writer how boxing movies have had more critical success than any other sporting depiction despite the fact that the sport itself is in a time of mistrust, arguable decisions and no true heavyweight icon like Ali and Foreman were back in its heyday. But when you take the Rocky's, Raging Bull's and now Million Dollar Baby into account you can argue that not even the Field of Dreams, Pride of the Yankees and Eight Men Out's can stand as consistently proud of their output.That noted, Million Dollar Baby stands alone. Alone as a boxing movie. Alone as a character study, and alone as maybe the best film of 2004.www.gregsrants.com",9,2,4,9 January 2005
Garden State," One of the best of 2004
","I have never seen an entire episode of Scrubs. I couldn't even tell you what night it is on. I have seen snippets here and there as I flipped between likely inferior programming, but could I name a character or an actor that has donned a white coat on the NBC sitcom  no.So when I heard that a new small budgeted film called Garden State was doing the festival circuit and was written/directed and starred Zach Braff the lead of the above mentioned sitcom, I was not exactly circling the release date on my desktop calendar. But as the months went by since its premiere at Sundance, I could no longer ignore what critics were crowning as '..a hilarious and heartfelt ode to twentysomething angst' (Peter Travers  Rolling Stone), and a 'quirky sweet coming of age tale' (Boston Herald), I could ignore it no further.Well, this reaffirms what critics are good for. They try and steer you from wasting your money on box office fodder and every once and a while, they use the power of print to help bring attention to a small gem that requires help to get recognized for what it deserves. Garden State tells the story of Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), a heavily medicated 26-year old that moved from Jersey to California to break into show business. Most known for playing a 'retard' in a football themed movie, Andrew comes back home after receiving a message that his mother has passed away in a freak drowning accident. We don't know much about Andrew as he enters an environment he has shunned for 10 years, but like any good character driven story, the layers of the onion keep peeling and peeling revealing a very complex and tormented youth.Most of the first quarter of the movie spends time with Andrew's re-introduction to old friends and family. They are about as quirky as they come without being too off the wall or unbelievable - barely. Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) is a gravedigger who steals jewelry from the dead before burial. Mark's mother is a mixed bag of nuts that is dating a knight from a dinner show production who wears his armor to breakfast, and Andrew's father is a doctor and psychiatrist that prescribed his son countless drugs in the ten years since their last encounter in efforts to stymie any emotion Andrew might feel from an unfortunate accident that occurred when he was nine. As Andrew explores life off drugs and with his reacquainted friends, he is brought into a world of extremes where each experience is fascinating and revealing and where each newly introduced character is more eccentric than the last. Whether it is the rich former schoolmate who made a fortune selling his idea for silent Velcro or a couple that lives on a makeshift boat on the edge of a geological phenomena, not since The Royal Tenenbaums have there been such charismatic oddballs that are all so lovable and yet peculiar. So when Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) it is no surprise that she fits right into his world. Sam is an admitted liar who lives in a house as distinctive as her nature. The living room is like a scientific experiment gone awry with hamster tunnels erected like a full sized Lego castle. A Christmas tree still stands in the corner some three seasons removed from the holidays, and the backyard has a pet cemetery with countless makeshift headstones. But none of this seems out of place. Writer/Director Braff does a great job in his debut in keeping everything out of the ordinary almost, well, ordinary. Maybe it was the opening chapters where we see Andrew modeling a shirt made from leftover bathroom fabric or hearing a horrendous rendition of Three Times A Lady being sung at his mother's funeral. For whatever the situation, Braff uses dry humor and intelligent wit to keep us interested in people I can only hope not many of us can relate to. When Andrew awakens in a strange house to see a knight carrying a jug of milk, it is explained to us in reasonable terms without belaboring the point or trying to squeeze every last bit of humor from one cameo. Maybe most surprising in his first attempt behind the big screen camera is how he developed and maintained great chemistry between Andrew and Sam. As he becomes more and more normal while recovering from his drug induced monotony, Sam becomes the complex character and we can understand why the two of them would find comfort and attraction in the other. I don't know what Braff has next on his agenda, but like more seasoned directors Wes Anderson and Alexander Payne he has an incredible knack of bring a world that I can (thankfully) only appreciate in the confines of a crowded unlit room and his next film will undoubtedly be circled on my calendar as a 'what to watch for'. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing Garden State again. It has quietly nosed its way into being one of the best of films of 2004 and I we shouldn't ignore the shoulder pushing we get from the critics headlines to go see it.",8,0,1,22 August 2004
Shrek 2," A classic
","If admitting you were wrong makes you a bigger man, then by the end of this review I should be as big as an ogre. It all started when I miscalculated the popularity of the Shrek sequel and I showed up to the theatre a mere 20 minutes before show time. The first, second, third and fourth showings were sold out and I was now left with the option of purchasing a ticket for a film that was not starting for almost two hours.Reluctantly, I purchased a ticket and headed to the concession stand where I waited another 30 minutes before getting served (no complaints, I was in no hurry). So I sauntered to the theatre where screaming children and patient parents were in abundance. Now one hour plus before the start of the film, I was searching for a seat. My second mistake was thinking that Shrek 2 was going to follow the typical sequel rules and provide me with entertainment that would be just below the standard set by the first film. Rarely are sequels anything but drawn out attempts to try and recapture the energy and success of the first, and Hollywood has rarely seemed to figure this out. By the time Shrek 2 was over my faith had been restored (if only temporarily).Shrek 2 picks up where Shrek left off. Shrek and Fiona are now married and the movie commences with their honeymoon and an invitation back to Far Far Away Land to meet Fiona's parents. The only problem is that the king and queen think their daughter has been rescued by Prince Charming and not a green, rude, slob of an ogre. Their uncomfortability at the inaugural first meeting was reminiscent of many of my first dinners with previous dating partners' parents without the food stabbing or talking donkey. The movie then follows the king as he tries to scuttle the marriage and Shrek as he tries to atone for his behavior with his new bride. Shrek 2 does take longer to get its gears in motion than the first, but when Shrek, Donkey and Fiona hit Far Far Away Land, the movie picks up a frantic pace of pop culture references and movie spoofs that will leave your head spinning trying to keep up. Whether it is the city streets that don spoofs of The Gap and Burger King or the hilarious take of Mission Impossible 2 with Pinocchio as Tom Cruise, the film goes for the gusto and doesn't allow you to catch your breath before throwing you another 'where-do-I-know-that-from'.And if the first Shrek brought us a few familiar fairy tale characters like the Big Bad Wolf and Three Blind Mice, Shrek 2 sees that ante and raises it two-fold. Blink and you might not see the Wicked Witch at the Poison Apple Bar or The Little Mermaid being eaten by a shark. Each cartoon character will remind you of your bedtime stories as a child and you will leave the theatre with cheeks that hurt from the 90-minute grin on your face.My third and fourth mistakes were thinking that Eddie Murphy had lost his talent to be funny and that Shrek 2 could not replace the interesting evil Lord Farquaad of Duloc. Eddie has not made me laugh in more than 10 years and his with a filmography that includes The Adventures of Pluto Nash and I Spy, his agent should be shot and tossed overboard for securing deals for Mr. Murphy to star in such underachieving vehicles. Donkey (Murphy) provides some of the best lines in the film and his overt jealously over the affection of Shrek with the character voiced by Antonio Bandares made me forget that I was watching computer-generated animals instead of real people.The villains in Shrek 2 an upgrade from the first film and that says plenty considering the energy and comedic indifference brought to the screen by John Lithgow's Farquaad brought us in 2001. Maybe that is because there are so many evildoers in Shrek 2 that it keeps it more interesting. The Fairy Godmother and her son Prince Charming are the obvious scoundrels in part two, but the king and even the Bandares' Puss In Boots start out as characters out for their own agenda until struck with a sense of responsibility. The combination of these characters all at one time after the misunderstood Shrek ups the ante of the evil quotient, and the audience is better of because of it.For all my misconceptions before the film even began that were corrected, I will concur that the movie is not perfect. There is a musical number with the Fairy Godmother and talking furniture that was hard to understand and too Disney for a film that tries to be better than anything that Studio has generated over the past decade. And maybe it was just me, but I thought the animation was not as crisp as the first. Maybe we have been spoiled by computer-generated films like Monsters Inc. and Ice Age over the last few years and we don't marvel at the complexity of the images any more. But I remember sitting almost jaw-agape in Shrek while I thought some of the images in Shrek 2 were unclear or lacked detail.But maybe I am just nitpicking. For Shrek 2 is one of the best films of the year even if we haven't reached the half way mark yet. The finale of the film set to Bonnie Tyler's Holding Out For A Hero was rousing and the most entertaining sequence I have seen an animated film as yet. As Shrek jumps from the Ghostbusters inspired Gingerbread Man, I almost cheered out loud along with my youthful audience in support of our unexpecting warrior. And anything that can excite me is definitely worth noting.A classic.",8,0,0,27 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Better with each viewing
","Every once and while I hear a critic or film-goer utter the words `The movie just gets better and better with every viewing'.  Really?  What so magically transformed it into becoming a much better film?  Was the screen at the theatre too big for you and the movie played better on your 19-inch television?  Maybe you have bladder problems and the DVD version allows you to pause for all bathroom breaks?  Or maybe you were too busy smooching with a blind date that you missed most of the good parts and had to watch the film several times over before you really knew what the whole thing was about.Whichever way, I have always raised an eyebrow when someone blurts out that phrase.  That is, until I caught myself doing the same thing this week.The movie was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and I had seen it in the theatre upon its 2003 release.  At that midnight showing I marveled at how Quentin Tarantino weaved yet another masterful story onto the big screen with humor, violence and imagery so unforgettable that you left the multiplex salivating like a Pavlovian dog after shock therapy.  So, when it came out on DVD, of course, I immediately ran to the front of the line for my copy.  I knew that the wife wouldn't be interested, so I waited for the proper moment, put it in the player and sat back to be wowed once more.  What I didn't expect was that my second experience was even better than the first, and the third was better than the second.You see, Tarantino films have always been like a multi-layered onion. There is so much going on at any given time, that you could watch a film over and over and get something new out of it.  Take Pulp Fiction for example. There were so many plot developments that jump from present to future in their timelines that second viewings allowed you to focus on a specific character or an event.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 is no different.Uma Thurman is `the Bride', codename Black Mamba.  She was a member of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DIVAS)', but on her wedding day, she is brutally gunned down by the other members of the team and their leader, Bill.  Four years later, she awakes from her coma and quickly sets out to avenge the massacre of her wedding party and unborn child.  There are five names on the Bride's list, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and the ringleader, Bill (David Carradine).  One by one, the Bride intends to visit and extract revenge, and unfortunately, a two hour movie just isn't enough time for payback.First on the list is O-Ren Ishii (not first in the movie however).  The Bride travels to Japan where she attempts to use her newly crafted sword to engage Ishii.  All that stands in her way are countless bodyguards in Kato masks with swords and chains.  When she was done, 57 people were on the floor bleeding profusely where limbs used to be.Next on the list was Vernita Green (who is known by three separate names in the film).  A homemaker who has since given up the life of the DIVAS and settled down with her 4-year old child, the Bride confronts her and again comes out victorious.That just leaves three to go and Volume 2 to extract revenge.
Tarantino seems to be having the time of his life with Kill Bill.  He switches formats in a blink of an eye and has elongated scenes in black and white or animated violent cartoons.  He spills life with gallons of blood being poured onto our screen just like in the martial arts movies of yesteryear.  Tarantino's sick sense of humor is also rampant and borderline out of control in Vol. 1.  Whether it was the Pussy Wagon that the Bride drives around town or the intermission both her and Vernita need to take from trying to kill each other once the school bus drops off her child, I can visualize Quentin behind the camera with a grin on his face like that of a five year old at Christmas.  Even the first thing you read before the film begins, `Death is a dish best served cold..Old Klingon proverb' sets the tone.But aside from all the violence and format changes, there is so much to explore and enjoy in Kill Bill Vol. 1, that I don't know when I will be done watch it and adding to my praise.  The third viewing, I focused simply on the music (Tarantino has a real knack for soundtracks - Stealer's Wheel, anyone?), and was amazed at all the adrenaline flowing sound bytes he incorporated.  Even Darryl Hannah's whistling in the hospital had me tapping my finger on the arm rest.The fourth viewing, I focused on all the comparison references that Tarantino made towards other films he has directed.  Vernita hates her code name (Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs), the Bride makes a hand gesture to represent square (Uma again in Pulp Fiction), Michael Parks plays a sheriff as he did in the Tarantino writ From Dusk 'Til Dawn.  A film lover could have a field day just amassing all the small details that Tarantino has thrown our way without explanation.If there was but one complaint about Vol. 1 is that it leaves us hanging like no film has done since Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  I yearn to a point of giving up my children for the second installment to becoming viewing available.  And you may note that I didn't put Kill Bill at the top of my list for 2003, but give me three or four more showings and I would expect nothing less.",9,0,1,13 April 2004
World Trade Center," Gripping and Powerful, but no masterpiece
","Gripping. Powerful. Masterpiece.These are just three of the words that have appeared in various print reviews for the new September 11th themed movie World Trade Centre.Directed by Oliver Stone (Platoon, Nixon) and starring Nicholas Cage (Matchstick Men), the movie chronicles the hours of two Port Authority Police Officers that were trapped in the rubble of the fallen World Trade Centre after the terrorist attacks on that fateful morning in 2001.The film's opening is quiet. It starts quietly at 3:59AM on September 11th, 2001. There is no rousing or exasperated musical score as Stone discretely takes us through Manhattan as we see people on their way to work as the two towers stand tall in the backdrop. In just five minutes we are reminded of the beauty of the buildings. The majestic presence they had over the New York skyline, and the horrors that were just hours away.As we meet the families of John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) we can anticipate the hardship and emotional tear jerking that will ensue. John is a father of four young children while Will has a wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is five month pregnant with their baby daughter.These two unknowing heroes gear up for work as if it were another day and are called soon after to the Towers to help with the evacuations. As they prepare emergency supplies and head for the elevator, we hear the crackling and buckling of concrete and metal that snaps in Dolby around the theatre. We know what is going to happen, but the audience was still on the edge of its seat until the inevitable occurs.To Stone's credit, he does not show the two towers crumbling down except for on the televisions in many background shots. Instead, he gives us a first hand impression as to what it must have been like for these two police officers who were in the lobby and running towards the elevator shaft for safety.The next hour and forty five minutes are split between listening to the two trapped men try and struggle to stay awake and alive while their families cope with not knowing their ultimate fate.World Trade Centre comes on the cusp of the five year anniversary of the event. Some media types claim that America may not yet be ready to relive the experiences of the day that will live in infamy. But World Trade Centre is a movie of hope. Of American's working together to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble. It is the American spirit lived through the world's eyes on that fateful summers day.It is Stone that should get the most credit here. He has constructed a movie that on paper doesn't seem that deep. Two men are trapped nearly the whole movie and cannot move while other rescue workers go about their jobs to find survivors. Without the backdrop of the event, the movie would never have been made as having Nicholas Cage's face being the only thing that can be seen on screen for ¾ of the film would be considered a waste of talent otherwise.But Stone casually brings the actual and/or inspired events of the two men gracefully to the screen while still projecting a sense of urgency and fear for those sitting at home awaiting word about their loved ones.Call me insensitive, but World Trade Centre and United 93 would make a great double bill. Both are based on real accounts of the day and both show the chaos of the situation and how normal men rose to the occasion to become heroes.Gripping? Yes. Powerful? Certainly. But a Masterpiece? No. World Trade Centre does have its flaws and in the Stone filmography, it ranks behind both Platoon and JFK. But the movie is above average. It will have you relive moments that are still as clear as the day they occurred. And you will watch again one more time in fear for the lives of those lost that day.www.robertsreviews.com",7,6,14,10 August 2006
Prisoners," Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic
","Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com",8,155,214,9 September 2013
Big Fish," Forrest Gump in fantasy land - spoilers
","Viewing a Tim Burton film comes with a set of expectations.  After such visually stunning films as Bettlejuice, Sleepy Hollow and Pee-wee's Big Adventure, one can be sure that the price of admission will bring awkward camera angels, strangely colored film sets and, usually, a cast of characters as weird as anything this side of Twin Peaks. Enter Big Fish, Burton's 2003 theatrical entry that that comes with a tag line `An adventure as big as life itself'.   Screened for the first time ever in Toronto, Canada, the audience clapped ecstatically when we were told of the film we were about to view, but the elation paled in comparison to the response of those in attendance at the conclusion of the film.  To put in simply, this is the best film Tim Burton has ever put on screen.  In fact, I'll be anxiously waiting in the next couple of months to see if Burton will get his just reward and be garnished with Oscar nominations for Best Director and even Best Film.The story surrounds the final days of Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor as both the old and young Bloom respectively), and the strained relationship he has with his son, William, played with remarkable ease by Billy Crudup.  William had not spoken to his father for three years, the result of growing animosity at the tales his father used to pass as truth to family and friends.  But soon, his father's cancer brings William to his bedside and the stories of Edward's youth are told one more time. There are stories about a giant that terrorized a town and then is lead to the circus.  A story about two twins who help Edward escape China during World War II.  A story about a witch with a glass eye that can tell a man's fate and a story about falling in love and doing anything to find the woman of your dreams. There are countless more stories, but you can catch them in the trailers, so I won't waste your time here.  Besides, the more you look into the film the better off you are.  It's a beautiful ensemble piece that tugs at your heart strings (sorry for being sappy) while telling a remarkable story about the life of a man who believes he is too big for his small town and sets out on an adventure of a lifetime.The movie reminded me of Forrest Gump set in a fantasy world of endless possibilities and wonderment.  Even the music style was similar to Gump's in that as the decades changed through the stories, so did the soundtrack.  We would hear Elvis during wartime, and the Allman Brothers in the 70's.Burton regular Danny Elfman is back scoring the film, but shows a restraint never heard before in this director's filmography.  All work magically enhancing the visual style of production designer Dennis Gassner (Road to Perdition, Miller's Crossing).It's been a while since Burton brought to the screen a story of such love and affection and to do so, he surrounded himself with old friends.  Danny DeVito (Batman Returns) plays Amos a half man half wolf circus ringleader and Helena Bonham Carter (Planet of the Apes) plays Jenny is woman from a paradise city who longs to love Edward.  Look closely and you will also enjoy Jessica Lange, Steve Buscemi and Robert Guillaume.  But through all its star power, it is a quirky giant named Karl, played by Matthew McGrory, that steals every scene he is in.  Not since the towering impression that Andre the Giant had in The Princess Bride, has there been such a loveable, awkward character.The conclusion of the film can be seen miles before it arrives, but it is no less powerful.  William is at his father's bedside when he passes away, but not before he himself finally comes to believe and finish the fantasy with a story of his own making.  The scene where Edward is brought to the riverside to the cheers of all the mystical characters we are introduced to along his travels, put a lump into many of the audiences' throats and even I pretended to wipe a yawn tear from my cheek.  Maybe it just caught us by surprise since we are not used to seeing a Burton film have such warmth and heart, but nonetheless, Burton moved us like an earthquake of devastating proportions.For you true Burtonians, don't worry.  For all the mush there is also more humor than his last ten films combined.  In fact, I noticed about an hour in that my cheeks were hurting from the constant perma-smile brought through the many fun characters and situations throughout Edward's life story.I don't know what kind of an audience Big Fish might reel in.  Those who like love stories, might be turned off by the wacky visual styles, and those that love Burton's way of turning the ordinary into the extraordinary, might be reserved due to its overwhelming tug at the heartstrings.  However, don't be fooled by the trailers, and don't be turned off by a director trying to forget his last film.  Big Fish is a marvel and out of the 200 plus films I have had the pleasure of viewing this year, ranks above the rest.",10,1,2,9 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman's mind is a world of its own!
","You can add Charlie Kaufman to the list of names (Hitler, Michael Jackson, Dr. Seuss) of people whom I never want to know what is going on in their own little minds.  As a writer of such films as Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Human Nature, the slant to which this man sees the world is somewhat out of my comprehension.  Not that that's a bad thing.   David Cronenberg continues to create films that amaze me with his vivid worlds of sex, violence and the creatures that lurk in the dark, but I rarely turn down an opportunity to sit through one of his fascinating films.   Now, Charlie Kaufman releases his next foray into his mind-bending filmography with the poorly titled Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The film, stars Jim Carrey as Joel, a mild mannered polite recluse that meats Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free spirited outgoing alcoholic.  The two spark up a relationship that lasts the better part of a year before falling apart over a harsh conversation one cold New York day. 
Wanting to rid herself of the memory of Joel, Clementine seeks the help of Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson) who operates a business that can remove selected memories in a non-surgical operation that is on-line with a night of heavy drinking'.  The movie then follows Joel as he fights the procedure and tries to retain the happier times within the relationship. 
The story as summarized in a single paragraph seems simple enough, but with the Kaufman slant thrown in, it is anything but.  We watch as Joel plays cat and mouse with the doctors working on his unconscious body and watch as Joel's dreams and memories begin to disappear before him.  Imagine your most vivid memory then conceive of it being stripped from you element by element. The house you were in disappears. The people you knew vaporize. Fences or other structures dissolve as if never erected.  You run, but it follows you relentlessly erasing everything one step behind you.  You try and hide in a suppressed memory, but the procedure is a success and soon these experiences will be nothing more than a file in a doctor's office.Exhausting.Now, throw in a few sub-plots to further mess with your mind.  There is the doctors' assistant, Patrick (Elijah Wood) who falls in love with Clementine and uses Joel's memories to woo her into a romance.  There is also the love story between Dr. Mierzwaik, his wife, his secretary (Kristin Dunst) and assistant (Mark Ruffalo) that is too complicated and quirky to reveal here. Each of these play out during the 108 minute running time and are as non-conventional ideas as any of Kaufman's work.  So, verdict time.  I am beginning to think that Charlie Kaufman might be the Martin Scorsese of our day.  See back in the 80's and 90's, Scorsese was able to get the best out of his actors and actresses and was able to provide an Oscar winning role to Paul Newman and a nomination to Sharon Stone. Anyone who can pull off this feat deserves credit.  Well, Kaufman should be no less regarded.  Catherine Keener pulled out a nomination for Being John Malkovich and Nicholas Cage was robbed of an Oscar for his duel role in Adaptation.  We can now add Jim Carrey to the list of actors that have proven their best following the written words of Mr. K.  By acting low key, without having us think he is being restrained, Carrey finally shows us the range he tried in other dramatic fare such as Man on the Moon and The Majestic.  The supporting cast, especially Dunst as the toke-smoking assistant are equally impressive.Oh yeah, the verdict.  Spotless Mind is not for all tastes, but in keeping an open frame, it might just end up on some critics best of' lists at years end.  Who wouldn't want to have a memory erased?  The loss of a pet, your most humiliating moment.  Kaufman exploits that notion and eventually shows us that each experience is there for a purpose, and good or bad, they make you what you are today.   This film challenged me into thinking of what I would dispose of within my own noggin and then further brought me to thinking as to whether I would regret the procedure.    I left the theatre without an answer, and aren't those the best kind of films of all? B+www.gregrants.com",7,1,3,22 March 2004
Saw," See-Saw?
","There are some movies that are just better when you unexpectedly find them on the television on one of those late late Friday or Saturday nights when you can't sleep. Generally, these are movies that have a few scares and thrills and probably due to the fact that you are just happy you found something other than an infomercial, you are prone to giving it a higher recommendation than had you spent a few bucks at the theatre. Movies such as From Dusk 'Till Dawn, Evil Dead II, Jacob's Ladder and Angel Heart are good examples of movies that might have been hard pressed to garnish more than a 2 ½ star rating had you not seen it with a tub of Hagan Das Ice Cream in your lap at an hour reserved for REM's. Add to the fact that movies after a certain hour also tend to scare us more than daytime horrors. My niece recently viewed The Exorcist for the first time and I surprised afterwards that the 14-year old said she had laughed her way through the experience. I later found that she watched the film with a bunch of friends in the middle of the day. Not exactly setting the mood for this type of fare to be sure.All of this came back to memory after my viewing of the new thriller Saw, out in theaters now. The movie starts with two men who wake up in an abandoned washroom with heavy chains around their ankles. In the middle of the room lies a body soaked in blood with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in another. The two men - Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) - have been drugged and take some time to realize the severity of their situation. As they begin to shake out the cobwebs, their recollection of how they may have been abducted and who may be responsible lead to a grizzly conclusion. Dr. Gordon is able to shed the most light on their circumstance. When a tape is found in each of their pockets and played on the recorder left in the dead man's hand, it is revealed that the psycho that has entrapped them wants Dr. Gordon to kill Adam with the one bullet he has left with the gun. If Dr. Gordon does not kill Adam before 6:00PM, his wife and daughter will be killed. Adam's chance of survival comes from the two hacksaws that have been left in strategically in a toilet tank. It becomes evident that whomever has put them in this situation wants them to consider cutting off their own foot in order to gain a chance at freedom. From here, Leigh Whannell's screenplay throws countless darts at the plot board in an effort to make the story plausible. In fact, for two people secluded in a warehouse washroom, there are plenty of items found that made me think of one of those video games where countless things are hidden in a room, you just have to move you cursor around to find it all. Within the few hours of their incarceration, the two find a picture of the doctor's wife and child, pictures taken by Adam the day of his capture, two cigarettes, a key, two hacksaws, a video cameraetc etc etc. And to think, I can't even find the converter most times if it falls between the sofa cushions. All of this occurs, of course, as the police try and hunt down the psycho behind the master plan. Danny Glover will be the one recognizable face as the officer who goes mad trying to bring the person known as 'Jigsaw' to justice.I suppose this movie is going to have every reviewer mentioning Se7en among its review. Saw does have many similarities. Most specifically are the lurid ways in which people are killed. Ten years ago, Se7en pushed the envelope and its legacy can be seen in any of the CSI television programs today. Saw tries to match this ingenuity by issuing in a villain that never kills anyone directly. Instead, he carefully orchestrates (to great lengths) scenarios whereas one person must kill another or put themselves at great risk in order to survive. A female has a rusty contraption on her face that will destruct in minutes unless she can get the key out of the stomach of a helpless man lying drugged on the floor; a man must climb through razor barbed wire in order to gain freedom before sealed in an underground tomb. Who thinks up this stuff?But for all its creativity, Saw still never really quiet clicks. It's as if it was trying too hard to become a trendsetter that it neglected to do anything other than find new and interesting ways of putting people in various stages of jeopardy. Danny Glover is absolutely wasted in a role that could probably have been cut from the film altogether and the conversations between our two men in peril (Elwes and Whannell) is too forced to be believed as banter between two strangers who must rely on each other to find a way out of their predicament. I am not saying that Saw is a complete waste. Shot in only 18 days, the film does have a real independent feel to it and had the script been given the same 18 days as the shooting schedule, they may have really had something here. Instead they leave us with a movie that audiences will either love, or will trying sawing off their own arms so they can release the popcorn and make a run for it.www.robertsreviews.com",5,0,1,12 November 2004
The Last Samurai," An Epic film that is not without its flaws
","While researching for this review, I again marveled at the filmography of Mr. Tom Cruise as I do with each new film to which he is attached.  Like him or hate him, you cannot neglect the fact that this actor likes to change pace and takes roles that are so different from the last.  Just look at his last five films for example.  He has portrayed a detective (Minority Report), a tormented publisher (Vanilla Sky), an inspirational speaker (Magnolia), a doctor (Eyes Wide Shut) and a sports agent (Jerry McGuire). Each role was such a departure from the last and each were successful Hollywood vehicles.  Enter Cruise's next stab at celluloid, The Last Samurai.  When I first heard that he was attempting this film, the title gave me reservations as to whether this was a misguided career move.  After all, those of us that grew up in the 80's remember Cruise more for his young pop-culture roles in films like Top Gun and Cocktail, so to think that he could divert our minds from his Risky Business role dancing in his underwear to being an American Samurai in Japan, is asking a whole lot.But the movie did have something immediately going in its favor.  Edward Zwick, who directed Glory and Legends of the Fall was at the helm and the film was co-written by John Logan who penned 2000's Oscar favorite Gladiator.  So there I was, popcorn in hand as the lights dimmed, and it didn't take long for me to get caught up in the fact based backdrop of the Japanese civil war between the Emperor's troops and the last of the samurai. The movie's plot is really quite simple.  Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war-hero in General Custards battles with the American Indians, who is recruited by the Emperor to help train his troops using new weaponry from the west (guns, cannons).  Algren agrees for a ridiculous fee, but is forced into battle before he believes his troops are ready, and they are defeated and Nathan is captured by the samurai.While a prisoner in the Samurai camp, Algren begins to respect the ways of it's people (everything they do is to perfection'), and befriends the family of one of the soldiers he killed on the battlefield.  Fall soon turns to spring, and Algren and the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe), have turned their captive-captor relationship into a mutual friendship, and when Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the Emperor and sentenced to death, Algren orchestrates an escape and the two head back to the village to begin a war strategy to fight the oncoming troops.The Last Samurai is a film that will be classified as an epic due to its exotic locations, cast of thousands, costumes, battle scenes and running time (144+ minutes).   Edward Zwick actually does a very commendable job in maintaining a story amongst all the visuals, and Tom Cruise is able to dig deep and put together a fairly convincing portrayal of a man that is torn between honor, love and responsibility.  But for all its positives, there are many flaws also.  The thought of an American riding along side the Samurai just doesn't fit right  especially in today's climate, it was just another example of America putting their nose where it doesn't belong.  The scene where Algren is beaten repeatedly by a samurai warrior and continues to rise every time he is submitted to the ground, played more like something out of a Marvel comic book rather than a real life will to show up the enemy.  The Last Samurai is a good movie despite its obvious shortfalls.  The battle scenes are visual feasts for the eyes and ears, and the, and Zwick moves things at a rather healthy pace leading up to the eventual climax.  It's not as memorable as his last war film, Glory, but The Last Samurai will still garnish a nomination or 10 when it comes time for the Academy to elect the best of 2003.And my final word goes back to you, Mr. Cruise.  Thank you for at least trying new things each time in front of the camera and not stereotyping yourself like so many of the other 80's superstars did in their careers (paging Sylvester Stallonepaging Sylvester Stallone).  Keep it up and we will forgive you for self-indulging yourself with such fare as the Mission Impossible series.",8,0,0,5 December 2003
Snowden," Overlong
","Oliver Stone has not been relevant for some time. The three time Oscar winner owned the 80's. Salvador, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Talk Radio and Wall Street were some of the best the decade had to offer and cemented his name in film history. But by 1997's U-Turn., Stone had lost his magic. His next few films, Any Given Sunday, World Trade Center, Alexander and W. were critical bombs where overlong running times seemed to only further pat the directors own back with self-indulgence. And his last two films, Savage and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps were hardly anchors in what will eventually be a career DVD boxset.Yet, when word began circulating that Stone was circling Snowden as his next film, many couldn't think of a director who would be better for the job. Based on the true events of former NSA/CIA employee Edward Snowden who became the center of equal praise and angst when he leaked thousands of classified documents to the press detailing the illegal surveillance tactics of the agencies, Stone attempts to tell the story of how Snowden eventually came to the crossroads in his life that lead him to be labelled as one of the biggest traitors in US history.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Snowden and his voice and mannerisms seem to capture the real life character to a tee. Stone based the biopic espionage thriller on books by Luke Harding and Anatoly Kucherena and switches back and forth in time between his revealing interview with Guardian reporters in 2013 to Snowden's attempts to join the military which was thwarted due to a degenerative leg injury. Snowden quickly goes from the hospital bed to the CIA and uses his cockiness and his innate ability to write code and interpret data.Under the wing of protégé Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans), Snowden quickly gets fast tracked through the ranks and travels the world in efforts of National Security. Along the way, Snowdwn meets Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) who will become his female companion traveling the globe to stand by her man even as she is kept in the dark as to exactly the job description to which Snowden is fulfilling.The film's pulse pounding moment comes when Snowden attempts to copy and extract from the secure intelligence facility, the files that when published showed to the world how surveillance works outside the confines of both US and International Law for benefits that could never be accounted. Even with the result never in doubt, Stone is able to lay the groundwork for some tense moments leading to Snowden's escape.This marks the second film in as many years where actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a real life character following his role as Phillippe Petit in Robert Zemeckis' under-appreciated The Walk. But this also marks the second time Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a real life character in movie that is inferior to the documentaries that threw both stories into the spotlight. Both Man on a Wire and last year's Oscar winner for documentary best picture, Citizenfour, were superior films than their dramatized big budget adaptations.Yet neither is the fault of the young former 3rd Rock from the Sun actor. Snowden collapses on the shoulders of director Stone who doesn't seem to care how long his films run on. Snowden clocks in at 134 minutes and it feels every bit as long as the time suggests. Watching Snowden switch from job to job/country to country is downright hard on the tushy as it is neither interesting enough to keep audiences on the edge of the seats nor important enough to keep us comfortable in the effort. Instead, the film runs out of gas long before Snowden finally determines that the information to which he is responsible must be revealed for the world to judge on merit.It is an opportunity lost. Laura Poitras' Citizenfour was far superior and clearer in its description of the facts. Stone's Snowden seems muddled in the director's inability to cut entire scenes in the editing room.And while most of the cast does a comparable job with little to actually do (including Melissa Leo, Zachery Quinto and Tom Wilkinson), Ifans and a role given to straight-to-video artist Nicholas Cage seem miscast. Woodley is good as the love interest and life partner, but is overused and we can't but think her continued screen time was Stone's attempt at giving the female audience members something in which to relate.So Snowden doesn't exactly make Oliver Stone relevant again. Nor do we think the film will ignite another firestorm over the merits of Snowden's efforts. Instead, it is a mildly interesting film that bores audiences lulling them into a hopeless want for the dates on the screen to catch up with real time.",6,17,40,11 September 2016
National Treasure," Too many clues, too few realistic outcomes
","I have the perfect idea for a film. Underneath my bed mattress, there is a stain that if you squint just right, it kinda looks like an arrow pointing to the bathroom the other side of the hall. In the bathroom there is a can of Gillette shaving cream that if you read the label, it is noted that their office is located in Boston. Go to Boston and you will quickly be reminded by everyone you bump into that the Red Sox won the World Series for the first time in almost a hundred years. They beat the St. Louis Cardinals, so our adventure would take us to the famous Gateway Arch in Missouri. Now if you consider that the Red Sox beat the Cardinals winning four straight games, it would suggest that if you stand at the Arch when the clock strikes four, then the shadow it casts will lead you to a buried treasure. Except, don't expect to find the treasure right away. While digging through underground power lines and water pipes, you will then find a chamber that hasn't been opened for hundreds of years. When you enter the chamber, you will use the Gillette shaving can and a World Series ticket to make a key that opens to another room that has a ladder that leads back to my bedroom. The final chapter will contain all the excitement as I find a five dollar bill under my bed that I obviously have no idea how it ever got there or how long it has lay in its darkened quarters.Preposterous? Yeah. Insidious? Without question. But when compared to the new Nicolas Cage film, National Treasure, it isn't that far of a stretch. In fact, pull in an A-list star, and Disney might even give you a sizable blank check and find you a director to film this confusing enigma of a film.Granted, I am well aware of the liberties I am taking but I wondered if the masterminds behind National Treasure thought the same. Their film follows the adventures of Ben Gates (Cage) whose family has been entrusted with solving an ancient riddle whose clues lead to a treasure trove of riches and artifacts. But these aren't your ordinary right-in-front-of-your-face type of clues. These are ingenious riddles that are so complicated only an incredibly intelligent history buff with remarkable problem solving and innovative skills could ever figure. Or Ben Gates. So complicated in fact, you wonder if those that had hidden the treasure had ever wanted it to be found again. Clues like the clocks time on the back of a one hundred dollar bill, a hidden pipe buried in a ships' frozen tomb and the shadow that a tower casts at an exact time on another building. Of course, as the trailers so nicely spell out for us common folk, the biggest clue remains at the back of the Declaration of Independence where an invisible map is locatednaturally. The obtaining of the map is Ben's biggest obstacle. How can you steal the Declaration of Independence? Well, thanks to his incredible ingenuity and a computer geek sidekick named Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben undertakes an elaborate plan to secure the Declaration for the purpose of his family quest. The plan will consist of going to the National Library to look at blueprints of both the building and the security devices surrounding the document, fake ID's, tapping into the security monitoring cameras, tricking the heat sensors to thinking there is a temperature variance and working on getting the document extracted during a rather convenient gala going on in the building the same evening. Of course, they could have saved themselves all the brain cramps in thinking of such complex plan and taken the approach of the other team in search of the same treasure and just taken an underground vent to the location and using a stun gun, demobilize the security and take the Declaration. But where is the fun in that?Along the way, Ben Gates is able to retain the reluctant services of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) who is in charge of keeping the Declaration safe and tags along for the wild ride to ensure the document does not in any way get damaged (except of course when she uses lemon juice to reveal the map hidden on its underside). Luckily for the crew, she is only a part time desk jockey and spends the rest of her days as some kind of stunt woman that can hang on to speeding truck doors with one hand or swing from a collapsed staircase to a safe landing platform while trying to escape from the evil Ian Howe (Sean Bean) who is also in search of the treasure if only for its monetary value. If this all sounds like it is more than the average mouthful, you are not alone. This is a movie that never tries to be smarter than it needs to be (it is Disney after all), but does throw a lot of things at you (I ducked once just having the kitchen sink miss my noggin'). It is definitely one of those movies that if you step out for more popcorn, you may not be able to piece together what has happened since you departure.Giving credit where it is due, the movie does move at a nice clip towards an ending that may be ridiculous, but at least it is no less plausible than any of the events that lead to its climax. The acting is ample with Cage giving his usual steady performance in a paycheck role and Kruger who is proving that she can hold her own amongst the big boys. Harvey Keitel pops up in a wasted role as the police agent trying to track down the missing Declaration and although it was nice to see him in something mainstream, I wish he would have passed on this particular project. National Treasure will probably open big and will no doubt be talked about for a sequel if the audiences show it any attention after its initial weekend. I was surprised that the trailer (which was one of the worst in recent memory) heralded the director Jon Turteltaub who's track record consists of just a handful of projects, but I can say that he did better with this script than say, Stephen Sommers did with any of The Mummy entries. It's just that National Treasure tries to be too much. If it shortened the amount of clues that brought them around the country and focused more on the adventure, maybe they could have an Indiana Jones for the new millennium type of series. Instead, I left the theatre feeling as I had traveled with them from clue to clue and having jet lag is no way to leave a theatre.www.gregsrants.com",4,1,2,22 November 2004
The Great Raid," The Great Raid is a Great Bore!
","Back in 1945, the 6th Ranger Battalion traveled behind enemy lines in the Philippines in an attempt to rescue over 500 American prisoners of war that had been held in captivity for three long years. The story of the soldiers in the camp and the daring true life rescue are the focal points of the new American heroes film, The Great Raid.Directed by John Dahl (Joy Ride), The Great Raid stars Law & Orders' Benjamin Bratt as Lt. Colonel Mucci who is given the assignment of planning and executing the raid at the Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp. The five days depicted in the film begin with the assembling of the troops and focuses on Captain Prince (James Franco  Spider-Man 2) who is portrayed as the brains behind the operation. Captain Prince was responsible for coming up with the military plan to be executed for the raid. We watch as he easily devises the attack while encountering minimal resistance from his commanding officers.On the other side of the fence  literally  Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes  Shakespeare in Love) is an American prisoner in charge of keeping his troops alive by providing them smuggled medicine and by maintaining order as their continued leader. Stricken with malaria, his health is deteriorating at the same time the special police move into the camp to take control. The timing couldn't be worse. The new commander of the compound has been mandated to ensure that to eradicate all prisoners now that the war is coming to a close. Their methods are horrific and the prisoners no doubt realize that the end  one way or another  is coming.With the two stories having equal play time over the first two-thirds of the movie, The Great Raid soon shifts from mellow-drama to action film as the Rangers storm the compound. The theatre rumbled as mortars were shot, machine gun fire erupted and tanks and army vehicles flipped under the shear force of their explosion. While the American's were storming the compound, the Philippine rebels were aiding in ensuring that Japanese army could not be reinforced from the other side of the river.The concluding rescue with an American force that was fighting against detection, against the odds and against time would be labeled as 'The most daring mission of our time'.So then why was I so bored while watching? Maybe it was because of all the unnecessary yarns that lead up to the final chapter. A side story of very little interest involving Connie Neilsen as Margaret Utinsky, a hospital worker who helps acquire the smuggled drugs for the ailing prisoners felt like it was in another movie altogether. Another involving a prisoner that is hell-bent on escaping even after being forewarned that any attempt would result in ten others being shot seems awkward and unmoving.Looking back on the experience, I think the makers of The Great Raid would have been better off staying with one side of the transpiring events. A story of the prisoners when expanded to feature film length would be something to leave the A&E channel at home for and likewise, giving two hours of screen time to what is such a military achievement would be equally engrossing. Instead we get a little bit of both without getting intimate to any of the characters and attaching the audience with any of the portrayals.The Great Raid has been sitting on the Miramax shelf for two years. Originally slated to be released in 2003 and then again in 2004, the films theatrical delay was a result of the much publicized Disney/Miramax split It's too bad that they didn't use the time to chisel away at needless plot points and or strengthen stereotyped military personnel depictions. At the very least they could have revamped the musical score that would even have Hans Zimmer rolling his eyes in over-wrought expression or ensured that bravado dialogue such as 'Nothing in our lives will ever be as important as this' was liquid papered out of the final draft.",4,7,38,7 August 2005
Sicario," Best Film of the Year
","Of the nearly 400 films being showcased at this year's Toronto  International Film Festival (TIFF), Denis Villeneuve's Sicario was the  one film at the top of my 'Must See' list. Having premiered at this  year's Cannes Film Festival where it went on to be nominated for the  prestigious Palme D'Or, Sicario stars Emily Blunt, Joh Brolin and  Benicio Del Toro as members of a government task force who attempt to  apprehend a villainous drug lord.   Director Denis Villeneuve is on some kind of roll. His previous films   Polytechnique, Incendies and Prisoners  were all thought provoking  character pieces offset by realistic and graphic depictions of  violence. Sicario opens with just such a scene as Blunt's Kate Macer  leads a rain on a Mexican drug house near Phoenix, Arizona and  discovers dozens of executed victims packed into the walls. Audiences  will have barely settled in their seats and scrunched on but a handful  of popcorn kernels when the shocking revelation is revealed on screen.   From here, Macer is forced to work with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and  Alejandro (Del Toro) who works as a sort of fixer on both sides of the  border. Their work leads them to drug trafficker Fausto (Julio Cesar  Cedillo) and the group then works to transport the criminal back across  the border. Their journey will be met with many obstacles with  shoot-outs at border crossings and a tense hunt and shoot inside a drug  trafficking tunnel connecting the two countries.   The focus of Sicario (which is Mexican slang for 'hitman') is clearly  on Blunt's lead character and Blunt is up to the task in being the  smartest person in the room while also being the one most left in the  dark as to the team's objectives. She will be continually conflicted by  her male peers particularly their penchant for instigating or  responding forcefully to appeared violence. The action settled between  Macer's first-hand education thrust the film forward to a very  satisfying and acceptable conclusion.   The supporting cast is equally engrossing particularly Del Toro who  will be on screen for most all of the film's most memorable shots. Del  Toro's character is clouded in mystery and unclear motives and Del Toro  gives his best performance since Traffic.  Sicario was penned by Taylor Sheridan who played Deputy Chief Hale on  FX's Sons of Anarchy. His take on the war on drugs and the violence and  human costs that surround the battle are dead on target. The realism  results in Sicario being hardly the crowd-pleaser. It is a bleak and  grim film that might just be Villeneuve's best work to date.   The photography by Roger Deakins is stunning. Expect Deakins to garnish  another Academy Award nomination for his efforts here to go with his  work on The Shawshank Redemption and Skyfall.   Also worthy of note is the music by Jóhann Jóhannsson that grabs you by  the balls while the action unfolds.   Sicario might be too bleak for Academy voters, but make no mistake of  Sicario's impact and brilliance. It was on my 'Must See' list for a  reason and did not disappoint. Easily the best film of the year so far.",9,49,98,20 September 2015
Inside Man," A rip roaring robbery riot
","When the movie trailer for Match Point starring Scarlett Johanssen starting showing up in my favorite multi-plex last year, I remember being mildly intrigued at the premise then being blown away when it was revealed at the end of the ad that the film was directed by none other than Mr. Woody Allen.Wha? Mr. 'Look at my neurotic bitching' is directing a suspense/thriller? Whoa! My interest went through the roof as I couldn't remember the last time  of ever  that I had been so surprised at the genre choice for a directors upcoming effort.Well, it happened again with the new bank heist flick, Inside Man. The trailer and ads lead me down a guessing path wherein I was spewing out guesses such as F. Gary Gray or Brett Ratner as the man behind the camera. But when the final credit revealed itself, I sat jaw agape as 'a spike lee joint' flashed upon the screen. The March 24th release date was then circled on the office calendar.Inside Man does have one marking of a Spike Lee film  Denzel Washington. The two have shared movie poster credits with films such as Malcolm X, Mo Better Blues and He Got Game. They are the black man's George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh. And that can be a very good thing.Inside Man also boasts some incredible talent in support of Mr. Training Day. Academy Award winners or nominees galore surround Denzel with names like Foster, Dafoe and Owen. Altogether, they fight for marquee supremacy while giving the viewer the biggest barge or egos since Ocean's Twelve.So the only question remaining was can all these remarkable talents join together and actually make a good film.Inside Man is a movie about a bank robbery. Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, the man behind the operation who in the opening sequences narration, lets us know that he puts together the perfect crime. His attempt to rob Case Manhattan Bank leads to Denzel's Detective Keith Fraizer being assigned as the hostage negotiator. Complicating matters and unknown to the paying customer until necessary is what exactly is being stolen. Dalton seems to have little to no interest in all the money that surrounds him in the vault and the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) seems so concerned about a personal belonging kept in the vault's safety deposit box that he employs the services of one Madeline White (Jodie Foster). Her background is never quite revealed, but what is crystal is that she is as tough as nails and has the right markers to protect the interests and reputation of Mr. Case.So the table is set. The characters are in place. Fraizer will try and talk Dalton out of killing anyone in the bank while White will try and arbitrate the negotiations and offer both sides future benefits for walking away from escalating the situation larger than the severity it has already reached.Inside Man is a better than average film with a much better than average cast. Denzel and Owen provide refreshing performances with characters that have been done before  and many times over. Their screen time together sizzles with tension and an understanding as to each others role in how the final act will play out.Foster's participation on the other hand is less impressive. Foster does her best in a limited role and definitely commands a presence on the screen, but you can't help but feel that she is a bit wasted when the final product is revealed and the end credits roll.But maybe most impressive is the directing of Spike Lee. We are used to his heavy handed films that are steep with racial tension. And although Inside Man does have its moments of racial indifference (most particularly a comedic breaking scene with a bank employee who's turbin has been taken by the police during a take-down)  Lee understands that the film at hand is that of a bank robbery and the attempts to salvage the hostage situation. He keeps things tight, moving and towards an end that even yours truly couldn't figure out until the results were revealed.That in short makes Inside Man one of the better films of the still new year and revives a Lee career that hasn't produced anything interesting since The 25th hour five years ago.www.robertsreviews.com",7,11,18,26 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," I didn't read the book
","I haven't read the book.I think when reviewing The DaVinci Code, everyone should disclose whether they are influenced by Dan Browns print phenomena. Just how many of those disclosures are there? Well, it has been speculated that some 60 million copies of the book have been sold. If you take into account that people read books and pass them along to friends, it would not be stretching the limits to say that some 100 million people have read The DaVinci Code. One hundred freakin' million. Let me put that into perspective. That is more than the population of the United Kingdom and Canada combined. That's more than the total number of records The Rolling Stones have sold. And that is just short of the total number of women who have rejected my 'Nice hair' opening line.I think it is important to disclose because this film came with about as high expectations as Star Wars Episode I. Office water-cooler talk was as rampant as the film neared its release date. Everything from the second guessing of the casting to talk about Tom Hanks' fro were being bantered around from cubicle to cubicle faster that the whispers of the office lushes Christmas party lap dance. With everyone and their brother knowing the story and heading to the theatre with varying degrees of high expectations, the movie had a built-in bias. All director Ron Howard had to do was walk the line of keeping page turners happy while adapting characters and condensing story plot lines to keep up with film pacing. No easy task to be sure.I can't spend time talking much about the plot. Most will already know what to expect, and those like me who went in oblivious, are better off just letting the story play out in front of them. The Coles Notes version is that The DaVinci Code is a mystery that can unravel everything we have been taught about some of the basic models of Christianity. Mary Magdelane, the Holy Grail and Jesus' own family tree up for debate with one clue after another leading Symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and a female cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on a quest to solve a mystery that has been hidden for thousands of years. The DaVinci Code is the third large summer film to be released this summer right on the heels of Mission Impossible III and Poseidon and does the first two releases one better by producing a slick story that is backed with strong acting and interesting action mixed in with high tense drama. Overlong  yes. Unbelievable and sometimes just plain illogical  sure. But that is what the movie is suppose to be. It is a fantasy. It's not based on fact (well, not all of it), and is meant as simple entertainment. I went to see The DaVinci Code with two friends that were test subjects on the matter. One had read the book and other had not. He who read the novel was slightly disappointed and I had to listen for two hours after the showing as to what was missing from the screenplay that might have better explained a few of the plot dot connections. The second was also disappointed as he compared the film to Nicholas Cage's National Treasure and kept expecting Hanks' character to put on a cowboy hat and find the Staff of Ra to find the exact location of the Holy Grail.I on the other hand was not disappointed. I thought it worked as a good movie that held my interest and kept me interested in both the characters and the next clue that would lead them down a path to which I was unknowing.The DaVinci Code is one of those films that are critic-proof. Opening worldwide the movie is a license to make money and you can be sure that when the big earners at the end of the year are listed in 'Gross Order' this one will be in the top five. That makes my efforts in the space sort of redundant, but for those who have lasted to the final paragraph, I offer you a recommendation. www.robertsreviews.com",7,0,1,27 May 2006
The Fountain," An absorbing tale, Aronofsky style
","To know Darren Aronofsky's films is to love Darren Aronofsky's films. Unlike a Stephen Spielberg whose films are visually stunning without offering much in way of surprises or M. Night Shyamalan's attempts at cinema that have you sitting in your plush uncomfortable theatre seat trying to get one step ahead of the projection in an attempt to figure out the ending 90 minutes before the great reveal, Aronofsky is a talent that deserves to be savored both visually and in a conclusion that is usually unforeseen.His two previous efforts, Requiem for a Dream and Pi are two of the more complex yet wonderfully absorbing films of the past 10 years. Each film dealt with addiction  one with drugs, the other with mathematics  and the consequences of these obsessions.Aronofsky's new film, The Fountain also deals with obsession  the obsession for life and the journey of one man's path through time in an effort to resurrect his everlasting love. In the film, Aronofsky uses his celluloid brush to paint a picture of a man obsessed with life while dealing with the eventual death of his wife. Hugh Jackman - who very convincingly sheds his Wolverine persona - plays Thomas and Tommy and Tom, three individuals spanning over a thousand years each on the same quest. The quest to find the source of everlasting life. What is interesting is that in each story, his quest is not to find the answer to immortality for his own gain, but in each case, he is attempting to find the cure for death to save the life of the object of his affection which comes in the form of a queen, a wife and a tree (two of the three are played by Rachel Weisz, I will let you guess which).The stories jump through time going from past to present to future which is usually annoying, but Aronofsky spends enough time and energy with each jump to give us time to relate to the characters and their surroundings while making an emotional attachment between the characters and the audience. That is if you buy into the film wholeheartedly.When The Fountain first premiered at the Venice Film Festival, it was met with general hissing and booing from a portion of the audience. Then, in September of 2006, it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival where again the audiences were mixed in their overall approval rating of the film. Having seen the film now twice, I scratch my head at the consensus response.Maybe the paying audiences were there to see the two leads, (Jackman/Weisz) who play the central characters in the film, without an appreciation (or patience) for the styling's of Aronofsky whose mind can best be described as Tim Burton on acid. Or maybe they were drawn in after watching the film's trailer which has elements of science fiction and adventure and thought they were going to be given an absorbing tale that will include aliens and lightsabers.Whatever the reason, few will argue that Aronofsky is an acquired taste that fails to transcend into the mainstream. For most, The Fountain will seem like it is going at a snails pace without any clear heading and can best be described like watching a Terrance Malik/Stanley Kubrick collaboration.But for those who like to think outside the box and have the adventurous spirit that can be whisked through time and space, this film will be right up your 'Best of' lists. It is a film that is intelligent, stimulating, demanding while offering some stunning scenes that were done without the aide of CGI. In fact, Aronofsky chose to do the special effects for the film by using micro-photography of chemical reactions on tiny petri dishes. But special effects are not what this film is about. It is about love, life and being able to let go. Aronofsky style.www.robertsreviews.com",7,2,4,13 November 2006
Love Actually," Will leave your cheeks hurting from grinning for 2+ hours
","Films with ensemble casts and multiple story lines are not easily put together with success.   Directors, at the time of filming, are not able to predict to which of the characters an audience might have an emotional attachment or which story line might be of most interest.  Even the most crafted of directors, namely Robert Altman, has had more failures with this practice (Cookie's Fortune, Pret-a-Porter) than successes. 
With film history not exactly on its side, it is even more incredible that Love Actually, works, and works rather well.  Writer/Director Richard Curtis, known for such romantic flicks as Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, assembled as many hip British actors as the marquee would allow including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Liam Neeson,  and threw them into a comedic script that is cut into so many segments, that a small review cannot possibly cover.
What Curtis does that is so refreshing is that he never stays on one storyline more than 10 minutes (which is actually quite back and forth considering the 130+ minutes running time), yet he never leaves us with a serial cliffhanger as he moves from character to character.  Each segment gives us enough of each story without over saturating us with a specific plot development.  And the surprising part is how well it works.Actually, the only thing that doesn't fit are the American actors and their contributions to the mix.  Billy Bob Thornton plays the President of the United States that is awkwardly caught trying to seduce the English Prime Ministers intern and Laura Linney plays a down on her luck workaholic that spends more time tending to her sick brother than dealing with her emotional needs.  The President sub-plot was too forced as if Curtis was trying to use his soapbox to make a post 9/11 political statement, and Laura Linney's woes just take from the joyfulness of the overall film.  A Curtis favorite, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) is given a moment that should also have seen the cutting room floor.However, when all is said and done and the stories all come together and intersect like a loosely wound Tarantino movie, you notice that the two plus hours have been more than enjoyable and that your cheeks are sore from grinning so much.  So, Love Actually is the 2003 Serendipity of the holiday season, a good date movie that at least gives you your money's worth.",8,0,2,3 December 2003
Man on Fire," Good Saturday afternoon fair even if overlong
","Looking back on Tony Scott's career you see a plethora of movies that seemed destined for Saturday afternoon television.  Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout, The Fan.all were movies that appealed to the testosterone full male audience while managing to do so-so at the box office.   Over the past twenty years, Scott has had the privilege of working with some of Hollywood's elite including Gene Hackman (twice), Tom Cruise (twice), Brad Pitt (twice) and now, with his new film Man on Fire, Denzel Washington has appeared in front of the camera two times for Ridley's younger brother. 
With Man on Fire, Denzel goes back to where he is probably most comfortable in the role of a justice seeking authority figure.  This marks the 10th time that Denzel has played the role of a cop or soldier out for revenge or retribution dating back to 1989's The Mighty Quinn.  This in no way suggests that Denzel has not expanded his acting range since he bolted from St. Elsewhere on television in 1982.  His turns in Glory, Malcolm X and The Hurricane shows just how versatile the actor can be and his five Academy Award nominations and two wins are testament to his tinsel town legacy. 
But I beg to ask why when the script of Man on Fire came across his nightstand, did he jump back into a protector's role that he has done time and time again.  Maybe Tony Scott runs a fun shoot.  Maybe Denzel wanted to get a chance to star alongside Christopher Walken or maybe DW just wanted to spend a few months in Mexico.  No matter the reason, Man on Fire is exactly what you would expect from the same two people who brought us Crimson Tide. And in short, that's too bad.Man on Fire is set in Mexico and surrounds the kidnapping of a wealthy family's daughter.  Denzel known only as Creasy, is the alcoholic bodyguard who is entrusted with her safety and loses her in a dramatic street gunfight that leaves him with multiple bullet holes.  After a remarkable recovery, Creasy is up and back on the assignment gunning down, blowing up and shooting just about everyone in Mexico that ever looked funny at his young victim.  As Creasy gets deeper and deeper into the individual cells responsible for the kidnapping, the local police play piggy-back and watch silently as Creasy unravels department corruption, a father's desperate scheme to get out of debt and finally the unveiling of the ringleader of the rash of kidnappings in the country known only to authorities as The Voice'.  
At a whopping 146 minutes, Man on Fire is about 45 minutes too long for a film of this genre.  It takes nearly an hour before the kidnapping takes place and I was left with a feeling that Tony Scott was unsure of himself and didn't know how to relate to the audience an emotional attachment between Denzel and the young Dakota Fanning.  As a result of this unassurance, we have to spend time with the two in overdrawn scenes including swimming lessons, homework assignments and multiple car rides where the two would talk and argue about things non-relevant to the overall plot.   As trailers revealed a kidnapping plot, as a paying customer, I became antsy an hour into the film and just wanted things to finally play out their course.  Also a nuisance was the various styles that Scott tries to incorporate into the film.  He uses various film stock, sub titles that appear anywhere except the bottom of the screen and multiple editing cuts and close-ups that frankly just don't work when combined together over the duration of the running time.  Maybe we should all sign a petition and force Scott to see Steven Soderbergh's Traffic so that he could take notes on how to effectively use these different methods to bring a feel to the film without making us as nauseous as the tea cup ride at an amusement park. 
And really, it's too bad that this project fails on these levels.  Denzel, Walken and Fanning all give exceptional performances, and I won't go as far as to say they were wasted, but the potential to make something extraordinary was hidden deep in the script and I wonder aloud what a directorial change might have done to recognize this fact. 
The violence too is unique in its own right.  A scene involving fingers and a car lighter brought back memories of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs. Another scene involving an explosive butt plug is also something I had not seen before and considering the rash amount of action films that get released every year, that is saying a lot.  So I guess I give Man on Fire its chops for attempting to be something different albeit its shortcomings are clearly evident.  This is one of those movies that sits on the fence of being a recommendation or a pan, but then I thought that when I see the commercials for `Coming soon to TBS this Saturday afternoon', I have to admit that I will probably be tuning in.

Whiplash," Fantastic
","There are multiple reasons why Whiplash comes to the Toronto International Film Festival with palpable anticipation. The film was showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival where it went on to both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize award for best dramatic film. Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch and J.K. Simmons, well, he's J.K. freakin' Simmons. So the gathering audience at the afternoon screening was primed, ready and eager for the expected greatness about to be screened.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman, a determined 19-year-old drummer who is pushed to his emotional limits by his new instructor Terence (J.K. Simmons). Terence has a reputation for being the best, but mentoring under his tutelage comes at a price. Terrence is no Mr. Miyagi. He is ruthless in his barrage of verbal sewage that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve. Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can't find Terence's tempo, , 'Were you rushing or were you dragging? If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig. Oh my dear God - are you one of those single tear people? You are a worthless pancy-ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl!' There is no 'Wash-on, Wash-off' PG-ness here.Being mean is in Terence's nature. And his assault on his young protégés is sometimes hard to watch. Think of Gunnery Sargent Hartman in Full Metal Jacket and imagine the persistent yelling and abuse for an entire film. Throughout, Andrew remains resilient. His goal to become a drummer of future legend has him shun friends and family. He's all alone and the uncomfortable Terence bond that he creates is all that he has.Audiences will be unsure of where Whiplash is headed. Are we headed for a triumphant climax where the drill sergeant-esque nature of the instructor pays off in a musical crescendo closing that brings audiences to their feet? Or will the pressure and barrage of verbal bullying take effect with a shocking tragedy that spotlights the harassment of our children. Be sure, this is no Mr. Holland's Opus and the hate and evil that Terence employs travels from opening to closing credits without reprieve.Writer-director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur. We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play. We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew's goal.The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew's defiance while gasping at his situation.The result is a fantastic film that is sure to be considered for Best Picture at next year's Academy Award's. It is a rousing crowd pleaser will have audiences clapping with hands they will want washed of Terence's abuse. J.K. Simmons has the role he was meant to play and his character was not only brilliant but could rank as one of the best cinematic villains of all-time.",9,26,55,9 September 2014
Army of Darkness," Enjoyable, just don't tell anyone.
","Have you ever gone to a movie and completely enjoyed yourself with all the action, comedy and romp only to leave the theatre thinking that you may not even give the movie a thumbs- up if you were asked for your opinion? That is exactly the situation I found myself in after watching Sam Raimi's third installment of the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness.Army of Darkness picks up where Evil Dead II left off 5 years earlier. Ashley J. Williams (or 'Ash' as we have come to know him) has been transported back to 1400 A.D. where he must continue to fight for his survival and deliver the people from the evil Deadites. Armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm (this may sound incredibly ridiculous if you have not seen the second installment), Ash is prophesized to deliver the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, which will rid the English townspeople of the walking dead and return Ash back to 1993 so that he can continue as a clerk at the local S-Mart.As odd or downright foolish that the plot may sound, Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) does a good job of keeping us entertained with a balanced mix of slapstick comedy and outlandish gore. Bruce Campbell (Ash) doesn't take himself too seriously and the results include such laughable quotes as 'Oh you little b**tards! Alright, I'll crush each and every last one of ya! I'll squash you so hard you'll have to look down to look up!'. These types of verbal exchanges definitely lighten the tone from the heavy blood soaked Evil Dead I and II entries.But what ultimately makes Army of Darkness so sinfully enjoyable is watching all the fun Campbell and Raimi seem to be having with the character and the notion of a self-centered fool using his 20th century knowledge in 15th century Europe. Whether it is Ash building himself a new arm or uttering modern day witticisms ('Gimme some sugar, baby.'), the movie never takes itself too seriously and that is most of the fun.In terms of special effects, the movie has both the best and the worst of what technology had to offer in the early 1990's. A scene where the army of the dead storms the castle is an ode to Jason and the Argonauts and the splendid work of effects master Ray Harryhausen. It is well crafted and choreographed and hi-light of the films effects. On the very opposite end of the scale is the scene in which Mini-Ashes run amok over the full sized Ash, jumping into his mouth, sticking him with a fork.you get the idea. The Mini-Ashes look like they were from a completely different film and the whole chapter on the DVD should be avoided if possible.So now I come back full circle with my initial statement. I enjoyed viewing Army of Darkness, and am embarrassed because of it. The humor is definitely adolescent, but you feel like a diabetic enjoying a chocolate bar, savoring the taste and hoping no one witnesses your satisfaction. Sam Raimi, who also helmed Darkman, does his best with an $11 million budget (his later $139 million budget for Spider-Man showed his true genius), and you can image by the energy exerted in such a preposterous storyline, that the cast and crew had oodles and oodles of fun during production. Thumbs up. Just don't tell anybody.Post note: For you star search enthusiasts, look for Bridget Fonda, hot off the heels of her role in Single White Female, as Linda.www.robertsreviews.com",6,2,5,19 February 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Like a long skit that doesn't know where to end
","Call me shallow or even easy to please, but one of the things that I have definitely appreciated this year is how the titles of movies have gotten back to a one or two word name that fits easily a top a theatre marquee or nicely within the margins of a film review. Kill Bill, Troy, and Miracle, all are good examples of studios having enough confidence in a film that they don't feel the need to put half the script in the overhead title. Last year, I exhausted myself trying just to get through the names of films like Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life and Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. When you try and stick to a review of under 1000 words or tell someone about a film within 5 minutes at a water cooler, it is a lot easier if the writers and the studios can save you the time of constructing a difficult to pronounce anagram just to save yourself a breath. Well, maybe my new world of Spartan's and Hellboy's are over and done for with the new Will Ferrell comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (referred to as Anchorman for the remainder of this review). Possibly lengthened for comedic effect or maybe simply because the writers get paid by the letter, it looks like Anchorman has opened the door again and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow's are now crawling into our movie magazines.Anchorman takes us back to a simpler time. Set in 1970's San Diego, the movie surrounds the crew of Channel 4 News and the changing of the times that effect their male dominated profession. Ferrell plays the title character Ron Burgundy, an egomaniacal scotch-loving womanizer that is the sole anchor of the 6 o'clock news. To the right and left of center chair is the dimwitted weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), the big Texan sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and the emotional leader and fashionably challenged roaming reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd). Together, the team has assembled to lead the ratings across the major networks for evening news telecasts. They are a tight team, a fun team and a team of out and out morons.To the credit of their program director, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), an opportunity to diversify the group and add a female presence to the team leads to the hiring of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). Immediately, the boys club is not amused. Back in the 1970's women were still fighting their way into male dominated environments and television was one of the predominant holdouts. The disgust of the news team explodes into a shouting match with the program director, but eventually her pushed-to-the-side role is accepted enough that they can forgo their hatred as being considered an equal and focus on the pursuit of wooing the new addition. Striking out with rapid-fire consistency, the team does get credit for pulling out all stops. In two of the films funnier moments, Brian uses a cologne 'made with bits of real panther' to make an impression which ultimately leads to very rib tickling comments from the newsroom as they rush to vomiting receptacles. And when Brick tries to relay the fact that he has a 'party in his pants' and that Veronica is invited, I will admit to having my fat cells jiggle with a reaction. Unfortunately, director Adam McKay then diverts the movie into a soap opera where after a brief fling, Burgundy and Corningstone fight for camera time and eventually, a crude sign-off delivered by Burgundy via the always trusted teleprompter, leads to his dismissal from the station and the fulfillment of Veronica's dream to anchor the news. We watch as the pitiful Burgundy drinks himself into a stupor while the team continues to flourish and improve on their number one rating status. Using the 70's backdrop can only provide us with pockets of amusement as this melodrama plays out to what is eventually a ridiculous conclusion and final act.For those of you that are Will Ferrell fans, he dominates the film with enough screen time to probably keep you laughing for your money. For those of you who find him only somewhat amusing during his brief skits a la Saturday Night Live, this will seem like a television bit that just doesn't know how to close. Every time the film would begin to pick up comedic momentum, it would be tarnished by the need to showcase Ferrell as someone who would not turn down anything he ever read on a script page. His yelling, screaming, crying and love for his dog are so hopelessly exaggerated that they begin to tire the audience out when stretched over 91 minutes. Also noted are that the funnier moments are too off the wall and would probably be better suited for a dream sequence rather than having us believe that as a flute player Burgundy would slide under a men's bathroom stall or that rival news station crews would meet in a back alley with pitch forks, grenades and gladiators on horseback to fight as an outlet to their disrespect for each other. There are some funny moments in Anchorman and some real interesting dialogue (Did you know that San Diego is German for a Whale's Vagina?), but as a whole, it just didn't keep me entertained. The cameo's were a nice surprise, but only for a second or two and then I wondered whether Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller or Luke Wilson would be able to find work outside of their collaborated efforts. Tim Robbins does a great job in a very comedic 180 from his Mystic River character, but his small presence and big hair doesn't generate anything more than a 'that's neat' from this critic. I suppose the fact that director McKay had only helmed Saturday Night Live episodes should have tipped me off for what I was about to encounter, but Ferrell's energy in Elf and Old School gave me hope that he could pull what must have been a fascinating idea before put to script papers. I can only hope that his next stab (Bewitched) reins him in and uses his talent as opposed to his audacity. If not, we can always hold out for Anchorman 2: The Legend of Ron Burgundy To the Temple of Doom to Uncover the Cradle of Life.",4,2,8,11 July 2004
Jaws," The Perfect Summer Movie
","Perfect.  Although not a word most reviewers ever dare put on the printed page for fear of its literal translation, I cannot think of a better word to describe the 1975 fish-in-the-water film Jaws.  Perfect.Directed by a relative unknown film geek named Steven Spielberg, Jaws opened in the summer of 1975 with reasonable expectations.  Universal Studios at first thought very little of the movie during production, but the reaction from the test audiences was electric.  What resulted, sparked change in the movie industry and revolutionized the summer box office for years to come.Jaws begins innocently enough as a group of young men and women are drinking and singing around a beach campfire at dusk when two people decide to go for a late night skin-dip.  As the male passes out on the beach, the female dives into the waters off Amity Island where suddenly she is pulled under like a bobby on a fishing line.  Looking both terrorized and confused, she does not scream right away.  Within seconds she is being torn from side to side screaming relentlessly for help.  Suddenly she is pulled under and the quiet calm waters overshadow the chaos that just ensued.
The next day, the young man who accompanied the girl to the waters' edge searches the beach with Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) in hopes of finding his lost companion.  A deputy's whistle leads them to the gruesome discovery of a hand lying on the beach.  The mystery was over, the girl was dead.This was the opening scene in Jaws, an adrenaline pumping few minutes that incorporated sex, nudity, terror and horror.  The game was afoot and Spielberg was on his way to establishing himself as the master behind the camera.Adapted by the best selling novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a story about hunting.  A police chief, a marine biologist and a gruffy sea captain hunt the shark while the shark continues to hunt and terrorize the community. When the beaches remain open and a little child becomes the second victim, Brody enlists the help of Matt Hooper (Richard Dryfuss) to help convince the mayor of the town that the beach is unsafe.  Unwilling to close the door on tourism revenue during the holiday season, the mayor keeps the beaches open and Hooper, Brody and expert fisherman Quint, take to the sea in hopes of locating and capturing their lurking predator.Twenty-years later, more is known about the making of Jaws that makes it even more enjoyable viewing.  For instance, we know that the shark created for the film was never tested and sunk to the bottom of the ocean on first trial.  As a result, Spielberg used a camera angle that gave us the view from the shark instead of producing the actual beast itself.  The result was pure terror as most of the thrilling scenes had a predator that was more implied than exploited.The new collectors edition DVD features many interesting extras that give us a glimpse into the hell that was the making of this film.  A documentary featurette titled 'Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws',  details how Robert Shaw had a temper, constantly fought on set with Richard Dryfuss and that he showed up for some scenes intoxicated.  We also learn that Lee Marvin was Spielberg's first choice to play Quint, and how John Williams' contribution of the score was the icing that packaged the cake.  A recapping of the test audience by Dryfuss takes you back to a golden age of movies when reactions were more commonplace, and how Spielberg handled the pressure of the studio executives when the film's production time ran from 55 to 155 days.  Fascinating stuff.It actually amazing to see the documentary and watch the film again with the knowledge that it was only Spielberg's second real shot behind the camera after The Sugarland Express.  To see him handle the drunken Shaw, the drowning Bruce (the name given to the mechanical shark) and the feuds between cast members to produce such a flawless film, is a precursor to what Steven became in later years.Almost thirty years later the affects of Jaws are widely accepted as commonplace.  Jaws was the first ever film to cross over the $100 domestic growth plateau that is now used as a benchmark to rate the overall success of a films popularity.  Over 65 million people went to see Jaws in 1975, which made it the first summer blockbuster, and it was one of the first films to report and have widely publicized the weekly receipts totals.
1975 was indeed the year of the shark.  From Time Magazine to local newscasts, sharks were everywhere, and thanks to Spielberg, they were in our nightmares too.  Perfect.",10,1,3,4 March 2004
Hitch," Smith without a gun - 'bout time!
","I can't tell you how refreshed I felt when I first saw the ad for the new comedy, Hitch. I have long ranted until blue in the face that I was sick of seeing Will Smith with a gun. I, Robot, Bad Boys (I and II), Wild Wild West, Men in Black and Independence Day all were highly successful films (West notwithstanding) that tried to take Smith's charisma and couple it with a holster.But, Will Smith has always been better than most of his filmography would suggest and you don't have to look much further than his Academy Award nominated turn in Ali or his overlooked breakout performance in Six Degrees of Separation to bear witness to the awesome potential of this leading man.So maybe sick of never going more than two scenes without shooting an alien or a drug smuggler or maybe just looking to reintroduce us to the boy that brought the Fresh Prince of Bel Air to our small screens on a weekly basis back in the early 1990's, Smith has elected to star in his first lead comedy of what is still a young career.The result is Hitch, a movie that doesn't strive to be anything better than the ridiculous elements of its premise, but does a good job in delivering the expected goods.Smith plays title character Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens who is a date doctor for the bumbling idiots like myself who need that bit of encouragement, advice or idea to help woo the women of our dreams. Hitch brings to the table what seems to be a wealth of knowledge about the opposite sex and he is all to happy (for a price) to assist in areas of communication, socializing and romancing of the opposite sex.Albert (Kevin James) is one of his prized clients. A large set man that works at a financial firm, Albert was the guy we picked on in dodgeball back in Grade 5. He wears a suit with white socks, he can't seem to eat without spilling sauce on himself and he is love with a rich client that ranks about a nine on the hottie meter. A call to the date doctor was exactly his necessary prescription. In no time, Albert has stood up to his bosses and made an impression with the quasi-celebrity Allegra Cole that was the apple in his eye.But as Albert is basking in the success of his tutelage, Hitch is having difficulty in his personal attempts to impress gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Their first three dates resulted in the revelation of Sara's murdering great grandfather, an allergic reaction to food that causes Hitch's face to swell and a dinner that ends up in a food fight. An auspicious start to a relationship if there ever was one.So in the confines of the 2-hour running time, Hitch will continue to aide and assist fellow gents in their pursuit of love without revealing his successful revenue generating profession to Sara. And in a conclusion that is just a level above a Three's Company episode, Hitch will become exposed as New York's great relationship sawbones and have to learn a new bag of tricks in an effort to gain the respect and admiration of his new love interest.It will come to no surprise that Hitch is predictable. But the charm is that director, Andy Tennant never tries to raise this film above the obvious. Possibly taking a page from Mel Gibson's What Women Want, the movie plays out like a better than average sitcom with an ending that although seen from a mile away, is enjoyable in its journey.All kudos have to go to the two leads of Smith and James for keeping us interested in a film of characters that must have spent their whole lives bumping into walls only to discover themselves in their middle age. Where Smith is completely believable in his expelling of philosophy and knowledge, James steals the scenes where they are together by introducing us to a vulnerable everyday man who gets a shot at the big time.Hitch is a date movie about dating that will without doubt be another feather in the cap for Mr. July (Smith was branded this title thanks to his 4th of July blockbusters). Coming off of the Oscar nominated Shark Tale, Smith has uncocked his magnum and hopefully put it in the nightstand for at least a few films.And for that, I am thankful.",6,0,0,20 February 2005
The Terminal," Endearing. Spielberg scores again!
","`Welcome to America, almost' That is the line uttered by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) to the recently arrived Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in Steve Speilberg's new film The Terminal.  The film, set almost entirely in a New York airport, tells the story of Victor's attempts to gain entry to America after his European nation goes to war while in transit leaving him without a recognized country or visa required to enter Stateside.  Standing in his way is the incredibly self-serving Frank Dixon who wants nothing more than for Victor to leave the airport, thus leaving him in the hands of federal officials.  But as days pass without Victor taking various bait as laid by the airport brass, Frank's nemesis becomes his crusade and to the bitter end he is determined not to let Victor get the better of the unfriendly rules and regulations he strictly enforces. As days turn into weeks, Victor befriends various workers within the terminal including an Indian man who enjoys over-waxing floors to watch travelers slip to his amusement and a young airport employee that trades Victor food for information on a young INS agent he has intentions of asking out.  Victor soon uses these friendships to his advantage after meeting a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is self-admittedly bad with men and looks to use Victor as a stop over conversation aide to hide her grief in her own decision making abilities. 
Under the watchful eyes of the airport cameras, Frank watches some of these events unfold including Victor's luck at getting a contract job with an airport renovating crew.  Not knowing how to rid himself of Victor's reluctance to leave, Frank does everything from threaten those that are closest to Victor to overtly lying to Victor giving him a false impression that no persecution will occur if he leaves the airport at a certain time of day.Directed by Steven Spielberg based on a screenplay written by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), The Terminal is one of those wonderful films that requires you to suspend belief in a situation too unbelievable to be true, but too magical to be ignored.  Tom Hanks is particularly believable as he puts on his Meryl Streep hat and nails an accent that if not handled properly could have been if not embarrassing, definitely distracting.  By mixing his new linguistic talent with stereotypical European hand gestures, Hanks is endearing and completely engrossed in the role of a foreigner that goes through an incredible transformation including using his time in the airport to learn how to read, speak and understand the English language.  But as a perfect compliment to Hanks tenderness and naivety is the evil Tucci who in terms of Spielberg films, outdoes even Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List and Danny Glover in The Color Purple as the most cruel and ruthless villain that he has ever tried to put on screen.  Tucci as Frank never waivers from his intentions and his tunnel vision geared towards what he hopes to be an inevitable and well-deserved promotion.  It has been a long time since I have watched a film and actually hated a character for their actions towards an innocent bystander, but Tucci delivers a knockout punch that should be reviewed again when nominations for little gold statues come out later this year.I did make a mistake before seeing The Terminal in that I read other reviews before actually previewing the movie myself.  Although most reviews have been more than favorable, local papers designated the story as unbelievable' and therefore underwritten'.  Huh?  A movie brought to you by the same director who has endeared us with dinosaurs and aliens has made a story that is insupposable?  The notion of a man living inside a terminal for months is possible and then should be based in a more realistic situation?  Pleee-eazze!  What is more believable than a man looks to fulfill a journey as set out by his father (I have to leave this one in an enigma to hide what is really a touching reveal and ending to the film)? 
The Terminal is another notch for the belt that is Speilberg's legacy. Sure, the brilliant films of Schindler's List, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan are arguably better, but if Stevie decides he wants to spend the rest of his life making 4 to 4 ½ star movies then the movie going public should continue to bow in thanks for all his contributions.  A strong recommendation is therefore granted and a longing for Spielberg's next attempt at celluloid.  For any director than can keep us in a movie theatre for two hours making us yearn to stay in an airport terminal longer is a craftsman of remarkable talent.www.gregsrants.com",8,1,2,20 June 2004
Prometheus," An Alien Prequel That Makes You Yearn For Alien
","The wait is over. The most anticipated film of 2012 and that does not contain a superhero or a Hobbit hits theatres this week-end in Ridley Scott's Prometheus.Carefully marketed as an original film that takes place in the same universe and references Alien (1979) but not a promoted Alien prequel, Prometheus stars Michael Fassbenders, Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba and Guy Pearce.The film opens in the year 2089 where Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) find cave drawings in the Scotland Highlands that they interpret as a star map and invitation to another planet that may lead to the origins of mankind.We quickly flash forward to the year 2093 aboard the spacecraft Prometheus where android and product of the Weyland Corporation David (Michael Fassbender) is quietly going about his work while 16 other crew members rest in hyper-sleep.Upon their awakening, the crew land on the distant planet and begin exploring a complex structure containing various alien beings and creatures (both dead and active). With different members of the crew working with different objectives, the team splits up and survey's the alien structure only to discover that they find themselves in a terrifying battle to save mankind and earth itself.Prometheus comes to theatres with incredible geek and horror historian expectations. Ridley Scott's Alien is widely considered one of the best horror and science fiction films in the history of film. And having master Ridley Scott back behind the camera for a science fiction film for the first time since in 30 years to revisit the movie that launched his career was a feat that came with high expectations from his fan base.The pressure to provide audiences with just the right amount of everything may have been Ridley's, and subsequently Prometheus', downfall. To use the phrase that 'everything was thrown at you but the kitchen sink' in reference to this effort would be an understatement and the film bends to the heavy pressure of the deep and convoluted plot from writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.The origins of mankind can be a heavy and controversial conversation piece on the best of days, but throw in aliens and creatures that look like they crawled out of the space garbage compactor in Star Wars and you end up with a mishmash of a film that goes in as many directions as a compass arrow when confronted with multiple magnets.The plot is only the beginning of the many disappoints in Prometheus. Whereas the characters aboard the Nostromo in Alien all seemed real and intelligent beings, this future doesn't offer the same hope. The 17 crew members about the Prometheus seem as if placed there by the same geniuses that screen thousands of applications before agreeing to send 18 castaways to an island on television's Survivor. Their personalities are wildly confrontational in interactions and it would be hard to believe that a trillion dollar science expedition would be left to some unstable critters as presented here.As Prometheus is at its core an Alien prequel (the final scene more or less confirms all), comparisons to the style and pacing of Ridley's 1979 masterpiece is inevitable. But where the Sigourney Weaver classic was meticulously calculated and used the claustrophobic elements of the Nostromo to help create mood and atmosphere, Prometheus does neither. The scenes inside the alien structure seemed grand in design and were more of a set designers attempt at an Academy Award as it was a terrifying configuration of caverns and layers.Anyone expecting the Alien as presented in Ridley Scott's original film or any of the subsequent sequels can check their disappointment at the door. Even though there are alien creatures that grow inside human hosts, they are a far cry from the H.R. Giger influenced creatures we have grown to root both for and against. And the 'Egg Room' that was the downfall of John Hurt's character in Alien has been replaced by a Cylinder Room filled with an oil-like substance that eventually plays its part in one of the sub-plots.Not all is bad with Prometheus. The aforementioned set and ship design were both incredible creations. And many of the special effects, which would include Ridley's view of our future, were equally stunning. Michael Fassbender is again reliable as the artificial humanoid and Charlize Theron proves in two consecutive weeks at the box office (following last week's release of Snow White and the Huntsman) that when she is evil, she can be bitchy-she-devil evil.But one cannot distance oneself from the Alien prequel hype. And as a lead-in to the popular film that coined the tagline 'In Space No One Can Hear You Scream', Prometheus fails to connect. So much so that we would suggest that if Prometheus was made first that Alien might never have been given a green-light. And now, my most anticipated film of the summer has left me feeling still empty and without the adrenaline rush that I craved in my horror junkie state.www.killerreviews.com",5,17,33,9 June 2012
The Queen," Start etching Mirren's name on the Oscar hardware
","Every once and a while, you sit in a theatre completely memorized by an acting performance. I remember the press screening of Monster and how amazingly Charlize Theron was able to transform herself into serial killer Aileen Wuournos. The conversation amongst critics in the lobby after the showing was just aglow with 'just give her the Oscar' speeches.We did the same for Nicholas Cage after Leaving Las Vegas and with Jamie Foxx in Ray. Sometimes an actor is just able to transform themselves into another character and is able to transport the audience to a time and place where they believe the character to be real and the depiction, flawless.Well, here we go again. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth in the new Stephen Frears film The Queen is the performance of the year. Bar none.The Queen is the story of the how the Royal Family personally and privately dealt with the death of Princess Diana in late August of 1997. The film begins a few months earlier with the appointment of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as British Prime Minister. Blair's first encounter with the Queen and his orientation on how to act, move and deliver in front of her royalness gives us our first glimpse into the sheltered and privileged life of the monarchy.Fast forward to August 30, 1997. We relive the events of that day in a reenactment that has paparazzi jumping on their scooters and following Diana with flashbulbs ablazing in the darkened Paris night. We watch as the car carrying the People's Princess goes into the tunnel and without showing any graphics of the accident on the screen, we recount the news reports and violent photos of the incident that the newspapers and television programs ingrained in our memory.The Royals don't seem to comprehend the indelible imprint Diana made on both the British people and those around the world. As fans and mourners converge in London with flowers and well wishes, the Royals maintain that they want to keep the matter private and they fail to relate to the British people and their need to hear from the throne. It doesn't help that The Queen and family don't share any emotional attachment to Diana. They comment on how she is not part of the family and how Diana uses the press when it suits her and complains when they become intrusive.It is here that Tony Blair comes to the rescue. Played with vigor by Sheen and using his Chaschire grin to his advantage, Tony brings a sane voice to a confused Palace. Still new to power but in front of the cameras as the Royal's cower in their lavishness, Blair is relentless in his attempts to have the Queen make certain statements such as a press statement and the lowering of the flag over the Palace, in an attempt to save the Queen and the family from the ruthless British Press that is asking in front page bold letters for the Royal Highness to recognize in some way the life of the beloved Princess.The Queen is just as much a film about being out of touch with the changing world as it is about the death and reacts of the death of the Princess. As the Queen struggles with the understanding of her people (she cries more for a slain deer than she does for the death of a family member), you feel sorry for someone who has lived such a life of privilege and has been so sequestered from the everyday life of her people that they fail to understand and relate to anything outside of their twelve foot walls. As I watched  and I will be the only reviewer on the face of the earth to put these two in the same sentence  I thought of the Queen as I do Paris Hilton. It isn't Hilton's fault (well, not entirely) that she doesn't know the value of money or understand what a hard days work might entail. These rich folk live a life that we can't understand just as they have problems relating to the blue collar public.And that is what makes The Queen so fascinating. To see Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip (James Cromwell holds his own against Mirren and has the best lines such as 'Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think we're mad!') and Prince Charles deal with the death in their own understanding is completely engrossing and the acting by all those playing members of the Royal Family are so convincing that you almost feel like you are sitting in Buckingham Palace listening to them squabble.And it is the acting that separates The Queen from the average film. I could have sat and watched Mirren and Sheen for another hour as they talk about life, Britain and the people to which the rule. Interesting fact: Sheen is playing Blair again in another Stephen Frears film about his rise to power due out sometime in 2007. But it is Mirren that you will most remember. At a recent festival, her performance was met with a five minute standing ovation at the conclusion of the film. The only thing remaining is the hardware to go along with the performance and I bet you can safely begin to etch her name on the bottom of the Oscar with still two months of film releases to go.www.robertsreviews.com",9,1,2,28 October 2006
Identity," Same old story until the ending, then you feel like an idiot
","A hotel on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada is the primary setting for the new film Identify, directed by James Mangold (last behind the camera in Kate & Leopold) and written by Michael Cooney, who's last credit was Jack Frost II: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowmen.The premise, as we are lead to believe, is simple, as a group of strangers are all stranded at a rural hotel after a storm blocks the road ways and exits.   Reading like a new age cast of Gilligan's Island, we have the movie star (Rebecca DeMornay), the Cop (Ray Liotta), the Chauffer (John Cusack), the married couple (John C. McGinley and Leila Kenzle), the convict (Jake Busey), the arguing newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott),  and the prostitute (Amanda Peet).  Throw in a mysterious man running the hotel and a child that doesn't want to talk, and we have the recipe for what turns out to be a murderous rampage.Giving away nothing that isn't in the overblown trailers, the strangers start showing up dead each one more grizzly than the last.  To add to the suspense, each dead body comes with its own hotel key which counts down the murders starting from ten.Everyone in the cast seems to do the best with what they have to work with, but we don't really get to know any of the characters too well.  John Cusack's character reveals that he was once a police officer that lost his edge, but all other characters remain mysterious and therefore each a suspect in each new murder.  Along the way, there is a confusing back drop of a psychologist, played admirably by Alfred Molina, who is trying to convince a panel suits that a man they are putting to death in 24 hours is mentally unstable and should be sent to an institution rather than the electric chair (`His body killed those people, not his mind').   We jump back and forth between these discussions and the hotel and in the end, we learn of their connection.Identity, is one of those rare films where the last act is actually better than the its predecessors.  As each member gets killed off without surprise (why in horror films do people find themselves running somewhere alone when they know there is strength in numbers?), we are left bored and tiresome. It's nothing we haven't seen before.  However, James Mangold then relates the story back to the convicted killer, and that is when you sit up, straighten your collar, and understand both the motivations and the outcomes of each of the strangers.Identity is a good film if for nothing else that it boldly tries something new and even the most clever of audiences probably didn't have the ending figured out.  Where it loses marks is in its cardboard writing and its typical ending which leaves enough room for a sequel while giving thriller fans one last jolt.  Cheap.I recommend Identity.

X2: X-Men United," Two times the X-Factor
","There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2. The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyone's favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villains are back for an encore also as Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) returns as the metal manipulator Magneto, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Introduced in X2 are Pryo, Deathstrike and Alan Cummings who steals the show as the blue faced teleporter named Nightcralwer. With a cast of characters as strong and diluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves with the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, a satisfying dose of that character will be administered. The story in X2 is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil Mr. Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to for the safety of humans.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor has been forced to locate and destroy all mutants through his unique ability to telepathically connect with those of unordinary powers. There are many subplots in X2:  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and requires anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, with top rate special effects and a body count (missing from the first movie) piling up fast. Wolverine again commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the mutant school and later with Deathstrike, is better than anything filmed in this year's earlier release Daredevil. X-Men comic book readers will have an advantage over the average movie screener.  I sat next to such a character that grinned with unprecedented glee with glimpses of Colosses and Kitty Pryde and the screen time given to the Blackbird jet, however, do not be dismayed, the movie is interesting and strong enough that a history of the characters and their origins before screening is not necessary. For the most part, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him. He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for the third installment.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  Both stories require a third segment to explain in whole. In today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters joining forces whenever evil threatens all.  Now, don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like X-Men 2 even more enjoyable.In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third",Null,0,0,5 November 2003

The Sixth Sense," Good job, but one of the top 20 of all time?
","In 1999 a movie was released that was the topic of conversation around office water coolers throughout the country.  People were amazed at slow pace, but ever engrossing ghost story that culminated in an ending that no one saw coming.  The movie was M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and its success went on to soak up over $300 million at the domestic box office and even garnish its young unknown star Haley Joel Osment a Supporting Actor nod at the 2000 Academy Awards.The thing is, that still to this day, I don't understand all the hubbub. Was it a good movie?  Yes.  But was it so revolutionary that it deserves its standing as 19th on the all-time grossing films list? Hardly.For those of you who have been living in a cave waiting for peace in the Middle East, The Sixth Sense stars Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe, a psychologist that we are introduced to being shot in the opening scenes. After what we expect to have been a speedy recovery, Malcolm befriends a new client, Cole Sear (Osment) who seems to have a gift/curse of being able to see and communicate with dead people.Malcolm tries to comprehend what Cole is facing and this all leads to a revelation of his own that Â‘shocked the movie world' back in 1999 and has been copied and parodied countless times since.To spend any more time on the plot would be counterproductive.  Most likely you have seen the film and on the off chance that you are coming out of a cave, well then, you might be lucky enough to be surprised at the ending without anyone telling you what to look for before it unveils itself.So let's start with the good stuff first.  Director M. Night Shyamalan did a superb job in keeping us interested in the story and the characters when everyone seems to be speaking in a monotone.  Shyamalan directed only two films before Sense (Praying with Anger and Wide Awake) so no one expected the phenomena that resulted.  The Sixth Sense was also written by Shyamalan we all know how rare it is to find a talented writer/director now of days.Also good are the performances.  Bruce Willis veers away from his macho persona he usually exudes and Osment and Toni Collette (who plays his mother) are great and were both deserving of their Oscar nods.  Hell, I would even give chops to Donnie Wahlberg who has but a small, albeit important, role at the beginning of the film.  All around, an A- grade for the actors.Then there was the scary stuff.  You know, the things that go bump.  There are a few genuine scares with rousing musical scores in tow but it is the quiet softer moments that really made the hair on the back of your neck take notice.  When Osment utters, `I see dead people' or when we see the imprint of a palm evaporate on a kitchen table, you are swept up in a world that is more spooky that scary and the movie is better off staying on this path.
There aren't many things that are wrong with The Sixth Sense and that is where I contradict myself.  I agree that The Sixth Sense was one of the better movies released in 1999.  I also believe that the premise was interesting and trend setting.  What I didn't understand was the sheer fascination from audiences around the world that put this movie into such lofty lists (80 million people had seen the movie after its release to DVD/Video in 2000).  Were we all that brain dead in '99 after Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Toy Story 2 that this film stood out so indiscreetly? 
In researching for this review, I can honestly now answer that question with a definite, `YES'.  Evidenced earlier with The Usual Suspects and then again in 2001 with Nicole Kidman's The Others, the movie going public has proven at the box office that if you can dupe them an dupe them good, they are willing to go back and back again in hopes of trying to figure out how you pulled it off the first time.  So hats off to you Mr. Shyamalan.  Although your succeeding efforts (Unbreakable, Signs) were better films, you did set a standard with a slightly better than average film, and hey who doesn't have time to stand at the water cooler and talk about your use of the color red in the film.  Good job.www.gregsrants.com",6,0,1,22 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Peter Jackson's odyssey comes to a welcomed conclusion
","The ring is destroyed!  Middle Earth is saved!  Hobbits and Elves rejoice!Peter Jackson's masterful odyssey that began 11 years ago is complete with the release of the third installment of the Lord of the Rings, Return of the King (ROTK).Peter Jackson's love affair with the J.R.R. Tolkien story is complete with the third film installment, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (ROTK). Audiences have waited through three years of release dates, countless DVD editions and marketing tie-ins to view what is essentially one long 11+ hour movie.  And at the end of it all, I too found myself rejoicing - rejoicing that the third movie finally ended!Lord of the Rings: ROTK is both good and bad with the good being exceptional, but the bad, being prominent enough not to be overlooked. First the good.  Ian McKellan as the wise wizard Gandalf is the best he has been in ROTK.  Gandalf transformed from being a new generation's Obi Wan Kenobi - as all wise and more powerful after death -  to being a vulnerable participant in a future unknown.  A scene shared with Viggo Mortensen's Aragon shows Gandalf to be scared for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Aragon must reassure him to follow his heart.  This is Ian McKellan at his best and if he was good enough to garnish an Oscar nomination for the first Lord of the Rings, then he should be assured one with ROTK.Also showing more acting range that was expected of him is Sean Astin in the role as Sam, the Hobbit that accompanies Frodo on his journey to Mount Doom. Sean shows courage, heart and conflict and we believe in the conviction that the young actor put into his role.Also on the plus side are the fight scenes in ROTK.  The great battles in the Pelennor Fields, Minas Tirith and the Black Gates are speckled with special effects mastery never before seen on the big screen.  Kudos also to Mr. Jackson for the amount of humor that was absent from the previous two installments.  Seeing Gandalf react to an overeager Pippin (played by Billy Boyd) put the audience into an outburst of laughter - a response not yet heard in the first 9 hours of storytelling.And finally, and most importantly, the story receives note for being the strongest of the three.  With many balls in the air to juggle, Peter Jackson weaves the story through Frodo's trek to Mount Doom with the ever-schizophrenic Gollum, Aragon's journey to regain the throne and Rohan's King Theoden search for an army to wrestle the evil Orcs just to name a few. All stories are equally interesting and Jackson is able to stay true to the novel in bringing the story to the masses.But not all is good with ROTK.  The special effects in the final film are average, that being, not on scale with what was presented in 2001 and 2002. Some effects actually look terrible.  The scene where Legolas (Orlando Bloom) is able to get atop a giant elephant looked cheap and unrealistic, and his subsequent dismount which was suppose to appeal to the skateboarders in the audience looked like the promo for some average Sony Playstation game.  And Aragon's confrontation with the ghosts of a disgraced army looked like it was cut and paste from Jackson's previous film, The Frighteners.Also notable was the amount of blue screen images used in the finale. Aragon in front of the army at the Black Gates or Frodo's gaze into the fires of Mount Doom looked terrible when compared to some of the film's other effect achievements.Then there is the ending.  All of them!  In a DVD world where extended versions are widely accepted as superior to the original cut, I would have enjoyed ROTK more had the last 30 minutes be struck from the record. After sitting through 3 hours, I had run out of popcorn and was restlessly waiting to use the restroom, but Peter Jackson marched each of his characters out for a curtain call of hugging, bowing, kissing and crying that I thought was completely unnecessary (Do we really need to see Sam get married?).However, for all its faults, ROTK is intended as one long film adventure and at that, it is exceptional.  Peter Jackson had an incredible undertaking in front of him, and unlike the Star Wars or Matrix franchises, The Lord of the Rings was able to maintain a constant tone and feel through its multiple components.  For that alone, I take my hat off and salute you.So it is finally time to take a breath.  Or is it? Next year there will be the DVD release of Return of the King followed by the theatrical extended version, then the DVD extended version, then the DVD box set, then the DVD box set with all the extended features.  Maybe if we are lucky, someone will rifle through the old house of J.R.R. Tolkien and find the unpublished works of Sam the Hobbit:Journey to Neverland Ranch.",7,3,5,20 December 2003
Cloud Atlas," A Spectacular Looking Mess
","They said that it couldn't be filmed. They said that David Mitchell's  Cloud Atlas  considered by many a literary masterpiece  with its  globe spanning, time-tripping plot could not be adapted for the big  screen due to the complexity that fell between the pages.  But that didn't seem to scare of a trio of directors  Tom Tykwer (Run  Lola Run), Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski (The Matrix)  from  signing on in an attempt to bring the literary adventure to the big  screen.  Accepting roles in the visionary adaptation were A-Listers Tom Hanks,  Halle Berry, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess and  Keith David. And with a screenplay adapted by Tykwer and the two  Wachowski's, Cloud Atlas rolled in front of the cameras late last year  and now has it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film  Festival.  Multiple characters, eras and story lines have notary Adam Ewing (Jim  Sturgess  Above the Universe) keeping a journal on his voyage across  the Pacific Ocean in the 19th Century; A musician in 1931 Belgium who  writes of his experiences in a letter to his love; A journalist (Halle  Berry) who investigates a murder that has taken place at a nuclear  plant circa 1975; A publisher in modern day England and his pursuit by  gangsters; A clone is interviewed on the eve of her execution in  futuristic Korea; and a tribesman (Hanks) in post-apocalyptic Hawaii is  visited by a member of a dead civilization. The stories are intertwined  and jump rapidly between each arch sometimes in as little as just a few  seconds between swaps.  All of the above story lines are weaved together in a 163-minute  adventure drama that desperately tries to become the most audacious and  epic film of the 2012 theatrical release year.  And although we can agree that the term 'epic' is aptly applied, Cloud  Atlas is also a labyrinth mess of a film that will alienate and confuse  audiences more than having them engrossed in story development.  Tom Hanks is clearly the actor of focus embodying over 11 different  characters through the different time zones and stories. With the  exception of one storyline that has Hanks as a British thug who commits  a violent act towards a critic, Hanks' ability and presence keeps the  film afloat while the ship takes water. All other actors play multiple  roles all competently, even Hugo Weaving who in one story plays a Nurse  Ratchet type female caregiver.  All other stories with the exception of one where Jim Broadbent plays  an aging composer are interesting enough even if they don't grab  audiences in a way that would have one root for one specific  character's journey.  The story arc that is rooted in the future where a clone falls in love  with a human adds some punch and high tech effects which help pass the  far too stretched 160+ minute running time.  There are also some scenes of incredible violence in Cloud Atlas.  Throats get cut, people get thrown off buildings and Korean clone women  get strung up like meat cattle. The violence is graphic but it is also  awkward in a movie that doesn't seem to be able to find its true voice.  Cloud Atlas is therefore like a glass of cold, flat Coca-Cola. It does  satisfy an immediate desire for taste and sugar, but it's ultimately  unsatisfying and leaves you wishing you had ordered something else.  We will also predict that Cloud Atlas will not only be shut out of any  Oscar or awards conversations, but the estimated $100 million will be  very tough to recoup even with all that star power headlining the  poster.",5,40,178,9 September 2012
300," Most fun you'll have this year
","As a young boy, Frank Miller watched the 1962 film 'The 300 Spartans' and was inspired in the story about 300 Spartans fighting against an army of Persians in The Battle of Thermopylae. As history tells us, 300 Greek soldiers lead by Spartan King Leonidas took on an army 20 times their number and held off the encroaching army long enough so that Greece was able to amass an army that fought off the encroaching Persians in 480 B.C.Miller then took the historical event and gruesome outcome as his muse to pen 300 in 1998 with collaborator and wife Lynn Varley. It was a graphic novel resembling Sin City that pulled no punches and had the pages soaked with blood and carnage.Years later, writer/director Zack Snyder who was coming off the wildly fun and successful Dawn of the Dead (2004) adapted a screenplay based on Miller's mini-series of novels on the battle and churned it into adrenaline pumping glory with the film simply titled 300.The story for the film is simple in structure. 300 soldiers stand ground in a mountain pass against hordes of Persians. The result was blood, decapitations, blood, dismemberments, blood, gore and just a little more blood thrown in for good measure.Sure, there is some backstory that never claims to be historically accurate. We are introduced in the beginning to the Spartan culture where their young children are taken from their families and taught to fight and become tolerant to pain and to the land (all of which are true). It is not long before we are introduced to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) whose love for their country comes a close second to the love they have for each other.But when a Persian messenger brings word of an army of over 7,000 which will destroy the Greek towns and culture unless they are given land and water, Leonidas stands firm and declares war on the trespassing army. Well, sort of. First, Leonidas tries to get approval from the five Ephors who were Spartas high officials. They refuse Leonidas' suggestion of war (even though there is no history to support their nay vote), but Leonidas still amasses 300 of his personal guards to stand firm in the mountains to protect the women and children that remained behind.So while away at war, Queen Gorgo tries to convince the council to send the entire Greek army to her husbands side in aide of his efforts. Her attempts would prove futile, but what the hell do we care? As bellowed by Leonidas, 'We're in for one wild night.'. 300 does not disappoint.If you've seen the trailers or the television spots, you know that violence is the call to order in 300 and Zach Snyder (God Bless Him!) fought off studio pressure to make the film PG-13 and went straight for the heart of the R-rating. We watch as the Spartans repel hundreds and hundreds of Persians led by baddie Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who is a cross between something on Stargate and Boy George. Their opposing armies leave enough CG blood splatter on the screen to titillate the warrior in all of us.300 is all about the violence, and Zach Snyder does a fantastic job of mixing just the right amount of blood, sweat and tears (all to a rocking score) with scantly clad buffed hunks to keep both genders of the date smiling with delight. There is enough spear chucking, arrow shooting and bone crunching for two or three movies. And when Leonidas stands on the battlefield of fallen Persians and eats an apple while making a speech about being civilized, it is a scene that will resonate long after the drive back home.There is so many good things about 300 that I don't know where to start. The way it was filmed in fast and slow motion video game style, the color scheme which is just dull enough to give a feel of rust, the acting lead by Butler who does a fantastic job of pulling off a role where he needs to be sensitive, intelligent, valiant, suicidal and at times, even humorous.The only thing that bothered me was the inordinate amount of Braveheart type rousing speeches that were shouted in our face before each new onslaught. There is only so much 'Give them nothing! But take from them everything!' and 'Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!' before a 'We Spartans have descended from Hercules himself. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death in the battlefield is the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. Spartans: the finest soldiers the world has ever known' before even the most engrossed of viewers begin to roll their eyes.But aside from this small drawback, 300 proved to be what I hoped it would when I started to see clips and trailers. It is a rocking ride and so far, the most fun you are going to have at the movies this year.www.robertsreviews.com",8,4,11,14 March 2007
Honey," Like honey, it leaves you wanting more
","Part Fame, part Flashdance and part 8 Mile, Honey is a movie about an aspiring dancer who makes it to the big times only to realize that fame and fortune are no substitute for helping neighborhood kids.
Jessica Alba plays the title character Honey Daniels, a hip-hop dance teacher at the local center by day and a bartender and dance floor extraordinaire by night.  It is during one of her late night dance floor gyrations that she is videotaped by an assistant for a famous music video director that sees Honey's talent and immediately hires her to be part of his dance pack.   At first, Honeys dreams seem to be coming true.  She is working with top hip-hop talent doing what she enjoys the most, dancing.  And it is not long before the director's confidence has Honey choreographing the dance troupes. Ahh, but wait for it, here comes the necessary plot diversions to stretch out the story and give us that warm Hollywood hug of a character that defies the odds and follows her dreams.  First, there are the street kids Honey meets while leaving the nightclub one evening.  These kids are talented and do dance moves that had my bones creaking just watching them.  Honey is enamored by the children and takes on the crusade of trying to keep them off the streets and in her studio where the two groups could learn dance moves from each other.Then there is the evil video director (Michael Ellis) who at first seems sincere in giving Honey the fame and opportunity but later turns when she shuns his sexual advances.And finally, in-between and vying for Honey's attention are her best friends who get pushed aside when fame overcrowds Honey's datebook and the local barber (Mekhi Phifer  8 Mile), who pursues her affection and eventually wins her heart.Honey is one of those films that if you can't relate to the music or the class of characters being thrust in your face with rhythmic impulses, you are probably not going to enjoy it very much.  The characters are all pretty to look at, but we've already seen pretty in Coyote Ugly and Dirty Dancing to a better result.It's not that Honey is a terrible film, it's just that it isn't very original.  Did we really think that her friends wouldn't be estranged only to reappear at the end in loving homage?  Did we really not see the Mekhi Phifer character and Honey teaming up to try and raise money through a benefit concert?  And the director who seeks sexual payment for his given opportunitiesof course he was going to blackball her and then see the error of his ways and apologize later.  Been there, done that.Maybe I just don't get it.  I wasn't raised in the hood, nor have I aspired to be something that only costs a few thousand dollars and my dreams to accomplish.  Funny though, this movie made me wish I was.  The kids all wear clothes and shoes that I only pass in the shop windows or when looking on-line at things I can't afford.  And if I had the encouragement of absolutely everyone around me to try and put on some kind of benefit that might reward me for being a good person, well giddy-up.Don't get me wrong, not everything in Honey is negative.  Some of the songs were tap toeing and the kids were definitely cute even if they were from the typical type casting of young-kids-from-abused-families-that-peddle-drugs. 
But to review the movie as a whole, Honey is probably an appropriate

Sin City," Good start to the silly season
","When I scanned the release schedule for 2005, there were a few 'event' films that caught my eye immediately. Obvious were King Kong, War of the Worlds and the next Star Wars chapter. Not only are these three films critic proof - and will provide a cloud of raining money which will pour down upon the producing studio - but they also had me salivating even with the realization that if just one out of the three is any good then we are above the mean.Take last year for example. Trailers appearing around Superbowl time got me pumped for Troy, The Day After Tomorrow and The Village. The result was one half decent Saturday afternoon matinée film surrounded by two pieces of crap. Unfortunately, this is the norm.But that didn't deter me from putting aside my dimes and quarters when the new trailers for summer 2005 came rolling out, and Sin City was the first of the five to jump out of the gate.The making of Sin City was fascinating onto itself. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, director Robert Rodriguez caused a Hollywood coup when he resigned from the Directors Guild of America after they refused to give Miller a director's credit on the film (due to Miller's style in the novels). Such rebellion against the collective hasn't been seen in Tinsletown since Elia Kazan named names.And then there was the word of the cast collection involved with the film. Willis, Del Toro, Rourke, Murphy (Brittany not Eddie), Owen, Alba.the list went on to read like a who's who of hip. When anyone asked a month ago 'Who is in Sin City?', I would invariably answer, 'Who isn't?'. It is a dream cast in a dream project and I X'd out the calendar dates until the April 1st release.With all this expectation, Sin City would surely be a let down. How could it not? Throw in the guest director Quentin Tarantino and the buzz meter soared into the red. Could this be the Pearl Harbour of 2005? Sin City starts off as promising as their ads. Bruce Willis is Hartigan, the only true good guy in a cast of shady characters, and we pick up Hartigan on the trail of a pedophile/kidnapper/murderer played by Nick Stahl. A standoff on a city dock leaves Hartigan will multiple bullet wounds and the kidnapper with two less appendages. It's a violent and visually energizing scene in black and white that sets the tone for the rest of the film.Enter one Marv (Mickey Rourke), who wakes up beside a dead hooker. Marv is one ugly dude, but is a brawler with nothing to lose. The cops are already racing up the stairs and Marv is quick to realize that he has been set up. His story  the most interesting of the three told in Sin City  would lead him to a farm where a sadistic cannibal (played by a very eerie Elijah Wood) eats his prey and mounts the heads of his victims like deer heads over a mantle.The second story surrounds a group of female renegades (lead by Rosario Dawson) who when provoked by Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his band of merry men lay a beating on the boys leaving severed arms and heads on the city street. A revelation that Jackie is a police officer requires the aide of Dwight (Clive Owen) to assist with the disposal of the body parts.The third story brings us back full circle. Hartigan is released and attempts to trace the girl (Jessica Alba) whom he saved from the Nick Stahl character years earlier. A mysterious yellow man is hot on his trail and when the two do reunite, Mr. Yellow is revealed to be the kidnapper/murderer from the first act who is looking finish what he started years ago.Sin City exploits just about every R-rated check box the MPAA censors have on the clipboards in front of them. There are dismemberments, shootouts, violence against women and police, crotch shooting, crotch ripping, suggested acts of cannibalism and in maybe the scene that will stick with you the longest, someone is left without limbs and tied to a tree for a dog to feast upon. This is not therefore your family movie after Sunday brunch. Sure, the black and white visuals of the film drop the red blood factor down to zero, but whether its fluorescent blood against a black background or yellow plasma spills in place of buckets of red, the imagination doesn't have to go far to imagine the scene in full Technicolor.But I am sure that Rodriguez and Miller make no apologies. Nor will they offer your money back if you don't appreciate the art of the black and white shot film (against a green screen no less) that uses color only to create visual distractions. Red shoes and dresses, blue and yellow eyes and yellow skin are just a few examples of the scatterings of Crayola coloring utilized in the print. Never distracting and always interesting, it was the best use of color in a black and white shot film since the red jacket appeared in Schindler's List.There are a plethora of things that are stunning in Sin City. The costumes, the music, the sets. But unfortunately, it felt after an hour and a half (the movie runs over two hours) that more time was spent on the style than trying to tighten the story lines. Cut about 20 minutes and leave them for the DVD and you have a movie that ends up on top ten lists rather than just being credited as being innovative. By the time the final story begins, you are already exhausted at everything you have been asked to ingest and that is probably too much for the average movie goer.www.gregsrants.com",8,0,3,4 April 2005
Coach Carter," Parts Hoosiers, Dead Poets Society and Lean on Me
","Parts Hoosiers, part Dead Poet's Society and part Lean on Me, Samuel L. Jackson stars as high school basketball coach Ken Carter in the new MTV/Paramount release, Coach Carter.Inspired by a true story, Ken Carter was responsible for turning around the basketball athletic program at Richmond High School by less than conventional methods. Carters' philosophy was that education was far more important than any athletic achievement and he had each of the team members sign a contract that agrees to some significant terms. Included in the personal agreements were to maintain a 2.3 grade point average, to attend every class and sit in the front row and to wear a jacket and tie on game days. In return, the players get the benefit of his coaching tutelage and the use of a gym facility for their training regiment.Getting the lowly Richmond team to work as a team would be a tougher job than expected. With a 4-20 something record the year previous, there was much room for improvement and the teenage kids were acting like, well, teenagers when given their first dose of authority. But things do get off to a rousing start until coach gets their progress reports from the teaching faculty and shuts down the gym forfeiting two matches 16 games into the successful season.This caused quite an uproar in the community and gave Carter some media attention back in 1999. Perceived as taking away the highlight of an adolescent's school memory while striking a blow to an incredible turnaround in achievement, parents convened in a town-hall type meeting to vote on the future of the imposed lockout and ultimately the future of coach Carter. The result can all be determined if you have seen any of the three movies I listed in the opening paragraph, and the team does get to play at least one more memorable game towards their legacy.Coach Carter comes from a very short line of good basketball films. In fact, this side of professional hockey, there is not much other than 1986's Hoosiers and Spike Lee's He Got Game there is not much to cheer about (sorry Blue Chips). However, Coach Carter does prove to be inspirational and the basketball game footage and camera angles are maybe the best ever filmed to represent the fast paced sport.Samuel L. Jackson does his best Samuel L. Jackson impression and is believable as a coach that would put in the time and energy into a thankless ($1,500/year thankless) coaching position. The kids too also pull off just enough to make the strong glide down court without feeling as if we are traveling towards an expected conclusion.There were some liberties taken that are truly evident. The fact that two high school teams can score 14 points between them with less than two minutes left in the game yet only get 70-odds for the entire contest was a bit hard to believe (but not impossible so I am told).But the major problem with Coach Carter was the running time. Clocking in at an unnecessary 136 minutes, there are far too many musical montages of Carter thinking alone in the gym or the team walking through the school halls. It was as if MTV films was trying to squeeze a double disc CD complication out of the experience, and I quite frankly could have cared less for these non-story moving moments.So too could the team members quitting the team ended up on the cutting room floor. They walk away only to come back only to walk away again. Surely, some amalgamation of the events could have been conjured to keep things on a forwards progress.But these are small nitpicks for what is overall a very enjoyable and moving experience. Coach Carter does deliver the goods and even though your bum might take time to forgive you for shuffling in your seat for two plus hours, at least the final result is a film that kids and parents alike can enjoy and hopefully draw inspiration from. And that my friends is a slam dunk.www.gregsrants.com",6,0,2,25 January 2005
Goodfellas," The Best film of the 1990's
","I hate it when people ask me what my favorite movie of all time is.  That is like asking an art lover what their favorite painting is.  Break it down to favorite abstract painter, favorite contemporary artist, and you might get a more definitive answer.  So asking a movie buff what their favorite film is not entirely fair.  I have a favorite comedy, a favorite drama, horror, foreign film etc., but to pick one from the bunch is more question than I can handle.Given my above conundrum, if I was ever to amass a list of best-evers, 1990's Goodfellas would surely be near the top of the list.  Directed by Martin Scorsese and featuring an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta, Goodfellas was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Although at the end of the March ceremony, only one award was engraved with a participant's name - Pesci for Supporting Actor - Goodfellas remains as maybe the best film of the 1990's.
Based on the novel 'Wiseguy', by Nicholas Pileggi, the movie follows the true story of Henry Hill (Liotta), as he rises through the ranks of the mob. From child to young adult, we watch Henry as he gains acceptance, gets married, and goes to jail, starts dealing drugs, all leading to his capture by authorities.Along for the wild ride of mob hits, heists and murders are Jimmy and Tommy (DeNiro and Pesci, respectively), two lifetime mobsters that take Henry under their wings and teach him the ropes.  Jimmy is the elder statesman who handles things professionally and is respected for his calm demeanor. Tommy is the hot-head stereotype who resorts to violence whenever threatened. Together, they provide the perfect balance for Henry as he tries to cope with life in the underworld while maintaining a normal life presence.Goodfellas is a near perfect film.  Scorsese has cast each part with actors born to play their role.  From Paul Sorvino as the mob figurehead to Lorraine Bracco in a breakthrough performance as Henry's love interest, the cast fits together like a leather glove.  And they each have cool names to boot.  There is Spider, Fat Andy, Pete the Killer and Jimmy Two Times just to ramble off a few.  Whether you were a bit player or someone with a bigger trailer, Scorsese handles everyone with crafted dialogue and incredible attention to authenticity.What also makes Goodfellas so good, are the costumes and set design that bring us right back to the 70's and 80's tacky kitchens and pastel living room furniture.  Scorsese does well in bringing us through multiple decades and showing the natural progression of the actors and their belongings as time marches forward.Even the voice over works.  Not a fan of this cheap tactic to move a story forward, Henry Hill bursts narration throughout the film with quotes like, `Jimmy was the kinda guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies' and `Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than Citibank.'  Each narration brings either humor or does well in helping us grow with the characters and eventually cheering for violence bearing mafia.But if I could pick one thing to give the director his chops, it would have to be in his depiction of Henry Hill.  By taking his time with the story (the movie does run 145 minutes), we can follow Henry through the many stages of his involvement.  When Henry is involved with his first encounter with violence, it is a believable occurrence based on the progression. And when Henry begins selling drugs, we may not agree, but we can definitely understand what brought him and his family to that stage of their lives.The DVD comes without many special features, and that is too bad.  It would be interesting to hear Scorsese talk about how some cast members (Michael Imperioli and Tony Sirico) went on to become famous with the Soprano's, or how he was able to nab Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Gallo for parts all but forgotten by the audience before the end credits.Five stars are not to be taken or given lightly.  Goodfellas deserves every one of them.",10,0,0,11 March 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," A smart action packed thriller
","Can you guess what movie topped the charts as the most rented film of 2003? In the year that brought us such blockbusters as two Matrix sequels, an X-Men and Terminator entry and even a Big Fat Greek Wedding, you may not hit the jackpot if given 10 guesses and a handful of hints. That is because the $121 million domestic grossing Bourne Identity is the answer to the query, and with movies now being able to double and triple their theatrical runs on the small screen, it is no surprise that this week sees Jason Bourne back for another adventure in the Bourne Supremacy. For those of you that require a refresher course before sitting down to new sequential installments, Bourne (Matt Damon) was fished out of the water in the Bourne Identity and struggled through the film to regain his memory whilst dodging deadly assassins through Europe. Bourne would later find out that he was once part of the CIA, but he leaves that world behind and runs to a India with new female companion Marie (Franka Ponete) stating that '..if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast I will bring this fight to your doorstep.' Well, this is the entertainment business and a statement like that can only mean one thing.non-compliance. The Bourne Supremacy picks up with Jason's new life being threatened when he is framed for a murder of two individuals of a CIA covert action 4,000 miles away. The perpetrators of the crime want to kill him to cover their tracks, the CIA wants to kill him because they are convinced he is a loose cannon and Bourne dodges both parties from city to city putting the pieces together to help clear his name and ultimately reveal who the is the wizard behind the curtain. Since it is too easy to compare a sequel to its predecessor, I will follow the rule to a tee and reveal that the second Bourne is better than first. Hats off to new director Paul Greengrass who's only resume green flag was the 2002 documentary Bloody Sunday which chronicled the Irish civil rights protest of 1972. A curious choice then indeed, but now in hindsight, probably the best man for the job. Supremacy flings us through country and city after city with such ferocity that I felt I was reading the bottom left hand side of the screen every five minutes to have revealed the next extravagant location. A director with a flare for documentary film-making knows about pacing and with India, Virginia, Berlin, Munich and Moscow all being thrown at us before we get to the rim of our popcorn bags, the pacing in the hands of simplistic action director may have sunk the film. But even as I give kudos to the man behind the camera it is the action star with the franchise strapped firmly on his back that I have to give the most credit. Matt Damon (Bourne) has left his fellow childhood friend Ben Affleck in his dust with his choice of roles and acting ability and with the Bourne films he is able to pull off a superagent persona that doesn't seem to realize his ability until forced into action. A scene at a Naples airport where Bourne is detained and sits quietly waiting to erupt is a classic example of what we have come to expect from the once covert assassin. He sits without emotion or expression only to in an instant, overpower two guards and download information from a hand-held computer device in what shoots across the screen in about 7 seconds. Also back for a second time are Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) as the CIA director that has more secrets than helpful ideas for the cause, and Nicky (Julia Stiles) a CIA agent profiler that might have a few keys to the locks in Bourne's brain he is so desperately trying to access. Luckily these two characters have significant, but small parts as both actors provided weak performances in an otherwise strong cast. Cox looked tired and delivered his lines like he had a bus to catch which is probably truce since he has participated in no less than 5 movies this year alone (look out Stiller), and Stiles breaking down and crying when confronted with the inquisitive Bourne was hard to believe as a character that responsible the analysis of the mental well-being of other agents. As for action sequences, Supremacy delivers two fold over the original. It's climactic chase scene was incredible in its choreography and you will undoubtedly shake your head wondering at what point did they extract the star and replace him with the stunt actor. Damon looks to be the director's human piñata and the authenticity of seeing broken glass fly into his face as his car skids, smashes and ultimately becomes undriveable makes this one of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. The Bourne Supremacy is more complex than the first and the addition of the Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) character and the complex way to which she is between two agendas trying to find the truth while Bourne both somewhat trusts and uses her to find the truth, is a refreshing way to have a story unfold in a summer of huge explosions and pointless humor. I understand that there are three books in the Robert Ludlum trilogy of Mr. Bourne's adventures and it has been a while since I have looked forward to the hopes of a sequel so quickly after exiting the theatre of the last. But that is exactly what these films have done. We actually care about the hero of the film and we want him to find out more about his past as it sits like a piece of popcorn stuck in our teeth that we want to expose. I look forward to installment three and have already cleared a spot for the DVD box set beside the Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan series on my wall unit. Thumbs way up.",8,2,2,25 July 2004
Shark Tale," Finds its place amongst the computer animated Hall of Fame
","It was nine years ago this November that one of the most influential movies of the next decade was released to mass audiences. The film was Toy Story, and it is credited as being the first fully computer generated feature length film. Expectations were fairly high for the $30 million production and continued to gather momentum through the roaring responses by test audiences and the reaction to the trailers and media hype. When released November 22, Toy Story flew out of the gate with nearly $29 million in its opening weekend alone. The landscape for films and the entries into the top grossing films of all time would be changed forever.In the nine years since Toy Story debuted, studios have yet to have a misstep with the computer-generated format. Monster's Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2 became incredibly successful films eating up box office dollar stats upon each release. Not be left behind in the cold, other studio's began to see the Disney cash cows mooing every time a Pixar/Mickey Mouse collaboration hit McDonald's Happy Meals. Fox Studio's released Ice Age (2002), and Dreamwork's lined up the Brinks trucks for Antz (1998) and everyone's favorite Ogre, Shrek and his even bigger sequel Shrek 2. This fall, children will throw sugar rush tantrums when two films, Pixar's The Incredibles and Dreamworks' Shark Tale hit theaters in the same season that Shrek 2 gets its widely publicized DVD release. In fact, Hollywood is banking on it. Animation studios and their respective creative powers are being dropped like stock in a Martha Stewart portfolio. Gone are the hand drawn ordered celluloid prints of The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan and The Aristocrats. We are in a new world now where even Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius can knock on the $100 million domestic gross doormat. I had the privilege of a screening of Shark Tale at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. Although only a child at heart, I will admit that I was more than a little excited amongst all the glitz and glitter of the red carpet. Trailers for the movie did not have the effect on me of say a Shrek or Toy Story. But whatever the coming attractions' originality lacked, Shark Tale more than made up in sheer star power. Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Peter Falk's are some of the names that can all be found in print on the films' poster. One of these names alone might get me to buy a ticket for a panned film entry so surely this was a can't miss proposition. Surely?Well, fret not ye parents who will be dragged by shirttails on opening weekend 'cause Shark Tale fits along nicely amongst its peers in terms of effects, laughs and originality.Set in the undersea world, Shark Tale is the simple story of Oscar (Will Smith), a small fish with big dreams. A slacker at the local Whale Wash, Oscar is one of those dreamers that think the world should be handed to him on a silver platter. On the other side of the reef, live the sharks. They are a collection of mobster type stereotypes lead by Don Lino (Robert DeNiro) who is looking to turn his family over two his two sons, Frankie (Sopranos' Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black). Typical of what you would expect if the actors were playing live action characters, Frankie is the relentless true heir  a mean, in-the-mold-of-his-father type, while Lenny is the vegetarian who can't bring himself to cause harm to another creature. When the two brothers meet Oscar, a freak accident leaves Frankie dead, Don Lino enraged and Oscar holding the key to the city after taking credit as a shark slayer. Lenny sees this as an exploitive opportunity himself  a chance to hide from his violent family responsibilities, and in a very humorously choreographed battle where Lenny pretends to be slewed by the inferior sized Oscar. The movie then plays out in true comedic style as Oscar builds a fortune out of his newfound fame, Lenny ties to hide living a life as a dolphin and Don Lino becomes increasingly incensed on the notion that a predator of sharks exists. But where the story might be 'simple' the execution is anything but. Computer generated films have spoiled us with sight gags that would be too costly with live action, and with adult-minded humor and references that makes the experience exciting for the grownups in the crowd. Shark Tale does not falter on these points. The opening sequence was captivating as we were taken for a swim through the underwater city. The ingeniousness of the creators and writers were found in every air bubble of the busy Whale Wash where turtles give turtle waxes, in every starfish laying in the celebrity walk of fame and in a sushi chef who wonders if he is in the appropriate market for his business. Each new turn within the city's infrastructure brought to life ideas that the audience cheered, laughed or marveled at the sheer brilliance of the thought process. Adding to the lure for the adult crowds, Shark Tale had as many film references as one could throw into a film without infringing on the original storyline. Godfather and Jaws references aside, you will may have to see the movie more than once to pick up quotes from films like Jerry McGuire and Ali. The little kiddies in the audience probably wondered what the adults were laughing and grinning at, but Shark Tale rivals Shrek 2 for film references.Even with all the adult pop-culture references, children will have no problem enjoying the aquatic world that Dreamworks has created. Add a love triangle between Angie (Renée Zellweger), Oscar and Lola (Angelina Jolie) and you have a filmgoing experience that has something for the whole family no matter what their age. But maybe the cherry on the top was the itself. Each character from Will's Oscar to Peter Falk's Don Brizzi is animated with wonderful detail and color with each creation having similar facial characteristics as their voiced impersonator. Jolie's lips, Scorsese's eyebrows and even DeNiro's mole are all present in their cartoon form. It's as if the actual actor was reincarnated as the fish that best suited their characters and mannerisms. Couple that with the incredible vibrant colors and attention to detail by the animators and you have what could very well become an instant classic amongst this still blossoming format.It's hard to knock a film like Shark Tale, but then, why would I? Scorsese and DeNiro seem to be having a ball bantering back and forth with one another, Smith has the reins off so he can act his inner child, and Doug E. Doug needed the perfect outlet for his humor that will make him as lovable and memorable as Eddie Murphy's donkey in Shrek. So hey, if they are having a good time, why should I complain. www.gregsrants.com",8,0,2,14 September 2004
Draft Day," Second Round Draft Pick is no Moneyball
","Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports themed movies. The Tin Cup, Bull Durham, For the Love of the Game star has stared in five separate sports films and now rounds that number to an even six with the football themed Draft Day directed by Ghostbuster's helmer Ivan Reitman. Taking on a role more his age (Costner is a football yard short of 60), Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL. The action picks on NFL Draft Day, the day in which 200+ young budding stars get drafted by big league teams in a huge televised event taking place in New York City. Sonny's Cleveland team was a lowly 6-10 the season before – largely due to the injury to their star quarterback. The Browns are given the 7th round draft pick on draft day, but pressures from Brown's team owner (Frank Langella) and an aggressive offer from the Seattle Seahawks to swap the number 1 pick for future options leave Sonny with only hours to think of both his legacy and what is best for the city's revered team. The film all takes place within the 24 hours on draft day and a running clock that appears a handful of times during the film reminds us that the time is ticking and decisions need to be made. Impeding such forward thinking are the films distractions which come in the form of two female characters with ties to Sonny. Jennifer Garner plays Ali, the love interest of Sonny and the lawyer and number cruncher who is responsible for keeping the Browns under the NFL salary cap. With the film only a few minutes aged, we learn that Ali is pregnant with Sonny's baby – a subplot that was hardly necessary to keep things moving. Also complicating things is Sonny's mother played by Ellen Burstyn. Sonny's father was a former Cleveland Brown's coach (fired by Sonny Jr. the year previous) and has recently passed away. Sonny's mother for reasons that were hard to understand considering she lived a life with football at the core of the family, decides that draft day is the day in which she wants Sonny to spend some time completing his father's last wishes as identified in his will. Both female stories go nowhere and could easily have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, in a weak attempt to connect with a female audience, the two characters are awarded ample screen time to emote and distract Sonny on what is arguably the most difficult and focused day of his career. When Sonny is not tripping over the estrogen pitfalls, he is struggling with his coach (Dennis Leary) and working the phones discussing trade possibilities with Jacksonville, Buffalo and Kansas City in an attempt to save the city the embarrassment of selling the golden goose for a few magic beans. It is when Sonny is working his draft magic that the movie is at its best. His calls to and from potential and existing players had an authentic feel and the chaos of draft day is captured with tense complexity and legacy importance. Draft Day wants to be football's answer to baseball's Moneyball. But the Aaron Sorkin written baseball film starring Brad Pitt had rocket-fire dialogue that catapulted the film to an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay. Draft Day instead is fluff, but it's good fluff. Costner consistently makes every film to which he is involved better than it should be and Reitman is smart to give appropriate cameos (Roger Goodall, Bernie Kozar, Jim Brown), he keeps the spotlight on his star heaving the film on Costner's shoulders in an attempt to score a box office touchdown. Draft Day was a fun distraction. Browns fans will likely enjoy a fantasy film of their team making right decisions (the Browns have not made the NFL playoffs since 2002), and football fans should find valued entertainment in the behind the scenes peak into the day of a General Manager. But film fans hoping for a Moneyball or something smarter than Draft Day's trailers have revealed should look elsewhere.",6,47,76,11 April 2014
Dodgeball," I laughed...and that says a lot
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story StarsLet's get one thing perfectly clear before we even start. I had no intentions of seeing Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. None. Forking over a double-digit cash sum to be reminded of the welts I used to get in junior high playing the ridiculous game was of absolutely no appeal. Couple that with Ben Stiller playing yet another character that is so over the top that I won't know whether to laugh or to feel sorry for the guy, and I had a recipe for a long sit through.However, my trains all lined up perfectly and it was too nice of a day to waste it outside on a patio somewhere, so there I was, standing at an automated ticket counter, scanning my bank card to purchase a ticket for a movie that that I was surprised to see Ebert & Roper give two thumbs up. (By scanning, I don't have to say the title out loud and embarrass myself in a crowd).Dodgeball has the most simplistic of stories to understand. Man needs money to save gym. Man enters team into tournament. Man wins tournament and gets the woman. In short, I guess the premises of the film could have been written on cave walls some 7000 years ago, and based on its brand of humor..it just may have.The 'man' is Peter LeFleur played by Vince Vaughn, he of Starsky & Hutch, Zoolander and any other film that a Stiller or an Owen brother is attached. Peter owns a local gym that has caught the eye of White Goodman (Stiller) the driving force behind a state of the art gym facility that is franchised across the street. Due to accounting ignorance, Peter's gym, Average Joe's, is in financial woe and Goodman buys the second mortgage leaving Pete with the only option of amassing $50,000 in 30-days to save the establishment. So determined to be the David to the Goodman's Goliath, Peter and his friends come up with the hair-brained idea of entering a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas in hopes of brandishing the prize money to thwart the bank's foreclosure. But things are not as easy as it would seem, and dodgeball is not like the game you and I might remember from the day. The rules are pretty much the same. Six balls, five players per team. Hit the person on the other side of the court and they are out. Catch a ball and you can get one of your members back in. But that is where the similarities end. Teams now consist of rugged, fierce characters with each team having a theme (girl scouts, kamikazes etc). Dodgeball is now a spectator sport with qualifying rounds and a 32-team tournament that even has ESPN 8 interested with coverage. In short, it's come a long way, baby.So the stage was set for what was an inevitable set up pitting team Average Joe against the team fielded by Gobo Gym's, Goodman. Bring on the balls!Dodgeball made me laugh. Plain and simple. Stupid? Yes. But funny? Definitely. If it wasn't chuckling to myself when instructor Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) is training the young group by having them dodge wrenches, I was laughing out loud at the best commentary during a sporting event (courtesy of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) since Bob Uecker in Major League. From Stiller's ridiculous Goodman to Vaughn's straight man Peter, there is a perfect mix of characters and comedy that might just make this film a bigger hit this summer than the studio anticipated.Still not convinced? Well how about cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong and even German adored David Hasselhoff. Each of these bit parts were non-gratuitous and damn down funny. To watch Lance give a speech on how he was diagnosed with four areas of cancer at the same time and yet still managed to win the Tour de France for five straight years is self-depreciating acting at its finest without degrading the actual person.To recommend Dodgeball at the office water cooler is to guarantee yourself a reputation as someone who's opinions ought to be questioned. But if you strip the movie down to just its essentials (that is, take the love story out, cause you know how that is going to end. Take the suspense of what decision Pete is going to make, cause you know how that is going to end), then the movie is a great way to spend a day during the summer with some friends. For trust me, in about 6 months time, everyone will be talking about how they rented this movie and laughed alongside their friends and loved ones at the same carnage that brought me sympathy in Junior High. Besides, what other sport could have a team motto as fun as 'Aim Low'?",7,0,0,22 June 2004
The Martian," Sir Ridley at his best
","Ridley Scott knows science fiction. The director of iconic and cult crowned sci-fi flicks Blade Runner and Alien, Scott is no slouch when it comes to futuristic or outerspaceish type scenarios played out through his keen direction.Scott last dipped his toe into the sci-fi waters in 2012 with the love it or hate it Alien prequel, Prometheus. The film was met with varying degrees of acceptance and disapproval but no one could deny the film was visually spectacular. In 2015, Scott brings Andy Weir's novel of the same name to audiences in the inspiring, The Martian due to hit theatres early October.Matt Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney. Watney along with a small group of other scientists are stationed on Mars when a storm prompts their evacuation. Through a series of events, his colleagues believe Watney dead as they execute their evacuation. But Watney is very much alive. Alive and alone on Mars. With little resources and materials, Watney sciences the poop out of his working assets in an effort to survive. He manages to relay a message back to earth but he is very much aware of the realization that any rescue effort or further mission to Mars is years away from actualization. Watney must live on his wits and faith in hopes that he may one day be reunited with species.The focus is clearly on Damon's character but maybe more interesting are the team of humans back on earth lead by Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels that attempt to science the poop out of things themselves in an attempt to orchestrate a spectacular rescue. Their pooling of minds will draw reference to NASA's brain trusts in Ron Howard's Apollo 13 and is riveting the exciting to watch unfold though the emotion of the colleagues.We'll leave the final chapters of the film to your viewing pleasure but make no mistake about it, The Martain is Ridley Scott's best film in years. Damon excels in the lonely character left abandoned. He carries the film with remarkable poise and the intelligence of the script by Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) is a marvel as to what man has and can accomplish when faced an unfathomable situation.The 3D imagery is spectacular and the special effects are sometimes toned and other times on the scale of a blockbuster big-budget extravaganza. But the film is rooted in the triumph of the human spirit. It's hard not to cheer or cry when we see a balls-out effort to what it takes, to use what it takes, to work tirelessly in what it takes to save one human life.The Martian is destined to be box office hit. Smart, funny, tense and drawing on emotion, it is easily one of the best films of the year and it is the type of film that might just have children once again naming 'astronaut' as the profession that they most aspire to. Yes, it's that good.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/",9,35,130,20 September 2015
The Island," Part 1984 and Logans Run with plenty of action to boot
","As a self proclaimed most hated man amongst critics in Hollywood, Michael Bay has done nothing over the years to deflect his growing reputation. His filmography reads like a loud speaker of summer trash including Bad Boys I and II, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Each of these films was panned by critics like Alaskan gold in 1896. Their success at the box office however is teetering on a money in the bank title as his last four ventures have all made over $100 million and if we include the foreign and DVD market intake, Bay has become the youngest and quickest director to ever become a Billion Dollar Man.The reason his films are so reviled by the print and entertainment media is due to the large scale productions brought to the screen with scripts as flimsy as a wet noodle and dialogue that leaves audiences groaning like Lurch when the doorbell rings. For explosions, car chases and pyrotechnics aside, you can only stand for so many 'Every night I watch the sunset and soak up every last ray of its warmth, and send it from my heart to yours' lines before your popcorn receptacle is turned into a barf bag.Well, Michael Bay is back on the summer bandwagon with his latest entry, The Island  his first film without the Jerry Bruckheimer producing credit behind his name. This extravaganza stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson (Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Girl with the Pearl Earring for those of you at home who don't readily recognize the names), as two humans who have been harvested as clones for potential organ usage. They live in a community that separates them from the rest of the world. They have the intellectual level of a fifteen year old and seem (in their minds) to exist with only the hope of winning a rigged lottery that would send them to an open air island, the only uncontaminated location in the outside world.But their suspicions and subsequent investigations reveal more then they imagined and they soon find themselves outside of the lab and on the run from the officials of the facility. Unfamiliar with their new surroundings, the two dodge various authorities while on the search for their sponsor (the owner of their organs) in an attempt to tell them the truth and hopefully reveal to the world the fact that they are more than brain dead embryos.The Island has two different and distinct parts. Part One stays with the science fiction elements of the harvesting human community. It is part 1984, part Logan's Run and is very successful in creating a world that is fascinating and futuristic but also alarming with the questions about human cloning that are ripped from today's headlines.But when the two escaped 'spare parts' find themselves in the big city, Michael Bay gets to take off the first hour shackles and do what he does best. Blow things up. In the last hour of the film, we definitely get what a summer film promises with explosions, helicopter chases, destruction on an unfathomable level and a spectacular car chase scene that is one of the best metal meets larger metal destruction scenes in many a summer.The result of the two parts being put together is Michael Bay's best film to date. That is not to say that I am running out to see the 127 minute film yet again, but unlike say Pearl Harbor or Armageddon, I didn't find myself shifting in my seat or looking at my watch wondering if I can endure the films final chapters. It is insightful  well, the first half  and incredibly entertaining  well, the second half. Not unlike Spielberg's Minority Report, The Island delivers an intelligent story surrounded by loud noises that will shake the foundation of my basement through a subwoofer when the DVD is released around Christmas time.So, I have to give Michael Bay a get out of jail free card for this 21st century fantasy. It was a wild ride that continues what I have felt to be a rather impressive summer of releases that above the mediocrity we are accustomed to from May until August. I do feel that the world is close to coming to an end since I appreciated a Michael Bay effort, but hey, if I can get the value out of the price of a ticket admission now a days, I am a happy camper.www.gregsrants.com",7,19,35,24 July 2005
