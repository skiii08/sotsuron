Men in Black 3," Job well done!
","Some people are giving this movie undeserved harsh reviews. Yes, the sequel was terrible, but I have to say this may be better than the first. MIB 3 lives up to it's predecessor's inventive alien creations, it's funny, it answers unanswered questions about J's and K's past. It has really good performances by Brolin and Schulberg (who plays th lovable and mysterious Griffin), and it does so in a very entertaining way. I was on the edge of my seat for all of the action sequences, and I was pleasantly surprised by Jermaine Clement's performance. Granted, his part was played for him mostly through CGI, make up, and voice modifications. I'll admit some of the segues to plot points are obvious and transparent, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! If you give it a chance, so will you.",7,0,3,15 June 2012
