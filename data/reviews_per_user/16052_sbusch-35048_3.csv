Source Code," Simple but effective
","Despite its short run time, Source Code manages to cover a great deal of exciting scenes and twists (some more predictable than others, but they are exciting and warranted nonetheless). Its best to go in knowing a minimal amount of what is going to happen. In fact, the movie itself is minimal, but by answering things that are usually important to the story at a rapid pace, the minimalist effect works well. Some may complain of the ending, but it works within the story well and leaves the audience with a large amount of space to think. All in all, an enjoyable ride that will leave you contemplating what you saw and satisfied with its workmanlike nature.",9,1,1,24 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," This movie made me feel like mr. Fahrenheit
","As a musician, the hardest thing for me is to let my music speak for me. I'm a little introverted, but after seeing this I cannot help but feel like breaking out of my shell and form the next Queen after watching this great film!
The movie had flaws if you want to nitpick, but it's quite entertaining. Every character felt real and fleshed out, and you couldn't help but feel for Freddie Mercury. The sound was incredible, especially at the end, see it in IMAX! I wouldn't be surprised if Bohemian Rahpsody was re-released again and hit #1 after this great movie. Maybe I'm speaking in hyperbole, but this is truly how I feel after watching this!",8,4,6,5 November 2018
X2: X-Men United," Way too much fun
","When I decided to watch this, I thought it would just be a fun diversion for a little over 2 hours. Turns out, it was a highly entertaining 2 hours that I do not regret. The movie may seem a little silly for non-superhero fans, but I think any veteran superhero fan will find it enjoyable; it is one of the best superhero films (maybe top 3 when it came out, now it's probably somewhere between 5-10). The film is more enjoyable if you've seen the first, but if you have to watch it without seeing the first, it probably would just seem mediocre. This is because it focuses on developing new characters more, while the story relies on characters developed more in the last film. In addition, the humor does not seem misplaced or overused (one of my problems with current superhero movies). People may not also like how there is not a clear cut protagonist, but I think that's kind of the point (hence the title). All in all, a really enjoyable movie that I definitely recommend.",9,1,1,23 January 2018
