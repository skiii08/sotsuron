Sucker Punch," Great action, choreography, cinematography and art direct all let down by possibly the worst story.
","Zack Snyder is one of my favourite directors at the moment, and on the directing front in this film he does quite well. However, the script and story for this film seem to be nothing more than a case for his crazy (but pretty awesome) fight sequences. Basically, Zack Snyder should stick to the directing and bring to life a story which showcases his talents better.It would have been better if it was higher age rated, like a 15 or 18 rating in the UK rather than a 12A.It's Watchmen/300 mixed with Dragon Ball Z or something. Quite fun to watch, but nothing more.",5,6,13,12 April 2011
Silence," Overly Self-Righteous & Dull
","I love almost every Scorsese film I've seen, but ultimately I found this one generally irritating. I guess it comes with the territory, but at times it was like being preached at. I found it to be overly righteous and self important, which wasn't helped by its staggering length...",4,11,17,26 November 2017
Moon," Simply Brilliant.
","This is a very complicated film with loads of things you might find yourself thinking about just to make sure you are still following. But I think when it all comes together this makes the film even better at the end.An amazing performance from Sam Rockwell and brilliant story and direction from Duncan Jones really make this film top quality, especially considering the low budget. I will be looking out for films from both of these people after seeing this film.I love the sense of injustice for Sam Rockwells characters and how the story doesn't go as you would expect sometimes which really keeps you glued to the screen.I would highly recommend this film to anyone especially those who enjoy sci-fi films and drama films.",9,3,5,26 July 2009
