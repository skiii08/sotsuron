Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely Hilarious
","I saw this movie on opening night (had to drive 40 miles to a theater that was playing it) and I was NOT disappointed. This movie was absolutely hilarious. I never liked 'Da Ali G', but this movie is non-stop laughs from beginning to end; the entire theater was laughing almost constantly. I won't spoil anything for the readers, but my fianc√©e and I spent the whole car ride home in tears laughing about different scenes from the movie. People who are easily offended should stay home, but if you've got a healthy sense of humor I highly recommend it. This is one movie that truly lives up to the hype. I'm planning on buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD.",9,4,13,4 November 2006
