Frost_Nixon," One of Howard's very best.
","I went to see this movie based on the reviews and the people involved (star and director) but after watching it I realize the subject matter is the least relevant thing about it. Simply put, this is a terrific character study that just happens to be about a former president and a celebrity interviewer, very much unlike, say, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BEJAMIN BUTTON which is all about its subject matter and a screenplay that's about nothing. I would have never imagined a portion of David Frost's life would make a worthwhile movie but the sections of this movie dedicated solely to him are just as interesting as Nixon's even though Michael Sheen sounds just like Austin Powers. In conclusion, this is a must see film even if neither Frost not Nixon sound like a couple of people you'd care to spend a couple of hours watching.",9,1,2,12 February 2009
The Incredible Hulk," OK but.........
","Not a bad film, specially compared to the 2003 stinker. The first 2/3 are the most exciting as the chase for Bruce Banner completely resemble the Bourne series (they even have a roof-top chase) but when Hulk and Abomination meet the movie becomes the usual, boring CGI extravaganza. The real problem at the core of this movie is the Hulk character himself: this is really one of the most boring comic characters ever. He becomes green creates havoc and destroys stuff. Big deal! Not a bad time at the movies and surely the best possible result considering the character's limits but please, have mercy and cut this series once and for all.",7,5,10,18 June 2008
Spartacus," Unjustifiably long
","After many failed tries of watching SPARTACUS, I notice it is being shown on TCM on Christmas day and sit through the 3+ hours. I realize a small screen / pan and scan version is not the way to watch this movie but I find it rather disappointing anyway, specially when comparing it to later films which it obviously influenced but also in which special effects were leaps ahead (Braveheart, Gladiator) and so was common sense. Here's why: 1) Plenty of action sequences take place off-camera, there is only one really big, epic battle. What we do get are endless talking scenes with very little dialogue spread over long stretches, in other words, the epic lenght is hardly justified. 2) Absolutely ridiculous scene in which Douglas addresses hundreds of thousands of people without the benefit of a single microphone. I guess off-camera he said something in the likes of 'pass it on'. 3) Also ridiculous scenes with thousands of death people, all with healthy looking faces, the same applies to SPARTACUS when he is being crucified, hardly showing any pain. 4) How can we admire SPARTACUS fighting skills when he doesn't even win any of the gladiator fights ? His ability in the training machine hardly counts. 5) I wish I could say I was moved by the leading lady's looks or presence but this was hardly the case. There are also scenes in which she is supposed to be carrying a well covered SPARTACUS' baby which looks so stiff it is more than obvious they filmed it with a doll. My recommendation, watch GLADIATOR or BRAVEHEART instead !",6,2,6,25 December 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Unintersting Basterds
","Just how far can a movie go overboard without looking downright silly ?. It's not that the excellent KILL BILL series didn't go take a similar path but I found the ending of INGLORIOUS BASTARDS so violent, so silly and so out of touch with any sense of reality I really lost all interest in the story. Additionaly I would have thought 'the Jew Hunter' would have been much, much smarter than to trust his life in the hands of the Basterds so when his fate comes I had no feelings one way or the other. Some of the dialog in this movie is as fun as that in the other Tarantino films but within a list of such, I have to place BASTERDS right above JACKIE BROWN but well below PULP FICTION, KILL BILL or even RESERVOIR DOGS.",6,2,8,11 October 2009
Hot Fuzz," Easy to love, easy to hate.....
","This may be my first time coming out of a movie and not knowing whether I loved or hated a film. On one hand HOT FUZZ gave me a headache with it's loud action and constant inclusion of loud noises, caused by close-ups of several artifacts, constantly shown to irritate the very uptight lead. On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!). In the modern Hollywood movie machine, the hardest thing to find is a comedy with actual laughs and HOT FUZZ is certainly that, just make sure to bring along a couple of aspirin if deciding to watch it.",8,1,2,27 January 2009
Terminator Salvation," I doubt they will be back........
","Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor, grab his shirt, throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators are too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.",7,24,47,1 August 2009
L.A. Confidential," An absolute knockout
","Much can be said about the 'catching lighting in a bottle' cast selection of this movie or its fantastic direction but LA CONFIDENTIAL's biggest merit is being the rarest of cases in which the most convoluted of the plots will have you confused and guessing 90% of the time but you'll still be enjoying it to 100% capacity. I've seen the film over a dozen times and every time I see it I realize something new (my level of the movie's understanding might be up to +/-95% by now). To think I wasn't interested in going to see this movie until word of mouth got me to ! Hard to believe there was somebody in Hollywood willing to take a chance on the unknown Australian actors for a major studio film's main roles but the results speak for themselves. One of the best movies of all time, period.",10,0,1,11 January 2009
Spider-Man 3," This could (and should) be the end of Spiderman
","Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad 'Three's company' episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1&2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1&2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system.",5,2,5,5 May 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," As good as the other two put together
","I found the interpretation of 'Extreme Ways' at the end of the movie far inferior to the original Moby version sang in the two other movies...... and that's about the only remotely negative thing I can say about this movie which action, from what I was able to understand, occurs between the Moscow and New York sections of Supremacy. I loved the way previous sequences got me guessing incorrectly about the final fate of a couple of characters (Nicki and the reporter). The incredible chase at the Waterloo station is as good as the one in Tangiers, as the ones in Madrid and New York, and so on.... I don't question the film makers ability to come up with a fourth movie but frankly Ultimatum ties up everything so nicely than I much rather they leave them at three. If they do (which I sincerely doubt) the Bourne trilogy will always be remembered as one of the best action series in film history.",9,1,3,8 September 2007
The Italian Job," My favorite caper movie
","This movie isn't Rocket Science, it isn't a great piece of art, it isn't THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA or the like. It has many, many similarities with the new OCEAN'S ELEVEN: a group of thieves unites to pull a caper with a charismatic lead, beautiful girl, computer nerd and several specialists in areas vital to the job's success. The cast isn't as renowned and neither is the director. Then why, somebody please explain, why this is a much, much better movie. Perhaps, better chemistry, perhaps a girl with with beauty out of this world, perhaps it's simply those charming mini-coopers that end up stealing the movie. Whatever the reasons, THE Italian JOB is a film that I've constantly watched on DVD after its release and can't help but enjoy tremendously every time.",9,2,3,16 August 2009
Quantum of Solace," How to fix James Bond for the next entry.......
","This is one of those movies you're not sure what to think of until some time passes from your first viewing. I believe the main reason that this series has been going for so long is that, when the producers have made a mistake on one of their films, they will show an open mind, come back the next time around and fix it. EX.: the sillier space sagas YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and MOONRAKER were followed respectively by ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, films in which Bond was brought back to earth; the outlandish DIE ANOTHER DIE was followed by the solid CASINO ROYALE and so forth. With this in mind, my suggestions for fixing the goofs on QUANTUM OF SOLACE are as follows: 1) Hire a real, renowned great singer, not one teens will dig (as far as I know, Shirley Bassey is still alive and these kids can't hold a candle to her). 2) Never again use the Bourne editing process, nobody likes it, period. You can't appreciate a great stunt when it cuts too fast to a next one which you don't end up appreciating either. QOS' editing all but itself sank it. 3) The gun barrel scene goes at the beginning, never again at the end. What the heck was the point in doing so ? 4) Go to any exotic countries you may like but use their most beautiful locales, not their ugliest. It's nice to find locations with 'flavor', not so good when they don't 'taste' so good. 5) If you want the audience to hate the villain, don't just imply he killed a beloved characters as in the case of Mathis and Agent Fields. Show it on screen so we can detest him properly and thus enjoy his doom. 6) When Bond kills the main villain show it. Don't just have him discuss it with his boss. 7) As bad as things might be for Bond on the movie. Give him a few scenes in which he might actually be happy. One of his main characteristics is his enjoyment of the good things in life (drink, food, girls and so on). 8) A follow up to 7: Bond must never say goodbye to the movie's main woman character in a car, in the dessert shaking hands or whatever. A body of water and heavy kissing have always been the norm (and worked out great as far as I can remember). 9) Take under consideration: hotels in the dessert are not flammable per se. 10) Bring back Moneypenny and Q. Their scenes always brought a smile to my face. Samantha Bond is more than adequate as the first but good luck finding someone to replace the beloved Desmond Llewlyn (but you have to do it anyway !). 11) Make sure the villain's evil plot is more evil and dangerous to world peace than simply leaving about a dozen people with funny looking hats, waterless, 12) Also remember, there are great film-makers, auteurs and directors who know how to make great Bond movies. Which have been the best of the recent ones ? : GOLDENYE and CASINO ROYALE. What do both of them have in common ?. Need I go on ? I'm sure you can afford the guy. By the way, QOS is OK. Had a sane editor cut it it would be above average for Bond, as it was it turned out below the median line. I guess you can say it is not as good as the sum of its parts and as such a wasted opportunity.",6,1,2,14 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Did it really have to be this awful ?
","I saw the play in London several years ago and even though it didn't strike me back then as a work of art, compared to this movie it sure felt like it. While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than pedestrian, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would 'accidentaly' fall in it and it's not like I was expecting anything close to great but the only thing I could say to my wife at the end of this movie was 'how come in movies where you don't want people to die they do while here, you wish everybody would died and nobody does'.",3,2,4,1 October 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," One of the all-time best made, bad movies
","Oscar nominations or not, this is the most boring movie I've seen since MEET JOE BLACK. It's sad to see so much talent and effort gone to waste but what exactly is appealing about this story ? Why on God's name would a little girl and a seemingly old man find themselves bonded to each other ? Why don't either Guiness or Ripley stop by when all that is here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room ! This movie has easily the best aging effects in history but you end up noticing you spend most of the time evaluating them instead of following the story which is the basic reason this movie fails.",4,18,34,17 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Oh my.......
","I can't remember this feeling of dread after leaving a movie theater since SE7EN and it's not that I don't think this is a fantastic movie, it's just that as much as I did read how intense it was before seeing it, I now realize I simply had no idea what I was about to go through. After a terrific chase scene involving several truck's and the Bat-cycle (or however you want to call it) I started to think perhaps we were at the end of the movie, little did I know the entirety of Act III was still ahead of us and with it the floor was about to be taken from under our feet again and again. When I saw the Joker coming out of a Hospital, dressed like a nurse and casually blowing it up I couldn't believe we were talking about a PG-13 movie (I guess we're way past post-9/11 sensibilities by now). Maybe repeated future viewings on DVD will soften the impact of this movie but if you haven't seen it, just know there are films 'not for children' and there is THE DARK KNIGHT, the most intense film I've seen in years.",8,4,9,19 July 2008
Taken," I was quiet Taken by it.
","We can negoti....booommm !........ This is one brief movie, so full of fights and action, you end up feeling they left in every kick-butt scene and took out some of the dialogue ones which could have given this movie more depth but hey, I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with a good dose of butt-kicking, specially when it's done this greatly, by terrific actors and for reasons you end more than caring about. Sure, everything goes just right for Neeson in his quest (it seems even Rambo would have more trouble reaching his objectives) and he definitely can't seem to be hit by any of the dozens of cars driving the opposite way or even by the hundreds of bullets shot at him but then again. Who cares ? My only 3 real complaints: 1) After substantially reducing Paris' population it seems hard to believe Neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist. 2) Who ended steering the boat when Neeson took out every living soul on it?, 3) How did the Sheik know exactly which of the 3-4 girls was Neeson's daughter ? 7-9-09 Another couple of additional complaints: 4) Liam Neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment, and listening to his daughter screaming out 'oh my God, they took her !', when in reality she yelled this out loud before Neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5) Neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport (prior to them both being photographed by the creep) is not there.",8,10,18,23 August 2008
Love Actually," Lust Actually
","There's plenty to love about LOVE ACTUALLY. It's just that I found a couple of the stories downright perverse. It may be convenient for the film never to show us where Keira Knightley's new romance will lead but nothing changes the fact that is not a love story but one of betrayal in which not much good will come out at the end; at least the Alan Rickman / Emma Thompson part is honest about its subject and what the consequences to his actions will eventually be for both of them. Further, what can you say about a story in which a girl is unfaithful to his boyfriend with his own brother ? The funny thing is that the filmmakers want to make us believe these are just different facets of love and for some reason, they time them at Christmas time, as if they would actually have anything to do with the real meaning of Christmas. Still, any movie in which Hugh Grant makes a convincing British Prime Minister can't be all bad. The truer love story in LOVE ACTUALLY ?: Laura Linney giving up on her dream for the sake of her brother, that part might just be enough to justify the title.",8,0,2,18 June 2009
The Proposal," Tired formula, boring stars.
","A long, long time ago I swore I would never to see another Sandra Bullock'romantic comedy'. After TWO WEEKS NOTICE, FORCES OF NATURE, MISS CONGENIALITY and so forth I thought enough was enough. Then THE PROPOSAL came along and, asides from a couple of good reviews, I also heard some pretty good word of mouth on it. Too bad, frankly speaking, word of mouth should have kept its mouth shut, THE PROPOSAL is just as bad as anything Bullock has ever done in the past except that now her looks are starting to go as well and by now she looks like she's Ryan Reynolds' aunt. Then there's lovable granny who takes Sandra to a strip joint for a never ending private dance and the love birds taking off their clothes (unaware of each other's presence), walking in reverse and ending up accidentally embracing each other naked in plain daylight (I guess the true odds of that were a bit remote). THE PROPOSAL is for undiscriminating romantic comedy lovers only, others beware !",3,6,8,7 July 2009
