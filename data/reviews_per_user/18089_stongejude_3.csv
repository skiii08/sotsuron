The Mask," Smokin'!
","This movie is a riot! Jim Carrey is at probably his best as Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask as he not only plays a relatable and sympathetic hero, he also plays an incredible comic relief character!",10,4,4,6 December 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Rushed
","This movie was solely made to compete with the better movie, Captain America: Civil War, the same year. It was literally built a long-standing rivalry between two iconic DC characters, despite this being the second film in the cinematic universe! And they just rushed the Doomsday arc at the last second to have a 'long-lasting impact'... despite resurrecting Superman two movies later! And don't get me started on Jesse Eisenberg's performance. He's more suited to play the goofball Joker, then the serious Lex Luthor.",1,4,9,11 November 2019
Evil Dead II," Better than the original!
","I love this horror comedy! It truly embraces the low budget of the the series, but actually uses it to it's advantage by making some of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen in a film.",10,2,3,9 October 2019
