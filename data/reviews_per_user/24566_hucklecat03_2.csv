The Hangover," It's About Dam Time!!!!
","God only knows when the last time I actually laughed at a 'comedy' film that I saw in the theater. Most 'comedy' films are full of poor acting, recycled garbage, terrible jokes and toilet humor. I mean, how many times can you see the same thing over, and over, and over again, before it gets as stale as a bag of month old potato chips?With that said, 'The Hangover' was BRILLIANT! Finally a comedy film directed towards a mature audience with mature humor. The characters worked extremely well together, and the plot was, actually interesting.So many comedy films these days are so, ridiculously, stupid, there isn't much of a plot at all, just lame jokes and cardboard acting. This film took it to the next level, and it's the first time, in forever, I can say I actually laughed out loud at a comedy film.OUTSTANDING!!! For MATURE audiences only",10,2,11,5 October 2009
Halloween," Absolutely Perfect!
","In my opinion, there is no better film in the horror genre than John Carpenter's 'Halloween'. The plot is so simple, yet so effective and eerie. (Man in mask, stalks teenage girls). Everything is effective in this film. The acting is very well done (especially for a horror film). The setting is perfect and Carpenter's score heightens the tension and suspense. Perhaps Carpenter's score is the crowning jewel in this film and is synonymous with the film. Although there is virtually no blood throughout the film, the audience can't help but think the murders are incredibly brutal and violent. Perhaps it's because Carpenter had no budget for this film, and therefore and had room for special effects or perhaps it was done by design, but directors of this genre should take a lesson from 'Halloween' Less is MORE! Halloween is a perfect horror film and one that should be in any horror buffs collection!",10,12,30,20 March 2007
