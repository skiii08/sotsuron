The Ring," The Ring is Originality At Its Scariest!
","The Ring is excellent in its ways to scare you. It frightens you with its mystery, and its scary images. The movie screams different sounds into your ears, and flicks out numerous pictures that will haunt you for days. The opening credits are.... in fact there are no opening credits, which was the first thing that I loved about this movie. The score by Hans Zimmer is also amazing, and creepy. The cast is pretty darn good in their roles, and the way this film was directed was genius. The ending is unpredictable, and I think it is also excellent. This is a movie that I think should be watched by anybody who is over 13, because if you are under 13, you may not sleep that night. This is a horror classic that will change the way you watch movies.4 stars out of 4",8,0,0,13 October 2002
Citizen Kane," News on the March: Citizen Kane is One of the Two Greatest Movies
","Citizen Kane is a masterpiece! It is one of the two greatest movies of all time; the other being Lawrence of Arabia. Some things in this movie are phenomenal, and that's why I like this movie so much.One thing that amazed me, and not finding out until listening to Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD, were the 'optical illusions' as I call it. One that I like in particular is the scene in Mr. Thatcher's story, the one part in 1929, when Kane walks to a window, and is below it, but when he walks back to the table, he is seen taller than the windows. Wow!Another thing is the scene in Charles childhood, when the camera is showing Mr. Thatcher and Charles' parents talking. In the background, in the mirror, is Charles still throwing snow outside. That showed how long of a take that scene had. Wow, again!Another thing was, and not finding out until watching The Battle of Citizen Kane, that this movie was based a lot on William Hearst's life. And also that this was Orson Welle's first film. Wow, to the third power!And one last thing is that I like the ending very much, but I won't give it away. So, see it for yourself; you won't regret it! Rating: 4 out of 4",Null,3,4,29 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A role model for all movies!
","I just saw this movie, 8 months after its original release, and I have got to say that this is one of the best movies ever made. It has all the qualities, of a movie, that I love. Some are that it is long, it is an adventure film, it is about a quest, and it has an excellent supporting actor, Ian McKellen, who should've won best supporting actor.This movie has great music and great cinematography, which I like the most about this film. The best, I think, are the shots that are far away from the fellowship, and show all of the scenery. These shots show us how beautiful, nice, dark, and crazy Middle Earth is. So, an A+ for that! The music plays well with the film, and that helped the film with some of its most dramatic scenes.Some films deserve to win Best Picture, but lose to another movie or never get nominated. Those films have been the better films, better than the ones that won. Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films. It will be remembered more than A Beautiful Mind, and will probably be voted one of the greatest films ever made! Rating:4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,18 July 2002
