Captain Phillips," Good, but not Great...no Castaway here.
","I liked the movie and the last 45 mins made it good. Up to that point, it was pretty uneventful. Just because this is a true story (critics seem to be the actual crew) this does not make it a great movie experience.True or not, I just could not get past how four men in a broken down boat could board a massive freighter. You telling be the massive Maersk company knowing there have been raids could not have a few armed guards for this territorial trip? That the crew who followed protocol could not at least try to pull the ladder at it latched onto the ship? Maybe I have watched too many movies where one guy takes out a crew, but this was hard to swallow...real or not. It took me out of the movie.This really was a kidnapper movie and the premeditated method of HOW to get the ransom money never discussed. It was all action without reason. After a while, how could you not ask these questions? Hanks played the role in subtle manner. No over acting here. The best acting was by the pirates...first time actors it seems. United 93 was far better as both an accurate film and entertaining by the same director.So, it was good, but not great.",5,10,23,21 October 2013
The Equalizer," Black Rambo
","Watching the end scene I thought how a man of color became a black Rambo and Denzel is just that in this movie. No hesitation accepting he had the skills much like the white Rambo in Taken. Men like Rambo movie no matter how they are the same picture painted with different colors. So what? This is a movie and nothing more. You have to suspend thought because it meets a visceral need to have power and control. It is as old as the day...to see justice in this lifetime.This movie like many others portray evil and the wicked heart of man, and in this sense, the movie was factual and accurate. This evil really happens. There is gospel in here if you look closely. Justice must be forthcoming or life is absurd. No, worse, life also then is evil if evil wins.In the end, it is instant gratification, and for men, these movies are essential because The Equalizer gets justice done so we don't have to in our own world. That's the gut or reptilian effect.On a pure acting note, another example of how character actors are the best and the dude you might meet at Home Depot or Lowes shopping probably has more acting chops that most A-list personalities. Take note Mr Willis next time generosity is called for. Support your local theater! Better yet, to the 5% who make the 95% of the money, just buy the theater and let upcoming talent do their thing.",8,2,5,2 January 2015
Lone Survivor," Watch Youtubes of Marcus on This Movie!
","If you have a problem with this movie, then watch the Youtube vids of Marcus about this movie. This intent was accuracy as the events unfolded. The language was meant to be very accurate. If you have any issues, it is all in direction.Did they really fall down the mountain like they did? Yes, they did fall, but the 'movie' might have made it look too Hollywood...well, it's a movie not a documentary, but they did fall down that many times. The injuries were accurate after the fall and how they died. Marcus was not on the hill when his Seal brother made the life saving call, but the gunshot wounds reveal how many times he was shot and it is not hard to deduce this scene. The call was verbally accurate.Wahlberg was decent, but average actor...he is more a personality. The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support. My main issue with Wahlberg was his acting chops when he was to act 'emotional' when caught. He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable. This is why he was so good in Shooter...did not have to display as much needed talent. Also...his monotone delivery is signature, but flip to any other movie he does (I was watching Planet of the Apes on TV a few seconds and it is the same character or Wahlberg being Wahlberg)...he needs to hit the classes and take it to the next level or just be satisfied until we all get tired of the repeat. Advice: look at what Matthew McConaughey has done past two years...do that! The end of the movie was most touching. These were the real men that gave their lives...they did not skimp here...they played it out and it made it impossible to leave theater...I teared up and it 'sealed' how real this movie was.",7,1,9,17 January 2014
Interstellar," Hated it but it was Good
","This movie was so slow and jagged like Inception...I felt much the same in that movie. It started so slowly...boring even...I text a friend about it in the movie...then it ramped up but the edits bounced too much from space ship to earth. I felt the establishing plot was not developed and I felt lost and bored most of the movie. The end was twilight zone powerful, but not enough to save this movie.My dad is aging so the wheelchair scene was hard and MC in the hospital. Adding of all actors Matt Damon was so bad. Really, MD? It took me way out of the movie. Casey Affleck was OK for his role, but Damon was too much. Hire someone else! Both actors chinked up for the roles.The concept and production brilliant...i didn't like the movie but lie with Inception it was genius to conceive and produce. C- at best",2,4,9,14 November 2014
Non-Stop," The worst yet slightly entertaining film ever made
","This movie was bad and went badder...just like my grammar! There is no way to justify this movie being made. Yet, it was still slightly entertaining. I love plane thriller movies. Airport blew my mind as a kid and scared the crap out of me. This is just a horrible movie. Call it a paycheck movie for name actors on the downward slope of their careers. How was this green lighted by studio execs? If this was made for TV movie it might be acceptable for a 2am showing, but as a major motion picture? There is a reason I never heard of this movie even though Liam Neeson starred and is a hot ticket since Taken. IMDb did not do me a favor with an average vote of 7 rating. Please.",1,6,11,13 June 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Huge Disappointment! Lame Story?
","Big fan of the original three movies, especially the first two. Refused to see the Burton remake and hesitated to see this one. A friend said it was very good. Read IMDb reviews and was impressed. Saw the film.Ugh! Really? Half the movie is still developing plot. Slow and boring. The fact is the plot of an intelligent chimp through drugs (a monkey version of the film Limitless) could have taken 30 mins at most.The CGI apes were bad as well. The original movie looked WAY better! The only good thing was the facial gestures of the monkeys, especially Caesar, but they looked too human in that regard. Very disappointing. Monkeys flying and swinging was so computerized and for this to be accepted it tells me a new generation of young movie goers accept this dribble. That is regression in my book! When in doubt, add eye candy to keep the male viewers attention w/Will's g/f. The lead acting was terrible, especially David Oyelowo as Jacobs. Franco needs to slow down and focus on one project at a time. He seems half present as the story rolls on. Brian Cox and John Lithgow were miscast.One of the worst scenes that told me the director was a goof had to be the stolen classic line from the original...it was so bad and comical the only reaction was insult. This would be poor in a local community play, but a major motion picture? Bad movie overall. If movies like Avatar and Rise are good, then my movie enjoyment will decrease with this type of genre.",2,3,8,1 July 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Excellent...Renner fills big shoes
","The opening scene is just studly. Jeremy Renner walks out of 45 degree water...walks out of. There is a great little IMDb short on this scene worth viewing. Matt Damon owned this genre (the Richard Chamberlin Bourne movie from the late 80's was really good)so Renner will always be compared to Damon. He was the perfect choice.This movie has a similar feel to Shooter for me. I can watch it a few times a year. Just satisfies. The only flaw was the most overrated actor now in Hollywood, Ed Norton. He along with James Woods are the boring actors who try to have more screen presence than they can. Dude has no Q factor for me. Was amazing in his earlier movies and History X, but not in this role.",8,1,2,19 December 2014
Back to the Future Part II," Did Anyone Note the Smart Phone in 1989???
","In the opening scenes,Doctor Emmett Brown at 7:46 holds up a device that looks just like a smart phone. It is crazy. There is no way in 1989 the producers could ever imagine in the future there would be a device that looked exactly like this and it would be a phone! It's really eerie when you think about it. This is a movie about the future and it is 2015, and he is holding a device exactly like we use today in 2015. At 7:53 in the movie he holds it up and we see some hot chicks (that will always be a constant) and he might as well be holding my LG Smart Phone...it looks exactly like it. Weird right? If they only knew what they stumbled upon. There is some prop dude that was brilliant. Who knew...maybe an engineer was a fan of these movies and copied the design? Likely! Some dude had to come up with a prop and he might have been the inspiration of a phone revolution. That's history.",8,0,0,19 July 2015
Flight," Brilliant...you have to be there to know
","This movie captures the essence of addiction and any review that says otherwise is simply a reflection of those who do not get it or refuse to get it. And the movie captures this essence as well. We are always the last to see ourselves. The music score is perfectly layered.The casting for this movie was perfect. Kelly Reilly was brilliant...I mean really brilliant. John Goodman was slightly over-the-top but used with precision to lighten the mood. Peter Gerety as the owner of the airline was instantly believable. Don Cheadle use of subtlety in his performance noteworthy. Alan Silvestri's soundtrack haunting. Mr Washington is amazing. Denzel just knows his craft. When someone is this good, I just relax and like a beautiful sunset, I can only admire and give thanks. Yeah...I dug this flick!There are millions of alcoholics and even more so in denial of living the illusion of being in control. Add the addicts of other forms of substance and we have a whole lot of people addicts to something.How any review can be negative about this film is beyond me. The film portrays the insanity of addiction, that despite a crash, the desire to drink is not quenched, in fact, it escalates. Guilt and resentments fuel addiction. Denzel was brilliant here as was the writing and direction.Arrogance is the only power a guilty man can stand on, and once that ladder is climbed, the top is about to peak, and quickly. Then there is a time when the lies must stop. One must accept the consequences. This is like the person arrested and says they are glad the police showed up. They were ready to let a 'power greater than them self' take over.Many reviewing this have addictions, but with different consequences. Shopping, gambling, sex, food (the number one addiction) can be equally as powerful in a person's life, but with different outcomes. At the core, the addiction is fueled by the same elements, some form of brokenness. Life in a fallen world. The key is repentance or a change of heart to seek God. We do not seek God out of His love for us, but out of pain and the need for rescue. Our hearts are that hard. Do you understand that? If not, continue on, by His grace you might have life.When one says I am a grateful alcoholic, they mean if it weren't for that addiction they would not have found grace, so in a twisted irony, those with the 'lesser' addictions might be worse off for they believe they are in control and live in their illusion.",10,3,7,18 November 2014
Contact," WAY Better than Interstellar
","This movie had a soul. it did not get bogged down in slow, methodical details and this is the difference between two great directors, one being Christopher Nolen and the other Robert Zemekis. Matthew McConaughey is the same...he was out starred. His services fill the scenes, but could have been better cast. Also James Woods sucks...smart man, lousy presence. Another actor would have filled the role in better and that is what a movie is about. See Flight for perfect casting. The message is significant...look up and not at what is before us...yet, this opens the doors to apologetics, epistemology, and ontology. In a word, Jesus. If people took the Bible seriously, the light of the eyes and mind would open. Most judged book by those most ignorant.",8,2,3,15 December 2014
