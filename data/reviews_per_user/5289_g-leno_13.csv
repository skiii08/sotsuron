The Avengers," Pretty much perfect!
","The only fault that this movie has is that its not long enough! The fights are great. Seamles panning through the war zone with ultra cool set pieces that are just used as fillers! Most movies would kill for some the little bits as the best thing in their whole film. Cap bouncing iron man's repulsors off his shield and taking out the enemies is just one example of this! Hulk steals the show probably because most people enjoyed the iron man and Thor stand alone films more than the others and thus expect them to be the best characters.Every character has their time in the spot light, and the only one that could have had a bit more action is Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury.Easily the best film of 2012, and for me, the best film i have seen since The Lord of The Rings! Bring on Avengers 2! i'm sure it will Destroy Justice League at the box office!",10,1,3,31 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dreadful, Geoge Lucas should refund everyone for this.
","I will never watch this film again, I have only seen it twice, once at the cinema way back then, and once recently to check that it really was THAT bad. The only reason I did not give this a score of 1/10 is that i believe no film deserves that as it takes time and effort to make any film.Ray Park was the best thing about this film, and when the best part only says 3 lines, its got to be bad. the special effects were brilliant for their time, but now are nothing special so don't add anything to the (bad) experience of watching it.Anyone who gave this film more than a 4/10 is a fan-boy (or girl) of epic proportions. I would rather spend a day watching Twilight playing on loop for a day than watch this again. For the manual on how to ruin one of the greatest sagas on film, contact George Lucas. Disney cannot possibly any worse than this!",2,2,5,24 November 2013
Iron Man 3," I think its the best Iron man movie yet!
","First of all, let me say that all of the people out there who write reviews saying 'just another stupid comic adaptation', Stop watching these movies if you don't like the whole genre! About the movie. Great comedy moments lighten the mood from time to time as the body count is pretty high for a 12 rated movie. People who like the dark knight trilogy because its 'dark' even though no one dies will find this great. This film has it all, great special effects, action sequences, comedy and concepts.Its Main bonus that it has over the other two installments is that is not just another bad guy in a rip off suit. Those looking for another Avengers will be expecting too much, and may well be disappointed, but they need to save the team ups for Avengers 2! My only fault in this movie was the lack of scenes with Rhodey in his suit, War Machinedeserves more screen time! In summary, not a 10/10 like Avengers, but a very worthy addition to the Marvel cinematic universe.",9,3,14,26 April 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Winter soldier, best movie this spring!
","I was so very happy with this movie, I walked out of the cinema feeling that it was probably the best way I could have spent my evening.Chris Evans has hit his stride in the role of Captain America. Every time he plays Steve Rogers, he gets better at it. The first avenger was a shaky start, with many characters being introduced and never being given any more to do or say in the film. In the Avengers, he comes forward as the tactical mind of the team, but is overshadowed by the ego of the powerhouse characters. This film however gives him the full attention while still managing to develop Black Widow, Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., and do a more than decent job of introducing Mackie's Falcon.I really enjoyed the way that the plot moves and shifts, making this so much different from many other comic book movies. The focus is on plot, characters and back-stories as much as the action, although there is still plenty of action too. Well choreographed fights, excellent visual effects and innovative ideas for gadgets and missions in the film make for a thrilling ride of a movie I hope that this level of quality continues to come from Marvel Studios, and as long as it does they will have the monopoly on the summer blockbusters for the foreseeable future. Bring on Guardians of the Galaxy!",9,3,6,5 April 2014
Man of Steel," Nowhere near as bad as a lover feared
","I was dreading this! A 'realistic' Superman? How is that possible? that'll be nothing like the comics I love!? Well, i came out of the cinema feeling pretty good about it! Firstly the criticisms. I wasn't impressed that superman kills, thats against everything he is supposed to be. Secondly The absence of the classic score that still rouses my spirits whenever i hear it, was sorely missed. Lastly my minor quibble that i don't think it would have been worse to have an older style brighter costume.On to the good points! The opening of the movie on Krypton is Jaw dropping! Any sci-fi movie would have been proud of that 10 minutes of footage! Russel Crowe was great and it gave a good setting for the rest of the story. The fight sequences are very well made and utilize great special effects to make the super powers look very real.To avid comic readers, there will be a lot of flaws to spot, but to Joe public, i think this will be a hugely enjoyable blockbuster. I just hope they lighten the mood (and costume) if they make a justice league film off the back of this. A solid 8/10 from me, just not as fun as Avengers Assemble.",8,0,2,21 June 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," This is the new benchmark
","What is the point of continuing to make films when you have made an action packed extravaganza like the Avengers already? The answer is so that you can produce a film like Guardians of the galaxy! Essentially, Guardians is everything that was right about the Avengers, minus what was wrong with it (not that there was much wrong with it).The story is extremely well paced, with no time to get bored between the action scenes as these are separated with essential plot details and very amusing comedy lines. The villain does not get to do much, but this film has to introduce so very many characters, locales, items and ideas that the lack of development for the bad guy can be expected and not judged to badly.Rocket and Groot steal so many of the scenes that it automatically makes them the easiest characters to love, but Pratt's Star Lord is still a great character perfectly cast. Gamora was not as lethal as I would have liked, but was still well played and Dave Bautista As Drax is the best performance i have seen from a wrestler, being better than even Dwane Johnson.The special effects are visually stunning, with lots of colour and detail in the environments. Rocket and Groot look amazing and the first proper look at Thanos was also pleasing. Even the make-up effects look good, when added to the performance of Micheal Rooker, you get even better supporting characters to compliment the main cast.If the success of Avengers gave Marvel the confidence to make this relatively obscure comic into a film, then i hope that this film brings in the kind of money that proves it was the right choice so that more brilliant characters can be shown to the general public. Marvel, Please keep making films of this quality!",10,3,8,2 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Superb Heroes
","Jumping right in to the action, this is one heck of a thrill ride only slowing the pace for a few moments to give a little back story to several characters that have not had their own film, and the new characters. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely, with one in particular that had me grinning like the Cheshire cat.Fans of the Marvel movies will already know what to expect from Thor, Iron man and Captain America, and the real delight for me came from the new arrivals, especially Paul Bettany as Vision.The Real highlight for me was the villain Ultron. The way he looks and moves combined with the amazing voice from James Spader gives Ultron real screen presence and a great sense of menace that sets it apart from other robots in film.The only thing I would have changed in this movie was to give Anthony Mackie a bigger part in it because i really enjoyed his performance in Captain America: the Wintrr Soldier, and was disappointed not to have him alongside Chris Evans again where he seemed to fit perfectly in his previous appearance. Vastly enjoyable film for all except the art crowd.",10,48,97,24 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Totally overrated
","Quite possibly the most over hyped and overrated pile of junk in my lifetime.Batman Begins was a fine movie and apart from the frankly terrible scarecrow, was an enjoyable watch.The Dark Knight was hailed as as masterpiece, I disagree. Heath Ledger was not a Joker. If it had been a villain called something else i would not have had a problem but this is so far away from the source material that it makes no sense for them to even refer to him as the joker. Jack Nicholson was better in every way. Two face was good but hardly used at all. On top of all of that the whole idea of making a film about a comic book 'realistic' is pointless, the whole idea of batman is unrealistic, just the way it should be.To all those people who say 'this film is darker which makes it better' you are all forgetting what happens, the joker actually dies in the 1989 film, no one dies in this.If you are a fan of classic batman, DO NOT watch this film, stick with the vastly superior Tim Burton film!",3,5,9,31 December 2012
Inception," What is the big deal?
","This is an entertaining film with a clever plot and interesting ideas, but why do people rave about it being the greatest film of the decade? It really is no more revolutionary than the Matrix was in the 90's, it most definitely is not as masterfully made as the Lord of the Rings films, and the action is no better than any other sci-fi or super-hero film that comes out.As said, I enjoyed the film and is certainly enjoyable, but I would not be eager to watch it again as I don't think it is one of those films that can be watched over and over. Is it just the legion of Nolan fans? Or am I missing something that makes people give this a 10/10?",7,1,1,29 June 2014
The Wolverine," Not the greatest film ever, but an entertaining action flick
","I am one of the people that like X-men origins: Wolverine, and i was looking forward to this film a lot! I would like to say it lived up to my expectations,but i'm not sure that it did. There are a few massive plot holes but i don't worry about that too much when watching a movie based on a comic book.There are less memorable bits in this than origins, but the action sequences are big and bold and very well done. The touch of violence and humor goes well with the setting in Japan being serious and organised. The villains are a bit one dimensional but really, who cares? Its a Wolverine film and i would go and see a sequel without hesitation.If you are not a fan of comic book movies or action films in general, then don't bother with this, but for an evenings enjoyment, its well worth it. Bring on 'days of future past', cant wait!",7,1,4,29 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Could have been so much worse, could have been better too.
","I did not expect too much from this film after hearing some bad reviews, but it was a watchable film that has moments of what could be great content but gets let down a moment later. There are some masterful shots in this movie that look simply amazing. The CGI is very good with only 2 seconds of Doomsday footage looking a little fake, other than that, no complaints about the look of the visuals.Ben Affleck is a very good Batman and is also pretty good as Bruce, which has not been done since Keaton in 'Batman'. Henry Cavil is still looking good as Superman, and acts well considering the sloppy script/story which I will come to later. Gal Gadot was surprisingly good as Wonder Woman. I was not a fan of the decision to cast her when first announced but she made the role her own and I have high hopes for her solo film. As a core to the film, these actors rescue the film from a deluge of problems that could have destroyed any chance the movie had of being good. Eisenberg's Lex Luthor is frankly the worst part of the film. Every time he starts to build a sinister presence, it is ruined by a silly childish line or action. The plot is all over the place, with unnecessary dream sequences, shoehorned in cameos and supporting roles and plot holes and character inconsistencies that make no sense. I read comics, lots of them, and I was expecting some changes to the characters so I was not too bothered by the changes that were made. What I was annoyed by is the huge inconsistencies in Superman and his powers. Now I understand that without toning his powers down we would not get a very good movie, but how can he react fast enough to catch a bullet yet not react fast enough to avoid gas spaying out of said projectile. Then he gets suckered in to the same thing again 2 minutes later. He seemed to forget that he has x-ray vision in 80% of the film, never used his speed for any real advantage and they also seem to have written out his freeze breath. I also have no idea why a nuclear blast would even bother Superman let alone virtually kill him.All in all, this is one Superman fan who wanted so much more than Batman promotional material and an hour of set up for the justice league film. 6/10.",6,5,9,3 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," game changer, but the saga peaked at the start
","There is no denying that this film was the start of something big, and you cannot take away from it the fact that it changed the face of the sci-fi genre, maybe even the whole film industry, in to what it is today. For its time, the effects, story, characters and detail in this film are are beyond exemplary. Most action and sci-fi films aim to be compared to star wars, a feat that is rare and, in my opinion, has only been achieved by Terminator 1 and 2, the lord of the rings trilogy and marvels: the avengers.A new hope works brilliantly as a first chapter to a saga, however, I feel that it works better as a stand alone film. Unlike many films that are a 'first part', it has a beginning, middle and end, tells everything that needs to be told and leaves the characters in a satisfying place. I feel that having seen the prequels does not diminish anything about this film like it does to episodes five and six.The only problem that I have is that the original theatrical release doesn't really exist anymore, you can only really get the version that has been tinkered with by Lucas to put needless CGI extras in. This is the original and best of the star wars saga, however i do feel that many people see this through rose tinted glasses and will not see any faults in any of the three original films, even though they are happy to say that the three prequels do not exist as far as they are concerned. Awesome film, great legacy, and now that Disney has the rights away from Lucas, a great future too.",9,6,10,21 November 2013
Deadpool," not just flogging a Deadpool!
","Like many other people who read Deadpool's (mis)adventures on a monthly basis, this film had a lot to live up to to make me happy. Getting the right blend of over the top violence and gore, crude jokes and 4th wall breaking references was never going to be easy, but it has been achieved with great success! The film is consistently funny from start to finish as long as you have the right level of maturity or aren't prudish.Ryan Renyolds is perfect as the regeneratin' degenerate, delivering gags as fast the the bullets are coming from the various guns, and DP's wingman Weasel is not short of wit either. One of the best things here was Colossus and Negasonic teenage warhead appearance, which gives not only more options for characters for Deadpool to mock, but also gives the movie the feeling of being a part of a bigger universe in the same way as the Marvel studios movies do.If there is one thing that I must criticise about this film, its that sometimes, the switch between the action to the origin flashbacks don't feel fluid, leaving the audience wanting more of the action, but instead just jumping back in time in what feels like the worst time. This could be to highlight how disjointed Wade's mind is though so I'll let it slide. Bring on the sequel! 9/10 for pure entertainment, I mean, why else would you watch a film if not to be entertained?",9,8,22,13 February 2016
