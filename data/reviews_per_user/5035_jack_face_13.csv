The Avengers," A mix of the Ultimates 2 comic and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
","I saw it in 2D. It's a combination of The Ultimates 2 comic book and the second half of Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The concept is almost right out of the comic (the comic is far superior) and just like the Transformers movie, the second half is all action with otherworldly technological beings destroying the city in a battle against heroes trying to protect people and ward off the baddies at the same time.Remember that scene where Sam Witwicky was running through all the destruction and he was jumping over cars and stuff like you've never seen him do before and wouldn't expect him to do in the first place? There was a damn near identical scene with Captain America doing the same damn things but you expect him to be able to do what they were showing. Remember how Shockwave and his Driller were plowing through buildings and causing total destruction? The Asgardian ships from Loki's army did the same thing. Remember how Starscream got damaged by Sam and they made him look like a total wuss during his death scene? Loki got his ass handed to him and totally embarrassed by the Hulk. Remember how they opened a portal to Cybertron and things didn't quite work out? Same damn thing happened here with Asgard.The big secret of the movie that was on my mind the whole time was who was Loki getting help from. After the first credits, that was revealed and it's a pretty big deal for long-time Marvel comic readers. It's equivalent to the last scene in the last episode of the Wolverine & The X-Men cartoon. Unlike that, where we'll never get a second season to continue that story, Avenger's 2 has the potential to be an even bigger, better movie if they do it right. The whole Asgard/Earth thing has played itself out in the animated Marvelverse movies and cartoons to the point of them needing to do something new and move on. I never saw Iron Man 2 and don't ever plan on seeing it but it does help to have seen the Marvel movies to have a better understanding of what's going on in this one because there are references and flashbacks. The scene after the full credits is short and only meant to be humorous.Unlike someone I know who said to not pay for this movie, I'd say it's definitely worth paying for. It's a popcorn flick and high on entertainment. There were only a few cuss words so kiddies might enjoy it if they have the attention span (and most don't) to handle the pacing of the movie in the second half. There aren't any over-extravagant Mark Millar stunts and it's not too technical. It's a fairly simple movie that's easy to follow as one can expect from a Marvel comic book movie. If there are any comparisons of this to The Dark Knight because of its box office take, squash that out of your mind. There's absolutely no comparison of any kind to the DC movie other than the fact that they're both based on comic book material.I give the movie 8 out of 10 stars and I rate it that high for its entertainment value. You get your money's worth from this flick and it's deserving of all of its success. One thing I noticed that most people probably haven't is the title. When it opens and even during the rolling credits, it's called 'Marvel's The Avengers.' They've clearly got Tyler Perry syndrome; as if anyone is gonna mistake this for the British TV show or its film adaptation. I guess they gotta cover their bases.",Null,1,5,23 May 2012
Inglourious Basterds," I'm no longer a Tarantino fan after watching this.
","I can safely say that I'm no longer a Tarantino fan. Looking back from Jackie Brown to Pulp Fiction to this, I wasn't impressed. One could call this Gratuitous Basterds because a lot of the violence was graphic and over the top, which I don't mind at all, but a lot of it was unnecessary. Movie starts out REALLY, really slow to the point where I was starting to fall asleep. Nothing but table dialogue. Like any movie, it had its moments. I think because this drags out so much is what hurt it for me. If it would've moved a bit faster, I think I would've enjoyed it. Brad Pitt's absurd voice aside, the only other character that was really enjoyable was Hugo Stiglitz. Didn't have much for screen time or dialogue but his appearances and intro were significant enough that he stood out more than most of the other Basterds and characters in the movie. I was really disappointed when they killed him off. Would love to see a movie strictly devoted to him because I like the character that much.Not much for chicks here but the ones they did have were pretty tight. It's a mostly white male cast and the only black character in the whole movie seems to have lived after the ridiculous movie theater massacre climax. How fitting. Scalpings, chokings, carvings...the violence was pretty graphic when it was on display but it wasn't enough to save this flick. Hitler dying by gunfire in an exploding, flaming movie theater is probably gonna stick with the uninformed who'll think this movie is factual. I give it 5.5 out of 10. Tarantino fans and simpletons who are easy to please and don't require much in the way of plot won't be disappointed. Those who want a little more entertainment will be.",Null,7,13,30 December 2012
Orphan," Finally, an American movie that's worth bragging about.
","I wanted to pay to see Orphan but when I finally found time to see it, it was already pulled from theaters or was playing in theaters that were too far away from me. I just had a feeling this would be a good movie and it was. And it would have been worth paying for too. I liked every single thing about it except for the climax. It was way too 80's horror movie style, gotta have a one-liner to end things type deal. I didn't like it. It didn't fit the suspense of the rest of the movie. The title character was totally out of character in that final scene. I was disappointed with it.The movie poster, tag line, dialogue, acting, plot, exposition, cinematography, camera angles...all of it is good. This movie is a really good effort by the practically newbie writers and director. Their future can only shine brighter. People compare this to Mikey, The Good Son, and other killer kid movies. This stands alone in visual and script quality. Isabelle Fuhrman totally owns her role. I don't know how she can possibly top this movie because as far as I'm concerned, she'll forever be known as the Orphan chick. But she's young and I expect good things from her if she chooses the right roles. Even the makeup in this movie is good. Changing from innocent girl to seductress to psychopath ain't easy to pull off, plot or otherwise. But this movie pulls it off. The acting and attention to detail with the makeup and scenery helps a lot. Well done.If you can, see this movie. It's a gem. Does it have sequel potential? Possibly. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. It's not perfect but for what it is, it's an impressive effort minus the original ending. Did I mention that the original ending totally sucks? Oh, I didn't? Now you know that it does. But enjoy the rest of it.The alternate ending should have been the theatrical cut. It makes tons more sense and is much better overall for closure regardless of it being left open for a sequel that will probably never happen since Isabelle Fuhrman is only getting older. Either way, the movie is definitely worth watching, especially with the deleted scenes if you can catch this with the alternate ending on Blu-ray. Very enjoyable movie. I'd watch it again. It's that good. Scrap the theatrical cut, go for the alternate ending and watch it with the deleted scenes already cut into the movie. I can't stress that enough.",Null,0,0,20 January 2012
Warrior," Worth seeing but prepare for disappointment.
","There were some very strong and emotional moments and again, it makes you look at yourself and your personal and family relationships. This is a very powerful movie in more ways than one. You'd think it's all about MMA and fighting and all that but that's just a subplot. There will be those similarities to The Fighter and they're justified. The difference is you already know exactly how Fighter is gonna end. With Warrior, the first 2 acts of the movie are perfect in almost every way. Gavin O'Connor is a very capable writer and director and I'll be peeping more of his work later. But the last act is what disappoints here because it goes from perfection to predictability. I'd love it if they'd have gone a different route to the happy ending than what they did here. It's pretty much cookie cutter and deviates from everything that came before it in regards to style and realism.There was a scene where Joel's character lied to his wife. He told her he was a bouncer when he was really fighting to make extra money. My problem with it is there was no consequence to the lying. They made it seem like it was no big deal because they needed the extra money the fighting brought in but a lie is a lie and it is a big deal because what if he'd gotten hurt or died? They already established that he got severely injured in a fight before and his family was struggling. What would happen to them if they lost his income and now had to cut and scratch to pay his medical bills in addition to the bills they already couldn't pay? There is no advantage to the lie he told in the movie and in real life, there's no advantage to lying to someone about something not worth lying about. He may have done it so his wife wouldn't worry but if he'd kept up the charade and things didn't go as planned or if she found out through other means, wouldn't that have been worse? This movie failed to show consequence and I want that to be known.On the flip side, the theme and some of the plot really revolves around the consequence of alcoholism. When you take a certain route in life, and it's a bad one and you know it, and you still choose that route, then you deserve all of the bullshit that comes from it. Nick Nolte played a recovering alcoholic and it fractured his family. As a result, he lost them. Circumstance created a chance for him to get back what he lost but that didn't happen and I applaud the filmmakers for that. A confrontation between him and Tom's character in a casino was quite strong. Tom carried a boatload of animosity and took it out on Nick. It was hard to watch someone take that kind of verbal abuse but at the same time, Nick created that for himself due to his past actions so it was hard to sympathize with him. My point is, when you make what's clearly the bad and wrong decision, you earned and deserve the consequence, and this aspect of the movie came through loud and clear.I really wish this movie didn't take the typical Hollywood route for its ending. Kurt Angle played a beast of a fighter yet he was defeated by Joel's character who wasn't built up to be a beast or a beast defeater. Nor was his trainer. Tom's character was. Nick was his trainer and he was too. Their path to victory was defined and believable. Joel and Tom played brothers and both had reasons for fighting and winning. That don't mean they should have pit them against each other in the finale. There could have been different plot devices used that could have led to one or both of them accomplishing their goal but not necessarily in the ring. Kurt's and maybe another character could have been used to make that happen. As it stands, as you watch the last part of the movie, you can see what's about to happen and you become disappointed because you went through all that good stuff, that great journey, only to be given what every other movie of this type gives.I'd hope there's an alternate ending to this with deleted scenes that tells a different last act because this movie could have been something near perfect and great. The story, the acting, the everything was great. Can't stress that enough. It's just the last act, man. It destroys a good thing. Gavin has a bright future ahead of him, that's for sure. I'd like to see him have the opportunity to do something unconventional and non-Hollywood. Something where his writing and directorial skills can shine properly if he's capable of it and I think he is based on this alone. Let the man tell his stories the way they need to be told, Hollywood, and that goes for all filmmakers who are being restrained by the system. Let's get America back to making respectable movies. Definitely go see Warrior and be completely entertained by the first 2 acts if you like dialogue, a slower pace, and solid acting but you've been warned about that last act. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. Woulda been higher if not for, well, you already know.",Null,6,15,16 September 2011
District 9," Original and that's rare.
","For this movie's budget, it was visually stunning and very impressive. Acting was good too. Plot was totally original which is rare these days. It was a good little movie, moved very fast, slightly absurd and darkly comedic in places. Special effects were top notch for what this movie cost. It ended with sequel potential. Characterizations were decent as later the focus shifted to one human and one alien.About the only complaint I really had was they never explained the reason why the aliens actually came to Earth and were malnourished. Later, I thought they'd reveal it but it was just a plot device to drive the story. The 20-year timeframe wasn't well delivered either. Unless mentioned, the movie seemed like it moved in a few weeks or months rather than 2 decades. I saw no reason why the aliens had to live in squalor. Plus the language barrier, or lack thereof, was never explained as to how it was overcome as no human ever spoke alien language but could understand them fully. I'll chalk that up as one of the absurdities. Why'd the aliens stay for so long? 'Why' seems to be the big question that's never answered. But I don't think they really wanted to. Needed to, yes, that would've been nice. Wanted to; if they would have, the movie would've been a lot longer and a totally different experience. All the stuff that was left out because the movie moves so fast could be revealed in a retrospective featurette, possibly on the DVD. Then the 2nd movie, if any, could be the return of the alien species; either malevolent or benevolent. Either way, I'd like to know the answer to 'why.' It's the only headscratcher in the whole movie.That aside, if you're a bonehead, like my friend who calls this flick 'cinematic trash,' who doesn't understand the type of story the director is trying to tell or needs a simple plot to enjoy a movie, then don't bother with this. You could get lost if your brain is slow because this movie does move very fast and uses very different expository techniques as it shifts from a documentary style at the beginning where the characters acknowledge the cam to traditional methods where you just kick back and watch things unfold. I liked it. Can't say I was expecting what I got and that's a good thing. It's original.",Null,2,3,30 December 2012
2012," Awesome special effects, lousy everything else.
","I knew ahead of time I wasn't gonna pay to see 2012. First off, this is a Roland Emmerich movie. I know not to expect much beyond the special effects which are about as top notch as you can get. Acting is acceptable. Good theme. Plot is pretty weak though. It's like, so textbook and predictable. I mean, are you really gonna sit still and argue about the right and wrong of humanity and risk lives in the process when you can move your butt and save some instead? Your ex-wife's new boyfriend really had to die because you couldn't save him and now you're a happy family again now that he's out of the picture? People paid for their lives to be saved and almost all of them get left behind? Your driving skills are so awesome that you can dodge collapsing roadways and pyroclasts? Your flying skills are so awesome that you can dodge collapsing buildings and one of the largest sandstorms in the history of the world? Come on, now. Way too fake for me. Enjoy the special effects and the accompanying ride but you've been warned about some of the predictability and unrealistic stuff. I give it 6 out of 10 stars. The special effects are responsible for most of that.About the only thing I took from this movie is an idea for another type of end of the world movie. One where people flee the planet but some stay behind. Those that stayed behind and survived start over with new laws, leadership, culture, beliefs, etc. Those that fled and return have to conform to these new ways and accept their new position in the world since the old way is unacceptable now and the old guard has no power. Out with the old, in with the new. Guaranteed conflict. If my plate wasn't full and overflowing, I'd write it myself.",Null,3,4,20 January 2012
Avatar," Don't bother wasting your time.
","Like almost everyone else alive, I was looking forward to Avatar but I wasn't going on opening day or even opening week. I waited and lucky me, when I went to see it in IMAX 3D at 10am on a Saturday morning, there weren't even 30 people in the auditorium. Clean, comfy, and quiet. Just the way I like to see my movies that I pay for. Online ticketing was trying to charge me 15 bucks plus service fee. I paid at the box office because I knew it wasn't gonna sell out like it did the night before when I really wanted to go. 9 bucks was the tally. Can't beat that.Say what you wanna say and feel how you wanna feel about me for saying what I'm about to say, but I thought the movie totally sucked! That's right, I said it. This movie might as well have been a children's book it was so fluffy. Minimal cussing (even with the military present in this flick), no non-human nudity, straightforward plot with no twists or turns, ultra predictable, monotone and unmemorable characters, borderline unrealistic war motives, pointless deaths, uncreative and fairy tale climax, and the environmental theme was thrown in your face so much that you'd think you were watching a PBS special. Special effects aside (they were top-notch), there was nothing I liked about this movie. I very rarely laughed. I don't think I did at all. Only thing that got a chuckle from a few peeps was when the antagonist said he was part of the Jarhead Clan. That's about it. It was a practically emotionless movie-going experience.I mean, come on. You turn on your own species over a girl? She gives you a piece and that's all it takes? I can see about him wanting to become one of them because of the girl and having a functional body but is he really ready to live the natural life and abandon TV, internet, and all the other wonders of human technology? Yes, the tech is a demon and it can also be a godsend. I get it. But that morality was never discussed or explored. No civilized human alive would just switch that quick. I ain't buying it. Regardless of the cost for him to get new legs, I ain't buying it. Things could have been done differently. The world they created and the creatures within it were a little too forced for my taste. Took up too much screen time that could have been devoted to adding more complexity to an otherwise oversimplified plot. The whole deal was just too textbook. No depth at all.3D effects weren't so good. All the previews before the movie were of 3D movies, all of them kid movies. I expect more from 3D. I've gotten more from 3D. Those previews and the movie didn't deliver the goods. Depth perception is altered but nothing moves beyond the four corners of the screen or comes out at you. The IMAX screen was big with a crisp, clear picture and sound. I'll give credit where it's due. But save your money and if you have to see this movie, just watch it on a regular screen for a regular price. I would tell you to just wait for it on Blu-ray and if you have a nice sized TV, just watch it that way. To me, it's not worth a penny. It's boring and not at all entertaining. The only surprises were seeing Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi. Wasn't expecting to see those two. If this movie was Rated R and more authentic, then maybe it'd be worth a whirl. But as it is, if you have the mentality of a simple-minded and impressionable 10 year old, this movie is tailor-made for you. I give it 4 out of 10 stars. I don't care how popular it is or how much money it's made and is gonna make. For me, it sucks chicken bones. A complete and total waste of time and money. I'm disappointed more than anything. I expect better from James Cameron.Even with all that said, this movie still got a round of applause when it finished. Now it joins the ranks of Equilibrium, the Godzilla teaser trailer, Spirited Away, and the first live-action Transformers movie as the only movies I've been in attendance of that have gotten some applause. Nothing happens after the credits so don't waste your time even further like I did. And when I left the auditorium, there was a long line of people waiting to get in for the next showing. Wanted to tell them so bad that the movie is a dud but everyone has their own tastes. I would have been upset even more if I had to wait in a line like that to see such a horrible movie. It only got those 4 stars from me because of the innovative special effects and Zoe Saldana's voice acting. Everything else? FAIL!",Null,4,8,15 December 2011
Zombieland," A Zom-Com that's worth seeing.
","I saw this in Hollywood, FL at Regal Oakwood 18. It was the last showing and I didn't mind because I had a good inclination that it'd be worth the money and it was. I don't remember the ticket price or if they gave a student discount. The auditorium was about a quarter full. Everyone stayed nice and quiet during the flick except during the funny parts which were numerous. That translates into being able to enjoy the movie properly. Nobody talking or acting stupid, air temperature was just right, and it was easy to find a good seat which were plentiful and comfortable.It's an entertaining movie. I ain't think very much of Jesse Eisenberg. Reminds me way too much of Michael Cera. Really dry, expressionless humor and delivery. I'd never seen either one of their movies. This'd be my first Eisenberg flick. Because I'm a zombie movie fan is the main reason I wanted to see this, not for any of the stars. So unless Jesse E. picks up another good role I'm interested in seeing, this'll be the only movie of his I'll be seeing. Not saying he did a bad job. He played his character perfectly. Harrelson wasn't bad either. Neither was Emma Stone (scorching eyes) or Abigail Breslin. Good casting all the way around. And yes, they do explain the reason people were zombified. Another plus.The filmmakers are green but this is a good step up for them in quality. I don't have any complaints about this movie. It's engaging in the fact that some things you can see coming if you pay attention to the 'rules' presented in the beginning. Cussing, blood, violence, mild gore, high zombie body count, and lots of comedy. Great characterizations too. A continuous thing about end-of-the-world movies like this is that humans just can't seem to get along. Even if they're an endangered species, humans will off each other over the pettiest of things. Never fails. We all suck. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 stars. Stick around after the credits or you'll miss something.",Null,0,2,20 January 2012
Inception," This flick isn't without fault.
","I'd recommend this to only those with the capacity for intellect and intelligent thought. If you're an idiot, then damn near everything in this movie will go flying right past your head like bird crap in the breeze. If you're an up and coming screenwriter or film student, this movie is recommended for you too as Nolan delivers in the storytelling department. The acting was very good. I haven't seen a DiCaprio movie since Titanic believe it or not. The guy can act. Ellen Page's miniature ass looks so awkward in this, especially in the hotel scene where she's dressed professionally but she played her part well. Best line of the whole movie was 'You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.' That one's an instant classic.For me, there just isn't enough at stake for me to care about how it ends. I have mentioned elsewhere how this is like an 80's G.I. Joe episode: there are no casualties. Nobody loses anything and what was gained wasn't significant at all. As much action as this has, the stakes are low. You can't get emotionally vested in any of the characters because remember, this movie is about dreams and mostly takes place in them. Always keep that in mind. The theme is that Leo and his team must enter the mind of an heir to an energy company and convince him to split that company up (kinda like what happened with AT&T and the Baby Bells) because if he doesn't, that company could become powerful enough to control more than half of the world's energy and become a veritable superpower. Sounds cool right? Well, execution just didn't live up to that synopsis.We don't really know Leo's motivation for doing what he does. We don't know the significance of the company he originally worked for (I forget the name). We don't know the true influence that Ken Watanabe's character holds but apparently it's enough to get Leo what he wants: amnesty. We don't know how severe Leo's crime is. Just that he's a wanted man but not how wanted he is or who wants him or how bad they want him. We don't know who funds his operation. We don't know much for background info on his immediate partner or the forger. Ellen Page (the architect), we know where she's coming from but she jumps in a little too eagerly. Michael Caine only appears seldom and we don't know much about his character either. I could go on and on. There's a lot of tiny little details that were left out. This movie could benefit from some exposition. There's complaints that the movie is too long. I think the length is just right. Actually, not long enough considering what's left out.Let's go back to that G.I. Joe comparison. You know how no one ever gets hit when they're shot at? Other than one character getting hit, this movie is the same damn way. During the first and third level of dreams, there's so many shots fired that it's ridiculous. Only one of the good guys ever gets hit. But the bad guysdo I really gotta tell you? The first dream level scene reminds me so much of that anime Noir. I remember seeing some episodes of it at an old anime viewing club I used to go to. The 2 chicks were surrounded by bad guys on all sides. And guess what? They took 'em all out and didn't even get grazed by one bullet. Same stuff happened here. Yeah, yeah, it's a dream. More cats should have caught a cap with that many bullets flying all over the place.A nice touch that I'd like to see more of happened in that very same first level dream. With all that noise and action and car wrecks and yelling and broken glass and bullets and screeching tiresamidst all that, there was no music playing. Hans Zimmers' excellent soundtrack took a break during that scene and I like that. Let the sound effects department get some clout for a change. No doubt the effects were heightened by the IMAX sound system but come awards time, those guys deserve some props for that. They did an excellent job and good move by Nolan for excluding that, too. I'd love to see more movies use that technique.The special effects? I ain't even gotta say how those were. You already know. It was very impressive but I could see through the techniques used to accomplish some of those complicated scenes. I'll bet those required lots of specialized training. I failed to mention that sitting behind me were what sounded like some college-aged guys who were creaming over the movie. One of 'em was all hyped up because he was seeing the movie in IMAX for what had to be his first time. His cherry must have gotten popped pretty damn good because when the movie was over, he was still creaming. Hey, we all have our firsts.I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars because everything is good except for the emotional detachment. It's not one of those movies that spells things out for you. You gotta use your brain to follow it. The story is good in an original universe with original concepts. The acting is on point along with the music, sound, and special effects. The theme is good but not well executed. The plot has a lot going on. It's the depth of the characters that's lacking. Who they are isn't given as much attention as the deep, diverse, and complex plot. It's gonna be 50/50 for me on this one as far as recommending you pay for it or not. You'll get taken for a good ride but at the end you'll realize the ride could have been so much more. Speaking of the end, nothing happens after the credits.",Null,2,4,15 December 2011
The Woman in Black," A lot like Dead Silence meets Insidious.
","The movie starts out slowly with a bit of humor. Actually, 3 girls died and some people in the theater found it funny. I kinda doubt that's what the film-makers had in mind. A drawing by Radcliffe's son in the movie drew the most laughs and it was a recurring prop that was later used as a plot device. The only other recognizable face was Ciaran Hinds from Above Suspicion. It has an eerie feel to it as if some sort of filter was used to make the movie feel like how the haunted house looked. Yep, it's one of those types of movies. To sum it up, Harry Potter is playing a lawyer who has to settle the affairs of the house and it becomes a cold case and if he doesn't, his job is on the line. This is more of a horror mystery. There wasn't much lawyer work going on. A lady lost a son, she's dead, her son is dead under mysterious circumstances, she can't move on until it's solved, you get the picture.Radcliffe just happens to be the character who has to work in the house and you already know he uncovers the truth. During his discoveries, the plot begins to unravel and some of the antagonist's intentions, and supernatural powers, are revealed. The number one problem with this movie is the use of jump scares. There were just too many of them in my opinion. Not that the audience didn't react to them because that's what jump scares are supposed to do but there were some genuinely scary moments that didn't need to use that technique. Thankfully, some didn't. This really is a scary movie. There's a very long scene where Radcliffe is experiencing about as much Amityville stuff as one can handle. That scene in the house was very well done and suspenseful. It's just you, the house, Radcliffe, and all the various haunts. The director did a good job with that. Most of this movie takes place in the daytime like Feast 2 (not a good comparison, I know) but they still did a good job building suspense.Without giving too much away, The Woman In Black lost her child and that means everyone else has to lose theirs, too. The girl setting herself on fire scene was good but I think the other death scenes should have been on par with the quality of that one for added chills. Props play a big part in the movie. Specifically dolls and toys. If you're sensitive to children dying or anything related to that, you don't wanna watch this. It will scare you. It's not gory or graphic but clearly the audience sympathized with what was going on in the movie when those particular scenes came up. The biggest error in the movie was the addition of the dog that accompanied Harry Potter into the haunted house on one of his return visits. What happened to the dog? You know what? Someone said exactly that out loud. Gimme a Napoleon Dynamite 'IDIOT' for that guy!But seriously, the dog was just forgotten completely. There were a lot of clues as to what would happen later in the movie. Lots of foreshadowing if you pay attention. You can figure out how the movie is gonna end if you do. Speaking of, it's a very good ending. Sad yet happy at the same time. And even then, some knuckleheads in the audience had to spoil things by saying the obvious right before those scenes started. The climax pretty much happens right at the end of the movie and it concludes shortly after that. The overriding theme is grief and how to deal with it. The Woman In Black's grief was resolved, or so it was thought. With that resolution, you think the movie is done but it's not. There's a very brief scene explaining why she continues to do what she does but prior to that, it's not really explained why.All the minor details are there but there's just not enough exposition. 3-5 minutes more of an explanation about her son's death and her feelings towards those involved in his death would have made the final revelation of her intentions make more sense. Not that it doesn't but for this type of movie, it needs to be shown. The absolute ending is nice. We get a clear image of what she really looks like. It's very reminiscent of Insidious in that aspect. A new revenge horror icon has been created similar to Freddy Krueger in the fact that she kills kids. Yeah, yeah, I'm exaggerating but this was a very enjoyable horror movie that does its job by scaring you and keeping you interested the whole way through. It's not gonna keep you awake at night but you'll enjoy the ride. Solid acting, scenery, and special effects all the way around despite the minimal cast and budget. Worth paying for and seeing on the big screen but just make sure you see it with an audience that doesn't have the maturity level of a Peanuts character. Nothing happens after the credits. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. The movie poster ain't that great (yet still relevant to the movie) and it's rated PG-13 but those detriments shouldn't stop you from giving this a chance.",Null,31,54,31 January 2012
X-Men: First Class," Good but not great.
","The movie starts by introducing young Erik and Charles. Erik in the concentration camps, Charles meeting a young Mystique for the first time. What's not explained is where Charles was or why Mystique was even there to begin with. Was it an early school for mutants? Was she an intruder? Nothing was explained other than showing Charles to be a gentle soul and that would carry over throughout the rest of the flick with the exception of him using the same pickup line to hit on chicks in bars. No trailer advertised Kevin Bacon to be in the movie at all so there was that reaction from the audience when people recognized him. It was kinda like seeing Sigourney Weaver and even Michelle Rodriguez in Avatar. The best bit of acting in the whole movie? Bill Milner's, who played young Erik, facial expressions after seeing his mother shot in front of him.Despite the large cast of characters, this is a plot-driven movie. It all revolves around the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis. In this case, you know there's a twist and it ain't a bad one but the execution was weak. I like how they took a real life event and used it as a backdrop for the growing mutant phenomena. I don't like how almost everything was watered down. I don't have much for complaints about the acting but this is essentially a war movie that focuses on things going on outside of the main conflict, mainly the mutants.Mutants are introduced slowly but surely and X team members are given code names along the way. Reminds me a lot of G.I. Joe Renegades but that's a very well written cartoon. The script here isn't bad. The direction is what's lacking. It just doesn't come across as serious enough and I can understand why considering the franchise. There are those emotional, crying moments but not enough hardcore, violent ones. Nothing to make you really wanna hate the protagonist (Bacon playing Sebastian Shaw). Shaw's ideals are like those of the primates in the Planet of the Apes movies (minus Aldo) where mutant shall not kill mutant. Can't hate the guy for that, can you?Lots to like but let's look at the characters and how the lack of attention in that department hurts the movie. First off, during the gentleman's club scene, they show a lot of scantily clad chicks. Where's the problem with that, you ask? The movie is based in 1962. Chicks didn't look then the way they do now so it was bad casting on that front. It's like casting Olivia Wilde in Cowboys & Aliens; a movie based in the 1800's.The hair styles are another issue. Alex Summers has a pretty modern do along with the Angel character. Emma Frost's hair, and emotionless characterization, was atrocious. It looked like she was wearing a wig with a whole can of mousse in it. Just terrible. Speaking of Angel, considering her real life heritage and skin color in the movie, would she really be openly employed as a stripper in a predominately white club in the 60's? And with tattoos? Redbone's got it bad enough these days, imagine how it must have been back then? And being a 60's based movie, it didn't have a 60's feel at all.And my biggest complaint is the characterization. X-fans know who the Darwin character is. The way he was killed didn't make sense considering that he constantly evolves to survive. That includes becoming pure energy as proved in the comics. I'm surprised they even used Darwin in this movie. The actor who played him looked the part perfectly, I'll admit that. But why they always gotta kill the black guy first?There were some issues with nationalities but you don't hear anyone complaining about it like whitewashing in movies like The Last Airbender. Moira's supposed to be Scottish. Banshee Irish. Does Magneto really look or sound Jewish to you? He was underpowered when the movie started but suddenly has greater control and levitation abilities at the end. Charles' influence certainly couldn't have been the cause of that level of change so quickly. Script issue! That's when Magneto goes villain but it wasn't on the level of Hulk Hogan going Hollywood at Bash at the Beach '96. What could have been this great cinematic moment didn't have enough behind it to matter which is exactly how the overall viewing experience can be described.You'd think the ending of the movie with all the special effects like the raised submarine would be totally epic but it's not. The problem there IS the special effects. The submarine crash looks just as bad as the plane crash scene in Air Force One. They should have hired the people who did the plane crash scene in Knowing because that looked very realistic. Is there sequel potential here? I'd say there's definitely room for more X movies but they should stand alone like the James Bond flicks.The movie checked in at just over 2 hours. Didn't feel like it was too long or too short. The movie was entertaining but it's too simple for my taste. I like my movies with more depth and a less comic-book style ending than the one it presented. I give this 5.5 out of 10 stars. Nothing special or memorable really happens and it's not worth paying any amount of money for but if you're an X-fan, you're gonna see it anyway. You're better off waiting for the DVD because you'll be disappointed shelling out the dough at a movie theater for this. Then again, some are more easily impressed than others. I'm part of the others. Don't bother sticking around after the credits. Nothing happens to the verbal dismay of those who stuck around hoping for something.",Null,4,12,3 June 2011
Casino Royale," A breath of fresh air for action movies.
","Saw Casino Royale at a friend's house on DVD. We were chilling, asked me what movie I'd like to see out of the selection he had, told him the type of movies I like, Casino Royale came up, he convinced me I'd like it, so that's what we watched. Can't say I'm a Bond movie fan. He always wins, always gets the girl, never gets hurt, just not realistic to me. My friend said I wouldn't be disappointed with this movie and he was right. It's a very good action movie. A breath of fresh air actually because they don't really make many action flicks anymore. Yes, he got the girl but it made sense. Yes, he won in the end but almost died in the process. Yes, he lived despite all the conflict and fighting but he took a beating throughout the whole movie and it was believable to a greater extent than previous Bond movies. And they didn't even have to go Rated R with it. Amazing! It's a visual action feast with a good plot. You'll be fully engaged in this from start to finish because the action scenes are long. Highly entertaining and worth watching on a proper TV with proper sound if you can make that happen.The plot flows over right into Quantum of Solace; the Bond movie compared to The Bourne Ultimatum. I don't know where these comparisons came from but it's all complete and total crap. The shaky camera during certain action and fight scenes is evident but that's where the similarities end. While Bourne Ultimatum is one of the better action flicks to ever come down the pike, Solace totally sucks. Don't know how that ball got dropped, especially since the story continues directly from the end of Casino with the same writers. Solace isn't worth the time or money. It reminds me more of the Bond style of movies that I hate and even reminds me of that totally unrealistic schlock-fest called Transporter 2. Stay away from Solace but opt in for Casino Royale. Solace gets a 4, Casino gets a solid 8.Don't get me wrong. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. He's grimy, kills people, steals cars, picks pockets, blows things up, trespasses, disrespects corpses, breaks and enters, burgles, and the list goes on and on. He's more like a villain than a hero. But that's what makes his version of the character more believable than the others who are way too high and mighty British. Craig is more of a street version and that's what I like in my spies. I'm just hoping the next Bond flick doesn't follow Solace's suit. Meaning I hope the right director hops on board. You can't go wrong with Casino Royale. It's awesome.",Null,2,4,20 January 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," One scene in particular you won't forget.
","It's worth paying for at a good dollar theater. Solid acting, solid plot, graphic in some places, keeps you guessing in others, a good dose of suspense, and an acceptable climax. It could very well have an alternate ending because it could go either way in my opinion. Not gonna spoil anything. It also seems like there's some cut exposition scenes because in some places, they just use dialogue instead of flashback which I think would have been more appropriate.Foxx and Butler do a good job here. I don't have a whole lot of complaints other than lack of flashback for Butler's character and the ending which I thought was going one way but went another. Like I said, it's acceptable. Maybe on the DVD/Blu-ray we'll get those extra scenes and alternate ending. One scene stands out above all others. Death by cell phone! You never see it coming, you don't know when it's gonna happen. It comes totally out of left field. The auditorium I saw it in had no more than 20 people in it but when that scene happened, everyone jumped and gasped and there was lingering laughter and jovial cussing afterwards. Some of that can be attributed to reacting to other people's reaction. It was one of those movie moments you don't forget. And not just the movie itself but being there in the auditorium when it happens because of the reactions. For that alone, LAC goes down in my history books. It was unforgettable. I give the movie 7 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,2,20 January 2012
