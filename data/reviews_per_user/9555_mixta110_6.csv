The Mask," JIM CARREY is a Comedy God! And today, that god is called LOKI.
","Amazing movie. Jim Carrey is an absolute scream! And in this Diaz is an absolute dream! The great thing with this film is it is almost impossible to tell where Jim Carrey starts and the cgi takes over. So well crafted and only the master himself could ever of pulled this off. His face and talents are like special effects. GENIUS! Jim Carrey, the living cartoon. I love all his movies, including his later more serious films, but I would love to see him return to this style again.Also, Cameron Diaz, although hot, has never looked as stunning as she does in this flick. SMOKING HOT! WARNING! DO NOT WATCH THE SEQUEL! I have not seen it myself, nor do I ever want to. It has FAIL all over it, read the IMDb reviews if you don't believe me.JIM CARREY is the MASK!",10,2,2,17 November 2008
Megamind," Better than Incredibles!!!!!
","I was shocked at how much i loved this film, and thoroughly pleased! The Trailers initially, i didn't fancy this one at all. And Megaminds design from the trailers i didn't initially like. The trailers kinda made this look like B grade fare, like say Hoodwinked or similar.BUT, WOW! As a fan of most of Pixar and Ice-Agees, I personally think Megamind is my new favourite of the lot! Ferrel was perfect, the designs and animation was stunning, and the storyline was interesting. I speak as an adult fan with no kids, this film had everything! It was witty, smart and well written/acted and spectacular.Toy story 3 was fantastic, but Megamind for me was more entertaining and funny. Incredibles was my number 1 pixar for a long time, and I wanted/want a sequel to that, but in Megamind, it bettered incredibles, and provided me with enough similar substance that it quenched my thirst as a sequel/spinnoff of sorts. But instead of following the Hero, we followed the villain. (As did Despicable me) But again, Megamind was much better.I only hope THIS gets a sequel. I'd actually rather a sequel to this now than incredibles.I love Pixar, but with Megamind/Kung Fu Panda and How to train Dragon, and cloudy meatballs, the other animation companies are seriously catching up!",10,5,9,11 February 2011
Quantum of Solace," James Bored ? Very disappointed.
","I loved Casino Royal, I thought and still thing Craig is a great Bond. BUT I was very disappointed with this film. It was lacking many things, and the action scenes seemed to be painting by numbers, they seemed to only happen at intervals to stop us nodding off. Also a very anti-climactic ending too. The villain was dull and not in the least bit menacing, Craig seemed tired of the role, which is a shame because the first film was brilliant. I think part of its problems, is that it feels like a direct sequel which of course it is, but in that, it doesn't seem to have its own identity as an individual Bond movie. Also, it felt like nothing really happened in the film. I'm not sure if it was the same director as that did casino royal or someone else but it was not well conceived. Maybe it was the lack of storyline? It was too confusing to tell.Not what i was expecting for a follow up to Royale, I was hoping he would become a little bit more Bond like. Like The Dark Knight is a more defined Batman to Batman Begins yet not totally leaving room for Batman 3.I don't thing a new gadget would have made this film any better, but it would have at least been cool to introduce maybe Q or the division he works for. Unlike Casino Royale, this film felt hollow, and too unlike a Bond film. It does not make me want to see it again on DVD. I'm sure it will make a ton of cash and maybe even win an award, but to me the blockbuster figures will be from curiosity rather than the repeat viewings that The Dark Knight had.",2,42,65,3 November 2008
Man on the Moon," Absolute genius! Carrey was robbed of an Oscar for this!
","?This film is utterly fantastic! A work of genius even. Jim Carrey was Oscar worthy here, and Tony Clifton needs to be on T-shirts! A unique biography with unique humour and a unique yet true story. I cant praise this film enough, and what an ending! Along with cable guy, and Me myself and Irene, this film is so under appreciated its criminal. I am at least glad its found its way into cult status, especially in the UK. Tony Clifton has some of the funniest and quotable lines ever! And without disrespecting the real Andy Kauffman, Jim added more spark to his characters, but played a convincing job. I think in many years time when Carrey is old, and receives a lifetime achievement award, this film will resurface and get the recognition it deserves.",10,0,0,13 February 2011
The Dark Knight," Outstanding! A Masterpiece, a few flaws but nothing major.
","As a massive and long time serving Bat-fan, I have at last seen my hero done justice on film. (I loved Begins, 89 Batman, Batman returns) Shoemaker killed him, and Nolan resurrected him like a fiery phoenix! Aaron Eckhart surprised me the most, Probably because Two-Face wasn't ruined with all the hype and trailers. Great acting, great character. Awesome face Effects! I am lucky enough to have read all the Graphic Novels and comics that this film takes its elements from. Seeing things that have been on the page become reality is fantastic. 'Something the nay sayers on here have obviously no idea about!' Some nay-sayers have said, Batman is for kids and they walk out shocked because of its violence!' Well, to those people, may i recommend Batman & Robin? 'I cant believe i found an audience for that film'. Well done IMDb.That said, This is a violent film. One of its very few flaws may be its PG rating, as not only is it too dark and scary for kids, but it is too complex! This is an adult film! And not one to bring your Gran to neither. Great storyline, great acting on all counts. great character development. Beautifully filmed. Great action,pacing,stunts and all the hype about Joker, even i got a little sick of hearing about it. BUT, after seeing the film, It was all well deserved! Joker truly is a work of art in himself. And I believe that this film did not sell well because of Heaths untimely death. I was anticipating this film as were most since the end of begins. Why would people want to see a film just because an actor died? That sounds morbid to me. This sold because of his acting skills, and word of mouth that this film is truly a work of genius.Bits i wasn't keen on...Things that weren't in the film that i was expecting to be, were my only major problems, but, I'm hoping they will play a big feature in the 3rd instalment. 'Bat-cave etc..'I also had a few problems with the visual design of batman's suit and mask, and speech. That's cos i'm a bat-fan, and an artist. The bat-suit/mask while practically explained in the film, was a massive leap away from the comics, which is something the rest of the film was perfect. So ugly design is the costume stuck out a mile for me. Some love it, i hate it. Its the reason i gave this film a 9 and not a 10. The central character is after all BATMAN, and part of what i love about batman in the comics and previous movies is the LOOK. But, who knows, maybe he will get a prettier costume in the next film. I love Bale as Bruce, but i still prefer Keatons quietness and look as Batman. Maybe for Bat-3 Bale will find a middle ground, and not so shouty. If you loved or hated this film, pick up the graphic novels... The Long Halloween,& Dark Victory. The source material for this film. And for the haters, maybe if you read these fantastic books, you will appreciate the film better. And finally realise that Biff,Pow,Bam!is from a very different era, and one that has past. Time to let it go.Hopefully CRISPIN GLOVER will be in Bat-3 as RIDDLER. And TIMOTHY SPALL will play PENGUIN.Maybe BANE could make an appearance? Place your bets for next bat-villains! Hopefully a new Batmobile and Batwing for 3 as well?",9,1,4,24 July 2008
Moon," Astonishing 2 man performance from 1 great actor! Brilliant!
","I love sci-fi, especially when its done well, and this film is done extremely well. No cheesy parts and no silly things to ruin it. Although not entirely original such as things like the Hal style computer etc, it made up for with its story and amazing direction and acting.Its easy to think that it would have been put together easily as it flows seamlessly, but when you think that many scenes would have been filmed separately with Sam Rockwell playing 2 characters and interacting with himself filmed from a prior shot and then edited/acted as if in the same room, having the same conversation. What a feat it must have been. Its been done before, but i haven't seen it given this degree of authenticity before especially for a whole movie.I absolutely LOVEd this film. I also loved SUNSHINE, but (spoilers...) The burnt man with super strength at the end was ridiculous and spoilt a near perfect film for me, his character was also unnecessary. MOON however didn't cheapen itself like that. The whole thing was plausible and it didn't need to resort to an OTT grand finale to win blockbuster points.I loved the slow pacing too, it really puts you there with them and lets you feel the space around them rather than blinds you with any quick cut forgettable action. Moon is a film that every scene i remember weeks after seeing it.Also welcome to the big screen is MATT BERRY (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace/IT Crowd etc) He is my favourite comedic actor in Britain, and it was a pleasure seeing him in this film. Though it was only a very short and fuzzy cameo, and wasn't comedic, i still laughed out loud just for the audacity of having him appear on screen. Imagination kicked in at that point i guess. One gripe, I would rather MATT BERRY been the voice of the computer rather than Kevin Spacey. Now that would have been interesting.Another great thing about moon, is that almost everything that happened i didn't see coming. It felt predictable a lot towards the end, but none of what i predicted happened, it curve balled instead and changed course. This was refreshing, (if not a little disappointing at times, because some of the predictions would have still been pretty cool.) Anyway, One I cant wait to own on Blu-ray, and it would be a great box set twinned with Sunshine, a prettier but inferior film.)",10,3,5,29 July 2009
