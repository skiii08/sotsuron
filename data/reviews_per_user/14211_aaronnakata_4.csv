Moneyball," Watch it even if you are not a baseball fan
","I hesitated for weeks before deciding to catch the movie. I am neither a no fanatic Brad Pitt fan nor had no interest in baseball. Thus the movie ranked low on my list of movies to watch. However after reading consistent good reviews on the movie, I decided that give it a try. I did not regret it. Brad Pitt was at his charismatic self. Watching him alone was worth the admission ticket. One of my favorite quote of the movie, 'I hate losing more than I love winning, and there's a difference!' This movie mixed intelligent conversations, flowing pace and excellent cinematography together. It makes this movie a home run. I think suffice to say, as a non baseball fan, it is one of the best movie I have watched. It is great. In sum, I would say Moneyball isn't just a great baseball movie; it's a great movie about baseball - and there's a difference.",8,2,4,16 March 2013
Lone Survivor," Intense every minute
","A good word to summarise this movie is the word 'intense'. This must be one of the most intense movies I have watched in my life. Period. What makes this movie good in itself is psychological. The narrative of being surrounded by enemies, outnumbered, and out-firepowered compels us to watch the movie's developments intensively. Furthermore, since this movie is based on a true story, it makes the whole narration even more engaging. What you really need to give to this movie is the sheer minute to minute actions, which the protagonists are trying to fight their out. There is simply no let up to the intense level. What I am saying is not just some mindless shootings in movies that perpetuate for the reason of only prolonging the shooting scenes. But moment to moment attention captivate actions. Please watch it and you will know how intense this movie can be.",8,1,3,5 April 2014
About Time," A feel good movie
","If you are looking to watch a feel good movie, without being too critical on the plot, you should definitely watch this film. Best of all, the accompanied soundtrack that goes along the show is awesome to say the least. All the songs fits perfectly and beautifully into each scenes. The main gist of the show tells that ability to time travel to relive and right the wrongs of your life. This plot may be overly used in many films but it has slanted to a more family love - father's love mostly - directions which is not often seen in most travel-back-in-time movies. The protagonist of the show is a young men who learned from his father one day that the all men in the family have the ability to time travel. So went to the adventures of his time travels, which his main motivation at first is finding the love of his life. It is wonderfully played out when he manages to find the girl he love and using the time travel ability, going back in time to right any wrong, to ensure the ideal outcome. All is well at this moment in this movie - which had done real well focusing on his love life and then fatherhood life. Then his sister's misfortune came in and the strange explanations on the adverse effects of time travel to change some outcome does not really gel too well with the general flow of the film. The later part of the show - last 30 mins, seems to be losing the grip, but a meaningful ending with the father ensures a reasonable finish to the end. Some hiccups for this movie, but the feel good factor persist throughout the movie, and I certainly did not regret watching this on a Saturday night, feeling good throughout the show.",7,1,1,29 March 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Knowing what come next was good
","Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatized version of CIA decade hunt for Osama Bin Laden. The impetus of the search was led by 'Maya', a CIA agent whose dedication led to the Al Qaeda number 1. Anyone who had been following terrorism closely would more or less knew the plot and would anticipate what would be coming next in the movie. However, unlike other movies that knowing the plot would certainly kill your pleasure of watching the show, this 'almost' accurate portray of CIA hunt for OBL had you wanting to see what is going to come next. The climax of the show is the Navy Seals raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Though most had felt this part as the holy grail of the show, I would think that the depiction and events leading to the raid as the essence of the movie. I would certainly urge anyone who had the slightest interest in terrorism and history to watch the show. Even someone with no propensity or inclination for terrorism or history would be moved by the dedication of Maya in her search for OBL.",7,0,3,1 March 2013
