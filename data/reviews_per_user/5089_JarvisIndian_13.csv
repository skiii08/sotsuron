M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," It should have been much better as non biopic
",Neeraj panday has been making thriller. But this feels like a non biopic movie. Dhoni is so calm and cool. But in the film Sushant Singh acted like extrovert. He didn't had that cool attitude. They should have showed nail biting matches . Cinematography was very weak. Before interval when it rains and a trains arrives chanting Dhoni Dhoni!!!!!!! And he gets inside and becomes cricketer . That same old chamatkar pe chamatkar of bollywood continued. But its worth a watch,7,0,0,15 December 2019

Uri: The Surgical Strike," Pure drama with patriotic reviews
",A patriotic movie without extra stunts extra heroism. Vicky Kaushal balances it perfectly.but indian fans who have given this movie 8.5 are those who haven't seen Hollywood war movies or they are just expressing over nationalism. You can search for Uri in YouTube you can find better narrative informative videos which can inspire. I didn't see any vfx which are better. Just because it is a controversial film don't give stupid reviews. It deserves 4,1,1,8,4 March 2019
