10 Cloverfield Lane," Expected more
","It was not a bad movie, but it could be more.Pro : The actors, especially John Goodman, he was fantastic! The setting was also great, very interesting.Some songs are very nice, like I Think We're Alone Now by Tommy James & The Shondells Contra: - It went boring to some moments and it was not interesting after a time - The end was just rubbish, very disappointing Overall it was okay. You can watch it, but don't expect too much, then you will have fun. Its good to watch with friends, there are some intense moments scattered over the movie, but like i said, don't expect too much, or you will be disappointed as i was. I liked Cloverfield from 2005 more than that movie cuz jkkkkkkkkkkkk",6,0,2,18 May 2016
