National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Great movie
","This movie is great. The story is very refined, so I felt down to it. This film has many factor- suspense, action, a bad guy, and so on. It is like Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones is full of action scene, but there are many demystification scene in National Treasure. The hero and his company goes to find treasure for his ancestral clearing of name. They solves a code one by one, and I was excited in the moment when those points and points are in one line.Anyway the hero is well-informed. He leads his friends to the answer and get over the dangerous with his knowledge.Everything in this movie is well thought off.Actually this film make you think and maybe even come to the conclusion that history is not bored. This movie is one that you can never get disappointed. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means. This is my recommendation",7,0,0,26 July 2016
Men in Black 3," Great Movie
","It is the one of my favorite movie. It is SF and comedy movie. I enjoy watching it unlike previous series. In this movie Will smith save his partner by getting back the future. Needless to say this movie makes me excited and laugh. I watched it in the theater and I couldn't help laughing from beginning to the end. However I think that this film is different from other movies which treats time travel. In other movies, when characters goes to the past, they often goes by an year unit. On the other hands, Will Smith can goes to the past by a minute unit. I think it is too convenient. I was disappointed in this point. But I like the story line. It is simple and the tempo of story is good. Also, this film has many funny scene, so everybody can enjoy it a child to a senior. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means. This is my recommendation",7,0,2,26 July 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," so cool
","This film is the best in this series for me. I watch this series sometimes when I have nothing to do. Johnny Depp is the hero. His performance is good and unique. He often acts the role of person which is crazy or looks addle-brained. I like his acting which despise somebody. But in serious scene he is always cool. The story is simple and we can understand it easily. And this film has many funny scene. The enemy is scared with the figure of monsters for children, but I think there are more scenes that are more interesting than the serious scene. I do not get tired even if long. Everybody enjoy watching it. The figure of monsters is made by the CG effect. It is very fantastic. It will be one of the factors that this movie is splendid. If you like action movie, you should watch it.",7,1,2,26 July 2016
Cars," Good Movie
","This is my favorite movie. I often watch it with my little brother. there is not human being in this movie but there are many characters of marked, so I'm not bored watching it all the time because they are like human. McQueen is a genius. He takes no account of advice for him by his teammate and don't thanks for them at first. So he is so bad. Therefore, he seems to be lonely. However, he changes himself by the gentleness of cars little by little at the place where he gets lost and reaches by chance. I like such movie because I can watch the figure which the hero grows up. In last scene, McQueen is totally different from first five minutes. He has no friend, but he makes some excellent friends and finds best partner. This movie is very wonderful. If you never watch it, you should do.",7,0,1,26 July 2016
Transformers," exciting movie
","this is the one of exciting movie for me. The scene where a huge robot fights is very cool. I like the movie which mechanical thing fights. I watch it repeatedly with my family. This movie is just the thing.This movie is incredibly funny and definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The story is simple to understand and perfect for this type of movie. The hero in this work is ashamed at first but he changes himself. He fights for mankind with the enemy's robot. It is reckless Then he is very cool. In the scene where the robot which came to save the human is restricted by a human being, I think that human weakness to the thing which does not harm.The effects and the quality of CG is very good. It's very reality. Above all, I recommend this film. If you watch it you will be excited.",6,0,0,26 July 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Wonderful movie
","This is one of the movies of the favorite. I know the original story by Disney, but it is more exciting than the original. Alice becomes adult and seems to be bored her life. She thinks that the experience which she has in wonderland is dream. She finds a white rabbit and falls down to hole. She arrives to Wonderland, and notices the dream is not dream. She is told she is the brave man who have received Wonderland once, but she doesn't believe it.But she becomes brave little by little when her friends in there are dangerous by the enemy. The last scene is very cool and fantastic. Anyway, CG is very beautiful.We can not look on this movie with indifference. Everyone dream to go adventure. I think that everyone want to challenge something when we see it. If you like fantasy or mysterious movie, I will recommend it",8,0,0,24 July 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Good Movie
","This movie is a fiction, but I felt down the story which I am made to think whether it is a historical fact. The mystery of Christ which is hidden in The Da Vinci Code. The hero and his company receives the code that Mayor of Louvre left and starts trip of the demystification. They solves a code one by one, and I was excited in the moment when those points and points are in one line.I wanted to go the Louvre after watching it. There may be the mystery that Da Vinci left in the present. If you like urban legend, you will be favorite. But it is difficult to understand the story if you don't know well about the history of Christ. But it is worth watching if you are interested it. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means. This is my recommendation",7,0,1,26 July 2016
Iron Man," Cool Cool Cool!
","It is the best movie that I have ever seen. Anyway, I'm not bored watching it from the beginning to the end. I think that the man who like a robot is interested in it. This movie is action and SF movie, but I feel it has a few elements of the action. The element of the SF seems to be too strong. Robert Downey Jr fights with the enemy in a robot suit.It inferior to the conventional action movie by all means, but it is very excited. I want to imitate the way of just attack. The story is good. Robert Downey Jr is a genius but is a little selfish. He make weapon for peace, but he know his weapon is used by terrorism, and his enemy imitates his technology. He is cornered by the enemy robot which is based on his technology, but he fights with strong will, and wins! Its a recommendation.",10,0,1,24 July 2016
Toy Story 3," Moving Movie
","I watch this movie and I'm very impressed. Among Pixar's film, this is the best, I think. This movie is more dramatic and exciting than previous movie. Woody goes on many adventure to save his friends. It is very dangerous. But he doesn't forsake them. This time I think that the most different point to before series is that main characters run a risk. I was very excited and moved because they gets over such dangerous. In the last scene, I cried all the time. It is very good ending. If I get married in the future, I will watch it with my family. This movie not only makes us impressed but also tell the importance to take care of a toy. I cannot treat a toy violently. We should tell the importance to future son or daughter through this movie. If you have not seen it, you should so by all means. This is my recommendation",9,0,1,26 July 2016
