The Benchwarmers," This film is funnier than most sport related films!
","The first time you watch it, it will be hell funny, but as you watch it more and more it gets old, but the humour is still there. Jon Heder is one the best comedians around since Ray Romano was on 'Everybody Loves Raymond', Heder plays a nerd named Clark, who was teased along with his mate, Ritchie (who is played by funny man David Spade from Joe Dirt) at high school because they were nerds. But the film has also got meaning to it; it is trying to tell anyone who watches it that anyone, whether nerd or jock, can be good at sports and shouldn't be picks due to the ability of the sport. Gus (who is played by Rob Schneider from the Gigilo movies) plays jock turned nerd as he tries to help kids like Ritchie and Clark to get out there and enjoy, what they are no good at.",8,0,0,5 February 2007
