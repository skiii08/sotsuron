Blade Runner 2049," Most disappointing movie in my lifetime
","The original Blade Runner is one of my top favorites of all time, and I personally have over 500 DVDs in my collection, of which over 50 are from the science fiction genre. I don't know what Kool-aid other reviewers have been drinking, but this was one of the most tedious, pretentious, boring, meaningless, poorly acted, loudest,dumbest movies I have ever experienced. After enduring 2 hours and 32 minutes, I did something I rarely do: I walked out during the ending titles. That's all folks!",1,74,159,6 October 2017
