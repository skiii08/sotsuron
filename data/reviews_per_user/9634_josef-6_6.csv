Sucker Punch," My 11-year old twin sons loved it
","Most of the movie took place inside the fantasy world minds of young women committed to a mental hospital. There was a fantasy world inside the fantasy world(kind of like a play within a play). The film dealt with a very mature subject (molestion) without actually showing any disturbing scenes to gross you out (unlike the TV show Criminal Minds for example). The young women fought their demons in a video game-like fantasy world as a kind of out of body experience. Killing dragons and Nazis in the fantasy was slaying their own personal monsters in their minds. The plot was original and unique. The actresses played their roles to perfection and Scott Glenn was excellent. I believe in guardian angels and have worked with patients who have had out of body experiences so the movie fit well into my personal belief system. It was entertaining, exciting, and surprising. My sons 'got' it and liked it.",10,12,23,26 March 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Best Super Hero Movie Ever? Maybe!
","This may be the best super-hero film ever because it was true to the comic book, had believable characters and exhibited true life emotions. It was 10 times better than Thor which was all special effects, 100 times better than all the Hulk movies, and better than all the X-men movies except maybe Wolverine Origins. I also give two thumbs up to Green Lantern for the same basic reasons. Being set in WWII allowed the movie to be classy because the women didn't have to dress like hookers and it was OK for the men to have honor and patriotism because the philosophy of greed and 'me first' had not been introduced to America yet. The movie was both entertaining and inspiring. It brought tears to my eyes in many places because it was so good and because it reminded me of what America is really all about.",Null,7,21,23 July 2011
Thor," Good but Could have Followed Comic Books Better
","The movie was entertaining and my 11-year-old sons enjoyed it but I thought it could have been longer since it only took Thor about ten minutes to discover humility after an eternity of arrogance. Natalie Portman was fine as his love interest despite garbage-head reviews (professional reviewers have their heads so full of pseudo-intellectual tripe they are unable to enjoy a good shoot 'em up.) to the contrary and the supporting cast was really excellent. My sons rated it up there with Skyline, Battle for L.A. and Priest. We are a Sci-Fi family. My wife and I are Trekkers, and my sons are Star Warriors. We know Sci-Fi and this is a good shoot 'em up.",7,0,2,15 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Loved the characters, loved the action, loved the science.
","This movie was great! I loved it. My kids loved it. It was exactly what we expected. Those reviewers who thought it had a weak plot must not like sci-fi or maybe they are just too dumb to follow a complicated plot. Most reviewers seem to be garbage heads who just don't get science fiction or fantasy, and would rather watch movies about the mentally ill. A Beautiful Mind was so NOT Oscar material: Lord of the Rings was ten times better. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was at least as good as Iron Man or Batman, and it was way better than either Hulk movie, the latest Superman movie or the first two X-men sequels. It is not going to be a classic like Dune or 2001, but then how many movies are? All the negative reviews are obviously the work of sci-fi haters.",10,3,10,2 July 2009
Warcraft," I really regret not seeing this movie in the theater.
","I wanted to see this movie in the theater but my kids were busy with cross-country practices and meets and viola lessons so I had to wait for it to come out on DVD. I've watched it twice in the two days since it came in the mail and I liked it even better the second time. It would have been so much more impressive on the big screen in the theater. I feel like I really missed out, but I still loved every minute of it. I don't think it is a spoiler to tell you that the trailer was misleading (as they often are) so do not expect the movie to follow the trailer. That said, I was particularly impressed with Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar and Paula Patton as Garona. I loved Travis in the TV series Vikings and he transferred very well to the big screen. Paula Patton was a revelation and I think that a star is born. She was instantly charismatic and sympathetic as a woman of mixed race and I cannot wait to see how she does in the sequel. I only hope that they sold enough movie tickets to make one. I probably would have taken my kids to see it twice so I cost them six ticket sales by being too busy. My bad.",10,1,1,10 October 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Same-oh......same-oh!
","The special effects are great to entertain your pre-teen sons, but the plot was weak after the moon shot secret mission cover-up part(that was totally believable) with Shia Lebouf getting an underwear super-model girl friend? No way! There was no chemistry between them at all! And the break-up with Megan Fox totally undermined the plots of the first two movies. No true love after all? Pathetic! It was as stupid as Aliens 3 killing off all the main characters who survived Aliens except Weaver or Mission Impossible making Mr. Phelps a bad guy after a couple hundred missions as a good guy. I boycotted the whole Mission series for messing that up and I would have skipped Transformers 3 if it wasn't for my sons liking robots and explosions. When you have a core ensemble cast (like Star Trek or Next Generation for example) you don't drop one of the main actors and expect success. No Megan Fox= no love story= no plot.",5,1,4,4 July 2011
