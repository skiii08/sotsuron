Alien 3," At least they killed Newt
","Unfortunately they killed Hicks and Bishop in the process.This film is just, simply, a piece of crap. It has nothing going for it.It fails as an Alien film. It fails as drama. It fails as action. It simply fails as a story.And the biggest sin of all - it wrecks the Alien canon forever, and marks the down-turning point where it all sank into oblivion, never to recover.With Riddley Scott's god-awful 'Prometheus', at least this particular abortion has been knocked back *out* of canon again (taking everything else post with it). But it's a Pyrrhic victory - Prometheus is only marginally more watchable than A-3.There was a script, which I have read about half of, proposed by William Gibson, that would have made a fantastic film. He preserved Hicks (I can't remember whether he got rid of the snot child or not), gave Bishop a bigger role, gave Weyland Yutani a bigger role, and gave the Alien a few more bio-tricks to have up its sleeve.But the producers were too busy snorting coke and slamming each others' genitalia in the door, while their paid sycophants told them how great they were.All I can say is the pseudo-feminist crap-token that infected the 2nd film gets put down with a big splash at the start in this sequel.But the whole story gets put down in the same splash.Baby, meet bathwater, meet disastrous film nobody likes.- -- ---",1,2,7,6 October 2014
The Ring," Excremental insult to the (un-remakable) original
","This film is just an embarrassment. Naomi Watts I couldn't care less about, but Brian Cox? Brian, really, WHAT were you doing in this? Were you that hard up for cash?I need to clear up some nomenclature. The original - i.e., the real film - is NOT called 'Ringu', somebody made that up. As far as any direct translation into English goes, it is simply called 'Ring', not 'The Ring', just 'Ring'.The original is a terrifying masterpiece.This film is just a mess.And then, and THEN, not content with trying to remake one film that could not possibly be remade, they tried again with DARK WATER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? There is no way, NO WAY AT ALL, that Dark Water could ever have been remade.And the same goes for Ring.See the real film, the Japanese one. If you can't cope with films with subtitles, consider getting an education, or moving to a country with an actually functioning social system that will GIVE you an education.",1,6,12,13 July 2014

","mmm. nomore shyamalan. please.period.he did make 2 good films. 2.they were 'devil' - which still had some outrageously overbaked background dialogue that you have to ignore. and we can all name the other film.bruce willis and sam jackson are not great actors, but they are great character actors. they suit cartoony material.and there's the problem. this film is cartoony - well it's about being a super-hero, for a start - yet it keeps trying to be arty, moody and serious.he just can't do it.the man does not have the talent. or ANY talent.his cinematographer does. his editor does. his fx people do. his musicians do.but m. night doesn't.he made one good minor work and one good major feature.everything else has been the same ham-fisted, overdone, high-school daydream fluff, one example after another, all out of the same mould.and he THINKS he's clever.quick review of the details of the film: slow, stupid, shallow, and drawn out to the point of being an endurance fest, with a deeply embarrassing ending.if you see m. night shyamalan on the credits anywhere, even as an exec producer, just skip. you'll save yourself a lot of pain.- -- ---",1,3,10,9 February 2016
The Maze Runner," Imagine if The Hunger Games hadn't sucked!
","Imagine if The Hunger Games franchise didn't suck! Take 'The Hunger Games', then -Remove the cheesy back story that's just there to take up time - and instead just fit a back story in where it needs to go.Remove the stupid emotional BS that's there as a placeholder for character 'depth' - and replace it with actual character unveiling with great performances.Remove the dumb CG and stupid 'arena' stuff - and replace it with a genuinely atmospheric, spooky, strange and downright scary maze.... and you've got The Maze Runner! It's not high art, but it was well told, excellently acted, scary when it needed to be, pacey and not boring - and, as a result, I really quite enjoyed it.------",7,5,8,5 December 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Somebody vomited on the whiteboard
","The first film was great.The second film was good.This film was an abortion.It was written by nobody who had seen the first two.The Kraken, which was to be the primary agent of all destruction during the 3rd installment, was disposed of. This was simply INCORRECT. This was the main wheel falling off. This is how this film crashed into the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. It could have survived - almost - all the incredibly tedious derring-do that padded out the rest of it, but not the Kraken. The East-Indo Co. seriously delighted that Davey Jones and his ship are at the lead?? No. That's simply WRONG. You simply got that WRONG. Try again, cos you got it WRONG. It was the KRAKEN they were after, NOT the ship. The KRAKEN. Not SHIP. You got that WRONG. Particularly as Davey Jones would have taken off and held them hostage against his heart. You got it all WRONG.Then it pads.Then they pull Calypso out of their rear ends. Along with CG that was so un-defined that at the drive-in none of us could figure out what she exploded into. We had to read somewhere that it was crabs, but on thinking back we still couldn't visually resolve that with what we'd seen.Then they padded.Then Keith Richards appears, in one of the few fun parts. He mumbles something incoherent, plays the guitar for a bit, and then some rubbish happens to do with Pieces Of Eight that nobody could be bothered following because it was so stupid.Then they really got going with the padding.Then a whirlpool turns up.Then the cold-blooded bad guy gets killed by Davey Jones, as a pointless afterthought instead of a climactic encounter.Then lots of stuff blows up because Cannons.Then they pad.Then they squeeze in a bit more padding.Then the dumbest ending in the world is tacked on.Then the audience leaves, bitter, disappointed and annoyed with themselves for trusting Disney.- -- ---",1,1,1,29 March 2015
Zodiac," Take a good story and tell it well, and you end up with a good movie
","David Fincher is so damn inconsistent.It is astounding that the man who directed some of the biggest abortions in Hollywood history: <ul><li>Alien III </li></ul><ul><li>the vile and laughable remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo </li></ul><ul><li>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button </li></ul>...was responsible for this masterpiece!It is, however, believable of the man who directed Fight Club, and helped produce a good chunk of House Of Cards and The Hire. I'm really looking forward to Gone Girl - I hope it's one of his 'A' game movies and not one of his 'B' game ones.Zodiac has a great cast:Robert Downey Jnr plays the same character he always plays - but we love him for it, he's a star not an actor. Mark Ruffalo is his classic Angryman, but it suits his cop role perfectly. But Jake G - the man delivers yet again, playing the autistic cartoonist lead perfectly.As I say in the subject, it just goes to show: take a good book or any good story, and then just try to tell it as well as you can (good direction upon a good cast), and lo and behold you end up with a good movie.And truth always trumps fiction!------",9,1,2,6 October 2014

","People get awfully confused about these films. Awfully confused.There is no debate, no controversy, nothing to talk about at all.They are just cheap pieces of crap made by talentless directors, talentless writers, and hype-driven producers trying to 'schlock' their way to fame and fortune.Both of the '28 later' films have no story, no plot, awful scripts, dreadful acting, no direction, and look terrible.Don't get all confused.These films are just pieces of crap.

Knowing," All Are Punish'd
","Towards the end, when the credits have not yet rolled, a lone male figure silently makes his way to the front of the cinema.He climbs onto the dais, and stands on the carpet in front of the screen. Wordlessly, he reaches down. There is a faint zipping sound, a pause. Then the unmistakable sound of urine landing parabolically upon carpet.The audience neither shrinks, nor exclaims, and nobody makes any attempt to stop the man. Rather, after a moment there is a faint chorus of 'Hmmm, hmmmm....' and various sounds of agreement. 'Yes, yes. I see where he is coming from. Hmmm...' says a learned voice in the darkness.There is a slow flurry of activity. It builds to a crescendo. In mere minutes the entire audience, from babes in arms to the elderly and infirm, are dropping their restraining inner garments and voiding their bodily fluids over the cinema and its furniture.The manager runs in, and attempts to calm the situation. But he only makes it worse. He implores the audience not to take out their wrath on the cinema itself, but the audience shakes its collective head. You took our money, a lot of our money. Now, it is you who will pay.Finally, the managers phone rings. Yes, he manages to convey, yes, he will give everyone their money back. The rioting hordes subside, and with a slightly sulfurous dignity they file out.Wearily the cleaners trudge in with their heavy equipment. This is the fifth screening of 'Knowing', and they wonder when this madness will stop.When you watch an Ed Wood film, your senses inform you very quickly that this is a product of tremendous enthusiasm, but of no talent whatsoever at all. And knowing that, one can enjoy the glorious train wreck. 'Knowing' that - fore armed with the knowledge that this is a turkey, and it is to be served as turkey.'Knowing' does not do this. 'Knowing' is the worst kind of film. For the first half it will promise deep intrigue, and even hint that they might be about to do some edutainment. Perhaps some obscure maths principle is going to be the decider here. Promises of 'Pi', and 'Primer' (almost). And it keeps the hooks in, till just after half way.After that.... really, its probably best NOT discussed. There would be those still traumatised out there from being hit in the face by a supersonic wall of shyte. Shyte. The pure stuff.Instead I will just conclude with this thought.To say this film has redeeming features, is an insult to redeeming features.Poor Nick Cage, I hope for his soul he donated everything he was paid for this film to charity.",1,3,6,19 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Just showing solidarity with all others who realised what an abortion this version is
","I have a strange relationship with the story of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'.On a long international flight back home, it was the only book I could find in English in the bookshop that didn't have a blerb that made me vomit. Over-hyped though it was, I thought it would fit the bill, and it did. It helped keep me sane over the cramped hours.Then I saw this version of the film, and it didn't make any real impression.Eventually, I discovered it was a remake and went and sought out the Swedish original.So - read the book and saw both film versions. You might conclude that I must really like the story, and hold the author in great esteem?I regret this is not the case, oh dear me no.Without wishing to insult Mr. Larsson's ghost, I'm afraid I think his book is boring and over-rated - it certainly didn't motivate me to read the other two. And I've read much better mysteries that could have been made into films.I think the Swedish version is a rather good film that removes some of the book's tedium, but it's still nothing that I'd label as an 'enduring classic' or some such hyperbole.I think this version, now I have the context of the real film, the original, is a steaming abortion and frankly rather embarrassing:The opening credits are idiotic, grating, and inappropriate: telegraphing that wheels had fallen off.Rooney Mara's performance is shockingly, appallingly bad. Perhaps it was the script and a completely talentless director? I don't know.Daniel Craig mailed-in his performance.Everyone but Craig has absurd Swedish accents but speak in English.The music is god-awful, sorry Trent but it is, it's totally wrong for the film.It's almost a shot-for-shot remake of the original, but in a purely colour-by-numbers, box-ticking way.Everything is More, Bigger, Longer, like a Spielberg effort. The sets are bigger, the vehicles are bigger, the houses are bigger, the rooms are bigger, and everything is stretched out as much as it can be, but without any added finesse.A cardboard and lacklustre, going-through-the-motions, rubbish film.And even more boring than the book.------",1,17,27,30 July 2014
Now You See Me," The kind of self-congratulatory garbage that makes Hollywood a mockery of itself
","Probably rates a 3/10 really, but there are too many paid-up 10/10 reviews on here.To repeat my summary - this is the kind of self-congratulatory garbage that makes Hollywood a mockery of itself.The whole film seems like it is grinning at somebody offstage, who is grinning back, and then grinning to their friends, and then their friends are grinning at those on stage, and they're all shaking each others' hands, and having a great time.While the audience sits there going... 'when is it OUR turn?'If you just want to watch (preposterously absurd) CG-eye candy and ignore the dialogue - all of it - then by all means, sit back with the beer and pizza. This film has nothing else to offer.It's analogous to bad, or boring, pornography - it's like watching somebody else eat a chocolate cake: it's fun for them, but it's painfully tedious to behold at length. I struggled to get to the end of it, and in fact my thumb was itching to fire-off the FF button through most of the last hour. Not even putting Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman together helped make it interesting.This is an expensive, over-baked, tediously rubbish movie. Go see Art Of The Steal instead, it's a heist film that actually bothers to remember that the story is for the audience, not the cast and producers.",1,2,3,7 July 2014
Quantum of Solace," Still holding its place as one of the great disaster movies of all time
","I can't believe I completely forgot to bucket this turkey in amongst all the reviews I've written.The quick summary: A complete piece of sh*t with no redeeming features, none.Do not see this film. Repeat, do not see this film.It is garbage, it is excrement, it is a waste of time.It is not only a bad Bond film, it is an extremely bad movie just in absolute terms.OK, now, if you want a more complex critique, read on...QoS was a particularly unpleasant cinematic experience.And in fact, when I did see it with my then girlfriend, there was an ominous omen - a bunch of kids (what were they doing in a Bond viewing?) up the back decided to remind me of why I moved out of the suburbs.The only entertainment I received that day was my GF screaming abuse at the kids' mother when she turned up to collect them.Then again, maybe the kids were right...This isn't a film, per-se. It's just a random collection of roughly 'Bond'y bits, stuck together: un-bonded Bond. It's patently obvious the writer was an idiot, the director was having a massive drug come-down or marriage break-up, and the producers... I suppose they must have been absent, and then just had to put a brave face on it when they saw the final bucket of vomit. It's just one big cinematic Sin. They should have burned it and cut their losses.It's sub-sins are: * being a crap Bond film - like the Timothy Daltons or Pierce Brosnans, when after Casino Royale we thought we'd at last left all the tedium behind* forcing Daniel Craig to appear in a crap Bond film, just after he established himself as Connery's only equal * forcing an audience to sit through a crap Bond film, after being led to expect more of the brilliance of Casino Royale * forcing Ian Flemming's ghost to be anally-raped at gunpoint, similarly to how the Indiana Jones character and the audience were anally raped at gunpoint by Spielberg and Lucas * having no plot, whatsoever - no matter how hard you try to piece together what's happening, you fail. That's because there isn't anything happening, it's just a random collection of roughly 'Bond'y bits, stuck together * having very, very silly scenes, for no reason - ropes and clocks and car chases all spring, horribly, to mind * having irritating villains - who in turn have irritating henchmen with silly haircuts * being a random collection of roughly 'Bond'y bits, stuck together, yet still managing to feel longer than the age of the universe * having a crap, boring theme song I imagine there were some severe meetings after this hit the cinemas and bounced back with a loud splat on the producers' doorstep.The only Bond film ever to make a loss, I believe, in some distribution chains?Wow, I can't believe the power-anger that even thinking about this abomination conjures up! It's a rush!Don't see it! It's a piece of sh*t!------",1,5,7,28 September 2014
Alien vs. Predator," We cannot bash this film enough! Come on everybody, do your part!
","Everything that needs to be said has been said by other reviewers, so I'm merely doing my filmotic duty here by helping to shove this turd right down to the bottom of the septic tank. Any rating over 3.0 means we still haven't completed our work, people!Mistake: they set it on Earth.Mistake: in the present day.Mistake: Cube.Mistake: the aliens are seen as the enemy, even though it's the predators' fault the whole thing... oh, sorry, got actually *involved* for a moment there. Remember the wise words of Bill Hicks. Don't get all baffled. This is just a piece of s***. Nothing more.What makes me angry is that it could have worked if only somebody with some talent, even the smallest part, had been involved.Obviously it had to be set some time in the future, and realistically on some godforsaken planet somewhere - Earth would have been too much of a stretch in any case, it would have pushed the stakes up too high and forced everything to have to be 'epic'.The alien is dumb - remember? It's just an animal, a 'survival life-form', as Ash put it (paraphrasing) in the original, beautifully terrifying film.The predator may well be psychotic, but it's technological and very cunning.The humans are whatever the script-writer wants them to be.So how about thousands of alien drones, so they actually pose a THREAT? Maybe a whole human civilisation got wiped out by an alien infestation and now bazilliods of the scary cockroaches are laying dormant in the rocks? In the meantime some truly bad-ass space-marines are fighting off a predator attack and... oh-oh, guess what gets woken up! There are a thousand ways this could have been played. Almost all of them good. And all of them NOT THE WAY THIS IDIOT PIECE OF GARBAGE WAS PLAYED.When I was watching it in the theatre (don't ask, just... don't ask), my girlfriend at the time turned to me, and the conversation went like this-GF: 'So, this is Alien...'Me: 'Yup.'GF: 'Versus Predator...'Me: 'Yup.'GF: 'On *modern* day Earth...'Me: 'Yup.'GF: 'In the Cube.'Me: (thinks for moment) 'Um, yup. You've got it.'I have only one reason to thank Riddley Scott for the pile of steaming crap that is Prometheus: all the stuff that has been kicked out of canon. Alien III and the other abortions that followed are now gone (there was only one queen, ever, and a human was too small to gestate it). And along with them, the two AvP coldsores are also flushed into the medical waste (ditto the above plus also the aliens didn't exist until well into the future). Sorry doods, anything by the original director wins, end of story.",1,0,1,10 August 2014
28 Days Later...," A piece of crap!
","This is basically the same review for this god-awful film as I gave its god-awful sequel.28 Days Later is, simply, a piece of crap.There is no need to analyse it any further.As a helpful warning to potential viewers we can provide something of a community service, but really it's not worth wasting any more time on this piece of shoddy, shoddy rubbish:It's boring, badly directed, boring, badly acted, boring, has no script, is boring, drags on for nearly 2 hours, is boring, has the stupidest story that goes nowhere, is boring, has no plot whatsoever and is boring. Excruciatingly boring.Nobody involved with this piece of shoddy, crappy little crap should receive any credit at all.Not even the presence of Brian Eno's 'An Ending/Ascent' or of Christopher Ecclestone could save this turd.That's right, it's a piece of crap!Move on! (Ps. Footnote. Some idiot compared this film to 'Cube'. This is incorrect. 'Cube', though badly acted, is a work of archetypal genius. This film is a piece of crap. Now you have been educated, go forth!)- -- ---",1,3,10,3 November 2015
Legend," A good film, but not a great film
","'Legend' is easily better than the 1990 piece of crap, 'The Krays'. But unfortunately that's a very low bar.Whilst this movie sticks to the facts rather than 'the legend', it just tells the wrong story.It tells the story of the Kray brothers, in their mid-career period in the 60s, from the point of view of Reggie Kray's girlfriend (then later wife) Frances Shea.And, well ... there's no nice way to put this:She's a very boring, uninteresting person.I don't know if its Sophie Ellis-Bextor ... sorry Emily Browning's performance, or the script she was given, or if Frances was pretty much just so ordinary that there was no reason for the story to dwell on her at all. Because there's no reason for the story to dwell on her at all.Consequently the entire film feels like it's blundering around with this giant millstone around its neck. That's for starters: it then proceeds to tell pretty much the least interesting anecdotes of the Kray brothers' part in London history.And this gets especially frustrating when you start to realise the sheer quantity of genius-level acting ability available here, including Tom Hardy, David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston and a huge, talented supporting cast of names and faces.Pretty much, all of it goes to waste ...... but not quite.The things that keep it floating along are Tom Hardy's Ronnie and Reggie, the side performances (doing the best they can with, frankly, not the greatest material), and the way 60s London is presented: everything is fresh, everything is new, the wallpaper, the cars, the skirts, it's all state-of-the-art rather than nostalgia.All of that is enough to make the film watchable, but not enough to propel it into fascination. Missed scenes due to checking messages and fetching snacks generally aren't worth the effort to go back and retrieve.If you're looking for machine-guns and broken kneecaps, sorry it's not here - what's here is, instead, almost a soap-opera.Furthermore, the twins effects don't always work. There are times it really does not feel like the two Tom Hardy's are in the same room, and with cheap efforts like 'Orphan Black' pulling it off perfectly there isn't much excuse for a 2015 high-production film.Tom Hardy, as far as I'm concerned, is a new superman of acting. He's not a Robert DeNiro, he actually has a range. He's not a Johnny Depp, he doesn't have a glass ceiling. He's not a Gary Oldman, he hasn't started imitating himself yet.I think I want to see some genius write a clever, clever SF film - or just a really *strange* and interesting film - and then a good director cast Tom Hardy and Jake Gyllenhaal as leads. In the meantime, we take what we can. Like 'Legend'.Oh - if you DO want to see a slow, thoughtful film (which you probably DIDN'T when you sat down to watch 'Legend') with Tom Hardy, that really showcases his brilliance: 'Locke' (2013).- -- ---",6,1,1,4 March 2016

Insidious," Had us jumping off the couch
","I'd possibly even give 'Insidious' an 8/10, it's very, very scary. It certainly deserves higher than 6.8, but c'est la vie that's the public for you.I have only one major criticism: the producers/director need to learn about DYNAMIC RANGE in sound. Whilst I don't mind loud bumps for making you jump, these aren't so much loud bumps as soooo loud it's WHAT?? WHAT?? I CAN'T HEAR YOU?? WHAT?? - this it does after pulling the childish trick of having everyone speak quietly so that you turn up the volume, then blows your eardrums during a scary part (cinema systems can handle it by themselves). It's immature, pretentious and frankly just irritating - if your playback apparatus has a compressor/limiter function, USE IT.But of the story, the unfolding, the characters, the build-up - all the stuff that matters? Yeah, it's got them! Insidious has the lot.It builds slowly, then starts to scare the hell out of you with macabre events, leaving you unsettled. Then it really starts to pour the action on.It even provides some comic relief in a couple of places - nice to see something that doesn't take itself so seriously that it can't let its hair down - but this just seems to make the scares even worse because you let your guard down!I liked Insidious, and I like the sequel too.",10,1,2,9 August 2014
The Mist," Shame they made such an awful movie, but King can't really shoulder the blame
","King is a lousy, hack writer, true, but he puts out the odd interesting story every few years. Gotta hand it to the guy, he's prolific, even if most of his output is garbage.But with this clunker, I gather the blame does not lay entirely with Stephen. True, there is attempt at social commentary with characters so shallow you could use them as tracing paper - that's a classic King'ism. His characters are only the lines they speak, never anything more - they have no back stories, no lives, no solidity, no believability, and no consistency.But that ending was apparently entirely the director's idea.So... after making us sit through the usual King tripe, rooting for the aliens (damn, those bugs were beautiful, and fascinating - where's David Attenborough when you need him), putting up with the completely forced and ridiculous 'social situation' fiction ... they try to have an ironic ending.And then try to legitimise it with one of DCD's most over-used tracks (think this makes the .... no, seriously, the sixth - with a 6 - feature film I've heard 'The Host Of Seraphim' used in).MENDOZAAAAAAAAAAAA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.................- -- ---",1,1,4,9 November 2014
Unknown," Formula, but with some innovation - quite enjoyable
","Not a bad flick.It's an old formula, along the lines of The Bourne Identity-type amnesia and spy stories, but this has an extra little twist on it that I thought was quite clever.The performances are fine, and it's always nice to see Bruno Ganz in anything. I now know from 3 different films that the guy speaks German, French and English - but then most Europeans (in fact most people in the world), speak at least 2 languages.I enjoyed too seeing the major landmarks of Berlin, in the snow, including the shopping centre where I bought my fave pair of jeans!I've taken a couple of stars off:1 star - it was formula, and even though it was good I'm just sick of the old-world Hollywood, they need to grow or die.2 stars - there is some absolutely ridiculous hollywoodism later in the film, some real far-fetchedness (can't go into details without ticking the Spoiler box). But, I don't think it wrecks the experience.All in all, if I'd seen this at the cinema I would not have felt ripped-off.",7,1,1,28 June 2014

Sinister," Not terrible not great
","It's funny, I agree with the negative reviews on here but... somehow still managed to kind of enjoy this film.Main highlight for me was finally hearing BoC - Boards Of Canada - used to major effect in a Hollywood feature film. (OOOH LOOKY THAT! If you lowercase 'hollywood' IMDb uppercases it for you! Just as I don't want it to!)I always take Ethan Hawke as the Tom Cruise who can actually act (most of the time). It's like if you took Tom, removed the scientology, removed the ego, toned down his John Malkovich screaming-and-throwing-things-is-acting habits, and added some more true acting ability, you'd get Hawke. I thought he was adequate in this, though he could have been given more to do.Main problem I had was with the story itself: as soon as I realised it was supernatural ooga-booga nonsense, not a serial killer, the fun kinda went out with the rules.Another problem was when Ethan was doing his endless wander-around-in-the-dark-with-an-old-unreliable-torch bits, why did the rest of the family not wake up? He was knocking stuff over left right and centre, with the bogey man doing the same. Heavy sleepers, indeed.The final - literally- problem I had was with the ending, it went on and on (and on... and on) and could have been removed entirely and the film would have been punchier.Still - an OK film I thought.

","Limitless is an actual Science-Fiction film, and it's not a bad one at all. I just watched it again, to wash the taste of the fantasy film 'Lucy' (god, what a giant pile of dog poo) out of my mouth.It has three huge plot holes, but they still aren't enough to wreck it.Also the '% of our brain' thing is used properly, and not harped on. Vinny(?) says 'access 20% of our brain' - the operative word being ACCESS, not USE. I've heard it said, and I agree, that 'we live on the surface of ourselves.' But what if we could, holographically, access the whole shebang? The plot holes are: * The first thing he would have done, would have been to guarantee an infinite supply of NZT48 * The Russian would have been a minor problem, dealt with with extreme prejudice in the first week or so * As soon as the side-effects manifested, he would have started investigating them and found out how to mitigate them - the bit about 'just eat and get some sleep' was cheap and annoying. And I *wanted* more side-effects, a whole sub-plot could have been written just there.In general, the limit of Limitless is that they simply don't do enough with it. But it doesn't wreck it, it's still a good story, and I loved its ending. Whether its faults come from the 'Dark Fields' book, or are errors of the producers, I don't know.And it's so beautifully shot and paced - with a fantastic soundtrack - that I was never bored for a moment.Limitless is staying in my collection of Good Stuff, along with Primer, Absentia, Coherence and others.- -- ---",8,2,4,8 December 2014
The Descent," How did this boring, unintelligent piece of crap get an IMDb rating over 7?
","I mean... did the studio hire everybody and their families with a FaceBook account to vote it up? And what really astonishes me is I've seen reviews comparing this to 'As Above So Below'.What they have in common? Caves.The difference is that 'As Above So Below' is an excellent little tension-building dread-fest. Whereas 'The Descent'... is just a piece of tedious, dragging, never-ending crap.Oh - and another common point: they both have obnoxious protagonists.But 'As Above' slowly puts them further and further through the ringer, till you are hanging on their every word and deed.'The Descent's crew of loathsome, vacuous, self-absorbed bitches could all have stabbed one another to death in the first 10 minutes, and it might actually have been an interesting film. And IF that had happened, we could have been spared the initial half-hour of nothing happening (except one, very cheap and completely plot-irrelevant shock) and all the den mother camaraderie that was ffffffffforced into the script through a keyhole.Summary:Awful characters - you need them all to die, as quickly as possible.Stupid, derivative monsters - in fact, laughable and a little bit embarrassing, given it's made in 2005 - and a back-story for them that makes not even a glimmer of sense. Which might not have been a problem, were it not for the film also having ...No plot.No tension.About one and one-half scares, in total.Then a waiting, waiting, waiting for the thing to JUST END WILL YOU just END!!!!!! Terrible, burn it, get rid of it and move on.1 star and it doesn't even deserve that.- -- ---",1,5,11,24 December 2014
The Witch," Try again
","I'm not sure you can get away with this kind of trash these days? I mean, back in the 80s or 90s, maybe a film where nothing happened for an hour and 32 minutes with good actors and dark cinematography and nudity and a completely over-baked soundtrack ... might have got up and bamboozled a few people.But now? We've seen it all. These films are a dime a dozen. Style over substance, atmosphere over content, and let's do anything except write a story. Anything.Waste of some very good actors, some great photographic direction and locations.A depressing dark tale of ... mainly mud, farmyard animals, and the deeply religious stupidities of ... I can't even be bothered looking up which branch of christians they were. I used to know heaps about this bunch of self-flagellators but it's all gone.Don't watch. It will depress, bore, and annoy you.This isn't the 80s or 90s anymore.- -- ---",1,7,18,7 May 2016
War of the Worlds," I expect rubbish from Spielberg, but this was shockingly bad
","I think it's only Americans who hold Steven Spielberg in any kind of regard - the rest of the world think he's an ego-tripping con-man who's good at pitch meetings and loves to spend studio money. He's kind of like an L Ron Hubbard of director-wannabes/producer-wannabes.The last good film he made solo was Duel, when he was a fledgling. Even in Jaws you could see the formula taking shape - quick flurries to indicate mass activity of some kind; characters who suddenly get tearfully, chokingly serious; and his most annoying gimmick, characters who sit around talking themselves up - it's as though they are trying to get you to like them, and telling you what a good story you are in for.The Indiana Jones films were made with Lucas keeping Steven on a very tight leash - a leash that was re-tightened after the disaster of Temple Of Doom.Catch Me If You Can? - yes! I *will* grant that one! But I think it had an awful lot more to do with Leonardo and Tom working together well, and the fact it was a (more or less) true story, than any great captaincy in the directorial chair. Let's just say Mr. S didn't stuff it up, thank the gods.Schindler's list? When you are Jewish and under the watchful eye of pretty much the entire world's Jewish population, with regard to the atrocities of the Nazi holocaust, you are going to tread very, very carefully lest you offend pretty much everyone. Even so, he managed to get some of his irritating trademarks into the film AND schmaltz up the ending.And now, we come to War Of The Worlds.With this embarrassing sci-fantasy... 'thing' that he has created, I really think the years of being praised by idiot sycophants has taken it's final toll.There is nothing in this film to offer, nothing. Not one single thing. Dakota Fanning needs to die in the first few minutes. And I put up with the Tom Cruise character and his infinite ability to survive ANYTHING... until he started to sing.The movie went under the Fast-Forward hammer from that point on - my gods I was so grateful I hadn't been forced to sit in a cinema for this giant, giant turkey. I really can't say - would I have stayed? There is a good chance not, that I would have left and gone to get on with my life. But, you know... train-wrecks and all that. The fascination with how badly a director/producer can get something wrong.Heh, Spielberg saying 'I have the power to make any movie I want.' Really, Steven? There is an issue there - you don't have any talent, whatsoever. You're a hack who stumbled onto a moronic, sell-able formula a couple of decades ago, and all Warner Bros, Sony and the rest care about is money. Art? They release the flintlock on their Brownings at the mention of the 'A' word.The alien machines underground. Really? You just wanted to get that in a film, didn't you? Come on Steven, fess up. What was it, a dream you had one night? Possibly it could have made a nice, weird film by itself - but it would need a real director and a real producer and ABOVE ALL... a writer. You need a writer, to write a story. That's what writers do, Steven.The tentacle in the basement. I can hear you in the 3D editing suite now, Steven: 'It doesn't go click enough! Add more clicky bits. More clicky bits! More more more! I need more clicky bits ADD MORE CLICKY BITS!!!'. You did it with the aliens' eyes at the end too. It's all you know how to do, spend studio money and waste the time and lives of designers with talent, adding more clicky, more fall-off-cliff, more scream, and more more more unsubtle over-emphasis to your rubbish films.Tom Cruise singing. In a film that was already one of these stupid 'off-axis' genre w*nkfests that Hollywood has gone in for - so you didn't get to see anything interesting, really - that had already slowed down to the pace of a smacked-out snail... Tom starts singing. Yup, that's when the room collectively reached for the remote, and we skipped large chunks of the rest of this river of sewerage.To those who haven't seen the 1953 original, please do - you'll enjoy it. For one thing, you'll be surprised at how good the FX were at the time. For another, you'll enjoy the presence of a story - to the extent that Wells' novel ever had one (its mainly people running screaming until the aliens die, but the military fights back, there is lots of discussion of what to do about these things, and the action doesn't stop to a dead-crawl so some fool can sing).One day I'd like to see a proper brass-and-glass steam version of the original done, given that the 1953 one is already well updated from the novel.Wells was decades ahead of his time. Spielberg is just a talentless idiot.",1,1,6,19 June 2014
The Conjuring," Textbook and a welcome arrival
","Real rating: 8/10Disclaimer: If a film's IMDb rating is too low, I will always give it 10/10 and then give my real rating in the review.I think the producers and director got totally sick of all this Paranormal Activity rubbish and said 'You wan't a scary movie? We'll give you a scary movie!!' Everything happens in the order you think it's going to, and you know when you're going to get scared, and you don't care.It is a pleasurable ghost-train ride and you can see everything coming towards you and you can't stop it and THAT ROCKS. Intstead of tinfoil-hat nutters and cheap cash-ins with unwatchable video footage and fishing-line stunts, we get an in-your-face haunted house story.And it has the 'Based on truth' (ho ho) thing, too, but at least it carries this on it's sleeve instead of just assuming the audience will buy it.",10,2,3,15 June 2014
Prometheus," This film only serves one purpose:
","It's kicked Alien3, 4 and the AvP's out of canon, permanently.* There only ever was one Queen, somehow she made her way in one of the alien ships (lets pretend the Engineers never existed, because they sucked quite badly) to LV-426 - that's the AvP's gone, and Alien3 on the ropes...* A human torso is far, far too small to gestate a Queen - that's Alien3 a'gone-gone... and with it Alien4* The alien drones and Queen did not exist until into the far future - that's the AvP's wiped off the board, and of course good riddance Why should we take this utter piece of crap as canon, over anything else that got made?For one simple reason: Everything after Aliens sucked in extreme measure, including Prometheus, but Prometheus is by the original director.So it's a case of 'we may as well take any help we can get'.Alien was such a piece of archetypal scripture, that it wasn't ever really possible to make a sequel, let alone sequels, of it. But then James Cameron came along and simply pluralised everything... and it just happened to work! Beautifully!We went from Art movie to Action movie, and even though the endings were completely identical we didn't care. Something we never thought possible had happened - go James!Then Alien3 came out and that was the end of that...One day there might be a good Alien film again, but it's kinda getting a bit late.Ridley inspired a whole heap of new-gen SF-action film making - as did George Lucas, as did Stanley Kubrick - nowadays I think we are just looking for the next evolutionary step.",1,3,7,19 September 2014
Lucy," Pile of rubbish fantasy film - still quite enjoyed it!
","UPDATE: Ed-Wood level bad film, don't see it.And they bucketed Limitless?? Limitless is an actual science-fiction film, and in my opinion an underrated one. Yes, they could have done a lot more with it, but at least it stayed just barely within the confines of possibility.Lucy, however, isn't science-fiction, it's pure fantasy. It's Harry Potter Goes Sexy Guns.But I still kinda enjoyed it.The 'science' in this thing is pure bunkum, so please don't go in expecting your brain to be massaged - I groaned all the way through it. Unfortunately I can't go into details without spoiling, but basically it's all wrong: incorrect, unfactual, mixed-with-pseudoscience, wrong.In some ways, it's a shame this tripe-fest got foisted on poor Scarlett - she is an underrated, actually very good actor, and this plot and its details were well beneath her abilities.But, as a ride, Lucy is quite enjoyable. It has no message, and no internal consistency, and it's based on a load of gobbledegook, but heck... at least it's not boring.The action is very actiony - the start, especially, is very gripping. (Though there are 'art' cut scenes in a very heavy-handed attempt at metaphor - oh my god, they just have to be ignored.) It promises you that it's going to be some kind of deep, techno-thriller... then it goes somewhere, er, 'else'.The CG is quite amazing, and for once it serves its purpose instead of boring you to into headache-dodging sleep like the (yawn) Matrix sequels.Grab the beer and the pizza and a bunch of friends, put it up on the big plasma, and turn your brain OFF - use 0% of it.Cheers! - -- ---",1,4,11,6 December 2014
Alien: Covenant," Astoundingly, worse even than the 2nd AvP film
","I don't understand something.
He made the Martian, and it was a great film based on a great book.
Then he did this, and everyone involved should really go to gaol.
How?
How did this happen?",1,5,12,21 November 2018
