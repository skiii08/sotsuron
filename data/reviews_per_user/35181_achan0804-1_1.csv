Mission: Impossible III," Orgy of stunts and special effects
",This movie is for viewers who like stunts and special effects. Theses are a bit overwhelming and bury the story. I also did not understand what the Vatican is doing in the story of international terrorism ? I have seen the first Mission Impossible which in my opinion was better. Less sensational but the story was more understandable. The director did a good job if this was indeed his first big feature movie. The cast is good and Tom Cruise is his usual self. This movie falls in the category of Da Vinci code where you have to view the movie a couple of times to comprehend the sense of it. In short a movie worthwhile watching!,6,1,2,16 December 2006
