Requiem for a Dream," Are u kidding?
","Is there really so much being said in this movie? Speed and Heroin are pretty dangerous - duh. And if this is really a 'point' or a 'message' in requiem (I don't think it is), it is made in a moralistic and patronizing way, as if talking to a child - by exaggerating to the extreme the warning, that is, the outcome of heavy drug use. Not exaggerating as a story of 'what' happens to the disgraced four, but the sadistic way in which each drop of pain is squeezed and turned into visual impact.But I don't think there is an anti-drug message motivating the movie. Or any message. Or a theme. At no time did this movie appeal to my intellect or my emotions - all it touched was my stomach. In the end the movie made me feel kind of a sucker - I just watched something that wasnt made for an audience, but for the sake of the director. Seemed to me just an exercise - of two things: - One: how can I (the director) take a character's fate and make it the most shocking, gruesome and disgusting as I can? Visual shock has priority over content in 'requiem' as if Aronofsky wanted to prove he had the technique to shock as much as cinema can do. - Two: Just how many editing and shooting tricks can one insert in a film? There isnt 30 seconds of footage without a split screen, 'that didnt happen' scene, character 'floating' or whatever. Very annoying, since in 90% of the cases there is absolutely no reason for the trick. They add nothing to the scene, nor are called for. The director is just having his fun. In 'Pi', Aronofsky spends the whole movie with plot tricks and turns that amount to nothing. Here he does the same exercise in editing. That may work for his entertainment, but my annoyance.In short, this movie is a fraud.",Null,0,2,4 May 2004
Fight Club," Somehow it works
","(I will comment the film as if in episodes) The first 30 minutes of film really caught me. After that, I couldn't completely dislike the movie no matter how much worse it would get (and it got just a bit). The 'help groups' storyline could be a movie in itself, and I found it a very convincing comment on modern life loneliness. Of course, something else made me relate to that part of the film - I HAVE INSOMNIA TOO, and I'm sure almost anyone in the same situation will appreciate the film. After that, the actual plot starts, things become a bit far-fetched but somehow the whole 'fight club' bit also made sense. The movie says (and it's not subtle) that live in a big city is a perpetual hypnotic state of mind and the only way you can wake up is by taking a fierce punch in the stomach - no epiphany will do, no brilliant book, not even a movie will do, only huge physical pain will. Since obviously we cannot take this literally in our lives - or we will end up acting as mad and dangerous as the character - the movie admits it can't provide an answer and moves to the third part, which is just silly but fun action mixed with plot resolution. The social content kind of exhausts itself from then on, but the movie still had more than 90% of the Hollywood action flicks around. At this point I have to say: so what if you can see the sixth-sense like 'twist' coming from a mile? That flaw takes something of the excitement from following the plot, but not of the general impact of the film. After the middle, there are some 40 minutes of action you don't remember after the movie is over, but don't mind watching either. The very end is exactly the way the film HAD to end. When Norton starts trying to 'save' people, I go like 'crap, the screenwriters either didn't understand their own plot or were forced to make a Hollywood ending'. But in the last minute, the whole 'double person' device went the right direction. Nothing brilliant about the resolution, it was just satisfactory. I am not saying it is 'deep' like watching a great Bergman, Spike Lee or something, but it does have great ideas and social comments throughout (and they are certainly not 'hidden' in a way you need to look 'through' the action). If you just want action, it is from average to good and still very much worth the rental.",Null,1,3,30 August 2004
The Natural," Sort of a B movie, but fun
","The cast is all-star; the story is promising; the lighting is weird; the directing is cliché, but the screenplay is the fun. It feels computer-generated, so amateurish are some dialogs, so formulaic are the situations (it feels as if a Disney family oriented movie sometimes invades a serious drama), so stereotypical are the characters. (SPOILERS) At one point, our hero has a bullet removed from his stomach after being shot 15 years before (!), and the doctor warns him about the danger he's in because of the damage it did to his guts. Redford argues it is not important because that shot is something of the past (!!). At another point, he goes on a bad hitting streak for weeks because he is dating a girl who wants to sabotage him. She does nothing, he just catches her bad luck! But he starts hitting well again for several weeks when he is at bat and vaguely sees a person in white (the mother of his son) standing up and reflecting the sun. The last 40 minutes of film are just composed of 'generic' scenes that could be in any movie: hero rejects bribery, gets to final game just before it starts, talks to a teammate who is on the fix, has a bad game but rises up to the occasion in the end hitting a home-run in slow motion (how could it be otherwise?). There isn't a single shot that you can't see it coming from miles. But I found nothing irritating in this movie, because 10 minutes after it begins you already can't take it seriously. I actually found its silliness very charming. Brimley, Redford and Duvall are very charismatic. Good mindless fun.",Null,5,10,29 August 2004
The Village," This film is about something, but you can't notice it
","* MAJOR SPOILERS * Death is a part of life, of course, and you can't go on living without accepting it. But dying violently, or even suffering violence from another human being without dying, can be beyond frustration to many people. It may lead you to thinking that the whole universe is wrong. Many stories deal with people who suffer that and live life seeking justice or vengeance.This film is the story of a group of people who had a very peculiar answer to what can be the ultimate frustration  death being inflicted upon a beloved one not by a virus, cancer cells or lightening, but by people. What do they do? They create a small world where violence never enters because they carefully select what human inventions can go in  family, marriage, work, love, ethics, God  and which cannot enter  such as money and competition. The world they create is a 19th century (change very little and you can actually place it in the 17th century) 'village' not only technologically very primitive, but also a very simple society (certainly more simple than the real 19th century America). They know where they are, but their descendants don't. The village is a compassionate, loving world, because they decided to become such people when they created it, while their descendants don't know another way to be.Throughout the film what strikes you is the absolute absence of aggressive instincts in people's minds and how people are extremely united and undivided by shutting themselves from the outside world. One day, however, violence enters their lives by a murder attempt committed by the 'village idiot'. That incident makes them rethink the whole enterprise and even put it all in jeopardy in an attempt to save the victim of the attack, who is dying (in order to be true to their project, they must stand that risk). Victim saved, they decide the plan is still worth it. More than ever, actually.That is basically the 'theme' of the film. In itself, it is incredibly promising, and very relevant. Some friends of mine who saw it thought of the sociological problem of solidarity, while I thought of the discussion about 'evil in man's heart' from William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. The movie, however, does not seek to become something to think about, and the premise is not very exploited. Why? Because everything is played like a thriller with a twisted ending. The fact that you only learn what is going on in the last ten minutes makes everything shallow. Someone here said that the movie is made like a twilight zone episode. That is VERY precise,specially if you have the first series in mind (think of the pilot episode, and you get something very close). Did you notice how practically NONE of the reviewers of this film commented on the theme? That is because the way the script is made just takes your entire attention away from it.It is a very rich idea that was transformed in easy scares and silly mysteries. I have a feeling this movie will be forgotten very soon. The director probably think he discovered something brilliant when he did 'The Sixth Sense', an idea that can make a lot of money and also get people's respect. So he just decided to do it again and again. But this movie has nothing like Haley Joel Osmond's landmark performance to make it work like a very good drama mixed with suspense. The main character's are just so-so. But nothing nearly as bad as 'Signs', don't worry.Since I always try to say something good, let me note that Hurt is excellent, as is Bryce Dallas Howard. The photography also stands out.",Null,0,0,18 September 2004
Coriolanus," Then, now and ever
","This is the first time Shakespeare's unsung masterpiece is brought to the big screen. That alone is reason to praise this movie, and a reason for me to watch it.My rough estimate is that the screenplay kept about 20% of the play's text, maybe less. The #1 priority of the screenwriter was clearly not to put off audiences with too much of Shakespeare's language (which is even more difficult in this work than in most plays). Thus we have long stretches without dialog, filled mostly with battle scenes. If you are going to produce a 10 million dollar film, you'd better not to cater only to a niche audience of Shakespeare buffs like myself. So they focus on lines that a) are the less difficult to understand and b) establish the characters. Long speeches are often cut to 10 words or less, and more often than not eliminated. So the choices in the script make a world of difference. Is the play's spirit kept? Is John Logan successful? Not fully, but mostly.Coriolanus, like the bard's other Roman plays, is a treatise on the state and society, worth more than dozens of political science books. He shows the problems both with democratic government and with anti- democratic forces more than one and a half century before the French Revolution. The role of the 'people' in the political process is at the margins of previous plays, but in Coriolanus it is fully developed, and Kudos to the movie-makers for stressing that theme. The caprice of the mob is a factor throughout the movie. Key scenes are kept, as is a crucial exchange of words whereby Coriolanus and the people are compared to the wolf who wants do devour and a lamb - the powerful general being the latter. Also kept is Coriolanus' denunciation: 'With every minute you do change a mind/And call him noble that was now your hate,/Him vile that was your garland'. Logan did not miss the importance of this theme, avoiding the trap of succumbing to a simplistic story of proud 'tyrants'. It is true that he made the mistake of giving the mob too much justification for directing their rage to Caius Marcius in the beginning (he is in charge of enforcing a state of emergency) - but the latter scenes of Marcius trying to get 'voices' (votes) among the common people make it clear that their relation is not simply one of righteous revolt, but something more complex. He is rejected for being too 'proud' to exhibit his war scars – but it is really the mob that is too proud to accept a leader that does not cater to such a caprice. He is expelled, but just a few gestures and clever words would have made him a god before the people.Coriolanus' accusation to the angry, volatile mob is spot-on. But the play is also a treatise on the individual: one of the many ironies is that every character in the play, including the general himself, is not more fixed than the masses. Everyone is divided against him or herself and carried by the influence of others. The individual minds mirror the unstable collective. All the character's arcs come full circle, but with an arrow vector that points to a continuation of the loop. And that is why I think the very last speech of the play, where Aufidius regrets what he has just done, should have stayed. The way things end suggest that at least his character reached a resolution to his inner conflict. But no such a thing is possible in 'Coriolanus'.No play from Shakespeare is more fit for adaptation to modern times. Coriolanus is more contemporary to the 20th Century than to Shakespeare's England under James Stuart (had the play been written 30 years later after his death, everyone would say the bard was 'obviously' talking about the English civil war). The film was shot in Belgrade, and the battle scenes and uniforms direct the viewers to the wars in former Yugoslavia. But the turmoil in the Middle East in the course of the revolution that started in the year this movie was made could be predicted by anyone who watched or read 'Coriolanus'. Shakespeare is worth a thousand pundits.",Null,1,3,9 August 2013
The Happening," Thought it was a B movie
","Another reader said he hated the movie because he was expecting so much from a Shyamalan film. I kind of liked it because I had a totally different experience: I picked up this movie at about 10 minutes on a hotel where I was staying the night just waiting for my connection flight the next day, and thought 'cool, a B movie in a post-catastrophe world. Soon zombies are going to pop'. I recognized Whalberg's face, but couldn't quite figure out where I had seen him before, so I just guessed it was from another low budget, specially because his acting was so laughable. There were no commercials, so my illusion lasted till the final scene. I kept waiting for zombies, but settled for the crazy old lady with the pale face, and Whalberg yelling 'why can't you give me just a minute' as if he had just entered acting school. Campy, apocalyptic with half-baked environmental ideas. Not terrible if don't know that this guy also directed 'Sixth Sense' and you are just passing time at a hotel. Don't recommend renting it, though. 'Day of the Dead' is more gratifying.",5,0,1,28 August 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," A companion piece for visiting UBL's compound
","I've lived in the Muslim world for years and in Pakistan for a few months. Now some friends came to stay and the one place they decided they HAD to see was the empty plot of land where once stood Osama Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Three hours to go, three hours back, some pictures and a story to tell (the movie says the city is 45 minutes drive from Islamabad, but that was back in 2010 - not now!).Once we came back we were so involved with the story of the raid that we had to see Zero Dark Thirty (for the 2nd time for me, 1st for them). The killing of UBL is meticulously reconstructed, but only covers the last 30 minutes of the movie. Most of the story involves a CIA semi-fictional agent who by sheer determination and luck convinces the Agency that Bin Laden can be reached, and that they have a good idea of what men is the key to his whereabouts: Ibrahim Sayed, AKA Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti. Information from detainees suggests Sayed is UBL's courier. Our hero figures that, wherever in Central Asia UBL is, the one thing he is sure to have is a courier. Track him, you get the big Kahuna.The Agency is initially unlucky to believe erroneous intelligence saying Sayed is dead. And then they are lucky to find out he is not dead. With a lot of push from our hero, they allot the resources to find him. It is no easy task. That's my favorite part of the movie. Surveillance technology can find out from where he is calling his family (busy districts in the Punjab), but it is a lot more tricky to follow him in the middle of the crowd to the place where he lives.After tracking Sayed to a VERY suspicious compound in a city the CIA never expected Bin Laden to be, it is time to decide if this is really UBL's residence. But the mysterious inhabitant never shows his face. I don't think he was hiding from CIA cameras, he just knows he is so recognizable. So the decision is left to the higher-ups, to bomb the place, raid it, or just keep waiting for more definitive intel. And that is the part where the Director has to make a dramatic decision. Does she show the President and his top aides deliberating? I think putting Obama, Clinton and Biden in the movie would suck all the air out of the room to the detriment of the focus on the field agents. Leon Panneta shows up, but he is not even named. The final act wrote itself, because it is a documentary-like recreation of the raid.Some reviewers pointed glaring mistakes: the Pakistanis seem to be speaking Arabic instead of Urdu. One part I had to laugh was when a mob stood outside the American Embassy in Islamabad. If you have been there, or anywhere in the diplomatic compound, you know it would never happen.It is hard to make suspenseful a story that unfolds throughout 10 years and involves meticulous collection of intelligence and a lot of false starts. So the movie may feel like a 'boring procedural' for people who are expecting normal Hollywood fare. In order to add a personal touch to the main character, she has a fried killed in a highly implausible scene. Otherwise, Maya just remains a stock character you have to fill in the gaps: lonely woman married to her job, always having to prove herself, obsessed with a task her superiors don't want to give priority.Some people pointed out to a big lie of the movie: that torture gave crucial information. I'd point out that it is just a half-lie. Yes, nobody gave useful intel for the killing of UBL under torture. However, keeping terror suspects for years under dubious legal status (say with me - Guantanamo!) paid dividends.",8,3,4,9 October 2017
Whiplash," It's the drum set, stupid
","Premise: a tough teacher with heterodox methods who manipulates and mistreats a promising protegé in order to make a triumph of him. The former gets away with psychological torture and even physical abuse in a manner that, in real life, would get him fired and banned from his profession in 15 seconds, and yet he succeeds... even when trying to undermine the poor kid. In another movie this would turn me off completely and make me snore for the whole 107 minutes.Instead, it is one of the most thrilling flicks I have ever seen. It put me firmly in the edge of my seat.That's because the 'art' at stake is no McGuffin. The jazz drumming is a third, more powerful protagonist than either the bully or the victim, or their face-off - despite the undeniably excellent performances (JK Simmons is a slam dunk at the Oscar). The characters say what they are doing is all about the music, about becoming Charlie Parker, about being 'one of the greats'. But in reality you could not pull off this story with any other jazz instrument - certainly not with Parker's saxophone. I can't stress it enough. Damn the brass, the woodwinds, the bass. In the drums there is something visceral, at the same time primitive and sublime that comes through in a away music listeners perhaps never realized. The instrument forces the character to bleed, to suffer, to submit his mind to the beat, to the merciless tempo, to the task of commanding the band at the same time the player seems to be in the background. It demands his transfiguration into a brute who brings delight. It is much tougher than the sadistic, over-the-top teacher.The movie is about taming an instrument more than Karate Kid is about karate, or the first half of Full Metal Jacket is about making soldiers. More than any sports movie are about a sport. You never cared so much about the activity that supposedly is there only to provide the plot, without even noticing it.And you don't realize it, because the characters never discuss the particularities of the dreaded sticks, snares and cymbals. Not for one second. Maybe that is the brilliancy of Whiplash. People talk about the drum set as if it was any other jazz instrument. It is not! Instead, they just show and show and show challenge of the drumming. You live it, you suffer it, and you are enchanted by it. There is a reason the first and last shots of the movie, both abrupt, have Andrew at the stool, hitting the cymbals with all his energy and skill. In the end you don't know why you loved the movie, despite the stock characters, weak plot twist, and clichéd situations that stretch credulity. You are swept, and wonder what is there that you never seen before. The drum set is omnipresent yet and nearly unmentioned. It's alive. The drum set is the real appeal of Whiplash. It IS Whiplash. The piece that gives the movie its title and is played over and over has a heterodox, challenging time signature. Seven beats per measure. Maybe this strangeness contributes, but I don't know jazz enough to say for sure. The direction is above par, stylish and discreet at the same time. The actors are brilliant. But who cares? Just hit the notes, Andy, until you bleed, get beaten up by the instrument until your brain turns into mush, and ultimately produce pure art.",10,0,1,11 January 2015
Paths of Glory," What is it about anyway
","I just rented it and was completely astonished. I had seen everything Kubrick did after this movie and never imagined it could top all the others so distinguishedly. It has ten times the human content any other of his movies has.SPOILERSAnother reader said what comes through most is the absence of hope. I think he kind of felt the same I felt, but I think it is more precise to talk of inevitability. Every little part of the plot makes you think of it: you just try to figure out HOW the poor men can be saved - and the fact is that they have a lot going on for them, such as the great lawyer, and the general's embarrassment - but somehow they don't even get close. They must die. Why? Because the assault was a failure? Why was it a failure? Because it was impossible to succeed anyway. Then why was it attempted? Because the target was there, and the army must go for the targets. What if they had advanced? They would die from German bullets. Deserted? Fire squad too. Not enlisted? They were probably drafted. Could at least that war never have happened? You get a feeling that, no, it was also inevitable, as long as there are countries. And the movie does not suggest that countries are things that can disappear. As long as human beings exist, and as long as there is society, the three soldiers must be executed.In the film, there are people in power, making decisions, you despise them, but you don't really feel that those generals killed the 3 men. The feeling you get is that the country killed them. During the trial there is an opposition between membership in the human race and membership in the army - if you look at them as soldiers, they must die; if as humans, they must live. The audience takes the second position, the court, being military, takes the first. That means that the film is about the most fundamental truth about human condition - the inevitability of death. That truth is so simple and fundamental that it may be too obvious, and therefore superficial. But the film focus on something more specific - the fact that the inevitability of death, being universal, puts us in the same condition. On one hand, it makes us all brothers, and human brotherhood is portrayed beautifully in the last scene. France is in war w/ Germany, but you don't see any German in the film except from the beautiful and frail girl in the end singing words they do not understand but with feelings every soldier there knows - the beauty and fragility of life. It is no coincidence that the melody is so incredibly simple. That fellowship is not unknown to the judges, and Kirk Douglas appeals to it. But they just have to overlook it. On the other, there is the fact that each of us dies his or her on death, and each of us do not want to die. Somehow the film says that such condition throws us against each other, because we want others to die before us (in the case of the general, he has so much to lose that losing his post is the great men's equivalent to death for the simple - in this film, officers don't get killed, period), and therefore we will never be truly brotherlike to the other - hence, perhaps, the inevitability of the war you feel in the film. In one sense, 'Paths of Glory' is not anti-war because it definitely does not imply that war is something evitable. The movie reminds us that war is an inhumane situation, but does not suggest we can abolish it. In another sense, it IS anti-war in the sense that there is NO reason for us not to lament war. There is no reason for us to find anything glorious or dignifying in war. Nothing, nothing in war is great - the title is definitely ironic. Conclusion: despite all Kubrick's technical marvel of his later movies, nothing in his other works comes as deep as 'paths of glory'.",Null,2,4,3 August 2004
Incredibles 2," More thrilling then the first!
","This review will be buried under 800+ others, but I just had to put my homage to the movie here. I lost count of how many amazing set pieces. Yes, there is little character developement, but we already know those folks. The movie puts them in new roles, and that is enough. We already know the universe they inhabit, and frankly exploring social themes would be a waste of computer power. I could get through even the overbearing feminism, but that is probably because with so much netflix, PC stuff has beaten me into submission. Also, because the elastic woman is so well used. So I ended up enjoying Mr. Incredible trying to be a stay at home dad (and relatively succeding, giving the utterly impossible circunstances). Yes, the plot is predictable, but this is kind of expected in such an action-oriented flick. Jack-Jack gives enough surprises.Incredibles 1 was good, but it dragged at times, specially in the 1st half. This one will not let you down, it really puts everything into the action scenes, and there is never less then 10 minutes between them. The chasing of the Screenslaver in the building and the Violet/Voyd fight were my favorites. Introducing new people with new powers was a smart idea, and it works better here then in the overcrowded X-Men sequels. The ending is overdone, but in the age of Marvel movies, ending battles have to be overdone, it's kind of a rule. I just took this movie like a Mission Impossible sequel: give me nonstop thrills, without being overbearing, and that is enough.",10,4,8,27 November 2018
