Hereditary," Mediocre
","Allright, I'll give credit where credit is due. The acting was good.The story however sucked balls and the totality was sadly extremely boring. The only thing mildly entertaining was the facially misformed girl getting her head ripped off due to a traffic accident. Look I love deep story lines; but the entire thing was mostly a snooze fest. This is the type of movie that the critics will give great praise, but who cares about those snobby opinions anyway.I watched it to the half and then fast forwarded it and the son getting some kind of seizure, which looked mildly entertaining so I rewinded back to where I was and continued watching. I ended up watching the entire thing and now I want my 90 minutes back.What a serious waste of time. The actors did what they could, but the script... ugh.",5,2,5,21 August 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Cute and Funny
","Are movie critics really people that matter? I don't recall ever having cared about what some self-proclaimed know it all thinks about a movie. Generally speaking user scores are more interesting.Anyway, the movie itself, I thought it was both funny and cute. Had it's heart in the right place. If you want to laugh and maybe cry a little bit, you might find yourself happy to have decide to see this movie.",8,1,1,14 February 2020
