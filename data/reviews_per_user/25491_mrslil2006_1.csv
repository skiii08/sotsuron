The King's Speech," I absolutely loved this movie! I want to go and see it again.
","The Cast in The King's Speech did such a great job that they deserve an Oscar. I never thought I'd be interested in British Royalty but for days and days after seeing this film I couldn't think of anything else. The political machinations swirling behind the scenes made for an enthralling subplot. The historical context in which this story took place gave even greater meaning and depth to the overall story. My daughter is a speech pathologist and therefore it had special meaning to us personally.I am sure that anyone who has had public speaking thrust upon them can easily empathize with King George VI and his torturous experience. The most interesting aspect of this film is that it didn't have all the usual Hollywood superstars, gratuitous sex and violence or computer generated imaging that so many inferior films have today. This film relies entirely on a solid plot, good character development and some of the finest acting in recent years.",10,1,2,14 February 2011
