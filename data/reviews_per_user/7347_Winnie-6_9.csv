The Rock," Just great
","I have always loved Jerry Bruckheimer's work and I was eagerly awaiting the next Michael Bay installment after the brilliant 'Bad Boys'.  And I was not disappointed.  Fabulous performances by Cage and Connery.  Great fx and thrilling action sequences.  The only fault I can find (well it isn't really a fault), is that Michael Biehn is seen to play the Commander of a seal team AGAIN.  Does this man do anything different?  After Aliens, Navy Seals and The Abyss it's time he played a new role.",Null,1,1,19 October 1998
Armageddon," Superb
","Let's be serious, there is nothing particularly realistic about this film. For starters, what are the chances that those asteroids would hit downtown Manhattan!  We can be hopeful of course, but more than likely it would be some obscure part of Russia or Nth Canada.  I am straying from the point. This is an all-American, gung-ho film.  The music (Jerry Bruckheimer music is always similar) provides the hero feeling and seeing them in their flight suits makes us all proud. All in all, the performances were good (Bruce Willis the same as always though).  The special fx were fantastic.  But more than anything, for an action flick I found myself rather attached to the characters.  Especially Bear and A.J.  And I was glad to see they both survived.  I also shed a few tears for poor orphaned Grace, left to survive on her own (with a totally gorgeous fiancee). Overall, I think this was a great film.  A mixture of a completely unrealistic storyline, gobsmacking fx, side splitting laughter, sniffly tissue moments and arm-rest gripping tension all contributed to the best film this year. I would see it again and again.",9,1,1,14 October 1998
Armageddon," State of the art
","It does make me laugh when people compare this film to Deep Impact.  The films are not even similar apart from the initial storyline!  Armageddon is far, far superior in every way, shape and form.  Actors - Bruce Willis (superb), Billy Bob (brilliant), Steve Buscemi (comic of the year), Ben Affleck (hunky and gung ho) and the amazing Liv Tyler VS Tea Leoni (yeeooorrgghh), Robert Duvall (booooorriing), Elijah Wood (hmmmm, there is potential, just not in this film) Morgan Freeman (ok, one exception) and that annoying Carrie from ER (how cardboard can you get???) Special effects in Armageddon leave Impact for dead.  Impact is not remotely funny - Armageddon pumps up the comedy from every angle. AND most of all - Armageddon crew had access to NASA.  Impact had to rely on a shuttle launch that has been filmed by every other film-maker too. Armageddon may not be realistic but at least it is entertaining, emotional and Liv Tyler delivers the performance of a lifetime.",9,1,1,19 April 1999
Dirty Dancing," Oh so hammy, but sweet
","This is the kind of film that everyone can watch and enjoy.  I have seen it more times than I can remember.  It is so predictable but the last dance scene gets me every time.  A fabulous soundtrack, an A-list dancer (Cynthia Rhodes, check her out in Flashdance and Staying Alive) and Patrick's bum all add up to a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",Null,0,2,19 October 1998
Titanic," You make me sick...
","I am getting physically ill sitting here reading what you ignorant people are writing about this film.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, of course.  But you people are slagging off a film based upon one of the most tragic nights in history.  You may not have enjoyed the script.  You may have thought it was too long.  But you are all hiding from the fact that this film is based on something REAL.  And it was documented very well in this film.  It gives us an accurate portrayal of the events as they happened.  And I happen to know that James Cameron is almost correct in his timeline of this film.  My grandmother survived the sinking of this ship. And I don't give a **** whether anyone believes me.  She lost her husband and her son (who would have been my uncle) and escaped with only my mother (her daughter).  She relived that awful night many times for me and I still cry when I think of her. You rude, ignorant fools.  Have some respect for the brave souls on that ship and in future keep your unwanted opinions to yourselves.",Null,2,4,15 October 1998
Titanic," Simply the best
","I was looking forward to this film for quite some time.  Although I was not a big fan of pretty-boy DiCaprio, I always have like James Cameron's work and I enjoy Kate Winslet (being British of course).  I did however, expect it to be just another Titanic story, nothing being new.  Over here in Britain the hype was not that big.  I am a major film freak but I only heard about the film 2 months prior to it's release!  So I missed all the rumours of over-budgeting, angry actors and flops. So on its day of release I wandered to the cinema to check out this film that I had heard about.  And oh my God! I have always had a morbid fascination of the ship itself (belonging to the Titanic Historical Society for over 5 years now).  But nothing prepared me for the range of emotions I felt during this film.  I left the cinema with misty eyes and heart so full of despairing hope, that I needed some time alone before attempting conversation with anyone. What an absolutely superb account of one of the most terrifying nights of the 20th Century.  For the first time ever, I was transported back in time to feel the passengers' confusion, despair, heartbreak and outrage.  And seeing all through the eyes of our very own Kate Winslet.  I was so relieved when she left the confines of her restricted life to embark on a journey of love with the young Jack.  I was laughing with them as they outwitted the awful Lovejoy, as they ran through the ship.  I was smiling motherly as they explored one another and Rose made the decision to leave the ship with Jack. But it all collapsed around them. I felt their startled confusion as the iceberg hit.  Their decision to alert the horrible Cal and Rose's narrow-minded mother, only to have Jack accused of stealing and taken below.  But Rose wouldn't leave him, and doing what I would have done she left Cal to rescue her beloved Jack.  Her bravery marked, she was pushed into a lifeboat, descending into the black water, never looking away from Jack as he waited on the doomed ship above.  This is where I fell apart.  I couldn't believe she was going to leave him.  But she jumped back on board only to be chased back down into the bowels of the ship by Cal. You know, I think it was essentially his fault that Jack died.  If he hadn't chased them, Jack and Rose could've made it to a lifeboat. I have nothing but respect for the actors who brought these people to life. For the first time in my life I felt as though my heart had been touched by the sight of such unbreakable love only to have my heart ripped out. Well done James Cameron, Leonardo and Kate.  Thank you for making me realise that life is what you make it.  And thank you for teaching me that there are people who let nothing on earth come between them.",Null,0,2,15 October 1998
Speed," Fast paced action
","God knows how many times I have seen this film.  One thing I love about Jan de Bont is his ability to make a film 'all go'  from start to finish.  No stuffing about, no boring parts.  Just all gung-ho action.  And this film has been credited with one of the most famous movie phrases of all time. 'There's a bomb on a bus, whadda you do?'  Great stuff.",Null,1,1,19 October 1998
The Truman Show," Not necessarily Jim's finest
","The Truman Show is damn good.  I can agree with that.  The whole idea of it is excellent. Completely original, brilliant writing and fabulous actors. Jim Carrey is one of my favourites.  I loved him in The Mask and as Ace Ventura of course.  But to be honest, I prefer him in comedies.  The Truman Show is a light-hearted film.  It isn't exactly serious.  But Jim is one of those rare people with the incredible art of being able to make anyone laugh.  He should use his talent.",Null,0,0,15 October 1998
The Wedding Singer," Just fab
","I do love this film - well, enough to see it twice anyway.  Thoroughly enjoyable, brilliant music and great actors.  Especially Steve Buscemi with his 'I'm the best guitar player in the world'.  A film I could see again and again.",Null,0,1,15 October 1998
