Mission: Impossible III," Hoffman's Very Good, the rest is just ludicrous. Disenchanted once again.
","There were enjoyable parts to this film, mostly the scenes with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but overall, this was a completely inert action film. Way too much was simply not believable or acceptable, even when you take into account the routine suspension of physics as we know them on planet Earth that happens frequently in action films. That helicopter chase with them flying through the wind generators was just ludicrous. Why couldn't the pilot just pull up fifty feet and fly above the damn things? Even though the helicopter in the Chunnel at the end of the original Mission Impossible was equally as dumb, I enjoyed that because at least director Brian De Palma knew it was stupid and made the scene playful by adding one hairy stunt on top of another.There is a lot in this film that has been stolen from other films. I know that everyone steals, but some people at least try to cover their tracks a little. But in the case of this film, strangely, I think the filmmakers simply may not know that the elements they stole were from other movies. There is a healthy dose of True Lies, License To Kill and On Her Majesty's Secret Service in Mission Impossible III. The action is mostly incoherent, hard to follow and shot in a quick-cut, hyper-fast way that makes everything look unbelievable and implausible. Surprisingly, the stunt coordinator was Vic Armstrong who has arranged the stunts for several James Bond films (Die Another Day, The World Is Not Enough). He is obviously someone who knows what he's doing, so where did the failure occur? In the case of Mission Impossible III, it is the filming of the stunt work by TV veteran director J.J. Abrams that is faulty. The other movies in the Mission Impossible series were directed by heavy visual stylists Brian De Palma and John Woo, but this third one has no filmic style at all and in many ways suffers for it. I wanted to like this film and they did succeed in giving us a good villain (something missing from the recent James Bond films), but there is no evidence that this was intended. I think the filmmakers just got lucky with the casting of Phillip Seymour Hoffman who recognized this kind of film as a lark and seemed determined to have as much fun with the part as possible.At one point when Tom Cruise is in full make-up so he looks like the villain played by Hoffman, I made a mental note to say something about Cruise's sense of humor and seeming relish at playing the villain while trying to remain the good guy when I stopped myself. It was really Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing this part, not Tom Cruise in make up, so it was once again Hoffman making something completely fun out what was probably dull on the page. Regarding Cruise's sense of humor. . . well, it has become non-existent. There is a scene at a house party early in the film where all of the woman at the party are maneuvered by the script (rather unbelievably) into saying how sexually attractive they find Tom Cruise. This comes out of nowhere and seems to be here simply to massage Cruise's ego and help dispel the constant 'gay' rumors that bedevil him. What has happened to Tom Cruise? He seems to have no sense of humor at all anymore and an ego that needs to be massaged by having all the extras fancy him. Whatever happened to that nice kid from Risky Business?A personal peeve: when a person's heart stops beating and it is luckily re-started by an electric jolt, the person doesn't jump up completely coherent. If your heart has stopped, there is usually something very wrong with you physically and you're not likely to just wake up and go about your business as if nothing much has happened. I hate movies that do this because it is so misleading. Yet this medical lunacy is a major dramatic plot element in Mission Impossible III and was one of the main reasons I disliked the film.",2,16,30,26 July 2006
Brokeback Mountain," A Film Full Of Real Pain, Still It Is Cathartic To Watch.
","A question, IS it better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all? Brokeback Mountain forces you to confront such conundrums. Heath Ledger stars as Ennis, a taciturn youth orphaned as a boy. He was raised by his siblings and he has never owned up to having any strong feelings of any kind, especially none for himself. One summer in 1963, he goes up to the titular mountain and along with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) they are given jobs tending sheep.One night, after consuming a pint of whiskey, these two young men have sex with each other. I won't say they 'made love' because this first time it is just a rough bout of alcohol fueled sex. They could easily brush it off with a, 'I was so drunk last night, I don't know what I did!', but they don't. Instead, before long, the rough mounting Ennis gave to Jack initially, slowly turns into mutual caressing, tender kissing and other playful physical contact.Both are high school dropouts with little future. Neither got much nurturing from parents or siblings, so this sudden discovery that they are both worthy of love and that they have the capacity TO love is scary. This fear is made worse because they are two guys. Whoops! It ain't supposed to be like that! Some reviewer's point out that Ennis and Jack have no words to describe what is happening to them but they do have words for what it's not. 'I'm not a queer', Ennis tells Jack. 'Neither am I', comes the reply. I have never seen a film with so much Homo-sex in it, but so little queerness as this one.Ennis goes on to marry Alma, a plain girl and by all rights, this should be the end. If it were, then Ennis might have a chance at normal happiness, but the 'love that dare not speak its name' is also the love that won't go away.Four years later Jack sends a post-card saying he's coming by for a visit and Ennis is beside himself with anticipation. When Jack finally shows up, they greet with warm handshakes, hugs and then to their surprise and delight, they kiss with intensity. Ennis's wife sees this kiss and wisely says nothing. Yet, Michelle Williams quite brilliantly shows us the wife's pain as she watches her husband kiss another (and a man no less) with more passion than he has ever kissed her.Ennis and Jack decide to keep up this relationship with quarterly 'fishing trips' wherein they are gone for weeks at a time, but never seem to bring home any fish. Both of them move like zombies on autopilot between fishing trips, for it is only then they feel they can be happy.Jack seems to have accepted that Ennis is his true love and he pushes for Ennis to settle down with him on a ranch together. It is the hopeful Jack who drives from Texas to Wyoming in an instant without thinking when he hears about Ennis's divorce. Jack also seems to have come to terms with his sexual attraction for men. In fact, when he can't have Ennis, he's off with the husband of one of his wife's friends or down in Mexico paying a male prostitute.Later, when Ennis visits Jack's childhood home and we meet his bastard parents and see the sparseness of his loveless upbringing, we see that Jack has indeed overcome a lot. But Ennis, dear Ennis, poor doomed Ennis only has eyes for Jack. I don't think he would be happy with another man or even another woman.Although Jack dies young in the film, it is Ennis who is the sad tragic character. The Chinese have it right, if you really want to hurt somebody, don't kill them; just let them live. Till the day Ennis dies he will have a dull ache in his heart named Jack. He'll also have the pain of knowing he could have been happy with Jack but he didn't act on it, and probably even drove Jack away.Brokeback Mountain wisely does not blame society for this dysfunction in Ennis. It would be too easy to place them in a blatantly homophobic environment. Homophobia is alluded to in the film, but clearly, in this case, the fault is not in society's inability to understand the love between Ennis and Jack, but in Ennis's inability to understand it. 'If you can't fix it, you have to stand it', is how Ennis sees his duty.Taking a cue from the philosophical idea that you can never really understand a thing until it is taken out of everyday context; this thing called 'love' becomes problematic if the object of your affection is not what you think it should be. Meaning, if Ennis had felt this strong love for a female, he WOULD have done something about it, but when Cupid shot the arrow into his heart, the name on the arrow was Jack. Nothing in his experience had prepared him for that, so he effectively shut down, even though Jack wants to live with him, he is too tortured to make the leap into Jacks more than willing arms. It is true, the strongest prisons are the ones we build for ourselves.Heath Ledger is excellent and so is Gyllenhaal, although Ledger has the harder role, emoting without saying or doing much, unlike the carefree Jack. The film-making here is solid and classical in style, there is no attempt to deconstruct the western genre here. It is a love story pure and simple, a doomed love story and so belongs in the realm of Romeo and Juliet, Gone With The Wind, Manhattan and Titanic. Brokeback Mountain is a touching and well-crafted story and film.",10,102,134,22 December 2005
500 Days of Summer," A Delightful ROM/COM! Joseph Gordon-Levitt Just Gets Better With Each Film!
","This is a thoroughly delightful romantic comedy that is actually romantic and above all funny. Joseph Gordon Levitt is just getting better with each passing year. If this film does not mark some kind of breakout for him, than I don't know what is wrong with people.Gordon-Levitt plays Thomas, a writer for a greeting card company based in LA. He has been a romantic since high school when he compulsively watched The Graduate and listened to British bands like The Smiths and Joy Division. A narrator informs us that Thomas believes in finding that one true love.His true love turns out to be Summer played by Zooey Deschanel. She comes to work at the greeting card company as an office assistant and they both fall into a somewhat passionate affair, at least from Thomas's perspective. Summer however, is a bit more cautious.Overlay this with a hip, retro score of old tunes and pop-cultural references and you could have something deplorable, but what can I say, this film is genius. We are immediately informed by the God-like narrator and the particularly hilarious disclaimer that this is a film that will not be afraid of using filmic technique.The title refers to the 500 days of Thomas's relationship with Summer and we are constantly shifting back and forth from different days of their love affair albeit with a helpful numeric counter title card. Some may find it disconcerting to go from say Day 4 to Day 309 and then to Day 83, but this is actually a quite effective structure for this story and the contrasts between the beginning of the affair from the end of the affair are sometimes hilarious, sometimes quite moving and sometimes realistically painful as only those who have been in an intense relationship can understand.The creative thinking throughout this movie is phenomenal, for example, to display different states of a characters mind, we see everything from a parody of a French New Wave film with Gordon-Levitt doing his best Jean Paul Belmondo, to a spoof of the chess scene on the beach from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal.At one point, we break into an extremely lively and hilarious musical number full of marching bands and a little animated bluebird tweeting precociously. At another point, we are thrust out of the story and directly into the offices of a record company where business executives try to figure out why there was a huge spike in sales of the Belle And Sebastian CD The Boy With The Arab Strap in northern Michigan. Trust me, in context, it is quite funny.If this film has a spiritual father, that has to be the 1977 Oscar winning film Annie Hall from director Woody Allen. Like that film, this one is about a writer of sorts and it follows the ups and downs of a relationship with a woman who starts out sort of weak, but develops personal strength as she goes along.There is a scene in this film that is a split screen in which Thomas goes to a party at Summer's apartment and we see on the left side of the screen Thomas's expectations of how that evening would go and on the right we see the reality. This is a brilliant touch to show the confusion between a characters hopes and their real lives and was reminiscent of the scene in Annie Hall where Woody Allen and Diane Keaton first meet and while they are making banal conversation we see their inner thoughts via subtitles.The director of this film seems to have come from the world of music videos and the screenwriters seem to have only one other produced credit, The Pink Panther 2. I had no desire to see that film before, but now I will.But it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who deserves a lot of praise. He has played very serious parts in the past, from the gay hustler in Mysterious Skin, the brain damaged ex-jock in The Lookout, he was the suicidal marine in Stop/Loss and the hard talking hero of that great High School noir film Brick.But he cuts loose here and he's dynamite. Sexy, intelligent, sometimes brooding and just a little bit arrogant, if I have had any complaint about Gordon-Levitt in the past, it's been that by taking such diverse roles, it looked more like he was trying to show-off his range, but here, he's a total charmer and nothing is harder to do on screen.While it probably won't happen, this is just the kind of small, pleasant film that should get a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. Too bad I'm not a voting member of the Academy or this film would be a clean sweep.",10,9,18,31 March 2009
Milk," Interesting, But Ordinary. I Expected More From Gus Van Sant
","I had very high hopes for MILK. Over the years I have followed its off and on status and when I saw that Gus Van Sant was directing and Sean Penn, Emile Hirsch, James Franco, Josh Brolin etc., were playing the parts, I was ecstatic.But then the film comes out and it's a respectable piece of work, very well made, by a group of talented professional filmmakers, but nothing to write home about. Everything is plain from the ordinary cinematography by Harris Savides to Danny Elfman's minimal score.Certainly, music with the big theatrical flourishes Elfman uses when he works with Tim Burton or Sam Raimi would be inappropriate, but something simpler like his score for A Civil Action or Standard Operating Procedure would have added something extra to the mix.But MILK was not devoid of dramatic jolts, not by a long shot. For example, I was unpleasantly reminded of Anita Bryant's ghastly existence once again.Although they didn't mention it in the film MILK, while there was a boycott on Coors beer here on the East Coast as well as San Francisco, there was also a boycott of Florida Orange Juice at the same time.The Florida Orange Growers did not take into account how much money they would lose if gay people boycotted their product. Once that became evident, the orange growers canned industry spokeswoman Anita Bryant very quickly. I find it reassuring to know that money will always trump God; at least here in the USA.As for Anita Bryant, she just faded into a well-deserved obscurity having done nothing of value in her whole adult life except to foster hate against her fellow American citizens who happened to not be heterosexual.Again, while I didn't dislike MILK, I didn't like it a whole lot either. I know most people don't like to watch documentaries, but the Oscar winning doco The Times Of Harvey Milk told the real story of Harvey Milk with the real people in a much more moving and dramatic way.Believe it or not, the documentary even tells you a lot more about Dan White than the feature film does. And while it doesn't make him sympathetic, it does explain his degenerating mind in a much clearer way. I don't think Dan White was secretly gay, which they hint at in the film MILK, but he was certainly neurotic and needed a lot of psychiatric help. But mostly, he was your typically angry conservative guy who hated anything not straight, not white and not God fearing (at least, what he perceived God fearing to be).But if a narrative feature doesn't expand our understanding of Harvey Milk either as a human being or as a political animal, then why make the film?I did like how MILK showed us the manipulative side of Harvey Milk, like when we see him placing a clump of dog poop exactly where he knew the TV cameras would be focusing on him so he could step in it, right on cue and prove his point about the need for San Francisco to enact a 'Pooper Scooper' law.Harvey Milk instinctively understood that local TV news audiences would love to see someone from city hall ruin his shoes by stepping in dog crap and he knew the TV stations would run that clip constantly. By all accounts, Harvey Milk knew exactly how to milk publicity, but that's what made him an effective San Francisco City Supervisor.Now, contrast that with the scenes between Harvey (Sean Penn) and his needy Hispanic boyfriend Jack Lira (Diego Luna). While the suicide of a lover in real life can be devastating to the surviving partner, those scenes just took up time and added nothing to my understanding of Harvey Milk as a man.Interestingly, the documentary The Times Of Harvey Milk does not go into this part of Harvey's life although it mentions several of his other lovers and we certainly see the real Jack Lira in archival film footage.Ultimately, that was my problem with MILK, it was too conventional. When I see a Gus Van Sant film, I want Gus Van Sant, not Ron Howard. Ron Howard can't do anything BUT conventional and ordinary.Whereas Gus Van Sant is a film artist of great depth, feeling, intelligence and variety (words never used to describe Ron Howard's film work). It may not be fair, but I expected a lot more from Gus and I felt let down.",7,5,12,2 December 2008
Capote," Suspense From The Art Of Writing? Capote Does The Impossible!
","This is a very deliberately paced story following Truman Capote as he researched and wrote In Cold Blood. Beginning when he sees a small article in the New York Times describing the shotgun killing of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas; Truman Capote for some reason thinks there is something broader and more meaningful to write about in this simple murder case than meets the eye.He was more correct than he could have imagined. As he explains in the film, there is the whole conservative, safe, behaved part of American society that we idolize and then there is a depraved, uncontrollable, violent part not very far beneath the nice surface and these two extremes met on the night of November 14, 1959 in an isolated Kansas farmhouse.The screenplay by actor Dan Futterman (Urbania, The Birdcage) is well written; not just in story structure (he actually builds suspense while waiting for Capote to write)) but especially in fleshing out the characters. Maybe there is a little skimping on the character of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas police guy who is in charge of investigating the killings, but it looks to me like there was more shot for the film and it just got cut out to make a more agreeable running time. The film does seem long and it is over two hours.Still, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is mesmerizing as Truman Capote. Truly, this is not just an impersonation of him, which would be easy to do given Capote's fluttery hand gestures and high-pitched voice. In real life, Truman Capote became such a caricature of himself that he was even made fun of in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall when, playing himself as a passerby in Central Park, he was ridiculed as coming in second in the 'Truman Capote Look A Like' contest. This is a very controlled performance that must have been a bitch to achieve, but Hoffman never lets you see the sweat. He is so totally in character that even in such throwaway moments as Capote watching a taxi pull away or looking around a hotel room, he is spot on.Hoffman is so good; you might forget there are other people in the cast. Catherine Keener as childhood friend of Capote and novelist Harper Lee (To Kill A Mockingbird) is her usual quiet strong self and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith is not as terse and 'psycho' as Robert Blake was in the same role in the film of In Cold Blood. Collins plays him as more of a sly charmer in this film and you can see why Capote was attracted to this muscular, tattooed convict. As cult film director John Waters claimed, there is something about a prison sentence that makes a man sexy. But Perry Smith is really just as much a user of people as Capote is, except that in this situation, Perry Smith is manipulating people to save his life; Capote is just doing it for a book.There is a palpable sense of how Truman Capote changed the art of writing, but maybe that's because I'm a reader and I know what Capote has done. Will someone for whom there is no American culture until Star Wars get a lot of the time period details and meaning? I don't know?One wrong period detail that stuck out to me was during a long conversation Capote has on a telephone and the phone handset clearly has an RJ11, four-pin jack on it. It may seem minor but those 'Registered Jacks' were not in use until 1976 and this scene takes place in 1961. Still, I was only momentarily bothered by this. Errors like that are inconsequential if the over-all film is worth watching and Capote most definitely is.",Null,1,3,23 October 2005
Burn After Reading," The Best Example Of Occam's Razor Put On Film And Brad Pitt Nearly Steals The Whole Film!
","Burn After Reading is a very funny Coen Brothers movie that is far more meaningful than their last film, the Best Picture winning film No Country For Old Men.Beginning with a cosmic zoom into the CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA. and ending the same way after some 90 odd minutes, Burn After Reading takes us on a screwball adventure of mistaken motives, extortion and a desperate need for plastic surgery. And since this is a Coen Brothers film, I do mean 90 'odd' minutes.Set in Washington in the here and now, (with one exception), we remain in the DC area and as everyone knows, Washington is a town that fairly runs on paranoia, secrecy and convoluted plots. That's also true of Hollywood and Wall Street, but at least the citizens of DC can pretend they are performing a public service, when they are really just running around on fool's errands.The plot starts when Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a mean and inept drunkard who mans the Balkan's Desk at the CIA is demoted for his alcohol problem. Angry, vengeful and raging impotently, Cox decides to write a tell-all book about his experiences with the CIA. The fact that he had a very low security clearance, was never privy to any important top secrets and knows nothing of any value to anyone does not occur to him.Simultaneously with this, Osborne's wife Katie, played by an icy/hot Tilda Swinton is planning to divorce him and she has been surreptitiously gathering information about Cox's true financial health so she can be sure to get a proper settlement after they divorce.Then, through some plot complications too difficult to recap, a computer disc of Cox's financial information is found on the floor of a local gym where the plastic surgery obsessed Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), and an empty-headed gym-bunny named Chad (Brad Pitt) make the fateful decision to use the information on the disc to extort money from Cox; a plan which fails abysmally.Still needing money for her elective surgery, Katie along with Chad then decide (rather rashly) to take the disc to the Russian Embassy in the hopes they will pay for the information. Which turns these two fitness trainers into 'Persons Of Interest' to the CIA.Those two separate plot points are the engines that propel Burn After Reading and both are based on the seemingly conflicting desires of revenge and self-improvement. But, as is typical of the Coen Brothers, the simplest of plans frequently go spectacularly awry. Don't worry if you lose track of the plot. As you will discover, with most Coen Brothers films, following the characters is more important than following the story line.For example, John Malkovich is perfectly unlikable as the bitter CIA man, but we soon conclude that he has never really been on top of anything in his life, which is why he treats Brad Pitt so abominably.Frances McDormand is thoroughly believable as the kind of woman who can't see how beautiful she is and acts as if a tummy tuck and breast augmentation are the magic bullets that will solve her persistent loneliness. But, McDormand's character is so self-absorbed she doesn't even notice that Ted (Richard Jenkins), her boss at the gym is in love with her and is secretly pained when he discovers that she's in trouble.But it's Brad Pitt who made the film for me. Whether he was stretching a gym patron's legs to the point where the guy's ligaments snap or just chewing gum and listening to his I-Pod while car dancing; being a complete featherbrain has never looked so sexy.There is a scene where Pitt is surveying Malkovich's Georgetown house when he notices some suspicious people going in and out of the house, coupled with another car down the road with a driver who also seems to be spying on Malkovich. As Pitt tries to process this information, you can literally see the wheels of his tiny brain grinding as he tries to formulate a theory about what he is witnessing, but his skull is as empty as a helium filled balloon. He is the living, breathing incarnation of a 'himbo' if ever I saw one, sporting a body that's a perfect 10, but an IQ in the negative numbersSince this is a Coen Brothers movie, you can expect some serious violence. Interestingly, most of the violence is perpetrated on the nicest and most naive of characters. Initially, I felt that the Coen Brothers had irreparably damaged this film by the inclusion of such violence against a major character we have come to like, but by the finale, considering the sheer ludicrousness of the whole story, I was smiling again. While all this other stuff is happening, there are some senior intelligence analysts at the CIA, keeping tabs on the people in this story and they are trying to make sense of it all, but they can't. This is where you should invoke Occam's Razor. Of course these CIA guys can't find a plot or pattern, because there isn't one.We live in a phenomenological world, where random things occur and are often not connected except by the most coincidental of tangents. Yet, because of our innate ability at pattern recognition, we humans can convince ourselves that all kinds of unconnected coincidences are meaningful. I hate the cliché of the weak-minded that claims, 'Everything happens for a reason'. Because in truth, not everything is connected. Some things happen for no rhyme or reason. Generally speaking, you should never believe there is some kind of conspiracy going on when ordinary stupidity and fecklessness is more than adequate to explain phenomenon. That is the ultimate message of Burn After Reading and it is a good message, and although it may be too bleak for some people to grasp, that doesn't make it any less true.",9,3,8,12 September 2008
Watchmen," This Film Makes Blade Runner Look Coherent.
","I did not go to see Watchmen with any great enthusiasm. I am not a comic book fan, never have been (except for MAD Magazine). I truly do not understand the appeal of these poseurs of literature known as 'graphic novels'; aren't they just comic books for college boys?I have enjoyed some comic book films however. I liked Iron Man, Superman Returns, and Batman Begins, but I hated both The Dark Knight and Sin City. Conversely, I liked Road To Perdition, Art School Confidential and Persepolis and they were based on graphic novels so I guess it has more to do with how a particular film is made than its fidelity to source material.But there was something about the whole Watchmen phenomena that looked to me like it would be a drag for anyone not initiated into the cult and I can respect that to a point.I now think that 'graphic novels'' fall into the same category as opera and NASCAR. Meaning that the people who are fans of those activities believe non-fans are all stupid. Think I'm wrong? Go ahead and make a disparaging comment about the Indy 500 in a red state or demean Tosca in a blue state, you'll get straightened out pretty quickly.The fans of graphic novels simply do not understand how a person can NOT be a fan.It's pretty simple really. They mostly all suck. And that includes car races and opera too.Forget that I don't know the back-story on these Watchmen characters (although the film tries to get you up to speed), even if I did, I don't think I would care about them. And by that I don't mean like the characters. I would've have loved to have hated some of them, but there was nothing to them at all.It's not because the actors didn't all try hard and they are a talented crew. I would have thought it impossible to make Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode and Jackie Earle Haley uninteresting, but they were. I felt bad for them.They were undone by the thousand little triumphs of the other film-making departments. Like, the special effects guys who worked to get Dr. Manhattan's blue color just right, to the costume folks who got the masks perfect, the make-up people who got the prosthetics to look properly gory and all of this combined with the editing, cinematography, production design, SPFX, digital effects all the way down to the rainmakers and 3rd assistant sound editors; they all did their jobs perfectly.To what end?Just because you use the best ingredients, if the chef is an idiot, that soufflé ain't gonna rise.So, if the 300 'auteur' wants to be responsible for another 'Un Film de Zack Snyder', he should also get the blame when it doesn't work. And Watchmen doesn't work.But here's a question, did anyone ask why they were making this film?It's an important question. I understand film as a commercial enterprise and certainly, if Watchmen makes millions of dollars, it doesn't really matter if it sucks as badly as Life Is Beautiful or Forrest Gump, but why was this film made otherwise?Other than making money (if it even does), can anyone on this film say they worked on it for any good reason other than that?The fanboys will no doubt blog endlessly in the vacuums of their chat rooms about whether the film is equal to the source comic books and God Bless them for that as long as they keep to themselves and don't bother the adults, but to the filmmakers I ask; what were you trying to achieve with this film?If you were trying to recreate the world of the comic books, did you succeed? What would that success have looked like on film? Or, is this like asking a Conservative what victory in Iraq would look like, knowing they haven't got the faintest idea.There were some neat touches; I liked the use of the music from Koyaanisqatsi over the back-story of Dr. Manhattan. I also liked the MUZAK version of Everybody Wants To Rule The World by Tears For Fears that played underneath the attempted assassination of Adrian Veidt.Otherwise, Watchmen was just a preponderance of pointless action scenes mixed with a retarded view of philosophy and science. I have not seen a film this aggressively stupid since that Ben Stein anti-evolution documentary last year. But at least Stein had the decency to be outright stupid, Watchmen might seem intellectually plausible to someone easily impressed by fuzzy thinking.",2,8,28,18 March 2009
Knowing," Thoughtful, Intense and Intelligent, But Still Emotionally Satisfying.
","The biggest surprise about Knowing is the fact I liked it a lot. Because a film containing prognostications of major disasters, coupled with science fiction and horror elements and leavened with unsubtle religious allegory is generally the kind of film I would avoid like a dose of the clap.Except for the major disaster part, this does not sound like my kind of movie. Especially since the main character, a grieving MIT professor is played by the ever-eccentric Nicholas Cage.Yet I believed he was smart enough to teach at MIT and that he was devastated by the recent death of his wife in a hotel fire and that he is now struggling with the challenges of raising his young son as a widower. Knowing begins in 1959 at an elementary school about to bury a time capsule slated to be opened fifty years hence. All the kids are asked to draw a picture of what the year 2009 will look like and among the various drawings of space ships, jet packs and rocket cars, one creepy little girl named Lucinda (Lara Robinson) writes out a list of numbers, filling an entire page.Fifty years later, in 2009, the time capsule is opened and John Koestler's son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) finds himself in possession of the paper with the numbers on it whose meaning is a puzzlement to all.Later that night, as a drunken Koestler looks at the numbers a little closer, he makes tenuous sense out of this grouping – 911012996 – which, if you put in the right dividing punctuation, looks like 9/11/01–2,996 or, September 11, 2001 with the 2,996 being the official death toll for that horrible day.With this key in mind, the meaning of the 'random' numbers now pops out like a revealed text. These numbers correspond to the dates of major disasters since 1959 including everything from Chernobyl to Lockerbie.Even more frightening, at the end of the page, there are numbers for future dates; and I mean dates only a few days away. John is stuck with a dilemma, he believes he has foreknowledge about the date, location and death toll for some future disaster.Naturally, his family and MIT colleagues discount his theories. It seems John Koestler has truly become a male Cassandra; cursed with an ability to see into the future, but with a complete inability to get anyone to believe him.We get a taste of what this means when John is speaking with a highway patrolman while stuck in traffic, when suddenly, an airliner in trouble comes whizzing in low and crashes in the field next to the Interstate.Later, another disaster is seemingly confirmed by this paper when John is witness to a particularly horrible subway crash that he was equally helpless to prevent. Yet, while all of this is happening, there is another subplot showing some strange humanoid figures that always seem to be in the background behind John and Caleb.Caleb also has haunting visions of the Earth in flames and this coincides with an unusual amount of solar flare activity and Knowing seems to be implying that we are quickly approaching the end of the world as we know it.I recognize that this becomes a tough pill to swallow for many people who have been enjoying the thrill ride that Knowing is giving them. It means you now have to shift your narrative perspective to include a larger and more all-encompassing ontological philosophy. I would normally be troubled by this shift in a film's point of view, yet Knowing adroitly manages to show us the more fantastic narrative elements at the same time as the Nicholas Cage character John Koestler experiences them.So, as John Koestler began to grasp the larger dimensions of what was happening to him and to realize that it didn't comport to his current notions of reality, Koestler had to make a philosophical shift and I made the intellectual leap along with him.Like John Koestler, I didn't fully understand exactly how the bizarre things that were happening were actually happening, but I could not deny the reality of them happening.So, when it came time for John to say his final goodbye to Caleb, I was wracked with tears because I knew young Caleb had to leave with these aliens who, while scary at the start of Knowing, have since become the benevolent saviors of humankind.If my last few paragraphs seem like I am talking about a different movie than Knowing, I understand your confusion. All I can say is that Knowing tries one of the most risky and difficult gambits for any movie, it undergoes a complete shift in tone and story, but it works here.I have no doubt there will be people offended by the plot convolutions and semi-religious imagery that mark the denouement of Knowing. But in my lifetime of movie going, I have frequently found that some of the most memorable films to me personally are the ones I can't easily categorize.Knowing crosses several film genres and will probably displease the die-hard fans in each of them. Sci-Fi lovers will find it too much like a thriller. Thriller lovers will find it too much like a horror film. Horror lovers will find it too scientific. Scientifically minded people will find it too religious and religious people will hate it because it doesn't exclusively promote whatever religion it is they believe in and to top it off, the whole thing reeks of crappy New Age ideology.Still, I found Knowing to be a compelling, visually stunning, dramatically interesting and narratively challenging film and I was totally taken to a different world created by film-making professionals who clearly knew what they were doing.And that is an all too rare experience at the movies today.",10,14,30,2 July 2009
Jarhead," Decaffinated Full Metal Jacket with no point!
","What is this film about? We follow a recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal who has buffed up his body (apparently at the expense of his brain) as he goes through basic training, through to his deployment in the desert during The Gulf War. What I have liked about Gyllenhaal in the past was he didn't come across as a vapid pretty boy. He always showed intelligence and wit even in minor crap like The Day After Tomorrow. That is missing from his character of Swofford in Jarhead. Here, he just comes across as a good-looking piece of thick-witted man-meat.This is not to say the real Anthony Swofford, whose book this film is based on is a dope; it just shows that the choices the filmmakers have made are dopey. We begin with voice over narration from Gyllenhaal's Swofford and we are meant to see this world through his eyes, but the filmmakers think that if they give him any kind of strong opinions, ideas or emotions, we in the audience will be alienated. I think they are wrong.I was alienated by Gyllenhaal being such a blank slate. I don't mind characters in movies having definite points of view, even if I disagree with them. The one time Gyllenhaal's Swofford shows any humanity or spirit is when he threatens another Marine while reciting his 'Rifle Code' and then asks the other Marine to kill him because he's bored. But like many others in the film, this scene goes nowhere.By the time of that scene, I had already given up on Jarhead; mostly for depicting things that aren't believable. For example, during the basic training sequence, they show a recruit being killed by LIVE FIRE. Yes killed, not by heat stroke or a heart attack (which DOES happen) but being KILLED BY A RIFLE SHOT IN THE HEAD. Do the Marines really use live rounds during this type of training? Perhaps they do, but even the Marines don't like to see their recruits killed stateside during training. There would most definitely be hell to pay if that happened; yet Jamie Foxx's instructor just shrugs this death off, like it happens every day. He even yells at the dead recruit as if it was his fault for getting shot. Has this ever happened? If so, were there no consequences? Any of us who saw that situation developing would have called CEASRE FIRE! But Foxx didn't.I've been in the service and I went through basic training and I know The Air Force would not have tolerated this. Foxx would have been removed from command and probably Court Marshaled. Later, another Marine kills some camels and then abuses an Arab corpse and we are told by Jamie Foxx (who was in command when the recruit got shot) that the Marines are 'not like the Army' and they don't put up with that. Not put up with shooting a camel, but shooting a human recruit in the head during basic is OK? This is ludicrous, even for the Marines with their misplaced pride in toughness over intelligence.In another scene, the Marines watch Apocalypse Now and they cheer and mimic the actions on the screen like an audience at a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (they're even dressed like the movie characters, but that is coincidence). I don't doubt this happens, but what is the point of the scene? Doesn't any Marine recognize that Apocalypse Now is ridiculing the very same macho attitudes they are cheering about? What am I to think when Lucas Black gets some hot crude oil in his eye and panics and has to be held down while his fellow Marines wipe the burning oil out of his eye? Wouldn't regular oil workers do the same if one of their co-workers got oil in his eye? Wouldn't you do the same if a co-worker got some WhiteOut in their eye at the office? What's the point here?Jarhead plays like a decaffeinated version of Full Metal Jacket. In that film, we also followed a Marine recruit through Basic Training and then to war, albeit the Vietnam War. But, Kubrick's film showed the psychological devastation of what being trained to kill does to a basically decent person, but what is Jarhead saying? That if you train Marines to kill, you better let them kill or they'll be really angry? In the film, they reiterate the Marine mantra that the 'most deadly weapon in the world' is a trained Marine. Not true. My vote is for the Hydrogen Bomb.Is some statement being made about preparing guys to kill and then, at just the moment they are about to kill, you take it away from them? If there is a big meaning to this, I missed it. All in all this film just dragged on and on without any kind of statement or story. The usually good Jake Gyllenhaal was saddled with nothing to do but show off his newly acquired buff body and having him dream about vomiting sand does not constitute character insight.The only interesting parts came from the supporting characters. Peter Sarsgaard once again does that magical alchemy of making something out of nothing (see Garden State and Kinsey) and Lucas Black is fine as the grumbling, but intelligent Marine who constantly questions his orders. The smart and sexy Lucas Black is just waiting for a role that will define him as an adult actor the way Sling Blade defined him as a child actor. I hope he gets it soon.",2,1,4,13 November 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Don't be afraid to criticize this film! You can still be patriotic and not like it.
","Spielberg has claimed in interviews that one of his purposes in making Saving Private Ryan was to specifically honor the soldiers who fought that war; a noble sentiment. But being a film buff, you'd think Spielberg would be familiar with the constant stream of films from the 40's through the 50's into the 60's and beyond including TV shows that did just that. It makes me wonder if he had another purpose in making Saving Private Ryan.He does. In the excellent series of interview DVD's put out by the American Film Institute titled The Directors, in the episode devoted to Spielberg he claims that he wanted to make Saving Private Ryan with a documentary style eschewing the Chapman Cranes and Steadicam approach to big budget film-making. He wanted the film to look exactly like a war photographer would have shot it had he been at Omaha Beach.Clearly, one look at the opening beach sequence shows he succeeded in that desire. But if Chapman cranes and Steadicams are not realistic, is artificially slowing down the film OK? How about de-saturating the color out of the film to make it almost seem black and white? What about heavily manipulating the soundtrack? Does war really exist in Dolby 5.1 Sound? I mean, what are we REALLY watching here? What has Spielberg done with Saving Private Ryan other than simply add an element of 'Chainsaw Massacre Movie' gore to the war film, a genre that is surprisingly non-gory. But the thing that annoys me most about Saving Private Ryan is something that is no real fault of the film. It's the way so many people fatuously praise the film as being 'realistic'. A bunch of different critics even stated that this film 'avoids all the clichés' usually associated with WWII films.Avoids clichés? Have any of you seen it? Well, lets just start with the squad who goes after Private Ryan in the film, do we have the tough, but decent guy from the Midwest? Check, Tom Hanks! Do we have a vaguely ethnic type? Check, Vin Diesel as Caparzo. How about the young coward who later on shows courage? Check with Jeremy Davies character. What about the wise guy from New York? Check with Ed Burns. Did we forget the country boy sharpshooter? No, we have Barry Pepper as a cross kissing sniper. You may just as well have cast Anthony Quinn, Wally Cassel, William Bendix, Lloyd Nolan and Richard Jaeckel. Certainly, John Wayne would have been perfect for the Tom Hanks role.Staying with realism, does Spielberg even get the facts of Omaha Beach right? The real plan was for the men to secure the beach and then have bulldozers knock down the sea wall. Tanks would then blast through German fortifications and then the men would follow the tanks. What really happened was that the water and tides were unexpectedly strong and the men were washed completely off course. That's why they landed directly in front of German machine gun nests; they certainly weren't heading there on purpose. After suffering terrible human losses and with the water being too deep for the tanks, (only 2 of the 29 tanks ever made it), the surviving men waited at the sea wall for five or six hours until German fire had died down and then they climbed up the sides of the bluffs, double-backed and attacked the Germans from behind, eventually over running them. That's what really happened. I found that out by simply looking this battle up in the Encyclopedia Britannica. Apparently, that is something no one at Paramount Pictures did because that is not what happens in the 'realistic' Saving Private Ryan.Spielberg presents the Omaha Beach slaughter as if this is what happened all over on D-Day. Again, not true, in fact, troop casualties were much less than expected. Yes, more than 2000 soldiers died at Omaha Beach, which saw the fiercest fighting and was a terrible slaughter, but a fifteen miles down the coastline at Utah Beach, they suffered less than 200 casualties and even less to the north at Juno and Gold beaches. I'm not trying to be disingenuous here. I know Saving Private Ryan was about this specific group going into this particular battle, but overall, what was presented in Saving Private Ryan is not what most soldiers faced that day.But what is really unforgivable to me, if you watch Saving Private Ryan, is you will get no sense that anybody other than Americans were involved in this action. Remember, it was called The Allied Invasion, not The American Invasion, which might explain why Saving Private Ryan is hailed as being accurate over here, but in other countries, notably Britain and Canada, who also lost soldiers that day, they find this film laughable.Nobody minds that Spielberg fudged things historical in order to make a dramatic movie. But pretending you didn't is wrong. And yes, just because Paramount Pictures says this is the way it happened, don't make it so. Saving Private Ryan is clearly a well-intentioned film and was made with skill and care. But, ultimately it is nothing more than a feel good picture, full of flag waving banalities and video game style violence. It is World War II: The Ride. Steven Spielberg has made a gripping and entertaining film with Saving Private Ryan. But that's all. Let's save our Medals of Honor for those who show bravery in an actual war.",2,4,9,27 November 2005
Peaceful Warrior," Sub-Mental Twaddle Combined With New Age Lunacy, But Scott Mechlowicz is good!
","I was wary about seeing this film because everything in the preview indicated I would find it insufferable, but I went to see it for one reason only and I am glad I did. The film follows a young gymnast named Dan Millman (played by Scott Mechlowicz) who is very talented, but arrogant and selfish which means he has to be knocked down a peg or two by the movies end. Through the course of Peaceful Warrior, Dan will also learn something about life, love and himself. Good luck keeping from vomiting. I failed but fortunately I had not eaten lunch, so I only had dry heaves.Not only does Peaceful Warrior espouse a philosophy no deeper than your average Chinese Restaurant fortune cookie, but it adds a level of mystical New Age crap on top that truly pushes the film into the realm of the insulting. Here's an example of a great truth according to the film, 'the hardest people to love are the ones who need love the most'. Right, like Adolf Hitler and Jeffrey Dahmer.Apparently, our gymnast hero Dan Millman (who already has a coach who is dedicated and caring) has not learned such basic things like the importance of focusing your mind on your immediate task when doing a complicated gymnastics routine. Dan has to get this nugget of wisdom from a grizzled old gas station attendant (played by a grizzled old Nick Nolte) who appears out of the night mist at a service station and may actually exist only in Dan's mind.There is nothing wrong with stories about people overcoming great odds and succeeding despite handicaps. Stories like that should be wonderful and inspiring but all too often they are just depressing and full of boneheaded, limp platitudes that offer nothing in the way of insight. This film is supposed to be inspired by real events and I don't doubt that the real Dan Millman overcoming a severely broken leg to get back up and become successful at gymnastics was not a great feat. But what is all of this 'way of the warrior' crap? I immediately thought of the guys from Murderball and how none of them needed a fuzzy brained guru named Socrates to succeed and recover. They did it the natural way, with human brains, sweat, hard work and the help of family and friends.Nick Nolte's phantom-like character appears just when our hero Dan has been having a spell of bad dreams, such as having his ankle shatter in to a million pieces of frozen chicken breast. Then, like Yoda chairing an AA meeting, he spouts fanciful parables and nonsense blather about 'taking out the mental trash' and being 'in the moment'. Socrates (as Dan calls him which is an insult to the real Socrates) even advocates not thinking of the future or the past, as if that were good advice! Think about that for a second. If you never think of the past or the future then you are living like Guy Pearce did in the film Memento. Yeah, that's an improvement.Focusing on the here and now is generally good advice, but our guru has to toss poor Danny off a bridge into a creek for him to learn that. 'Your mind was focused on only one thing while you were falling', Socrates tells him, 'you even had a word for it, 'Ahhhh!' Do you imagine the poor people who jumped from the World Trade Center were very focused? I don't think so. I'm sure they each had a lot of very different feelings and emotions going through their minds. Too bad they couldn't be as disciplined as our gymnast hero and his flaky gas jockey guru. They might have died happy.Still, despite the psychobabble and sub-mental twaddle that passes for insight, Scott Mechlowicz makes this a tolerable film. He is a young actor to watch. With his slender physique and expressive face, he seems to be able to run a gamut of emotion. He was unique among the cast of Mean Creek in that he was simultaneously the most menacing of the boys, but also the one you felt most sorry for. He was delightfully goofy in EuroTrip and he seems to be an actor of good range and he is cute as hell. He will get better looking as he gets older and I don't think we've seen all that this guy can do. I hope he's in more comedies, but I will see almost anything he's in. He is the only reason I stayed to watch this film until the end.",1,14,29,27 July 2006
The Illusionist," Why Must Innocent People Pay For The Hero's Love Life? It's Unconscionable!
","Ultimately I disliked this film because I felt queasy about the single-minded quest of our illusionist hero Eisenheim played by Edward Norton to muscle in on the romantic affairs of the Crown Prince Leopold. Presumably with a childlike taunt of 'I saw her first', Eisenheim feels that he has the right to have Jessica Biel for himself even though she is betrothed to the Crown Prince. Taking his cue from other amoral, selfish types who think their own desires are the only ones that need fulfilling, when Eisenheim is finished, we have an innocent man in jail for murder (who will presumably stay there) and the suicide of another man who is made to think he killed someone who is actually still alive. All of this is perpetrated so Norton and Biel can go off together and live happily ever after. Why did so many innocent people have to suffer for their love? Couldn't they have just eloped or run away? I actually heard people in the audience cheer and applaud when the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) shot himself. Suicide should not be laughed at in this manner. Maybe I'm old fashioned that way, but whatever the Crown Prince's crimes, they were not worth a bullet in the head. It is not OK to trick the Crown Prince simply because he is alleged to have beaten up his girlfriends from time to time. Key word there is 'alleged', we never actually see him do anything violent, even if he is a bit of a jerk. Sadly, being a jerk is not against the law or our prisons would have long since been over filled.There are other unbelievable things in this story; for example, it was only fifteen years since the heroine played by Jessica Biel laid eyes on her childhood friend Eisenheim, so it is not believable that she did not recognize him at all when she saw him again as an adult. I mean, she kept a picture of him in a secret locket that she no doubt looked at from time to time, but she couldn't recognize him when she finally saw him? She couldn't figure out who this guy is right away? How many sleight of hand masters does she know?Plus, how much did he really love her if he couldn't wait to run away for fifteen years in the first place? Now all of a sudden he thinks he can't live without her? Also, wet rope makes more sparks than the chemistry between Norton and Biel, even though both are good actors.Consider what actually happens in this film: Ed Norton's Illusionist breaks up a prosperous and seemingly OK engagement (what couple doesn't have occasional fights?). He has a man put in jail on false murder charges and forces another man to kill himself, all to satisfy his romantic jones. How long were they going to let the poor innocent man rot in jail for the murder of Jessica Biel's character before mentioning that 'Oh by the way'; she's not dead and he's in jail on false pretenses? This is unconscionable in every way. Wisely, the filmmakers never show us the poor sap who was jailed for Jessica Biel's alleged murder. I can only presume that he is not having a good time. If we in the audience ever connected the poor fellow to someone with a life and a family, we would not be so sanguine that Norton and Biel find their happiness at his expense. Now, with the Crown Prince dead, and Biel gone, will Paul Giamatti's police chief finally realize and admit he screwed up the case and release the innocent man? I doubt it.Also, the 'Sixth Sense' like ending where every thing is explained is a bit clumsy and Giamatti should have already figured it all out anyway. Other wise, the film has a power, I could not take my eyes off the screen despite the fact that no sparks fly between Norton and Biel at all. The magic scenes were interesting, but not so compelling as they would be in a live stage performance. I know how they do tricks in movies; I don't know how magicians do it on a live stage. Phillip Glass's score is only ordinary; I had hoped for more. But that's obviously a paradox; more from a minimalist.",3,6,18,10 September 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good Subject! Not So Good Movie.
","A sterling effort, perhaps too sterling. I have seen the original Edward R. Murrow See It Now shows about the Air Force Lt. Milo Radulovich who was discharged from the USAF because his father read Serbian language newspapers and his sister was an obnoxious person, probably a Communist, but then, that was her private business. I saw the episode where Murrow took on Joe McCarthy and the episode containing McCarthy's ridiculous response.This film added nothing to my understanding of the issues, the time period and the people. So, since the See It Now episodes are available on DVD and video, why see a movie with movie stars that simply recreate those shows almost verbatim? If the film doesn't go any deeper with the issues than the TV broadcasts, or doesn't go into any new territory with the characters, what's the point? I suppose they could have overly dramatized the situation and co-writer/director George Clooney shows restraint in not doing that, but you can go too far the other way and turn an inherently dramatic situation into a dry history lesson. I wanted this fictionalization to engage my emotions, my feelings and my passions. I felt like I was in a Civics 101 class and I was listening to a less than inspiring professor. Say what you will about Michael Moore's style, but his films do get the blood boiling, either you're for him or you're against him, but you ARE moved emotionally.This film could have used a nice dose of moral outrage. It wasn't that McCarthy and others were immoral, they weren't, they were ordinary sleaze-bags so nakedly hungry for headlines they recklessly charged people with treasonous crimes and then did nothing to support their claims. All of this was done as an ego boost and a power grab and it was painfully obvious to anyone who bothered to look. This film didn't need to give McCarthy's viewpoint a fair hearing; Murrow himself in the film says that sometimes there aren't two equal sides to an argument. Murrow has a point; slavery has no justification in any scheme.I really wanted to be moved by this film, but I wasn't. It was all too clinical, something I usually like, but here it didn't work. For example, I have seen documentaries on Titanic that informed me but did not make me cry as I did when I saw the James Cameron film Titanic. And I didn't cry because of the silly love story in that film, I cried at the lost humanity and terror of the people on the ship and the inevitability of their demise. Good Night and Good Luck suffers from too much restraint.There are too many unanswered questions in the film; for example, I wanted to know why at CBS two employees could not be married? Why did Murrow and Fred Friendly sign the dreaded loyalty oaths? Everyone seems surprised to discover that Murrow signed it; he must have had a reason. Why not share it with us? What's with all of the long, long silences after Murrow finishes his newscasts? What's with all of the shots of people walking aimlessly though the CBS building while non-synchronous sound is overlaid? Why film in black and white? The world did not exist in black and white in the fifties. That's an aesthetic choice, but I can't really substantiate it, except that it is cool looking to have cigarette smoke wafting around inside closed rooms.Good Night And Good Luck is a noble effort, but for the real history of what Edward R. Murrow and company actually did and said, watch the actual See It Now TV shows, they are available. Regarding the paranoia and emotions of this era, that is better dealt with in the Martin Ritt film from 1976 called The Front starring Woody Allen and Zero Mostel.",5,5,10,15 October 2005
World Trade Center," The Best Ron Howard Film That Ron Howard Never Made.
","I didn't dislike this film, but I sure didn't like it a whole lot. It has nothing to do with the 'it's too soon for 9/11 stories' argument. It has more to do with the fact that all throughout the film, I kept thinking of the almost 2,900 other families that had bad news that day. I am very happy Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin survived and I am sure they are equally happy as well. They had something very horrible happen to them that I truly would not wish on anyone. They were both extremely lucky when a massive building fell on their heads. But other than getting lucky, what did they do that was so inspiring? Having worked as a paramedic, I can tell you that most anyone else in that same situation would have done the same things they did to keep up their spirits and to live. Generally speaking, people fight for their lives; it is totally natural and ingrained in us to do so. However, just because we have a story that is exceptional in real life, it does not always become that amazing a movie story.Roger Ebert is on to something in his review; would World Trade Center be anywhere near as compelling if it were about, say, two construction workers surviving for a day in the rubble after the collapse of a parking garage in Muncie, Indiana? I mean, have the trapped workers say all the same dialog and the use the same cut aways to the worried families. Would that film be anything more than a mediocre episode of Rescue 911? Although this film is well made and competently put together, it really resembles a TV movie of the week with a big budget more than anything else. It is the forced sense of inspiration I felt throughout the film that bugged me. I want to be inspired because of something great and unique that happened that day. Certainly the stories in the excellent book 102 Minutes tell of numerous happenings far more hairy, scary, dangerous and inspirational than the story of these two Port Authority cops found alive in the rubble. I mean, with one exception, no professional rescuer ever reached anyone in the impact area of either building.It was the regular, untrained and very scared ordinary men and women who helped their fellow citizens on the impact floors who were the real heroes in the World Trade Center. Many of them died when the building collapsed even though they had time to escape. They just kept going back for more trapped people. Once again, I'm not criticizing the trapped Port Authority men or their rescuers, but the filmmakers for taking the easy way out and making this story so blandly joyful that I actually felt nothing at the end.In fact, the only moment where I felt emotion and tears welling up (and incidentally the only moment when I heard anyone else in the audience react) was when Jimeno's wife was talking to the black woman whose son was an elevator operator in the South Tower and she says that she yelled at him the last time she saw him. It was a beautiful moment played between the two actresses that was truly poignant. The film could have used more moments like that.Maybe I expected something a little more provocative from Oliver Stone. He can usually be counted on to get the emotions boiling (for better or worse) but not in this film. This could have been a Ron Howard film in that it was completely safe, sane, bland and not objectionable in any way. Opie could even have given a supporting role to his brother Clint as one of the rescuers.Also, who was that scary guy with Charles Manson eyes who put on his Marine uniform and went down to Ground Zero to help out? Is that a true story? He came across as a weird individual. Especially when he starts saying things about God's curtains and stuff. Well, every disaster brings out the wackos. Overall, I liked the film, but I did find it a bit dull, uninspiring and certainly when we see Jesus bringing the Evian water, I almost laughed.I have no doubt that future films about September 11 will be held to a different standard and we may see something similar to the Holocaust Film Syndrome. That syndrome postulates that any film against the Holocaust must ipso facto be a good film because of its subject matter alone. To criticize a Holocaust film (for being lousy or stupid) is like agreeing with the Nazi's. This syndrome is more prevalent among the members of the general public than among critics, which is why a morally reprehensible piece of junk like Life Is Beautiful can be so inexplicably popular.Remember, just because a film is about a noble subject, it does not automatically mean that the film is any good.",4,4,13,14 August 2006
Invictus," Invictus Turns The Truly Inspiring Nelson Mandela Into A Platitude Mouthing Yoda-like Character.
","I recently celebrated a milestone birthday. As I reflected upon the day, I thought about the sheer number of unlikely things that have occurred in my lifetime.Back when I was ten, the idea that Great Britain and the IRA would ever achieve a ceasefire was, at best, a dim prospect. Likewise, no one thought the USSR would ever dissolve or that the Berlin Wall would be dismantled and the idea that a black man would one day be elected President of the USA was given about as much a chance of happening as finding two identical snowflakes.The thought that South Africa, a county where racism WAS the official government policy would ever end its evil apartheid ways was almost inconceivable. Adding to that, the fact that the citizens of South Africa elected themselves a black president was an almost unbelievable turn of events.Then, in order to prevent his country from devolving into resentment and revenge, President Nelson Mandela (a believer in the power of forgiveness) established the Truth And Reconciliation Commission where people could admit to their past racist misdeeds and then be publicly forgiven.This showed me that the people of South Africa, both black and white have achieved a level of grace and civility that we Americans can only dream about.If you don't believe me, just listen to any Teabagger or wingnut religious conservative on contemporary talk radio. You won't hear more foolish hateful nonsense this side of a fascist dictator. However, what the real Nelson Mandela did to avoid the potential revenge and recriminations of the people is an inspiring story that truly gives me hope for mankind.So how come Invictus proved to be one of the most annoying experiences I have spent in a movie theater in a long time? Was it because director Clint Eastwood has reduced Nelson Mandela to a supporting player in his own life and instead focused his film on a white rugby team?Was it because he turned Nelson Mandela into a Yoda-like character sputtering out banal philosophy that would embarrass even the flightiest of New Age nit-wits, or even a serious New Age nit-wit like Deepak Chopra? I mean, what has happened to Clint Eastwood?How can it be that after directing about 30+ feature films, Eastwood still has not developed any kind of camera sense. I find it hard to accept the sloppy choices of angles and coverage in Eastwood's films, especially since he usually works with very competent cinematographers and editors.Every poignant plot point is telegraphed well in advance, so any chance of surprise or insight is muffed. Is this what his vast experience in the film industry has taught him?Clint Eastwood has spoken with admiration of some of the directors he has worked with in the past, like the Hollywood studio trained minimalist Don Siegel and the operatic Italian Sergio Leone, in fact, he's even dedicated films to those two masters. Why Clint Eastwood now desires to direct films like Ron Howard is a true mystery.But there are a couple of things in Invictus that even the anemically talented Ron Howard would never have done. For instance, what's with all the musical montages that serve no purpose but to slow down an already leaden pace?What's with the unforgivable instance of showing a massive jet liner buzzing the rugby stadium during the final game? Now, I know that the plane buzzing actually happened, but Eastwood uses this incident as a way to instantly tap into our post 9/11 awareness of planes flying into buildings for terroristic purposes to create a false moment of tension.I mean, even the most xenophobic American who cares not one whit about what happens outside the borders of the continental United States would have at least heard about a jet liner crashing into a rugby stadium in South Africa during the World Cup game, which, by the way, is actually played for by teams from around the world, most unlike our own masturbatory baseball World Series where we even celebrate the lunacy of two teams from the same city competing with each other, as if this were something culturally significant.I could have told Eastwood that he was on a fool's errand if he was specifically trying to make an inspirational movie. If an audience finds some kind of inspiration from your film, that's great, but they are the only ones who can do that. If you try to impose that feeling on people, you will just end up sounding preachy and scolding and believe me, the only thing worse than false sincerity is false inspiration.Invictus is a two hour plus scolding lesson full of inspirational haranguing that has the effect of pummeling you into brain dead, but laudatory submission. But, when the whole damn fool audience is cheering at the most cliché of sport movie banalities, it is easier to just flow with the crowd.Although not explained clearly, the title Invictus is Latin for 'unconquered' and is the title of a famous poem by William Ernest Hensly that ends with the lines 'I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.'Apparently, Nelson Mandela used to recite the poem to himself during his long imprisonment to help keep himself sane. But there is a more recent use of the poem Invictus that deserves to be mentioned.It seems that when Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed on June 11, 2001, he used the Hensley poem Invictus as his final statement. Why do I find that coincidence much more interesting and intriguing than this film? But hey, if it's inspiring enough for Timothy McVeigh, who am I to argue?",1,34,68,15 December 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Listless, Pointless, Dull and far Worse than I had Imagined!
","By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running. This is a thriller with no thrills, an intellectual mystery with no mystery or intellect. It posits a mystery 2000 years old and feels like it was filmed in real time. Who is Robert Langdon, the hero played by Tom Hanks? I get no feeling for anything about the guy, his claustrophobia is presented as being important, but it is an uninteresting embellishment and is clearly not important to the story.The whole story for the film reduces to. . .well, I don't know what it reduces to? I seemed to just be watching pretentious people running around on fool's errands. This is not always a problem in a movie, no one can adequately explain The Big Sleep and I defy anyone to clearly tell me what happens in the recent Russian film Night Watch, but those films have a surfeit of characters that make the twists and turns interesting to follow. Not to mention a wonderful visual strategy that makes them breath. The Da Vinci Code is a suffocating film that does the impossible; it makes the Louvre look boring.I was puzzled by the casting. With all American Tom Hanks on board and the French Audrey Tautou, the German Jurgen Prochnow and the competent Brits: Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellen, we have a Chinese dinner approach to casting 'one from column A and one from column B', but this cast doesn't gel. They each do their little bits, but the whole does not add up to more than the parts. There were too many little things that rankled me or anyone with half a brain. The Louvre is filmed so blandly, that it doesn't really matter that they really used the real place for a location. Also, the Louvre does not have steel gates that come down when a painting is removed from the wall. Also, Tautou introduces herself as a 'French Police Cryptologist'. French Police Cryptologist? The French have a national police? The Louvre wouldn't be in the Paris police jurisdiction? Does your city have a staff cryptologist on its police force? Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock 'refrigerator moment'. I can take religious hooey, but I can't take scientific hooey. Even the car chases are uninteresting, and badly filmed.One more thing, if I am ever shot and have to leave a clue to the identity of my killer, I will write that he was an albino monk in a cassock with a cell phone and an automatic. There can't be that many running around, even in Paris.",1,103,199,14 June 2006
The Social Network," Like The Lead Character, The Social Network Misses The Important Ideas
","There is something wrong with this film like it was put though a filter of some type to remove any real humanity, unless that is the point. I'm not a psychiatrist but Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in the film seems to suffer from some kind of emotional agnosia. . .and so does the film.I was looking forward to this film and I had fun watching it, but as I thought about it afterwards, all I could remember were the squandered opportunities the film had to actually tell a moving story about friendship and loyalty that got wrecked by a cool business venture that became much too successful way too quickly. Both Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher have both said The Social Network is not really about the 'Facebook saga' with Sorkin even being so bold as to claim the basic story goes all the way back to the Greek dramatists. He has a point, so what do you think, would Aristophanes have been a MAC man or a PC user? Truly, you won't find a better emotional core to build a drama around than the relationship between best friends Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). That bromance is the heart of The Social Network and the film kept getting close to this emotional territory but then it would crash like an overloaded network and flit to other characters not important to the main story.For example, the machinations of the Winklevoss twins are comic relief elevated to main story arc status. The self-righteous anger they feel and the lengths they go to seek revenge play like Margaret Dumont fighting with Groucho Marx.It's very satisfying to see these overly entitled, great white hopes become dismayingly angry that things didn't go exactly the way they wanted them to for probably the first time in their lives. The Social Network develops a sharp edge to it in these scenes from their characters genuine feelings of an entitlement snatched away from them by a clearly undeserving cretin and the actors play it for all the high comedy they can. But the main bromance is tested when the sexy, charming, persuasive entrepreneur Sean Parker (played to paranoid perfection by Justin Timberlake) comes in well over an hour into the film and starts finding ways to turn Facebook into a mega-money making operation all the while charming the pants off Mark Zuckerberg; much to Eduardo's sad eyed jealousy. At this moment, The Social Network could become an ancient Greek drama in more ways than one. But it doesn't. Instead, we just get more back and forth cutting between depositions and lawyer meetings, which are interesting and could have provided clues into the characters, but don't. These scenes were the biggest missed opportunities in the film. Another squandered moment, why can't we see the scene where Zuckerberg goes into an investment banker's office in his bathrobe and slippers to deliver a Sean Parker bird-flip? Will Zuckerberg realize that making good on revenge for others is totally unsatisfying? And why was the tough talking Parker too big a wuss not to do it himself? If the scene isn't going to advance the plot or inform about the characters, why have it?Witnessing Parkers pathetic attempt at a put down of Andrew Garfield by offering him a check for $19,000 and then totally being made a fool of showed exactly what kind of man Saverin was and what kind of useless blow-hard Parker was. As a secondary theme, the idea that money can ruin almost anything good like friendship, loyalty or love, even here, The Social Network does not convince. It seems that it was the fact that Facebook made tons of money that this story even has an ending that did not end in suicide or death. If Sorkin or Fincher sees anything ironic or even noteworthy in this, they sure don't indicate it in the film. Remember, people would even have excused a horrible sociopathic bully like Alex DeLage in A Clockwork Orange if he had only made a billion dollars for someone. As it is right now, The Social Network feels way too long and there is no emotional payoff. I didn't feel a sense of relief or fun or even sadness when the end credit titles listed what happened to the various characters. The Social Network had glibness and a flow that only indicated a surface look at the deeper themes, but nothing else. Fincher generally likes to make fast moving films because he seems to fear depth. He probably disagrees with the saying that 'still waters run deep' and thinks that still waters are the ones that turn stagnant. Well David, that's true, but stagnant water can still be deep water, and shallow water is never anything else.",5,192,363,2 October 2010
Cinderella Man," So Full Of Cliché's And Fake Sentiment, It Could Win Best Picture
","From the very beginning of this lousy film with the quote by Damon Runyon stating that the story of Braddock is the best in boxing (oh, if I disagree and think maybe Ali's story is more important, I'm a dope?) to the ham fisted inelegant rendering of the final boxing match between Baer and Braddock, Cinderella Man is cheap sentimental hooey that is most definitely Ron Howards worst film and from the guy who made Far & Away and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, that's really saying something!The politics are specious and why does everyone else have to be a total villain in order to make Russell Crowe look like a nice guy? Is Crowe that much of an ogre? He's not when you look at his other work like Proof and The Sum Of Us. No, it's just a stupid manipulation on the part of low talents like Howard and Akiva Goldsman.From the PAST DUE notice on the milk bottle (oh, didn't they realize that if they didn't pay their milk bill they would stop delivering?) to the sick child, one cliché just trumps another.Did Braddock really return his relief money? Did he do it in such an ostentatious, look at me way? I hated this film. Truly hated it.",1,22,52,7 June 2005
