The Equalizer," Watchable!
","Another proof that there is no messing with americans, if you mess with them you will get yourself killed. All they need is a cork puller, a nail gun and a book and you're in trouble. First half of the movie was awesome and so promising, the rest is just crap.",3,4,6,22 February 2018
Dunkirk," Crap
","There is no other word, crap. That's it. To review Dunkirk i need only 3 sentences. Slow motion of slow motion. I was about to cut this crap few times. Bad. P.S. IMDb forces me to write 5 lines of text, but there is nothing more to write, really, at least not for me. I said everything what i had to say.",3,1,3,9 December 2017
Logan," Excellent movie.
","This is the best film about X-Men. Good story, lots of action, tense to the very end. After so many years of shooting and after so many movies, this movie is definitely what I've been waiting for all this time. This is the first movie in which we see Logan really using his weapon, every movie with Logan should have been shot like this, but instead we had to watch movies in which he is scratching his enemies like a cat. It is sad that I had to wait so long to see the real X- Men. Because of this and because they killed two people who definitely did not have to kill I would give a lower rating, otherwise they would be 10 regardless of some ambiguities in the movie. I hope they will continue to record X-Men, although I do not know if it will be as before. As the next sequel will be a new acting team, I think movies will not be as before, but it is still waiting for us to see. They need to make use of Hugh Jackman while he is still alive to record another quality continuation. Definitely the best sequel of X-Men. I recommend watching the movie.",9,3,7,25 November 2017
