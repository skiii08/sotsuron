Black Swan," Predictable
","There isn't a lot to be said about the story itself. Natalie Portman suffers a mental breakdown due to the pressure of her role in the ballet. That is about all there is to it really.There is a one dimensional mother that has come straight from a cartoon (think Cruella de Ville watered down), a pretty best friend who portrays the 'dark side' and of course the boss who starts out as an interesting bad guy but quickly becomes as mundane as the rest of the characters.Picture a 10 minute short cartoon made by an art student and then prolonged for 90 minutes and you just about have it. Everything about it was simplistic and predictable in the extreme.Ms Portman did well to learn ballet for the role but would have better deserved an Oscar for 'closer'. The music score was pleasant and it was reasonably well filmed but otherwise I'd strongly recommend avoiding this movie.",1,18,31,27 May 2011
The Duchess," Period Drama at it's best
","If you want an engine then go to Germany, if you want a fine wine then go to France but if you want a period drama of sublime beauty that will stay with you forever then go to England.Not since Bride's Head Revisited have I seen a film deliver so flawlessly on every level. Every scene, every movement, every nuance of emotion is painted with the brush stroke of a master. A beautiful, bittersweet tale told magnificently.I never tire of Ralph Fiennes and here he is at his best. I always rated Keira Knightley as many others may; namely an averagely good actress that is very pleasing on the eye, but on this occasion she excelled herself. Dim the lights, turn off the phone and if you are not impressed by the end of the movie then ask the Devil for your soul back.",Null,0,0,4 July 2009
Twilight," Could have been so much more
","I was left frustrated by this movie as it had all the ingredients to be something special but failed to deliver it's potential.To be brutally honest, I think the missing ingredient was someone the likes of Joss Whedon who knows how to script teenage dialogue. As it was, some of the scenes, especially between the two lead actors were quite painful to watch.It has many redeeming qualities that bring the film into the category of something worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon but I can't help but feel that it could have been so much more with the right person to bring everything together.",6,0,2,23 June 2009
