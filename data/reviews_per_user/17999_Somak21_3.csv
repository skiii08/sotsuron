The Avengers," 'We're not a team. We're a time-bomb!'
","The Avengers gathered huge expectations since it was officially announced in 2010. When separately the marvel comic characters can rock in the movies, then what massive consequences can happen when they are assembled altogether. From Tony Stark to Clint Barton, The Avengers group is subversive and totally heroic in their move. A Lot of money ($220,000,000) is involved here as there are spectacular special effects and eye-popping destructive acts. Till now, there is a huge chaos created allover revolving the release of the movie, even in India. A huge profit is estimated for the movie. Anyway, Let's see how this movie works.Nick Fury is the director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The Tesseract is an unknown source of huge sustainable energy that can come to much need of planet earth. But when Loki (Thor's Brother) steals The Tesseract and tries to demolish the earth as directed from Asgard, Nick Fury assembles The Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye to eliminate the extra-terrestrial attack on earth and save humanity. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury does a perfect job. Even not being a superhero, his special role as a colonel in every marvel hero movie is commendable. Tony Stark aka Iron Man is said to be the salient character of Avengers even Captain America is the first one of them. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is remarkable, humorous, smart, sleek and heroic and most of all perfect from every nook and corner. Without Iron man's technological help and cleverness, The Avengers would have to face much problem.Steve Rogers aka Captain America, the first Avenger does here a nice work indeed. To him, saving America's glory and assets is everything and so he does. Chris Evans as Captain America was a Joy to watch and he was the only hero that can stand beside Iron Man shoulder-to-shoulder.Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Hulk, is the strongest and mightiest and toughest pillar of the Avengers. Even Edward Norton was the leading hero of 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk here also gives much justice and creates a great atmosphere of strength and destruction.Chris Hemsworth as Thor (Which we have seen previously in the movie named on him) was indescribable. He is said to be the God Of Thunder from Asgard and here with his mighty hammer, he yet again creates a great appearance and makes a strong impact in defeating enemies. Nothing is greater than Myst and Gods, in that case. Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson was effective as the only female superhero character in the midst of powerful masculine superheroes.Clint Barton aka Hawkeye was fine and he seemed to be the weakest among the Avengers but still he was effective in his negative pre-climax and heroic role in the climax.Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's brother seeks revenge on his brother and tries to rule the world as the only God. So, the character with so much vengeance and thirst and also battling the Avengers all alone had to be very important for the movie and so it was. Among all others, the most important one was Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and he did a splendid even 'The Avengers' movie puts an end to his character forever. Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Gwyneth Paltrow & more - everyone carried out their roles splendidly.It was very lucky for me to watch the movie in 3D as the remarkable special effects by Chad Ball, Roland Blancaflor, David Boucher & more and Visual effects by Visual Effects by Shaun Friedberg 'Pyrokinesis', David Abbott, Nada Abdou & more was the most important substance of the movie. Massive Destruction, Aliens, Super natural powers - everything was excellently perfect. Can't be better than this. Also, I would specially recall the use of humor in the movie that made people laugh at times. Also, the dialogues of the movie are excellent. Some awesome ones like - Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack! Tony Stark: I have a plan : attack! & Thor: He's my brother Natasha Romanoff: He killed 80 people in 2 days Thor: He's adopted.Even, this is the second directorial of the director Joss Whedon, he does a commendable job and I doubt if anyone could have done it better. Joss pens down the story with Zak Penn with the help of the writing by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby (The original comic book writers) and gives birth to a very efficient story that perfectly got along with the movie. Finally, when I saw in the final scene where Tony Stark & Pepper Potts were redesigning devastated Stark Tower and only the 'A' stood among the five letters, I was fully assured that the movie did not intend to glorify any one Marvel Hero but glorified their team work as AVENGERS. And if as the end of the movie hinted is true then get ready for THE AVENGERS 2 because Nick Fury said 'We Need Them And They Know That Very Well'.'The Avengers' is one helluva ride of destruction, fighting evil & heroism. Kids will love it and so will the elders. Make some time, take your family, put on your 3D glasses, pop some corns in your mouth and have a epidemical time. If you miss this one, consider it as a huge loss.",9,4,9,28 April 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," 'Impossible' to Miss
","At first, let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise, so if anyone thinks that I've overrated then guilty as charged. If I come to expectations then it will be a total loss of words cause since the news has spread that MISSION IMPOSSIBLE will have it's 4th part, the whole world waited for its teaser or trailer and when it released the movie was hugely expected by many corners of world. If any of my review readers have watched M: I 4, then they have surely realized that this one's the best Action Thriller of recent times. Mission Impossible Legacy has gone through many experts. Brian De Palma started this high-tech thriller series. John Woo modified the 1st part and instead of using much technology, he concentrated on the thrill part & story. Mission: Impossible III is called as the best of the trilogy as it was triple intense, triple advanced and triple mayhem. Now, come to Mission : Impossible 4 - Ghost Protocol. The term 'Ghost Protocol' is used brilliantly and 'why' will be answered the moment you watch the movie. It's a challenge that this one's so intense that the viewer's mind can't be distracted while watching the movie. And as the story unfolds, we see new situations, new thrills and action sequences. The sequences are so awesome this time that one can't forget them. Some are - 1. The collision of KREMLIN, Russia 2. Ethan's sky-scraping scene 3. The chase in sandstorm 4. The ClimaxThe story in short is The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin and suspects reveal that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Jane ( Paula Patton) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are behind this. To save their organization's name Ethan, Jane, Benji and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) setup on a mission to find the mastermind behind this who is Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). No Plan. No Backup. No Choice.Brad Bird is one of the finest directors of this time but his experiments were only animated (Though hugely successful). THE IRON GIANT, RATATOUILLE & THE INCREDIBLES - three of them are hugely appreciated all over. His debut as a real-life movie that also the saga of Mission Impossible was immensely tough for anyone. But we can see that he is outstandingly talented as a director and he can handle any kind of movie and very well he does. This Oscar-winner animator has given us the best of him this time. Michael Giacchino, The Oscar-winner yet again gives some nice scores with a great use of M:I theme. Robert Elswit, another Oscar-winner in the crew, the cinematographer was excellent in shooting Russia, Dubai & India and every scene was fantastically shot. His work should be listed as one of the best contributions to the movie. Special Effects by Hamish Bennett, James Bomalick etc. are awesome, just awesome.Tom Cruise is a blockbuster powerhouse himself. His smartness, his acting, his heroism, his intelligence and ability to do deadly stunts ---- from 'A' to 'Z', it's a Tom Cruise flick. At the last scene when we see Ethan's wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) staring at him & Ethan also doing the same, the moment should be called the most beautiful moment in M:I history. From Action to expression, Intelligence to charm - Tom Cruise proves that no one in Hollywood could have done ETHAN HUNT better than him. Paula Patton as Jane was very down to her role. She did awesome as a IMF agent irrespective of being a woman. Simon Pegg was the real entertainer. Special credits to Jeremy Renner as Brandt. A commendable job by him raised the beauty of the movie. Michael Nyqvist as Hendricks was seen sometimes but that was also a joy to watch. Anil Kapoor, the 'tharki' Indian was a funny fare. Josh Holloway in an extra short role of Agent Hanaway was fine.Finally, 'Mission Impossible 4 - Ghost protocol' to me is one of the many proofs of why I love Tom Cruise so much? Not only is he the most beautiful hunk but also he is gifted with every quality that a hero requires. Powerful performances by lead actors and eye-popping visual effects make M:I 4 a must watch this season. It can heat your blood this winter if you're a die hard action-movie fan. Most of all, it's a must must must watch for Tum Cruise fans.As a conclusion Mission: Impossible 4 - Ghost protocol is a super action flick with eye-popping special effects and a terrific storyline which the movie abides by start to end. There was not a single scope of a dull moment and viewers didn't have a single second to divert their minds elsewhere. One of my friends said that 'Bollywood is advancing its standard to Hollywood in technique used in movies and RA. One proves it'. He got a reply from me 'That's a very long way ahead, lad'(and M:I 4 proves it).",9,5,10,17 December 2011
The Social Network," Facebook V/s. Friendship
","'Facebook' - The ultimate social network which is a maniac all over the world has a history that is much more than just a story. David Fincher's take on this universal tale reveals the dark side of every human hidden in him that comes out to achieve success in life. 500 Million users and still counting... a huge number that doesn't come so easy and you can't even imagine so many characters when you decide to open your own social networking site. Here, we come to know that Facebook was not invented with the intention to make billions of dollars but as time flies, the mentality of 'being just popular' changes to 'being very rich'. That's the story of every human who gets involved in socialism or business of which a perfect example is the great betrayal hidden in the story of the invention of 'Facebook'. So, you don't care a f**k if you are pronounced guilty for that.Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg), the student of Harvard University is a complete gizmo geek himself for whom programming is as easy as peeing. After breaking up with his girlfriend Erica Albright(Rooney Mara), in frustration he blogged rude things about her but the most of all, when hatred against girls rise in him, he comes up with an idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female. He hacks into the databases of Harvardvarious residence halls, downloads pictures and names of female students and, using an algorithm for ranking chess players supplied by his best friend Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield), he creates in a few hours a website called 'FaceMash.com', where students can rate girls by their hotness. Mark was punished for six months because of 'Facemash''s humongous traffic that brought down the network of Harvard. But however, the fame of 'Facemash' drew attention of Cameron Winklevoss(Armie Hammer), Tyler Winklevoss(Josh Pence) & Divya Narendar(Max Minghella) that results Mark to be the programmer of the website owned by Winklevoss twins & their business partner, Divya.Soon afterwards, Mark comes up with an Idea to make and exclusive social networking site, 'Thefacebook.com' an approaches his friend Eduardo for economical help. Eduardo invests a thousand dollars on 'Thefacebook' to start it. Soon, Winklevoss twins hears of this and believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea to open 'Thefacebook'. Soon, 'Thefacebook' raises it's members and Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster joins the gang when 'Facebook('The' word was removed then) crew shifted them to California. But this vexed Eduardo. Soon, situations were solo handled by Sean himself and which resulted to conflict between Mark, the creator and programmer of 'Facebook' and Eduardo, The CFO of 'Facebook'. Dancing like a puppet of Sean, Mark cheated his most best and loyal friend Eduardo and later that night, Parker, along with a number of Facebook interns, was arrested for possession of cocaine during a party thrown on the occasion of Facebook's 1 millionth member. All of this resulted to a massacre when The Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya along with Eduardo sued Mark for cheating(with Eduardo) and stealing Idea(of The Winklevoss twins).Credits mostly go to a indomitable screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Even the film is based on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' written by Ben Mezrich, Aaron puts up a beautifully composed and well-equipped script where smart & fresh dialogues are the icing on the cake. Music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross also are commendable because situationally, the songs were a perfect choice(especially, 'Baby, you're a Rich Man' at the end of the movie was a tremendous song). Cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth was also stylish especially when he had caught the The Winklevoss twins rowing in the lake or The beautiful sights of Harvard.Jeesie Eisenberg, the well known face from Zombieland(2009) was promising in the role of Mark and his smartness and attitudes in the character were proprietor of applause. It can be said, he stole the eyeballs alone. Rooney Mara was very short but inspite of being short, those moments had only 'Roonie' written on them. Andrew Garfiled was tremendous at a word for his vibrant & undramatic performance. Justin Timberlake who was 'Sean' and the only negative figure in the plot was witty and sufficient and it could be easily said that even his role was not so important, he didn't made us feel that. Others like Armie Hamme(Cameron Winklevoss), Josh Pence(Tyler Winklevoss), Max Minghella(Divya Narendra) were good but not commendable.Sensitive & sober direction by David Fincher was another constituent that needs to be mentioned mostly. Adding life to a non-fictional story behind the invention of 'Facebook' wouldn't have been such a simple job but with a super casting and severely talented crew, he made that possible. Giving super films like Fight Club(1999) & Oscar winner The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button(2008), he has relived the magic of controversial movies by 'The Social Network' which surely needs excessive achievements.Don't miss this 'Facebook' film at any cost not because it's related with the effects of 'Social Networking' in our social life but because it also inspires the fact where Money changes 'Loyalty' to 'Greed' and later 'Betrayal'. One of the greatest betrayals of all time, stands somewhere in the land of Harvard. Watch 'The Social Network' to experience the changes in a human after fame binds him and try to find a heart behind the screen. This one's one of the greatest deliverances ever. Don't miss it.",8,1,2,14 November 2010
