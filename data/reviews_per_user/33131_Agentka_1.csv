The Rock," The most intelligent action movie I've ever seen.
","When I first time have read about this movie, I thought that it's smashing. But I was wrong. It's the best action movie ever made, and it's got the most intelligent plot.Look at Stanley Goodspeed, simply man, who is called into lethal action. He's worried about his fiancee, Carla and their unborn child. He's scared, he cries and he is NORMAL human, not rambo.Then look at John Patrick Mason, who is bitterness and determinated. He's born kille, he want to get out of island, but all the time, he thinks about his doughter, Jade Angelou, which he saw only one time and who is 'the only evidence that I exist'.And at last, look at my favourite charakter, general Hummel (Ed, I love you!). He isn't bad charakter, he's former war hero, who's soldiers was betrayed by their own government. He lost his wife and best friends, who were forgotten. I think, he was real patriot.Another characters like, mj. Baxter, Womack and com. Anderson are also magnificent.That movie is just awesome..",Null,2,3,16 January 2003
