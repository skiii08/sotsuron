Deepwater Horizon," Very good film
","OK I hate the reviews everyone gives for this film. What did y'all expect when you decided to buy a movie ticket to go watch this movie. If you thought this movie was all about the economical side of it all then your stupid enough to realize that it wasn't. From the moment I saw the trailer I knew that Peter Berg was geared tired more of the life of the riggers and what happened on board of the rig and I knew he was gonna portray that. Did it seem like a typical Michael Bay movie, yes. I knew a fire broke out and all but what Peter Berg did was add all this big explosions and fire shooting at them and the camera shaky effect kinda made it a little bit non realistic in a way but still I bet that did happen on that rig and how the big fire erupted and caused a lot of destruction, we know that happened. The plot could've been better and well written I can give you that but acting wise I think everyone did a great job and Peter Berg put up an amazing cast for this film. It gets deep and emotional and it will cut right into you if you pay close attention. This film had my heart racing. Every second watching it and seeing how Mark would maneuver past those fires and how everyone was trying to stop the flood of oil and all these fires erupting from different places had me at the edge of my seat. What Peter Berg wanted for us to see and feel is there pain on that rig and what happened on that day on April 20th, 2010. He wanted us to feel there pain and have us at the edge of our seats just waiting to what will happen nextAll I gotta say is if there were more options for rating this film I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10 but since there is none I'll settle with a 9. I definitely recommend this to anyone",9,0,0,25 April 2017
Black Mass," Good but not good enough
","I'll have to admit it was a little slow but I do have to say it was pretty good. I thought Jonny depp did a tremendous job and so did joul egderton. I thought all of the acting was great but there were time where I thought that there were to many F words, but what did you expect there gangsters who don't what they say, how they say it l, and who they say it to because they don't care. It wasn't as brutal as I thought it was but still bloody. All the reviews I've read about this film were just horrible and I don't get it. It wasn't that bad of a film I mean it's a gangster movie most of them are slow. I came into the theater knowing that it might be slow. Look all I can say is is that this is a good film and it talks about a cruel violent man who didn't care about other people other then the people he associates with.",8,0,1,29 October 2015
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Wow just wow
","Look it takes a lot to make a man cry because we are not like women. Women can cry for no reason but men not so much. When I watched this movie I about balled my eyes out because it made me remember about the crulity of other people. It hurts me to see how people could be just underly cruel.This movie is by far an Oscar winning film. It is just emotional and touching the whole way through. I didn't see anything wrong with the movie I thought the acting was just fantastic and the layout of the movie was perfect. Wouldn't change a single thing about it. But I do recommend that kids under the age of like 12 should not watch this film without a parent because it would be to sad and cruel because at the end people are seen leading into a gas chamber with the two little kids. We know that they were all gonna die. Not trying to give out any spoilers but I'm just letting the parent know that this could be a hard film, even as an adult, to watch it but other then that great film.",9,0,0,2 January 2016
