Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WOW!!!
","Fantastic Special Effects.  Wish my computer could be as detailed.  The only thing I really did not like about this film was the grammar and syntax used by Jaa Jaa Binks.It seemed that at least 75 percent of the film was computer generated, the rest blue screened.  Live actors did not account for too much screen time.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
