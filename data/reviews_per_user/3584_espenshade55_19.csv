Requiem for a Dream," An important film
","This film is strange, dark, and disturbing. And it is one of my favorite movies.This movie has no redeeming qualities but that is because there is nothing redeeming about drug abuse. This truly is the ultimate anti drug film.It also boastes incredible performances form Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Conelley, and believe it or not Marlone Wayans.By no means is this movie for anyone that is younger than their teen years. But every teenager should see this film, along with every adult, after seeing this no one in their right mind would even be tempted by drugs. The cinamatografy is unique and entertaining, the story is compelling and powerful, and the acting is superb. Easily 9/10",9,0,1,25 September 2004
Friday Night Lights," The Best Sports movie ever made
","This movie was phenomenal in every way. It had incredible performances under a great director with a fantastic story to back it up.It tells the story of a high school football team in Texas through the course of their 1988 season. Billy Bob Thorton played the coach of the team and give the best performance I've ever seen him give. The film was directed by Peter Berg who gave it a unique film style. He managed to tell this story in a very beautiful way.Tim McGraw gives a great debut performance of an ex-high school football player who has become the drunken abusive father of one of the players currently on the team. He was almost unrecodnizable in this role and he portrayed it well. He, and the rest of the cast for that matter deserve a lot of credit.This is the only football film I have ever seen that has done justice to what it feels like to play football in high school. I played under Friday night lights myself, that time of my life ended just a year ago and it still holds fresh in my memory. And because of that I can tell you how accurately this film portray's the sense of brotherhood and friendship that is felt by every team, at least every good football team.Whether you ever played under Friday night lights yourself or not anyone should be able to appreciate this film.",8,76,112,10 October 2004
Hotel Rwanda," One of the best
","Don Chedal Is a great actor and he has done some phenomenal movies but none of them compare to this film about a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered more than twelve hundred people during the massacres that happened in 1994.I'll admit that I knew nothing about this event in history other than the fact that it happened. This film was an eye opener, a powerful look at one of the most devastating events in the history of the world. A dark part of the history of the world made worse by the apathy of the rest of the world. And how those who were being needlessly slaughtered where protected only by there own determination to survive and by the help of a few great men who risked everything to fight an impossible battle.This is a film that should be not only experienced but remembered, it is something that could change you and how you view the world. This is a film that sends a message to all of us. We cannot simply ignore these atrocities, we cannot put our political and diplomatic agendas above the lives of innocent men women and children. It sends the message that there are things that are worth fighting for and that there are some things worth dying for. It is a message that still has significance today.",9,0,0,11 January 2005
Crash," Absoulte Masterpiece
","Paul Haggis seems to have just popped up all of the sudden, first with 'Million Dollar Baby' and now with 'Crash' which goes way beyond entertainment and offers some of the most interesting, compelling and realistic character's ever created.The story follows several different people in LA, all with different job, different social status, different dreams, different beliefs. Yet haggis was able to fine commonality in diversity and masterfully allowed these character's lives to collied in the course of only a couple of days.The character development in this film is better than pretty much any film I've ever seen. Most films try to create an allegory, or if not that they simply conform to formulaic design. They create character's that can do no wrong or can do no good. In this film all of the character's are shown as having a capacity for both, just as humanity has its flaws and virtues in reality as do the fictional character's created by Haggis. There are times when the man that is made to look like the good guy does something completely unforgivable and the schmuck does something completely selfless and noble. Speaking from experience, it is very hard to create this kind depth in any fictional being, its even harder to do it when you have that many principal character's.The dialog was very interesting and smart. I can imagine it would be very difficult to create the variation that was included in this film. He used several different vernacular's for the different character's based on there social status, level of education, occupation, etc. It is so realistic that it allows you to be drawn in from the very beginning and held to the end.I found the cinematography interesting. It isn't on the same level as John Mathison or Matthew Labique but it was still good to look at. It reminded me a little of the look of Steven Soderburg's 'Traffic' minus the variation of color tints. It was a sort of grainy image which gave the film an interesting effect, very dark and gritty. I felt it fit the subject matter perfectly.I was absolutely amazed to find out that this film was shot on only seven million dollars. What Haggis was able to do with the minuscule budget that definitely would have inhibited them in regards on-location shooting, scheduling and other things. This film is proof that the bigger budget doesn't mean the better film.This is definitely recommended. It is a beautiful film. Completely original and unique. This is truly one of a kind. Don't miss it.",7,2,9,2 June 2005
Cold Mountain," Don't waist your time and money
","This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen based in the civil war era.Now I don't have a problem with the fact the they had a British actor and an Australian actress in a movie about the American civil war filmed in Romania (At least not a big problem).This movie simply didn't work from beginning to end. It simply slouched along for two and a half hours bringing in a truck load of pointless cameos that simply seemed arbitrary and unfounded.It also boasts one of the most ridiculous mockery's of an academy award win in history which was for Renee Zelwiggers over the top and very Machanical and two dimensional portrayal of Ruby.Also, the writing simply did not fit the characters. They had these people with second grade educations attempting to speak eloquently with poetic tools likes metaphor's. I hate to use these old phrases but you could feel the paper the script was written on while they spoke.It also feature several needlessly explicit sex scene's, that again were just kind of there with no real message that they seem to want to send.This is a bad movie with a plot that was doomed from the beginning that leads to several pointless adventures(To use the term loosely)followed by a long drawn out resolution with a ridiculous and predictable ending.Take my advice, save yourself two and a half hours and do something a little more productive.",2,3,6,23 September 2004
The Alamo," What is Everybody's problem?
","Spoiler's if you don't know your historyThis was a good movie. It was strong historically, powerfully acted, well written and well directed.I've heard a lot of people complain about how the characters were portrayed and that it was undermining their sacrifice and making them look less heroic. This is the first time I've ever heard a long line of critic's criticize a movie for adding in some historical facts in order to make the character seem human.This film received the most ridiculous criticism I have ever heard and some of these were from professional critics. The worse of these came from my local news paper critic, because I'm nice I wont mention the paper or the guy's name, but he criticized the fact that they showed Jim Bowey dieing in sick bed when the Mexican army barged in rather than actively participating a great deal in the battle. Last time I checked Bowey was dieing of tuberculosis and they showed him buttoning up his shirt, taking out his guns and fighting the best he could to the bitter end. I don't know what these people expected to do, have him jump up off of his death bed and start kungfuing everyone?All of these men were portrayed in a realistic, powerful and skillfull way.Don't listen to the nut jobs who are dishing out this undo criticism. See it and see the true story of the Alamo and the great men who gave there lives to defened it.",7,5,6,29 October 2004
Collateral," Simply Amazing
","Micheal Mann is brilliant in more ways than one. And in this film he shows again his incredible ability to film at night.The city itself is almost a character on its own in this incredible film. Tom Cruise gave one of the best performances of his career as the payed assassin Vincent, and Jamie Foxx has prooven himself with his portrayal of Max.The writing was brilliant and gave you a good look at these unique characters. And Vincent, rather than being shown as a two dimensional soulless killer is instead shown as a man who thinks a lot about what he does. This film, although it has great action scene's still exhibits several interesting and thoughtful conversation between the two main character's. They talked about there thoughts about death and the worlds apathy towards it.Only Micheal Mann is capable of making a film like this one. It is a must see. I don't give ten star ratings very often but this is easily a ten.",10,0,1,27 September 2004
No Country for Old Men," It took some time to ponder
","Due to the lateness of this comment, and due to the fact the movie will likely soon be out of theater's and on the DVD shelves I fear this review will be seldom read. I saw the film opening day, then three more times during its run at the box office and only now do I feel apt to give it the praise it deserves.I would go so far to venture that this is a perfect film, this is the only time that I have said this, and might be the only time I ever will. This film is crafted beautifully in all aspects of the film-making process from the opening shots to the ending monologue. Some have said that this is the Coen's best film since 'Fargo', I would say 'Fargo' was training for this film. 'No Country' has a far more pessimistic view of the world, and is secular in more ways than one. The film resonates with a feeling of controlled chaos, in the end I feel it's because the film is ABOUT chaos.'No Country' boasts some of the most intense, gut wrenching scenes ever crafted and its built out of specificity. The simple creaking of floor boards, the sound of a light bulb being unscrewed, the movement of a crumpled candy wrapped unfolding all add to this world that the Coen's, with the help of Roger Deakins' flawless photography were able to build from top to bottom.The most prominent criticism I hear from my peers in film school, or from the general public comes from the confusing ending. I feel obligated to address this because I truly believe that the ending is what made this movie what it was. What ultimately made me fall in love with this film was the fearlessness in the story telling and the clarity of mind which allowed Joel and Ethan to see deeper into the world than the rest of us choose to, or want to see. In the end, the film is about chaos, the antagonist is fate, age, and finally circumstance. Thus I believe it to be a misinterpretation to say the ending came out of left field, or was simply erroneous to the plot, because I believe the real plot lies beneath the obvious one.It is a film about the way humanity deals and copes with an ever changing world that may eat us whole or simply leave us behind. Its a pondering with little commentary, its existentialism in its truest form. It questions without fear, and bravely leaves the audience to question.",10,0,2,27 January 2008
Batman Begins," The intelligence of independent cinema meets the high budget event film
","This is one of the few examples of a film where the and intelligence of an independent filmmaker gets to intertwine with a huge, big budget, Hollywood event film.Nolan (Memento) takes this 'Batman' film far beyond the previous series created by Tim Burton and then destroyed by Joel Schumacker. This film was a character study, a humanist exploration through the idea's of revenge, justice, and sin that show up in our culture. This is were the previous series dwindled, there was no connection between the bat and the man.Christian Bale gave a wonderful portrayal of the caped crusader in this film. I do think that he gave a better performance than anyone in the past. The thing is he also had a more complex character to portray than the other's. All of the other films showed you that character after he already became 'Batman'. This film required Bale the portray a massive character ark, from the man who believed in revenge to the one who believed in justice, from the man who thinks only inward, to the man who is completely selfless. This created a much more interesting feel to the franchise. With the previous film's, Batman was a bit of an allegory, he was a representation of an ideal rather than a man. This film showed how the man became the symbol and thus it shifted more to the analytical approach to humanism.Still, this is Batman. And that means that action is a must. And this film had plenty of it. I was sitting on the edge of my seat from the beginning. Moreover, they were done in a way that made it believable that one man could take out an army, especially because they were made so you barely ever saw him. For once it wasn't a film where you have hundreds of bad guys that aren't able to hit the broad side of a barn, they just never got a shot off.The cinematography in this film was leaps and bounds in front of the original series as well. The other films never had the same kind of dramatic lighting or use of color filter's that this film had. The cinematography in this film was good enough to tell a story in and of itself, it gave new meaning and a new feel to the scene's.The cast was strong all around. As mentioned above Christain Bale took the title character to bold new levels. Gary Oldman gave another great performance, even though it was a small part he brought something to it that other actor's wouldn't, he really deserves a lot more credit than he's received throughout his career.This is the best 'Batman' film yet. I can't wait to see it again and any of you that are 'Batman' fans will be able to appreciate this film.",8,0,0,15 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Too Much Focker Humor
","I liked Meet the Parents much more than meet the Fockers for a very simple reason, they didn't find one thing that seemed funny and then wear it out until it looses all meaning. That was my problem with meet the Fockers, there was too much 'My names Focker and my mom's a sex therapist, hardy har har.' I do think that this film was entertaining. Maybe something that I would have been better off waiting for it to come out on video to see. I still think the little child was the best part of that movie, heck in this case he might have been the best actor in the film considering the fact that everybody went so over the top in there performances.There were several good scene's though and I think the good elements of this movie slightly out weight the not so good.I think that it is worth seeing but it certainly didn't live up to the standards of the original.",5,0,1,13 January 2005
The Insider," One of Michael Mann's Most powerful films
","Michael Mann is on of the most talented director's in the industry and one of the most consistent in the quality of his films.This film is an in depth portrayal of the life of Jeffery Wigand (Russel Crow) who is trying to expose the secrets of a large cigarette company and how he risked everything to make sure that the people knew the truth.Al Pacino, Russel Crow, Christopher Plummer, and the rest of the credited cast all did superb jobs at portraying there character's and maintaining the attention of the audience through a film that is nearly three hours of only talk.Michael Mann again used powerful cinematic devices and dramatic lighting to give the film a unique look and feel. Mann is one of the most brilliant film maker's there are and it shined through in this film.The screen writing was superb, it had a subtle brilliance that allowed me to just get sucked into the film and make me forget that I'm just watching actors.This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It deserves its place on the IMDb top 250 list, if anything it should be higher up.",9,1,2,9 December 2004
National Treasure," Here come the Buffalo
","In the John Sayles book 'Thinking in Pictures, the Making of Matewan' he has a segment when he's talking about the executives at the studios being afraid of long periods of no dialog, he then uses an example. 'The Indians are waiting in an open plane, cut to a close up of the Indians brandishing there spears and lances, cut to the buffalo thundering towards them, cut back to the Indians. 'At this point somebody will inevitably say can't one of the indians say here come the buffalo? 'Good observation yellow deer your really on you toes today.'That was my main problem with this film, there were too many 'here come the buffalo's' people just saying obvious thing after obvious thing. It was filled up with dialouge that you didn't need, I don't know maybe they feel that they need to spoon feed us everything so that we'll understand stuff that is right in front of us.This film did have it entertaining elements although there were too many moments that we have seen in every other movie in the genre. And I still find it baffling that they could figure out all these clues that were supposed to have eluded people for hundreds of years by guessing and taking stabs in the dark.Also, the whole idea that our founding father's had all of that treasure during the coarse of the revolutionary war and decided to hide it rather then try to use some of it to pay for the war and then hiding it.And, of course two scientists and a woman that works for the national archives all of the sudden turn into stunt men when they need to.Overall, not one of Jerry Brukheimer's better investment's. Maybe take your kids to see it because it's only rated PG but if your over the age of ten it will just seem too low brow.",5,0,0,9 December 2004
The Great Raid," One of the best films of the Year
","John Dahl has done his share of good films over the years but none of them came close to this film about American POW's being held in Japan and the soldier's that risked everything to get them out.Knowing the history of what these men went through, you go into the film expecting to see images that will be hard to watch. You do see these but they don't go over the top, they show you the hardships that these men faced and the intensity of the battle sequences put you right in the middle of everything.The cinematography is worth mentioning. It was interesting how they kept the image slightly over exposed in the background to focus you in more and more on the actor's. It made this film about the people and not the spectacle, which is obviously how this film was intended.The performances were good all around. Franco and Brat are both talented performers that fit well into there perspective parts. The stand out in this film for me was Joseph Fiennes as a POW who kept command of his troops and did his best to help them through while he fought his own battle with malaria. His physical performance was superb and he made you feel what his character was feeling.When I was waiting to get into this film, I talked to an elderly man who showed up a little after me. I learned that he was a POW in Germany for a year in WW2. After the film, all they had to say was how powerful it was, and what an affect it had. The film showed these men as just that, men. Great men that were willing to sacrifice everything for there fellow soldier's, for there brother's in arm's. As they said in the trailer, 'there is a price for freedom, a price that some are willing to pay.' All of these men were willing to pay that price.",9,25,48,6 August 2005
Mystic River," A Triumph
","This movie didn't get nearly enough attention at the Oscars. They got two awards for acting but they got bilked out of the best supporting actress award, and the best picture award if you ask me.This movie was beautifully filmed and the performances were top notch. At time's I felt that Sean Penn had a little too much yelling and not quite enough actual acting but he definitely did deserve that Oscar. Tim Robbins gave one of his best performances ever in this film, you feel hunted just by watching this guy, it was an amazing performance that draws you in and won't let you go, you really believe him as this character and, like Sean Penn he deserved his Oscar. Kevin Bacon also gave a strong performance, and both Laura Linny and Marcia Gay Harden deserved the academy award far more than Renee Zelwigger did for Cold Mountain.Clint Eastwood's direction was superb, everything in this movie was done so powerfully and yet so subtley that you feel like you are watching real life.Clint Eastwood has a very unique approach to dealing with his actors, giving them more room to go with what they want to do then just what he want's. I still find it fascinating that two of the best director's of our time, Clint Eastwood and Micheal Mann can be the exact antithisis of each other in the way they run their sets and work with the people who are working for them.I rarely devote a paragraph to a musical score but this time I think it is warranted. It was also composed by Clint Eastwood. It amazed me how incredibly well it fit the feel of the film, a little dark and gloomy, very subtle. It doesn't give you and uplifting bravora style of a musical score but something that is simply made to exentuat the ambiance of the film. Its rare to see a director compose the score to his film but this was just as good as any of the greats like Hans Zimmer, James Horner, or John Williams could have done.It is easy to loose yourself in this film, it is easy to forget that you are in the theater, or now, sitting on the couch watching it. The writing, the acting, the set all seemed so real to me. The 8.1 stars that this film has posted isn't a fluke, it is truly deserving of a high user rating, in fact I wish it was higher. This isn't just one of the best films of the year, this is one of the best films ever made. I would recommend this movie to anyone, anytime, anyplace. If you can't see the brilliance of this film you need to get your eyes checked.",9,0,0,10 November 2004
Hitch," Kevin James is the Redeeming Factor
","Yes this does contain spoilers if you are completely dense about the Hollywood formula for romantic comedy's. Man meets girl, man likes girl, man and girl are too different to get together, man and girl get together anyway, one of them does something to screw it up and they break up for 15 minutes, man and girl get back together and live happily ever after. How incredibly shocking. (Sarcasum in case you didn't catch that.This film did have some entertaining moments. Unfoutunatley they all focused around the character played by Kevin James. The character in and of its self is nothing out of the ordinary. Another product of formulaic Hollywood cinema. Lets face it, every film needs a socially dense fat guy to stumble around like an idiot. Foutunatley James was able to bring something extra to the character despite the fact he wasn't given much to work with. Realistically, James himself accounted for about four out of the five stars I gave in the rating of the film.Eva Mendes did nothing for me in this film, well nothing good anyway. As the rest of this film goes her character is again a very formulaic and very much not interesting character. The thing is she as an actress didn't bring anything interesting to the character either. All she managed to give was a flat, simple and boring performance. Still the worse thing that this character brought to the film was in the script. Remember at the top when I mentioned that one of the people in the couple inevitably screws up. Well Eva Mendes screwed up the relationship with Hitch big time. Most of the time this part of the formula works because the thing that they did was usually by accident, not out of spite, and it doesn't permanently harm anyone. What Eva Mendes' character did in this film had me rooting against the inevitable reconciliation at the end. This woman is a journalist, who on very slim evidence released a story that could have and very easily would have destroyed the lives of three people. This was not a likable person and it made the intended happy ending a morbid one for me.I though the cinematography left something to be desired. The color composition wasn't great, the picture quality as a whole wasn't spectacular, and the images for a lot of the film simply didn't seem to be lit correctly. Still, nowadays it seems that studios don't think they need great cinematographers for certain genres, comedy is one of them.Really, I'm tired of these Hollywood comedy's that have been done to death. Don't get me wrong, I like comedy but it can't be something where you can actually feel your brain rot as you watch stupid people get into stupid situations that eventually leads to a stupid and tacked on solution. Please don't make me wait until the next Charlie Kaufman film before I see my next comedy. Still if thats what I have to do to avoid patronizing, dumbed down films like this than so be it.",5,1,2,29 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wow
","The Star Wars franchise has always proved to be visually stunning and Revenge of the Sith definitely keeps up this trend. However, this film has something the the previous two films did not have, an element of inner conflict, of pain, the Revenge of the Sith is a tragedy that at least starts to get back to the ways of the original trilogy.Over the years I have realized that George Lucas could not write dialog to save his life and this film is no exception, but lets face it none of us go to see Star Wars to hear David Mamet quality screen writing. And, even though there isn't much in the way of dialog it was still effective enough for the sake of story telling. That was the strength of this film was the complexity and power of the story which I actually think could be the best of all six films rivaled possibly by the Empire Strikes Back. In the last two films Lucas was too much on the side of cheap flashy entertainment with no real though, Sith gives us a study of humanity, temptation, desperation, devotion, and betrayal.There is very little that I can complain about in the way of cinematography. HD has proved itself time and time again, especially in Sith and the recently released Sin City. The only problems that ever came up is there is occasionally a slight blur of the image with slow pan shots that you don't get with film until the camera's really jerking around. Still, this was only every once in a while and I was probably the only person that would care. Still, there were several scene's that were incredibly well lit, particularly the scene in which Palpaten tells Aniken about the powers that the Dark Side can offer. There were some interesting dramatic lighting techniques used in this film that really made it interesting to look at.The acting was better in this film than it was in the previous two (thats not saying much). Of course they were inhibited a little by the weak dialog but they still did a good job with it. After seeing the last film I never thought that Hayden Christensen would have the talent to develop the Aniken character well enough to show his transition to the dark side, I'm pleased to say that I was wrong. I still wish they were able to hold onto Gary Oldman for the voice of General Grevous, I think he would have been able to bring something interesting to the character but what are you going to do. Portman has been giving several good performances recently and she managed to keep it going here but the stand out of the cast for me was McDirmand as Palpatine, he was very articulate and very convincing, it was truly a great performance.This is recommended strongly to any fan of the Star Wars franchise. This film might actually be one of the top three of all six of the films and it blew the previous two prequels out of the water. I saw the first showing possible at midnight this morning, I plan to see it several more times before it goes on DVD.",9,2,4,19 May 2005
Heat," One of Micheal Mann's best
","Micheal Mann is one of the best crime story director's who has ever lived and this is one of his best if not his best film.Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Seizmore, Wes Studi, Natalie Portman, Dian Venora, Jon Voight, etc. This movie boasts one of the best casts ever assembled and it is the first time that Pacino and De Niro, two icons of the film industry had met in a film since Godfather Two and Heat has the first scene that ever featured the two actors together. I'm not going to go into detail because I don't want to spoil it but Pacino and De Niro's scene is so incredible and yet so subtle it has quickly become one of my favorite scene's in any movie.This film not only tells the exciting cat and mouse crime story, but it also becomes a character study that bores into the lives of the Cop (Pacino) and the career criminal (De Niro) in an incredible depiction of the lives that these men chose and vow to see through to the last regardless of the burden that they must pay.It has several well done action sequences that are enough to keep anyone at the edge of their seat but again this movie is about the people, their family's, and others that they love and hurt in order to fulfill their duty.If you ever have three hours of free time make sure you see this film it will not disappoint you.",10,1,2,22 September 2004
Sin City," A great modern take on Film Noir
","This is the kind of film that lets you know right from the beginning that you are in for the ride of your life. From beginning to end the story's that they tell are powerful, involving, and yes, extremely violent.One thing that I found intriguing was the structure of the story. It was reminiscent of Pulp fiction in this manner. You get introduced to one character and you see his story unfold, then the next, then the next. But what is really great is how they brought other character's into the other persons story. During Micky Rourks bit you get a glimpse of Clive Owen and then after Mickey Rourk is finished they tell you why Clive was there. In the end everything comes together in a very interesting way.As for cinematography, I have this to say. I'm a film student right now, the second I go pro I'm using HD and only HD because if that the kind of look you can get out of it there is no reason to spend the extra money on the 35 mm film camera's. For what they were trying to do with this film High Definition was the only way to go. They made ever element of Sin City, including the actors look smooth. And the composition of the shadows was absolutely amazing.The acting in and of itself would usually not impress anyone if it was not for the overall feel of the film. Really what you got were performances reminiscent of the 1930s noir films like 'Double Indemnity' or the 'Maltese Falcon'. Of coarse these are very different stories but they still bare some basic similarities that made performances like this motivated, and even more powerful than they would have been had the simply gone with what we consider now to be proper acting style.I am usually a big opponent of the use of voice over but it was used perfectly in this movie. It was needed and it was completely motivated. Of coarse, voice over is a common element in the noir genre and that still holds true for neo-noir films such as this. It opens a window to there innermost thoughts and allows us to see a full human even if we only get to follow his story for a little while. It also worked simply because of the phenomenal writing. It was witty, it was intelligent, it was funny, and it was at the same time serious. Really top notch writing.This is a film that you will never forget and I guarantee you I will see it a couple more times before it hits DVD. The bottom line is, to miss 'Sin City' while it is in theater's is to simply let cinematic history pass you by.",10,0,3,3 April 2005
Cinderella Man," This was a masterpiece
","There have been several great boxing movies made throughout the years, particularly Raging Bull and the more recent Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man is right up there with the best of them.Director Ron Howard has proved himself as being one of the best film directors of our time. he has a great understanding in the complex aesthetics of film making, different film stocks, and an uncanny ability to work with actors. Much of the film was stylized but not to the point that it subtracted from the effectiveness of the story, rather it enhanced it.The cinematography was very well done for the most part. Simply the choice of film stock gave scene's new meaning and an enhanced feel. The only problem was unnecessary camera movement. It is definitely justified during the actual boxing sequences but there were several scene's that were not very intense that still had the camera bouncing around all over the place. It served as a distraction more than a dramatic effect.The performances were really good. Russell Crow has again shown the extent of his talent in a nearly flawless portrayal of Braddok. I haven't been too thrilled with Renee Zelwigger recently, especially after her woefully over the top performance in Cold Mountain but Ron Howard was able to bring her down to a believable level. Paul Gamatti is still one of the best, yet most overlooked actors out there and he gave another Oscar caliber performance in this film.Still, the story in and of itself was great. In most cases when it comes boxing movies the main character's are complete schmucks and completely unlikable. Braddok was one boxer that was also a truly good person, a man fighting for his home and his family, simply for the ability to live. He was grateful for everything that he had and his story was definitely worth telling.I hope people don't look at this and say, 'just another boxer film'. because that isn't how I saw it. This was a true work of art about a man who's resolve, perseverance, and devotion allowed him to capture the imaginations of an entire nation. This was a truly great film.",9,1,2,30 May 2005
