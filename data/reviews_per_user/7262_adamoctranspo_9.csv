E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Let's be real
","If you were a kid in the eighties than I'm sure you love E.T. It's a visually impressive film and we'll directed but it truly speaks to one generation. As a 90's / 2000's kid, E.T. freaked me out. He resembled a burn victim and I did not enjoy the film. This is a kid's movie and kids nowadays and in the future won't relate to E.T. I've showed this film to some kids and they don't like him either. If the film doesn't speak to its target audience then it's not relevant anymore. It's still good but only works as nostalgia for an older generation. I'm sure my opinion won't be liked but it's valid.",5,0,12,6 May 2019
Us," Lots of hate, pretty petty opinions
",Us was awesome. The scale of this film was much larger than I expected and it was creepy as intended. I found the acting to be on-point and Lupita Nyong'o performance was captivating and impressive. It may not be a logical film and it doesn't answer all the large questions created by it's finale but lots of horror films get away with these issues. It's a trip and it was fun to take. Not your typical horror film.,8,1,3,21 July 2019
The Hateful Eight," A real treat and amazing script
","It's weird to see haters reviewing this with 1 star. I guess they wanted Transformers or something very American to hold their attention.First off, the characters are awesome and well written. The dialogue is punchy and fun. The story doesn't need to be overly complex but if you pay attention there are a ton of details to pick up on. Especially on a second viewing. There is violence but it's far from disgusting. It brings some exciting scenes to a one set film.I think this is one of Tarantino's best, similar to Reservoir Dogs. It's a longer film, so as long as you dedicate the 3 hours and aren't expecting a traditional film then give it a watch. Especially on a cold winter's day.",8,3,7,2 November 2018
Interstellar," Is there a better Sci-fi flick?
","Interstellar may be my favorite film. Certainly my favorite Sci-fi movie. It pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished on film. Christopher Nolan figured out how to tell a compelling story about characters we really care about. There is no wastee scene in this film, no pointless dialogue. The acting is amazing and Matthew McConaughey leads this film with a force. The soundtrack matches the intensity of the story. This is a must watch, full attention, no phone to distract you. It's rewarding though, the type of film that makes you think. I watch this once a year and I never get sick of it. These are the kind of blockbusters we need.",10,0,1,4 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Historical or Fiction
","I'm a fan of history, I love the authenticity that went into this film. The cars, the clothes, music, commercials, sets and language are all on point. I almost thought Rick Dalton was a real person. The slow build and character development was classic QT. Now the last third of the film really lost me. The movie piqued when Cliff Booth went to the ranch. That scene alone reminded me of the tension in Hateful Eight. But then we get into Kurt Russell quickly narrating the next six months and up to the very h plour the infamous Manson murders took place.Everything after that is pure fiction. That's where the film lost me. Either make the entire film fictional or historic, don't combine the two. It doesn't work, revising history is pointless. I wish QT went the other direction and ended the story the way it really ends. It's almost as if while filming Titanic, James Cameron decided the boat shouldn't sink at the end and everyone gets off ok. The violence was pointless, the dog attack scene was just vicious and Cliff Booth came off as a real woman killer by the end of the film. I give this movie 6/10 because I liked it up till about 60%. What a strange film.",6,2,2,24 November 2019
Schindler's List," The only war movie needed
","In 2019 this film is more relevant and needed than in 1993. Steven Spielberg puts on an amazing display of history that is often ignored or forgotten. When this film came out only 40% of Americans knew the history of the Holocaust. Spielberg chose a perfect period in time to create an everlasting story. The Pianist is impressive as well but Schindler's List manages to tell alot of overlapping stories. This gives us all a clearer view of what happened. Each character has a small story and you are invested in. Spielberg also manages to insert comedy to horrible situation. There are some weird scenes like when the gun won't fire multiple times, sparing a man's life. The cinematography and use of color is impressive. Since the film is in greyscale it feels historical, the violence is more digestible. When Spielberg brings in his one spot of color (the girl in red jacket), you can't help but realize the way it was filmed was all a choice. The color jumps at you and your eyes can't help but follow. The violence and gore is hard to watch at times, this film has endless senseless deaths and humiliations as well. The actors are amazing, Liam Neeson blew up after his performance as Oskar Schindler. His final speach shows true emotion and care. The ending of the film cements the reality of the story. All the actors join their real-life figures and place a stone at Oskar Schindler's grave. Schindler's List belongs on the AFI top 100. It may be Spielberg's best film.",10,0,4,4 May 2019
12 Strong," Watchable
",At this point I'm insanely burnt out by films about 911 or the war in the middle East. I'd prefer a film about Isis than another movie about the Taliban. I'd say this isn't as good as Lone Survivor. The action is pretty boring. The main feature is American soldiers riding horses and shooting guns. It's too bad they chose to make a generic scripted war buddy flick. The team is a bunch of pretty actors having a great time in Afghanistan.,5,1,1,16 December 2019
The Nice Guys," One of my favorites
","I could watch 'Nice Guys' about once a year and love it each time. It's a great comedy that can get pretty dark. Russell Crowd and Ryan Gosling are hilarious and well written characters. The actress who plays his daughter is very good at emoting as well and she is very believable in her role. There are some great twists, I don't want to ruin anything. If you like 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' then this is an amazing follow-up. The action is cool and fun, the dialogue is on point and the running length of the film is tight.",10,3,4,7 September 2018
Alien: Covenant," Bad decisions kill a good movie
","The first and last 30 mins of Alien: Covenant are awesome. There's great action, cool set pieces and decent characters.Once the team lands this film really falls apart. Some decisions are forgivable but others make no sense. The captain of the team is dumb and puts everything at risk just to ask questions.Prometheus was a mistake, a bad movie as well. It irks me that this sequel depends so much on the plotline of his first prequel. The stories are complex to their own detriment. Some of this film is so good, it sucks that we ended up with such a mixed bag.",5,1,3,28 October 2018
