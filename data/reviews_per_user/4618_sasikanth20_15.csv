Men in Black 3," Better than MIB II
","It's been a long time since I watched the Men In Black movies, but from what I remember, the first one was really entertaining while the second one was a bore. I believe the third installment of the series, 15 years after the first movie, falls somewhere in between the first and the second. Its entertaining on most occasions, but is also a bore at times.Overall, an average film. It could have been way better, but is not. However, thanks to some good acting, its watchable. Give it a shot at your leisure.Acting: 8/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 6/10 Technical Aspects: 8/10 Is it worth your time and money??: If you've liked the MIB series thus far or if gross alien stuff doesn't freak you out, then yes. You may watch it for Will Smith.For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)",7,1,4,28 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A typical Guy Ritchie film!!
","With rotten status on rottentomatoes.com (59%), I was not so eager to watch the movie. But finally decided to give it go for Guy Ritchie, and Hanz Zimmer's music. And I am so glad I did. Brilliantly shot, great acting, awesome direction and great music make this movie one of the best I've watched in 2011. With its twists and turns, Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows is a typical Guy Ritchie film (If it weren't for him, the film would have barely made it to the theaters). Plus points are direction, music and ya, Robert Downey, Jr., who comes up with a really good performance. I thought is was way better than the first installment, for it had a much simpler story-line. Only drawback for me was the length of the movie.I would definitely recommend you to go watch the movie.For a detailed review, please visit: sasikanth.blogspot.com/2011/12/movie-review-sherlock-holmes-game-of",8,0,1,31 December 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," A good watch!
","Though the script is a little more complicated than the first movie, J.J. Abrams did a decent job with it. The direction is pretty neat, and the screenplay is decent. Chris Pine does a very good as Kirk, while Zachary Quinto does a brilliant job as Spock. Benedict Cumberbatch is equally good as Khan. The rest of the cast did a good job. On technical front, the visuals are excellent. Most of the IMAX shots were graphic works, but good. The rendered 3D work was excellent, but shooting with 3D cameras would have made it even better. Nevertheless, I loved the effects. Music by Michael Giacchino is good, while cinematography by Daniel Mindel is perfect. Overall, a worthwhile film.Acting: 8/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 8/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10Verdict: 8/10For more reviews, please visit sasikanth.me :)",8,3,5,20 January 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," A decent film!!
","Tintin (Jamie Bell), a young journalist, happens to buy a model ship named Unicorn. Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) tries to buy the model from Tintin, but fails. The model is stolen from Tintin's possession, and he soon discovers that there's more than meets the eye. He goes on about an adventure trying to solve the puzzle, and meets Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis) through his journey. The rest of the story is about how they solve the mystery together, and discover the lost treasure of the Unicorn.Though everything seemed to have worked really well for the movie, I somehow wasn't totally satisfied when it ended. The spark you expect in an animation was missing. The story also seemed a little complicated. It is a adventure film with its share of fun moments. Overall, a pretty decent watch, but not a classic!!For rest of the review, please visit: http://sasikanth.blogspot.com",8,0,2,12 December 2011
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Tu bas bhaag!!
","After a disastrous Delhi-6 four years ago, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a winner at his hand. Direction is perfect, and similar to Rang De Basanti, Rakeysh uses a non-linear narrative to unfold the story beautifully written by Prasoon Joshi. However, though the film starts off great and the first half is perfect, the film loses steam in the second half and feels like a drag thanks to slow screenplay.Ignoring its flaws, the film is still excellent. Farhan comes up with an unforgettable performance. Go learn more about the flying Sikh now!!cting: 9.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7.5/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10Verdict: 8/10For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)",8,0,0,20 January 2014
Hugo," An epic masterpiece!!
","When was the last time you watched a film which made a difference to your life? When was the last time a movie made you question your purpose in this world?? Well, Hugo makes you do all that. Hugo is an epic masterpiece expertly crafted by one of the finest directors of our time. It might be a little too long, but the heart wrenching tale of the twelve-year-old hooks you to your seat and makes you a part his adventure. It's a film with a message, one which tells you that you have a purpose in this world, one which tells you never to stop chasing your dreams. I am inspired, and hope you will be too. Go watch it!!Acting: 9.5/10; Story-Screenplay-Direction: 9/10; Technical Aspects: 9.5/10; Is it worth your time and money??: Absolutely!! It's a must watch for every film buff!!For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)",10,2,5,8 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A decent film!
","The Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining film, but I liked the original, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man better. This one has better visuals and 3D effects, but the script was too weak for it to surpass my expectations.Overall, the film gives you the thrills, thanks to the visual effects, but a better story line could have made it a worth watch. The shady screenplay doesn't make things better either. Watch it without expectations, and without comparing it to the original Spider-Man.Acting: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 7/10 Technical Aspects: 8/10 Is it worth your time and money??: For the visuals and the 3D effects, yes!! Nothing so special otherwise.For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)",7,3,6,10 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Better than The Unexpected Journey!
","Now that you've started with the series watching the first one, you can't miss out on the middle pages of the book can you? But honestly, after watching the trailers, I thought the movie would be a huge disappointment, and I was not really excited about it. However, I ended up liking it better than The Unexpected Journey, for the second installment of the trilogy has more meat and substance, where the plot unravels slowly yet steadily, and everything seems to start to make sense finally. Peter Jackson does a commendable job with the direction, and an interesting screenplay gets you engrossed in the film.On the acting front, kudos to Ian McKellin for putting up such a consistent performance in the series. He's brilliant. I was starting to wonder what all and how much Gandalf had to survive through the books. Uff! The rest of the cast, but for the only female character were good. Though she looked beautiful, I though Evangeline Lilly looked odd and did not exactly fit into the role.On technical front, the editing is much better than its predecessor. Cinematography is brilliant, and the 3D effects are alright. The graphics looked a little artificial at times though, and the music too seemed too melodramatic and not as great as the LOR score.Acting: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 8.5/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10Verdict: 8.5/10For more reviews, please visit sasikanth.me :)",8,1,5,20 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Best of the lot!! Must watch on IMAX!!
","Its not a great film, period. But thanks to its adrenaline pumping  action sequences, a decent story, direction, and acting, it delivers to  its expectations. The awesome cinematography just helps the case. I  would have loved to hear better use of the MI theme though. It's a lil  boring in parts, but you're too engaged to notice these flaws. Its  without doubt the best film of the series so far.  Watch it for sure, and if you do, watch it on IMAX. I've never seen the  audience clap without any particular reason, but they did today for the  spectacular sequences shot using the IMAX camera. They left me  spellbound.",9,52,104,14 December 2011
Brave," It ain't a Pixar classic.. a worth watch nevertheless!!
","Brave is no Finding Nemo. Neither is it close to Ratatouille, Up, The Incredibles , or any of the other Pixar classics. It's very different from what Pixar generally make. But still, it's a beautiful movie; a movie with heart. One you will enjoy!!A better script/fairy tale could have made this another Pixar classic, but that is not to be. The direction is brilliant, and the emotions are perfect. Go watch it without any expectations, and I am sure you won't be disappointed.Acting: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 8.5/10 Technical Aspects: 9/10 Is it worth your time and money??: Absolutely. It ain't like any of the other Pixar films, but is a good movie nevertheless. Go watch it!!

The Artist," Brilliant film!!
","Jean Dujardin, man, take a bow, for you were out of this world!! (He now joins the list of my all time favorite actors)The moment you know that it's a black and white silent movie, you have this notion in your head, a notion you cannot describe. But having enjoyed the all time Indian silent classic Pushpak years ago, I kinda was motivated to watch this film (even before it won the Oscars). I am glad I did.The Artist is a movie which you can connect with. It's very predictable at times, but brilliant, moving yet humorous performances by Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and every other cast member, not to forget the dog, Uggy, make you fall in love with them. Every character is so well written that you can emotionally connect with them. The cinematography, though in black and white is absolutely mind-blowing, and the direction perfect. The background musical score adds so much life to the film. The screenplay was good, though, pardon my ignorance if that's how it's supposed to be in b&w classics, was kinda slow at times.Overall, a fabulous film, one of the best I've seen so far. If you wanna have a delightful experience, go watch The Artist, with pleasure!For a detailed review, please visit sasikanth.me :)",9,0,3,4 March 2012
Super 8," Brilliant movie!!
","I've seen quite a lot of movies, but I've never watched anything which literally made me jump of my seat for its sound effects. This film did that.Its one of the best movies I've watched in recent times. It was spooky, freaky and humorous, all at the same time. The actors fit the bill perfectly, and did an awesome job. I felt that the movie had a message infused into it. Plus points are the casting, brilliant screenplay, direction, and the sound effects. I cant think of any negatives. Its a film to be watched in a theater. I absolutely loved it, I hope you do too.For rest of my review, please visit http://sasikanth.blogspot.com/2011/10/movie-review-super-8.html",Null,1,2,16 October 2011
Titanic," 3D or not, go re-live this magnum opus all over again!
","Now how does one rate a classic like Titanic?? I was 11 years old when the movie first released and I still remember the first time I went to watch it. I barely had any knowledge about movies back then, but the sheer grandeur and brilliance of this movie made me watch it a billion times over and over!! (Twice in the last five days in 3D!!)After working on action classics like The Terminator, Rambo, Aliens and True Lies, James Cameron comes up with one of the best romantic, epic movies of all times. The way he adds fiction to the true story is absolutely brilliant. The script is too long, dialogues a little cheesy, screenplay a tad slow, but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie. Bottom line, I'm no one to talk about this man.Twenty-two year old Kate Winslet looks gorgeous as Rose DeWitt Bukate, and plays her role to perfection. Her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that I have goosebumps even now thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as Jack Dawson is one of his best works to date. The chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see on-screen. The rest of the cast, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and every other actor, is excellent. It's a shame that it didn't win any Oscars for acting!Cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely splendid. The way he captured the romantic moments between Rose and Jack in the first half, and the disastrous sinking in the later half is terrific. It is one of the best work on cinematography I've seen to date. Editing by James Cameron, Conrad Buff IV and Richard A. Harris is perfect. Music by James Horner is absolutely brilliant. Be it the foot tapping Irish music for the real party under-decks, the musicians playing till the last-minute before the sink, or the ever loved 'My Heart Will Go On', master- pieces!!James Cameron spent over a year with 300 people to digitally remaster the 1997 version into 3D. And the effort pays off, for it was fantastic to watch this masterpiece on big screen again. The 3D effect wasn't so great, but seriously, who cares?? It's TITANIC!! 3D or not, go re-live this magnum opus all over again!For more reviews, please visit sasikanth.me :)",10,2,7,10 April 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The legend ends, or does it?? :D
","The Dark Knight has finally risen, and he does with a bang!! The Dark  Knight Rises is nothing short of a terrific film and a perfect ending  to the franchise. It ain't a perfect film by any means, but that  doesn't stop it from being awesome!!  It's an entertaining film. To call it an epic might be going a little  overboard, but its close nevertheless. Nolan continues with his fine  work and gives a perfect end to the Batman Trilogy (end or a new  beginning remains to be seen, thanks to Robin).  Acting: 9/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 9/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10  Is it worth your time and money??: Do I even need to answer that  question?? It's the biggest movie of the year, and if you still need an  answer, hell yeah. It might not be the best of Nolan's work, but it's a  perfect finish to the series (I hope this ain't the end!!)",9,13,27,20 July 2012
