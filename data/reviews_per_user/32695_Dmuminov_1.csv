Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident evil is not what it use to be. It looks more like Matrix 3D...
","I have watched movie yesterday, and I am really disappointed. Like a real fan on Resident Evil, I expected much more, especially because, the director of the first Resident Evil (which is in my opinion the best of all sequels) was back to direct this one. First things first, this movie isn't a horror really, there is no mystery or scary scenes. This is more like an action movie, than a horror. A lots of scenes looks like they just come out of Rambo, Matrix or some other action movie. Story and plot are not interesting and exciting, in other words, there isn't any. Scenery is also static, it looks too much futuristic. In previous sequels, scenery was changing during whole movie, but in this one, there are maybe 3 dominant sceneries. Unfortunately, all my fears of this becoming an action instead of zombie horror are true. Special effects and 3D scenes are nothing special, but whole movie is based on them. This crew could have perform much better, if there only was a good story and plot. Resident Evil atmosphere is just missing out, even that great music theme from the beginning of the previous sequels is no more. If you miss this movie, you won't be missing much, I am sorry to say that, but that's just it.",3,0,2,23 October 2010
