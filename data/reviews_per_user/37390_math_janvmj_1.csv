Hereditary," Easily the worst 'horror' movie i've ever seen
","Not trying to blast or anything but don't waste your money on this.
The story has holes...sometimes it doesn't make any sense and you just try to get over it and then you start laughing because you realize how stupid and horrorless is this movie. Insidious is WAAAAYYYYY better than that.",1,9,21,11 June 2018
