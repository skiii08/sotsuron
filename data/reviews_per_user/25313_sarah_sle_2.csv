Hereditary," Seriously?!
","WTF!!! You have to be kidding me!! If this is considered horror or a thriller in the realm of film, kill me now! Hollywood has gotten lazy in its age! I would rate this POS a negative 10 if I could! Too bad! If I were writing this story it would have turned out totally different! Maybe regular folk should be writing for Hollywood instead of these idiots trying!",1,1,7,26 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," WTF!!! What the hell was Hollywood thinking?!
","I'm sorry. Not enough time has went by to rewrite the history of this horrific event as it happened, much less let loose this hairbrained piece of crap movie!! To run a parallel universe in concurrence to actual events is just unfeeling and heartbreaking to the still living families involved. And to actually offer them awards towards it......lmfao!! Brad Pitt nor Leo deserve respect for anything. Movie was boring and their acting was subpar!",1,5,7,19 January 2020
