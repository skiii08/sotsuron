It," A pitiful shame to the original story in the book
","What a friggin let down. I have read the book since I was 19 years old, almost 15 years ago. It was scary, haunting, and the true definition of Evil. What they did in this movie was preposterous. Only the beginning was good, the rest of the movie summed up with 'scary' moments that are not scary at all, stupid comedy scenes like the jokes the kids tell sometimes which wasn't even fitting for a scary movie, and worst of all, the scenes which were not even in the book. Not to mention the 10 year old kids sitting behind us in the movie theater and laughing/screaming which even more ruined the experience.If you liked the book, don't go watch this. Leave the magic in your mind.",1,5,13,14 September 2017
Spectre," A more emotional approach to our beloved Bond
","While fans of the previous title 'Skyfall' won't be too happy about this, I think Spectre brings a new take to old fashioned fast-paced Bond we all know and used to.Starting from the mesmerizing opening credits, you already get the hint that this movie is not your usual bond. This time they bring us the inner side of James, to show us he is not just a fast paced action guy. From the inner calm way he approaches to the ladies, and captivates them with every word and reaction from his side, to the mysterious air around the whole secret organization that is Spectre.This movie shows something about Bond that we didn't see in previous movies. There is a special touch to it, something that is very hard to explain, that captivates your every breath.The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it could have been a lot shorter, but otherwise, its just special, and that is what I expect from this series.",9,7,21,5 November 2015
