The Devil's Advocate," Why why why this ending?
","The first two hours were superb. If the director could end the film a bit earlier, it would be a perfect 10. But when we arrive in the final confrontation it gets so childish and predictable it loses a lot. We could do without it, that's for sure. But still (till that moment) it's a thrilling movie that deserves to be seen. I wonder how someone who can produce such a masterpiece didn't understand how he messed it up in the end. Since the audience is not children, we don't want to be told so much! If you could just stop the VCR in the 2 hours mark, it would be great.",9,3,4,5 August 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin made me eat my hat
","I'm very happy to admit that Tarantino proved me wrong. If you read my review of Vol.1 you'll see that I was very disappointed with the apparent lack of coherent plot and cinematic innovations. Vol.2 is so breathtakingly good that makes up for the sub-par (for Quentin's standards of course) Vol.1 and not only that, it makes you look back at the first installment with a much more appreciative eye. Vol.2 has a great plot and solid character building, blended with the unique Tarantino style. So Quentin has definitely not run dry of ideas, on the contrary he's become even more subtle and mature.I also have to save some praise for the captivating performances of David Carradine and Uma Thurman. It is unbelievable how perfectly they fit their roles, as if they were made for them! In terms of comparison between 1 & 2, here's how I see it: Vol.1 on its own is a mediocrity, Vol.2 on its own is a fantastic movie, Vol.1 & 2 together are a monumental saga.",10,0,1,8 September 2005
Walk the Line," I've seen that before
","Johnny Cash's story is unique, or is it? Country boy goes to the big city and then follow fame, money, sex, drugs and the obligatory decline, but finally love overcomes all obstacles.Yes it's well shot, yes the leads are good, care has been taken to the minute detail in the technical department, but, well, you just know it's gonna flow like this. And mind you, not being from the States, I haven't had a clue about JC's life beforehand. It just seemed to follow the recipe.Now I know a lot of people expect exactly that from a biopic. It generally won't let you down, so it makes a good rental, but there's nothing ground-breaking in there.",7,3,4,29 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow, what effects!!!
","There are a lot of movies for which I would say 'Go see them just for the effects'. It's a general remark, meaning it's a dull movie with good CGI. The effects in Phantom Menace are so good, I couldn't care less about the plot, the character development and all the rest that usually make a good movie! An incredibly realistic world that you know its 100% virtual!!! The awe for the effects predominated every other feeling I had towards this movie. Some things though, still managed to annoy me, namely Jar Jar Binks and little Anakin Skywalker. Both were put for the pre-teen audience, I know, but the fact is that they are unbearable for everybody else. There's no point to specify annoying parts of their roles, because they are annoying from beginning to end. A final remark: Why this was Episode I? They take so many things for granted! I was hoping for an Episode I where we see how the Jedi circle is formed etc. This was more like Episode III. So, not from a SW fan, go see it if you haven't yet, it's worth its money. Of course don't expect a cinephile film, but who does?",7,0,2,17 October 1999
The Longest Yard," Totally unworthy of its predecessor
","I wonder, will some corporate guy actually get a bonus for having thought that a remake of Mean Machine starring Adam Sandler would be a great idea? What kind of productive thinking is that? This movie not only adds nothing in the mean machine brand, but it serves as a Trojan horse that can destroy the myth from within. What is the redeeming value of having endured 2 hours of Adam Sandler and co? I couldn't find any. Even to say that it conveys an anti-racist message is a longer shot than those we see in the movie itself. The music is pathetic, but at least that was expected. Oh and I forgot, it is a comedy? Where are the jokes then?",4,8,15,8 September 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Not bad
","Spielberg offers us a light and entertaining comedy. Tom Hanks steals the show, while Leo DiCaprio is bearable (which is a good thing concerning his other roles). I guess this has way deviated from the real story, some things depicted just can't happen. An honorable mention must be made for the fantastic opening titles.",7,0,1,30 December 2003
Unbreakable," Shyamalan knows his stuff
","M. Night Shyamalan is brilliant. He's both an excellent writer and director, an extremely rare combination in the movie business. What more can one ask than a compelling, well told story and great camera angles and filters. Bruce Willis shines again (he fits perfectly in Shyamalan's roles) and Samuel Jackson, while deviating from his usual style proves how good an actor he can be. The bad part: A little more development in the end would not be a bad idea, what was with the on screen narration of the aftermath? Too cheap way-out for this movie's standards.",9,0,1,2 February 2004
Fight Club," Definitely enjoyable
","Fight Club is a very enjoyable movie, but as long as you take it for just what it is, a psychological thriller with comic elements. Well shot with very good acting and solid plot. Don't be fooled to think of it as a social satire or as if there is a strong social message underneath. There might be something remotely resembling such a thing, but if you simply start to examine it a bit more seriously, there are more logical holes than a strainer. I was also a bit annoyed with the female-friendly close shots of muscles and Brad Pitt, but we'll have to live with this. So thumbs up, but know what to expect.",8,0,1,1 November 2000
Memento," Remember to see this movie!
","While this film is about someone with no short-term memory, it's very difficult for us to forget it. The plot is built in a backwards-linear way (as Christopher Nolan puts it) and this helps the viewer to actually get into the world of Leonard. What I like most is that you can't be based on a single thing! Additionally, every other aspect (apart from the truly original and captivating story) of Memento is great. Acting, directing, atmosphere, all are top-notch and with refreshing doses of dark humor a la Coen brothers! Another great proof that big budget is of the lowest importance in making a good movie.",10,1,2,31 January 2002
12 Monkeys," Terry delivers
","This film has the unique ability of satisfying almost every possible taste. And it does so with class. With Twelve Monkeys you get high quality acting, effects, costumes, drama, (non-linear) plot, character study, action and fiction. There are some elements that could be developed more, but I guess there has been a compromise so as it appeals to more people. Still, it's a very entertaining and fulfilling movie experience. There is no way you'll feel sorry for the money you spent for the theater or the rental or the DVD.",8,0,0,14 September 2000
Billy Elliot," Chick Flick a l' Anglaise?
","Stephen Daldry apparently figured out it would be a good idea to borrow all the powerful aspects of British cinema we've witnessed over the years (namely social criticism, straightforward dialogues, realistic family confrontations, the Thatcher decadence atmosphere and scenery) and mix them with a corny and shallow theme, in order to create a 'socially aware' feel-good movie. The producers of Full Monty did it first and better. This film remains though a pleasure to watch due to the high calibre of its performances and especially that of Jamie Bell.",7,0,0,21 July 2001
The Fifth Element," This is entertainment!
","Let go and enjoy this thrilling ride! Beautiful protagonists, amazing scenery, colors, action, humor, fiction, fantasy. This is Brazil meets Die Hard. It was all I asked for a summer escape. Witty lines, smart details, smooth plot. Unfortunately the last minutes are cheese-o-rama. It's a shame they were so clumsy at the end. Still, a definite recommendation!",8,0,1,8 June 2001
The Others," Dark and well crafted
","Hitchcock is everywhere in this film. Perhaps that's what makes it a quality film. Once again, we have proof in our hands that there's no need for violence or gore to shock the audience. Tension is built gradually, while some angles and cuts increase the adrenaline levels. All the actors deliver memorable performances and, having been cast by true experts, embody perfectly their characters. The plot flows smoothly, except some necessary elements that lead to the grand finale. I think this film will eventually stand the test of time and will be considered a true masterpiece of the genre!",10,0,0,24 December 2001
Troy," What you would expect from Hollywood
","As a Greek, I've been taught many times our ancient literature. Yes this movie has plenty of inaccuracies, omissions and alterations compared to the original. But so what, Homer was NOT an historian, in fact 'Homer' most probably was an imaginary name given to a pleiad of people that crafted this story throughout the centuries. Nobody claimed after all this to be Iliad. And you know what, if you stop playing 'spot the inaccuracy', this movie is actually enjoyable! It felt great to have all these war time heroes of my childhood on the silver screen! Spare the cheesy dialogues and love stories (both Hollywood compulsory), the characters were pretty accurate in their behaviours. This was what I had in mind for most of them. What I didn't like was the active effort to capitalise on the Lord Of the Rings success (by means of same graphics, same battle sounds, same battle choreography, even same actors). Let me finish by saying that this movie have received too much unjust criticism. It is just a movie, for Zeus sake!",8,4,8,5 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Gayxploitation and boring like hell
","Brainstorming session at Focus Features. Someone comes up with the gay cowboy novel she's read. Someone else thinks it's a good idea and gives the green light. The birth of a failure. Apart from gay love not been such a shocking idea anymore, the movie turns out to be unbelievably boring. How could it not be so when the only reason for making it was to show two gay cowboys on screen. Did we need over two hours for that? Two slow, painful hours?The direction and the photography are classy, but there is nothing else. At best, there is something, an exact copy of a secret heterosexual romance with the predictable pinch of social outcry. So this is why I call it a 'gayxploitation' movie. The 'Oscar worthy' performances? Heath Ledger is good but not special and his smoking/spitting thing is rather annoying (okay you desperately want to look genuine, we got it), while Jake Gyllenhaal is miscast. Come on, can you see him as a cowboy? The mustache at the end is so fake that compares only to Johnny Depp's at Donnie Brasco. I'm afraid this is gonna end up just like Dances With Wolves and Beautiful Mind. A bad film that the Academy's political correctness elevates to unworthy heights.",4,11,65,30 January 2006
X-Men," Honest entertainment
","It is a good thing when you don't walk disappointed from the theater. I guess X-Men succeeds at this, giving the audience thrill, visual/sound effects and beautiful people (this applies much more to the male audience, having cast Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). At no point it underestimates the viewer's intelligence, keeping a somewhat coherent plot for such a genre. The 'unbelievability' factor is not that high. Pure entertainment which doesn't require a complete cerebral turn-off.",7,0,0,23 October 2000
Spider-Man 3," Only as a hi-def showcase
","Apparently Spiderman 3 is all but a collection of obligatory scenes that appear from nowhere. They must have thought, hey, it worked before, let's squeeze this scene here. And then this, and then the other and look, we've made a 'movie' almost 2:30 hours long! Doesn't matter if there's no plot, no coherence and no logic, the producers perception is that the public has the memory skills of a goldfish and will only care for what happened during the last minute.Maguire and Dunst are absolutely awful. No chemistry, no acting skills. I'm focusing on them simply because the rest of the cast just didn't have enough lines to join the list. This is a crappy movie you should get only on a hi-def format to enjoy the effects. And this is also the only reason it gets a 4.",4,1,2,2 January 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Excellent. Period.
","This movie gave me the familiar goose bumps I get when I witness an artistic masterpiece. It is so good that I find pointless to describe individual scenes. While its brightness transcends time, it was also a brave political statement at the right time. In my opinion, it's also Kubrick's best film.",10,1,1,25 January 2001
Pan's Labyrinth," Yes classic movies can be made in 2006
","Absolutely magical in every sense. Cliché expressions like words don't do justice fit perfectly to this film. Del Toro gives us the perfect marriage of real and surreal, complimented by amazing visual effects and makeup, breathtaking music, seamless flow of the storyline and of course the brilliant performances of all leads, but especially Ivana Baquero as Ofelia and Sergi Lopez as Capitan Vidal.It doesn't really matter that this masterpiece, Best Picture of 2006 by far didn't get even Best Foreign Movie from the Academy, because awards are not what matters. What matters is the millions of enchanted cinema goers who will always have this piece of gold in their top ten lists.",10,7,14,27 February 2007
Malcolm X," A bit too long but well done
","Spike Lee created an epic in two parts. The first one illustrates the atmosphere of Malcolm's childhood and junior years and is less focused on the facts, the second one recites the story and leaves the atmosphere in the background. I cannot comment on the accuracy of the facts since I'm not familiar with Malcolm X's life, but I sense an effort to make him likeable to everyone. Of course this might be attributed to Denzel Washington, who does a remarkable job. The film has the right blend of personal and social life and it doesn't become cheesy except in the last minutes. It would be better for everyone if they didn't exist.",7,0,6,17 May 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Simply great
","The first half hour is cheerful and has some very funny moments, but it results in pure tragedy. Kubrick masterfully exposes the mentality of the US Army at the time. He creates a realistic atmosphere of Vietnam and he covers almost every aspect of a soldier's life there with unique style. FMJ ranks on top of war movies.",9,0,0,18 May 2000
Fargo," Enchanting
","Fargo is a truly multi-layered film. Sometimes a comedy (or a black comedy, there are some hilarious murder scenes), sometimes a drama. I loved the portrayal of the Midwestern naivete. You become annoyed by all these people who don't understand the importance or the situations they face and stick to their superficial lives, but in the end you wonder if it is us who get it the wrong way. That's the main question, put brilliantly in this film. Excellent casting and acting and a lesson in directing from the Coen brothers.",9,0,0,4 December 2000
Notting Hill," Take it for what it is
","Looking for a 'date movie'? This is the one. A pleasant, sweet and charming love comedy, for two relieving hours. I guess it doesn't take itself too seriously anyway so I won't be too harsh against it. Two beautiful actors involved in an intimate affair and all the rest of the supporting cast adding to the comic relief. I loved Hugh Grant's lines, every single word was perfectly chosen to add to the wit and attractiveness of his character. I didn't like the plethora of close-ups of the two leads, they made the film look like a photo shoot of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Okay we know they're good looking but please! In conclusion, it is light entertainment but it is actual entertainment and not all films are nowadays, so it's worth seeing.",7,1,1,21 October 1999
Léon: The Professional," Wonderful
","How can I rate this unique movie less than a 10. Intelligent dialogues, strong emotional build-up, fast pace, absorbing atmosphere and a great soundtrack.But Leon would be doomed without first class actors. All four main characters are perfectly cast and brilliantly played. Their presence dominates this movie, which by the way has nothing to do with an action flick, it is a masterfully crafted character study. Action is just the extra salt to the delicious cinematic plate Luc Besson is offering to us.Natalie Portman requires a special praise. This is not only a stunning performance from a 12 year old girl, this is even not only a great performance from an accomplished actress, it is absolutely Oscar material and, judging from her next projects, easily her best role to date.It is no coincidence that Luc Besson, Eric Serra and Jean Reno are French. They know how to go past the surface and make a movie with a feeling.",10,7,10,12 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A memorable experience, but still Hollywood
","Things are quite simple. Having a monstrous budget and being based on perhaps the best scenario a director could dream of, this film has all the preconditions to go to the top. This is the case concerning at least our audiovisual redemption. Effects, photography, costumes, camerawork, all are of unparalleled quality. Moreover, the flow of the story is smooth, while its power and complexity captivates the audience. Quite often though, Hollywood tortures us by adding typical void and superficial dialogues, annoying close-ups, cheesy heroics and sentimentalism. Thankfully, the greatness of this epic overbalances and minimizes all negative aspects and we are left with two dominant feelings: Awe for the grandeur we have just witnessed on screen and eagerness for the next installment.",9,0,0,21 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," A depiction of trigger-happy America
","This is junk. Completely void of plot, full of clumsy sentimentalism, very sloppily crafted, this is a movie made just because 'every beginning has an end'. Moreover, it's getting very depressing to see what youth in America is fed today. This is a typical case where war and death are portrayed like an electronic game, where you take your joystick and get some 'frags'. No wonder Americans are so numb when real war is taking place.",4,0,1,17 November 2003
Cast Away," Not disappointing
","I hope everybody understands that the strong point of such films is not the plot but the scenery, the audiovisual effects and (less) the acting. Given this, Cast Away is a decent production, which rewards the audience asking for suspense and agony. As Gladiator, it is meant to be seen at DTS/THX theaters. Unfortunately, after the (predictable) rescue, you will feel an inevitable urge to sleep.",7,0,0,10 March 2001
American Beauty," Overwhelming cinema
","I can't describe the feeling I have when I get in touch with a work of true art. American Beauty is not about the situations it presents or the corruption of the American society or anything like that. It's pure, original, sincere art. This is by far the best film Hollywood has given us for years. As a lover of European cinema, I'm truly pleased to see that art is not dead in the States.",10,0,0,19 March 2000
Being John Malkovich," An original idea and that's about it
","Why this movie is so overrated eludes me. If it's just a pleasant light romantic comedy that's okay. Nothing else seemed interesting and no serious thoughts could be generated by having seen it. And I still don't understand why John Malkovich. If you want a famous person, try high profile guys, if you want an anonymous person, try an anonymous person. Anyway, this is the film we've got and this is what we are supposed to judge. It's not bad, but don't expect something big.",7,1,2,23 May 2001
Face_Off," Cool badness
","The subject sums it up. Nothing else is interesting in this movie, except perhaps some directing tricks by Woo. The only reason to watch this is to see the talents of Cage and Travolta saving this bomb, just by them being bad in a remarkably cool way. Oh, there is some action too, but completely meaningless.",6,0,2,16 October 2000
The Exorcist," A classic movie but in 90's is a bore
","I confess, I was bored. Nothing didn't even remotely scare me or shock me in this movie. Nevertheless, I consider this to be a quality film: The Iraq scenes reveal a great cinematographer, the characters are deeper than the usual horror flick and by 1973 standards it has good visual and sound effects. Just don't compare it with REALLY scary films. Maybe it's a psychological study, but definitely not a thriller. Small trivia: The first Greek song I heard in the movie is 'Istoria Mou Amartia Mou' ('My Story My Sin') by the late Rita Sakellariou whose funeral was today (first page news here).",6,1,2,9 August 1999
Underground," Perfection on celluloid
","If for any reason you haven't seen this masterpiece, do it now. You won't regret it. Especially if you are from the Balkan region, it is a must. The story of the last 50 years in Yugoslavia in 3 hours in a film only Emir Kusturica can do. Some scenes simply stick in your mind and cannot get out. Extremely powerful and not at all tiring, despite its duration. Definitely in my personal top 10.",10,71,98,2 July 1999
Before Sunset," The best movie of 2004
","This is one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original. Having rated Before Sunrise with 9, Before Sunset is a definite 10. It is a subtler, more profound and more mature movie. The script is absolutely excellent and the two leads are giving breathtaking and classy performances. Can you imagine that none of them is not even nominated for an Oscar? Speaks volumes about the Academy once more.This is a very difficult movie to make. The ingredients need to be just right. The emotion and the tension have to be created progressively, realistically and timely. Before Sunset succeeds in every layer and leaves us with a plethora of truly memorable scenes.This is what talented people with a love for cinema can give us. Thank you.",10,2,3,20 February 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Just for the action
","I gave it a 7, which was a compromise between the absolutely excellent effects and the absolutely lousy plot. It could've been less, but hey, you have to see the famous first minutes even with such a typical dumb-hollywood scenario.",7,0,0,29 July 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A hi-tech kung-fu fairytale
","An important thing about this film when judging it is what is its genre. As polished wu xia, this film is perhaps the best ever made. As a rival to 'Da hong deng long gao gao gua' it is poor. Throughout the film you can find all the basic elements of Chinese mentality: Pride, honor, respect, sincerity and love. Great visual effects, although the 'flight' scenes are exaggerated and tiring. On the other hand, one cannot but admire the beautiful choreography of kung-fu scenes. Speaking of beauty, I still wonder how my eyes managed to unglue from Zhang Ziyi. And I thought I'm old enough not to be mesmerized by a woman on celluloid!",8,0,0,25 October 2000
The Lives of Others," Important and amazing cinema
","The Lives of Others was a special film even before it was made. It is the first introspective movie about East Germany. A long-awaited look into one of the most interesting large scale social experiments of the 20th century, the DDR. Such a subject gave this movie tremendous potential, which thankfully it explored to the maximum. Yes, the critics are right, it is an amazing movie by all means. Technically, it is extremely well made. The scenario flows perfectly and the accomplished direction immerses the viewer in a dark and claustrophobic atmosphere. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck knows how to tell a story and makes a remarkable debut.But in order to achieve true brilliance, the film also needed the classy performances first of the late Ulrich Mühe and second of Sebastian Koch. They truly take it off and bring their characters to palpable reality.This is one of those films you physically feel the shiver of its greatness when the credits roll. Simply must-see.",10,0,1,11 August 2007
Good Will Hunting," Same old
","Usual stuff. A talented but problematic guy deals with his life. Average story, skillful acting, corny ending. I wouldn't recommend it, since it's nothing fresh. I guess it would appeal most to younger females because of Matt Damon.",7,3,8,14 November 2000
The Elephant Man," David Lynch at its best
","This is how films should be made. Unique directing, excellent cast, memorable performances by Hurt and Hopkins and a touching story. The subject is tough and the movie handles it without being pedantic. The whole film has some great moments but the very last scene is simply superb. While I hate tear-jerkers, I admit it was masterfully shot. A must see.",9,0,0,17 May 2001
Amadeus," Worth seeing but not a masterpiece
","There are some things that will never make me to really love Amadeus. First, why do they have to translate in English the operas? Second, how do they let someone refer to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as 'Wolfie'? Third, how unjust can this movie be to Salieri's personality and his work. Okay, apart from these things, Amadeus is a true quality movie. F. Murray Abraham stages a memorable performance, absolutely worthwhile of the Oscar, the costumes and scenery are expertly crafted and the rendition of Mozart's classics by St Martin in The Fields philharmonic is top-notch.",8,2,6,2 February 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Audiovisual appeal
","Moulin Rouge is a very pleasant movie to watch. It's style over content the good way. A glamorous cast and a great music add to the overall feel. It evolves as a fairy tale where even the evil is presented in a non-disturbing manner to the audience. There might be nothing more than an excuse of a plot, but chances are you won't notice it since Nicole and Ewan do their best to outshine it.",8,1,2,24 October 2003
Donnie Brasco," Good but sometimes superficial
","This film has the luck to be based on a thrilling story, but the latter is unfortunately manipulated to emotional extremes. The family conflicts with scenes like the daughter's first communion are extremely annoying and boring to me. A waste of celluloid. From all the characters, there is only one interpersonal relationship that works. The good news is that it's the one between the two leads. The very last Pacino scene was quite strong. Al is his usual overacting self, especially in the beginning of the movie, where there's no need for emotions. Johnny Depp is acceptable, even if he's not perfectly cast. But the moustache is ridiculous. In general, there is an obvious effort to give a 70's feel (and I don't mean just the costumes and the premises, but even the way the scenes are shot), maybe trying to capitalize on the success of this genre at the time. It's not bad, it just doesn't give the extra boost the director thought it would.",7,0,1,14 September 2000
Mulholland Drive," Brilliant
","In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch produced his best movie to date and one of my favorite movies ever. I like it so much because it's one of those rare cases where every expectation I have when I sit in front of the silver screen is fulfilled. It has a clever plot, which makes you actually think and not switch off your brain, it has fantastic performances, especially from the two female leads, it has great, great music (Llorando a capella is divine!), beautiful photography and expert directing. And most of all, it takes you away from your seat to a 2-hour fantasy trip. Explanations of what is actually going on you can easily find everywhere. However, I'm sure Lynch wants YOU to build the story and not simply digest something that someone else has chewed for you.",10,2,4,19 September 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Disappointment
","Perhaps Tarantino has nothing more to give. This stylistic excuse of nothingness can't help but make you wonder where is the raw talent behind Reservoir Dogs, the pure genius behind Pulp Fiction and the mature, solid director behind Jackie Brown. Sorry Quentin, but it's getting boring to play 'spot the reference'. Okay, it's worth the price of admission, but that couldn't be what such a charismatic guy can expect from his audience.",7,0,1,14 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," A proud zero except for some action
","A genuinely pathetic scenario with lame attempts to appeal to the female audience (just look at the demographics on IMDb, where on earth will you find an action movie with higher female rating at all ages, a sign of only one thing, it sucks big time!). Awful, sad, clueless, idiotic. Fortunately we have John Woo giving us a couple or so exciting minutes of adrenaline rush, but that's a tiny percentage of the film's length.",4,0,3,30 October 2000
The Insider," This was BAD
","When you see the dialogue being a continuous effort to describe the esoteric world of the protagonists, instead of it being expressed by their acting, the tension being artificially built up, instead of it being naturally generated by the flow of the movie, the same cliche dilemmas being put on screen again and again instead of them being created in the mind of the audience, you know this film is a failure. Not in a single moment the director and the writer could make their production being worth of such a good material they had in their hands. Is there something worse than chewed food?",4,1,2,13 March 2000
Quiz Show," Simply excellent
","This film belongs up there with the best. Redford impressed me, creating a fantastic 50s atmosphere and giving an expert touch to each scene. All the actors excelled, but especially Ralph Fiennes, who once again proves himself to be pure gold. And what a job the casting team did! The story flows smoothly and the writer respects its initial material. In the end, the main message is passed just the way it had to. This is good cinema!",10,3,3,14 May 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Breathtaking
","This film is awe-inspiring yet minimalistic, slow paced yet with thousands of years of time-range, emitting loneliness and warmth, grandeur and insignificance. A true work of art with imposing classical masterpieces playing at the background. It asks the questions and doesn't always give the answers. Moreover, what to say about these excellent visual effects, there are so many contemporary films which would be ultimately embarrassed. It is hands-down the defining sci-fi movie.",9,1,3,5 December 2000
Avatar," Good CGI, dumb dialogues
","In terms of the visual department, Avatar is a pleasure to watch. It is an achievement and it rightfully got the Oscar. This is the only reason - and by all means a sufficient one - to go to the theatre. The overall story is also relatively believable although surely not original. However, given the investment this movie got, the huge potential was only partly realised. And why? Because at some point they forgot they were making a movie, not a CGI demo. The dialogues are so annoying, childish and empty, it makes sitting through the movie with the sound on a real challenge. I don't want to hear exclamations of 10-year olds if I'm to get interested in the plot. I don't want to be force fed what's going on, I don't want one dimensional characters and so little respect for the intelligence of the audience.So I have to admit very mixed feelings on recommending this movie. The reality is, you cannot miss Avatar, since it sets today's standard in visual effects. But please, do not have any more expectations than that, or you will be disappointed.",6,2,5,14 March 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Optimistic film
","Those who accuse the movie to be a tearjerker are too harsh. It is mainly about feeling good (and making the others feel good) in any circumstance. The lines are purposely superficial and this gives the film a strange beauty because the situations themselves are more than enough to generate concern about the protagonists. One shouldn't search thoroughly for a clear point but just sit, relax and enjoy the film as it comes.",8,0,2,13 May 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Not a clockwork movie
","The effort of Kubrick to embed symbolism in every detail is obvious from the beginning. About the brutality and sex, while in 1971 this might have been a shocking movie, nowadays it is nothing special. What is interesting though is the way these scenes are presented, with the environment (sound, face expressions, scenery) contradicting with what is actually happening, trying to disorient the viewer and make him think if in his actual life he pays attention to the bare event or to the package that goes with it. What a contradiction is Beethoven's 9th with murder and rape, as even the protagonist admits in the film. In general this is a movie worked out in detail, but I think so much importance is given in the depth of particular scenes that the flow of the film is affected and it loses its coherency, making it difficult for a not determined viewer to sit and watch. This of course doesn't remove from The Clockwork Orange the masterpiece status, but suggests that the unprepared pay attention to the inner meaning of this film.",9,0,0,17 January 2000
Pretty Woman," Don't shoot
","When I first saw this film back in 1990 I was sick. How can one even remotely like such an obvious insult of our logic. But then I was a teenager. Now that some years have gone by, I can understand the need of a sentimental escape from real life. I still don't like it, but its international success proves that even today almost everyone needs a tale. There are millions of us who don't care about the one dimensional supporting cast, the implausibility of the plot or the wooden acting, when this film offers them a trip to the land of dreams. So, while this film is light years away from my taste, I will not be harsh because of the joy it has offered to so many people.",6,1,3,20 May 2001
Pulp Fiction," As good as it gets
","It sounds cliche but I can't describe how much I love this movie. Whoever doesn't appreciate its cinematic excellence and utter coolness, must definitely see it again, very very carefully this time. Everything about Pulp Fiction has been said, so I'll use this space just to pay my respects to everyone involved.",10,0,1,21 October 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Fast paced and hilarious
","If by mistake you don't pay attention to the plot, you'll end up wondering what's going on. So glue your eyes on the screen and you won't regret it. There are many similarities with Pulp Fiction, but there's a distinctive British style. One of the best comedies/noir I've ever seen!",9,0,0,16 May 2000
Three Colors: Blue," So Beautiful
","What a splendid start for the now famous trilogy. This film is three persons: Kieslowski, Preisner and Binoche. They combine their talents and produce a masterpiece. An artful approach of modern day life in France. A lyrical narration of the life of a woman who lost her husband and her son. It touches even the deepest strings of the viewer. If you have trouble describing blue, watch this movie.",10,0,0,14 November 2000
A Beautiful Mind," Pathetic
","A completely dumbed-down and whitewashed version of the life of John Nash. The really interesting part, namely the Nash Theorem and the Nash Equilibrium, are just mentioned, no one actually cared to explain why these contributed to game theory and economics and earned him the Nobel prize. Instead of that, we get a ridiculous and unrealistic depiction of his schizophrenia, Crowe babbling as an idiot, Conelly in the most unbelievable, sexist, dumb role they could ever write for Nash's wife and clichés of academic life, institutions, interpersonal relationships etc. Only Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris and the make-up department were actually worth their salaries. A film destined to please brain-dead people, I guess that's why the Academy liked it anyway.",4,7,16,4 February 2004
Die Hard," A really classic action movie
","This is definitely the best of the Die Hard series. I'm usually bored with this kind of film, but I admit this one makes the adrenaline rush. Turn off your brain and you will enjoy this movie. Of course don't ask for quality, but who does.",8,1,3,30 May 2001
Wedding Crashers," Don't believe the hype
","I fell into the trap of having high expectations for this movie, after seeing the overall ratings and considering some positive comments from friends (female friends, that was a huge mistake, never to be repeated, ever!). Well it seems they were dead wrong. The scenario is predictable at best. I know that this is never a strong point at a slapstick comedy, but they could use some half-wit dialogue. Script is dumb, period. Now the protagonists: I sympathise with them because they had to cope with some hopeless lines, but they could at least emit the aura of real charmers and womanisers. This was their job after all. What they achieved is to appear fake and badly cast. Especially Owen Wilson was seriously annoying. Obviously there will be no mention of the female characters, because they're just caricatures. Chris Walken is the only bearable actor in this movie and I completely understand that he's into this kind of flicks because he has a family. The only way to sit through the whole movie is to expect nothing at all. I guarantee it will match your expectations.",4,1,2,8 September 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Excellence
","One of these cases where any comment does not do justice to the quality of this masterpiece. Everything in this film is so good it defines excellence, from acting to directing. I don't think cinema has ever created a more dominant figure than the Chief.",10,1,3,8 June 2001
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Not bad
","The problem with Die Hard movies is that they take themselves too seriously. While they always try to create a complex plot, they always end up making it dumber than before. Other than that, this one is good action, probably the best of the triad. Of course remember to turn off your higher cerebral functions.",6,0,0,30 October 2000
The Green Mile," An Oscar Beggar
","Almost every scene and every shot in this film is stylized to conform to Academy standards. (Un)fortunately, these are not my standards. I must give credit though to Hutchison and Duncan for their performances and generally to the character development. It's a pretty much accurate adaptation of the novel but when it had to divert, it headed directly to audience sentimental exploitation. So I'm neither shocked nor amazed by this movie, although I might consider it a good rental. It's nice fiction after all.",7,0,1,15 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The only worthy Star Wars film of the second trilogy
","After the pathetic Episodes I and II, Revenge of the Sith comes as a worthy addition to the franchise. It has a believable plot, good performances and the (wonderful) audiovisual effects complimenting and not starring in the film. It is utmost enjoyable, covers the plot holes from all previous films and leaves the viewer with a feeling of closure. I would go as far as considering this the deepest and darkest film of all six. If you leave your childhood fondness aside, RotS is definitely more subtle than the original trilogy. My only objection, we are still subjected to the love story torture, but it is definitely more bearable than the Episode II abomination. Finally, George Lucas is back with a vengeance (or is it a Revenge?)",8,2,5,21 May 2005
The Blind Side," Unbearable
","This is a dumbed down excuse of a movie. Honestly, I felt a physical assault on my brain cells. Obviously the producers are trying to target the Christian republican rednecks, who ironically, will probably not like it anyway. For the rest of us, it is simply unbearable to watch.I like Sandra Bullock. No I really do. But it is completely beyond me how she got an Oscar for such an awful movie. Is portraying a stereotypical character with corny lines worthy of an Oscar? Is delivering the clichés we've seen hundreds of times before worthy an Oscar? I feel sorry for my lost time watching this, although thankfully it was just on the plane, so I didn't pay a cent.",3,29,49,19 March 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Pretty good, but not a masterpiece!
","The only reason I rented this title was because I've seen its rating in the IMDB. Well I was hoping for a thrilling experience, a work of art at least. C'mon you raters! This is simply a good film! It's ok to watch, but if you were hoping for something better than good, then you will be disappointed. There are so many better films than this! Now, talking about the film, Tim Robbins was not the ideal match for this role and Morgan Freeman was ok for a nice old man in a Midwest bar, but definitely not for a murder convict. In general the atmosphere in the jail was laughable. So many good men, you would believe it was the Sunday mass.",8,0,0,4 August 1999
Vanilla Sky," Sorry, I'm not buying.
","This is the definition of a poser film. Sophomoric, unoriginal, pseudo-intellectual, it has all the elements that make me rush out of the theatre. Cruise is continuing his truly annoying performances a la Magnolia. This time his girlfriend joins him in breaking our nerves. Cameron Diaz, without giving a memorable performance, is better than the other two combined. Yes. They are so bad.",5,0,0,3 February 2002
The Deer Hunter," Walken, De Niro and Streep make this an essential viewing
","The Deer Hunter is most of all a character study. This is why it was absolutely necessary to find the right cast. And the right cast it was. Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Chris Walken deliver memorable performances and demonstrate their tremendous acting potential.The film though is not a masterpiece as so many people claim it to be. It takes off due to the performances, for sure, but the script is not that strong. I've found it somewhat incoherent, more of a collection of strong scenes than a flowing story. Also you can't fail to notice the sub-par sound quality and editing.So don't miss it, you have three Oscar-caliber performances in one movie, but having very high expectations may leave you disappointed..",8,0,0,3 March 2007
Amélie," Ridiculously overrated
","This movie just can't have such a high rating when true works of art crave to surpass 7! An artificial feel-good atmosphere, some decent humorous lines, charming characters and an original directing are not enough to bring a good film to masterpiece level. From start to finish, this movie is sophomoric, pseudo-intellectual and fuzzy. Or else, 'The Alchemist' on celluloid. I guess it's acceptable if you're a teenager, but it definitely can't stand towards an informed audience. Did I mention how corny it becomes in the end?",7,3,7,27 October 2001
The Sixth Sense," Much more than a thriller
","The power of the Sixth Sense lies on its critics. The rush of so many people to ascertain they had got it, shows how brilliant the script and the direction was. When the credits rolled we all felt fooled by Shyamalan, we all thought there must have been a flaw we haven't noticed. But no, the story is flawless, the hints were there and everything does make sense in the end. Basically, it's so intelligently made it's intimidating, hence the reaction. Shyamalan doesn't fool you, he simply outsmarts you. To paraphrase a quote from the movie, he makes you see only what he wants you to see. This is why you have to watch this film at least twice in order to appreciate how masterfully crafted it is.Now the acting. A movie can take pride if one of the leads throws an exceptional performance. When you have two magnificent, Oscar caliber performances, what more can you really ask from your actors. This is both Bruce Willis' and Haley Joel Osment's best role to date. And it makes the Sixth Sense the only movie after Leon that the adult/child relationship really works.Let me finish by saying that I consider a major spoiler even the title Sixth Sense. In order to truly enjoy this movie, you shouldn't know it has anything to do with supernatural. What's the fun when you know even before the first minute that this is about ghosts? Not to mention that the word twist is a spoiler by itself! Once more, I urge everyone NOT to read reviews before going to see a movie and if they have to take advice only ask if it was either 'good' or 'bad'. That's it. Nothing else.",9,0,0,14 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Beware of the corny ending
","So this is the end of the trilogy. For today's standards it is the apex of epic film making and audiovisual effects. Moreover it honestly tries to follow the plot of the books (but notice I'm referring solely to the plot). The Return Of The King is a movie you simply have to see for the sake of it. Now the bad part. It is unbelievably corny! Please, guys, why did you have to make the breakup of the Fellowship just a series of end-of-summer-camp goodbyes? No respect to the spirit of Tolkien, no inner meaning, no depth. This was completely unworthy of the rest of the effort and it spoiled it for me. Perhaps the whole crew got tired of this enormous project and daubed the last 30 minutes so that they could get over it.",8,5,10,5 January 2004
The Truman Show," Smile, you're on candid camera!
","I cannot understand those reviewers who wrote it's a good comedy and you will have a lot of laughs. I don't remember myself laughing not even once. I consider though this film one of the best I've ever seen. An excellent idea, with excellent scenario (I guess both go to Peter Weir) and an excellent performance by the protagonist, Truman. Once again the Academy ridiculed themselves by not giving the Oscar to Jim Carrey. It is one of those movies I call a cinematic experience. The perennial story of the fight for freedom, told in a truly original way. If you think you are left unsatisfied with the end, you are potential viewers of the fictional Truman Show. But the most annoying scene for me was the very last, where the two cops take the remote and change the channel to find something else... At their faces I recognized everyone of us. We search for the next excitement, forgetting instantly all the past. Enough with the analysis, just go and see it, it's a piece of gold, even if it's too slow in the beginning and too predictable in the end.",9,0,0,14 January 2000
The Matrix," Excellent graphics, recycled story
","Matrix is ground-breaking as far as CGI is concerned. We witness truly marvelous artwork. Aside from that, it's nothing special, nor original. It mostly reminded me of Carpenter's They Live. It stimulates our interest till the moment of the big revelation and then degenerates to a shooting extravaganza. We get some royal with cheese at the end with the love story and the usual close ups of Keanu for the girls. I didn't regret having seen it though, the guys at the visual effects department did a monumental job.",8,1,2,23 May 2001
Heat," Average to good thriller
","This film is, as expected, De Niro and Pacino. It would be a mediocrity without them. The plot is nothing unexpected, although it tries to explore a little bit more the cop-robber relationship. It has some really boring moments, especially where Pacino has to deal with his marriage. Who cares. Some good entertainment and a beauty to see these two guys on screen.",8,0,0,23 April 2000
300," Amazing movie and an extra treat for us Greeks
","What a ride! These were my heroes since childhood and in this film they came to life. The moments I almost got a hard-on from excitement is when I was hearing the true and historically documented sayings deeply embedded in the Greek DNA: 'Your shield or on your shield', 'Come and get it', 'So much the better, we shall fight in the shade', 'Go tell the Spartans, passerby, that here, by Spartan law, we lie'. I can't believe any Greek remained stiff during these. My total respect to everyone involved in making this film. Guys, thank you from the depth of my heart. You created an absolute delight for us Greeks and I hope for everyone else. I'm over 30 and I haven't felt like this for years! Excellent costumes, wonderful imagery and very faithful to both the comic and the novel. In fact it's almost identical to the image of Spartans we all carry in our collective subconscious, this is why it resonated with Greeks so much (broke all box office records!).",10,1,5,16 April 2007
Cube," Great idea but underdeveloped
","This is a truly original film. With a simple yet so powerful set, a handful of people explore their minds and souls. I always appreciate the films where complexity derives from simplicity. Now the bad part: Awful cliches, two-dimensional characters and a sophomoric use of mathematics which drives back everyone who is slightly familiar with the subject. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is imposing and with a little try one can enjoy the experience.",8,0,1,23 May 2001
Apollo 13," Interesting subject, superficial movie
","Who can stand up and say he/she's not fascinated by this subject? While these guys are heading to where everyone dreams to be, after just a few minutes we see that this movie isn't supposed to serve reality but to be a box office hit. There are so many emotional scenes which I guess never happened in the real mission. I liked the lingo that's everywhere in the picture, at least they had a good space travel advisor (well that's before you read the goofs section:-). But anyway as the production said: 'Certain characters and events have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes', so here's the catch. 7 out of 10.",7,5,12,29 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," What Ryan is not about
","I inevitably compare Thin Red Line with Saving Private Ryan as they are two sides of the same coin. What I missed in SPR was the character study and the depth of a war movie. No doubt TRL is a better movie, as it has more qualities than the one-dimensional SPR. Unfortunately you can't have it all and SPR action scenes are far better than here. I just wish Spielberg had the chance to see this one. Thin Red Line has its flaws but it has the ability to keep you 3 hours locked on the screen. 8/10",8,0,0,11 September 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Has quality but remains cheesy
","The reason for making this movie is obviously for the female audience to admire Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas combined. I'm sorry I can't relate to them, for me it's just a boring movie, without real shock value and with a plethora of corny and cliche moments. The only good thing is that it's a high budget film, which means nice costumes and scenery.",6,2,6,29 May 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Monty Python at almost their best
",This is an incredible movie (for everybody else except MP that is cause they have done even better in some Flying Circus episodes - that's why I put a 9). I can't believe people are complaining about the ending! You guys simply don't get them! The ending is the best part of the film! My stomach was aching from the laughs! Monty Python is the funniest gang ever assembled! And of course British humor is light years ahead than American.,9,0,0,9 September 1999
Sin City," Out of superlatives
","Absolutely magnificent! This is the movie all comic book adaptations should fare against. Thankfully Frank Miller himself was involved and he managed to communicate the true feel of his work. Everybody from cast to crew worked with the utmost respect to the original material. They delivered a pure quality film and managed to make it both artistic and entertaining. Performances are excellent, photography is unique, the atmosphere dark and compelling. A breath of fresh air from Hollywood and a proof that there is plenty of talent that can work little miracles. Don't hesitate for a moment to go and watch this. Final note, to the marketing department: Please guys don't spoil it. We don't want to be told how cool this film is. You ruin the whole thing.",9,1,2,26 June 2005
Gangs of New York," Fantastic direction, extremely weak story
","Watching Gangs of New York makes you feel that so much effort has been put for nothing. An absolutely top class direction by Scorcese and a memorable performance by Daniel Day Lewis, for, well, a plain and uninteresting story. It is hardly believable that they accepted contributing their immense talents having to deal with such a weak scenario. My only guess is that, this movie being shot right after the 9/11 events, they would have considered it as a tribute to the city of New York and they just had to be there. So about this excuse of a script: The tension is not built, the lines are poor and nothing is actually happening the right way.Now Leo Di Caprio. Who thought putting him against Day Lewis? The difference in class is so huge, one cannot think of them as adversaries even for one second. Daniel owns this film, while Di Caprio barely surfaces. And of course Cameron Diaz doesn't need to even be mentioned at all. Completely indifferent.Gangs of NY is the definition of a missed opportunity. With a proper script and a better lead instead of Di Caprio, it could be so much better.",7,13,24,16 April 2006
The Breakfast Club," Enjoyable but had higher potential
","I would take Breakfast Club as a very enjoyable teenage movie. It might not have a clear point or top performances but it still retains its entertainment value. Apart from that, since the setting is minimal and the movie is concentrated on the dialogues, there was room for far better lines. Plenty of plot elements could be analyzed and explored deeper. It does not really justify the forming of the bond between the kids. Moreover, while only scraping the surface of their problems, it tries to communicate some vague moral lesson, without having truly elaborated on it before.",7,1,4,26 January 2004
Gladiator," This is good entertainment
","What we have here is the absolute escape for a summer night. An absorbing story with great characters and mesmerizing visual effects. Also excellent acting from both leads, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Unfortunately we get the usual Hollywood emotional overdose. Without it we would be talking about a masterpiece. But we're still talking about top-notch entertainment. Don't watch this film in a non THX/DTS theater, you'll miss half the experience!",9,0,0,24 August 2000
Contact," A lesson on idiotic directing
","...or how to transform a fantastic, compelling story to utter cheese. The only good thing about the movie is that they dedicated it to Carl Sagan. Without his powerful novel it would be a total bomb. If we remove Sagan's masterpiece we are left with dumb sentimental dialogues, fluff about God (an insult, since Carl was a famous atheist), pathetic erotic interaction between Foster and McConaughey and the usual American nationalism. Thankfully Carl was gone before seeing it on the big screen, he was probably going to punch Zemeckis. Now thinking the other way, if you try to overlook all this, we have a chance to watch on celluloid an absorbing and, most important, scientifically accurate sci-fi tale by a master. So, despite the novel's rape, I would still suggest it.",8,0,2,1 May 2001
High Fidelity," A realistic and humorous look at relationships
","I had a long time to identify myself with a character. Well John Cusack made it. This film touched me. I love it much more when a comedy succeeds at generating emotions (and I don't mean the idiotic sitcom way). A truly great and memorable film, especially for music lovers like me (or should I say like everyone). Well done guys!",9,0,1,26 April 2001
Atonement," Great British story
","First of all, a comment on style. Atonement ticks all the boxes in Britishness. You cannot but love the mannerisms, the photography and the dialogue. A classy film only Brits can do.Then, it's the acting. Although all performances are great, there are two performances that stand above the rest. James McAvoy and Saoirse Ronan. Sometimes characters define the actors, but these two actually redefined their characters. Keira is undoubtedly stunning and lovable and she did indeed great, but she's overshadowed by the sheer quality of the other two. From the other two Brionys, Vanessa Redgrave shows what an excellent actress she is by perfectly mimicking the posture, gestures and talk of little Saoirse, while Romola Garai unfortunately was not such a good fit (and it seems this is mainly a casting error).Finally, the story is very well told and while the movie may leave a sad taste, it is actually a proof of its strength. This is what good movies do. They have the capability to imprint sentiments to the audience.",8,2,4,4 October 2008
V for Vendetta," A must-see experience
","Oh boy... This movie sure knows how to make an impression.Right from the beginning we are immersed deep into an Orwellian world (after all the plot and for that matter, the whole comic series by Alan Moore, is very similar to 1984). The big screens depicting the Big Brother are a direct tribute to 1984, the movie. But V for Vendetta is more vibrant, more colourful and much more entertaining than 1984.All the performances are top class (especially Natalie Portman is amazing, finally her performance in Leon found its match). The direction is sublime and the political references are so many, you really cannot miss them. A very strong denunciation of today's tactics of instigation of fear by the governments against their own people.V for Vendetta manages at the same time to offer high class entertainment and a strong political message. It is a must see and a proof that art can be serious when it's needed. Don't miss also the London references, always a pleasure for me to spot since I absolutely love this city.",9,1,2,12 May 2006
The Godfather," Greatness
","Yes, it is perfect. Every praise you hear about it is true. When every aspect of making a film is top-notch, you get the absolute movie. I would like to note though, Godfather is NOT a movie to watch while eating your pizza. It needs you to be completely devoted to it.",10,1,4,31 October 2000
