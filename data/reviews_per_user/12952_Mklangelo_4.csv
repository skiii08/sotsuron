Hereditary," Great flick (for horror, that is)
","I'm going to confess to thinking that the Horror Genre, in general is 95% crap. It is a repository of junk. I can count the offerings of this type of film that are truly good films on two hands and I'm being generous. The Excorsist, The Omen and The Ring are a few that come to mind. And honestly when a Horror Film gets a 7 or above in IMDB, it's almost meaningless. I think the folks that are true Horror fans have a pretty low set of expectations. I think lots of kids are fans of the genre which might explain the high ratings.Hereditary was really a nice surprise. The movie's plot starts slowly. The tension and creepiness build very gradually to a crescendo finale that really puts a chill up and down your spine. Skillfully directed and Toni Collette was really superb. And that little girl is one creepy looking kid. Mom won't have to spend a dime on baby-sitting her because nobody is gonna mess with that kid.If you hate horror movies because most of them flat out suck, treat yourself to this little gem... And leave the lights on.",7,0,1,25 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," The same old, same old
","I will begin this review by stating that I am highly biased against all Superhero films. As in (almost) all the others that have ever been produced, Avengers: Infinity War falls in with the vast majority as a collection of over-worked cliches that are the backbone of this 'genre'. I will admit that the banter of Tony Stark is clever. It always has been. I love Mr. Downey's ability to talk that talk. He is master of the fast, catch you on your heels style of verbal attack. For Tony Stark, it's a mixture of self defense and bringing you to the realization that you are actually dealing with a world class genius. A fun character. (Mr. Downey even sang on stage with Sting. Do a youtube search. You'll probably like it. I know I did). They toned the Stark character down simply because every one and their Superhero brother, aunt and sister made an appearence in this cliche.
On to my other gripe. We have the trope of the Superhero landing. You know, one foot, one knee and a hand on the ground with the other hand and the head in some stylized pose. I permanently turned off the Wonder Woman movie, featuring eye candy Gal Godot, the minute I saw it. I puke each time I see this trope and thankfully, I didn't see it in Infinity War so my thanks goes out to the cast and director but my trusty barf bag was at the ready.
Mark Twain is reported to have said, 'History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes.' Right once again, Mr. Clemens!I won't talk about the specifics of the film since truly, if you've seen one, you really have seen them all. I will confess and say that Deadpool 1 and 2 are the only two movies of this type that I actually enjoyed. We have actual human motivation and genuine, character driven drama and not just bombastic CG driven tripe. Plus the 4th wall is broken from time to time with irreverence. In other words, the DeadPool movies don't take themselves too seriously. That appeals to me. As for the social aspect of why hungry audiences gobble up this tripe as quickly as Hollywood can churn it out is anybody's guess and here's mine. You live vicariously for the escape for 2 plus hours as you long to forget yourself and your society of hollow, mindless consumerism and its vapid celebrity worship. 
But I'll go no further with that since ameteur anthropology is best administered in very small doses.",5,3,5,28 July 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Typical overproduced Hollywood crap
","Move along, folks. Absolutely nothing new here. They keep cranking out these clichés month after month. Big names with even bigger clichés. You deserve better films... or do you? I know I do. The opening was interesting with the Egyptian aspect, it really had my attention. I started losing interest with that absolutely awful scene where Xavier stammered and stuttered like a little school boy in the office of his CIA lady-crush.I nearly lost my dinner. I think the big stars go for making these things obviously for the huge payday they reap but I think pretending to be a super-hero appeals to their enormous egos, which most of them seem adept at concealing.",1,5,20,8 June 2016
The King," Ben Mendelsohn draws us in...
","Mendelsohn draws us in so subtly. The context of that lost father and son relationship is fleshed out perfectly in a form we have been telling each other since language was a skill for us.. The hook is set.
Familiar but satisfying ground perfectly played. The familiar is made new! ChaIamet, with his outright hostility to his father in his deathbed shows us the second side of this broken relationship. It renders depth and provides doubt.
I gained new respect for Robert Pattinson as he shows movie goers that small roles can be memorable. His portrayal of the French Prince was a revelation to me. It's the first time I've seen him become a character. He rendered his French Accent like a fish breathes water.
I might seem a bit too focused on teh
Joel Edgerton revealed a perfect English Accent and was a huge part of every scene he was in, whether or not he spoke. Not many can pull that off.
I might seem a bit too focused on the accents but they matter. After seeing Brad Pitt and slew of other A List actors mangle British accents, I like them well done.
A movie that will surprise many.",8,4,8,1 November 2019
