Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant Work By Tarantino
","I eagerly watched Kill Bill: Volume 2 this afternoon and when I left, I knew that Quentin never fails to please the audience. A continuation to the so-called 'pretty much all fighting yet great' first volume, Volume 2 presents the elements of a true classic with the style of Quentin Tarantino. Characters, plot, conflict, and the seek for revenge build to remarkable levels. Although some people argue that the fight scenes are not as long or gory as Volume 1 presents them, they are just as great, if not better. What impressed me most was how Tarantino brought ideas given earlier on in the film BACK towards the deaths of specifically Elle and Bill (yeah, they die in case you didn't predict it by some chance). Tarantino brings his incredible characters to life. My favorites were Pai Mei, with his signature beard wave, and Elle Driver, who, with all other characters, did a fantastic job. My rating: 10/10",10,0,1,18 April 2004
