The Ring," A must for any true horror fan
",I'm gonna make this short and sweet. The Ring has the 3 best traits a horror movie can have:1. Makes you jump halfway out of your seat without relying on 'cheap' scares.2. Maintained a creepy atmosphere throughout the entire film.3. Had me unnerved for *hours* after I saw it.I can think of no greater compliments.,9,0,0,11 November 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," A solid sequel that adds depth to the title character
","The Bourne Identity showed a man on the run from an enemy he couldn't identify. It showed what that man was capable of when pressed, and the lengths he would go to for survival. It was interesting stuff, and Matt Damon played it beautifully. You got the sense that a very dangerous man was hidden behind that stony mask, though you only caught glimpses of it when things went sour.This time out, we get to see what Bourne is capable of when he's just plain p****d off. Here is a character much more parallel to the one presented in the novels, a much more ruthless and imposing figure who will stop at nothing to accomplish an objective. This is Bourne as he should be: a very dangerous man indeed.That's not to say that the sequel is better than the original. In fact, in most ways it's a tie. Excellent fight choreography (though we don't get to see much of it in this film), incredible car chases, and bits of edge-of-the-seat suspense are showcased in both. Personally, I give The Bourne Identity a slight edge thanks to the freshness of the storyline and the more coherent action sequences.An 8 out of 10 movie that I give a 7 because of the much overused 'frantic' fight scenes.Note to Hollywood: stop filming hand-to-hand fights by hanging a camcorder between the two combatants to make us feel like we are actually there. It's a movie. Let us watch it.",7,0,1,2 August 2004
