Source Code," Classic Scifi
","May be spoilers below Wow... amazing movie and classic scifi. Everything about this movie was very well done. At only 90 minutes its short, but everything is very tight.My wife had a hard time understanding the movie at first because it is almost completely told from the main characters point of view. There is not intro or build up as some movies do. The movie simply starts and you have no idea what is going on because the main character, played by Jake, also has no idea what is going on.As Jake figures things out more of the plot presents itself. I can see how some people would not like this, you will be confused at first. But as a scifi fan I was able to figure out what was going on rather early which allowed me to really enjoy how the story was told in the movie.All in all you should see this movie. It reminded me of a very good TNG episode in the way it was told.",10,0,2,16 April 2011
Underworld," Great idea little Plot
",Why does it seem like the entire plot to this movie was writen on the back of a napkin. One day the guys who wrote the film must have been like wouldn't it be cool to do Romeo and Juliet with Vampires and guns. And that pretty much sums up the whole plot. Such a waste of a good idea. This movie could have been so much more...,5,0,0,20 September 2003
Terminator Salvation," OK film... but the ending killed it.
","Spoiler Warning This movie had so much potential, and actually did some things well, but then the ending ruined it. First I think Marcus as the main character really worked well. I enjoyed getting to know his character, and I felt many of the early scenes did it well. I also liked how he was confused but clearly very bright and knew what to do. I also liked the later scenes where he questioned what he was somewhat and eventually rejected what he learned.John Conner on the other hand was just a (they made me delete the word here)in the entire movie. It was clear the movie was never supposed to be about him and when Bale forced the issue all we got was crap. Then the ending was just awful. Spoiler ahead â€“ When Marcus chose to give up his life for John I was just wanted to walk out. What an awful ending. I mean I expected Marcus to die, and I am OK with that but not to save Conner. He does not deserve to be saved in this movie. I would rather see two more movies with Marcus and very little John.",2,1,4,26 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good, but there were a few problems
","Overall I though AOTC was an excellent film, much better then the first film and easily on par with the other 3 Star Wars films. The ending sequences were some of the best, and most entertaining of any movie I have seen. The storm trooper drop ships, and that entire battle, reminded me of Black Hawk Down. In fact I like how the storm troopers in ATOC seem much more like a cohesive military force.The main problem I had with ATOC was the entire romance between Anakin and Amidala. The dialogue was terrible, so bad that I could not watch what was going on at times. There was just no chemistry between them. The entire relationship, from Amidala's, point of view was completely unbelievable and entirely too forced.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Good actiom... no plot
","The Matrix reloaded. it can basically be summed up as good action sequences and no plot. Much like most other action moves that come out today. Now don't get me wrong the action sequences were some of the best I have seen, however that was all there really was.The movie basically said the same thing over and over again. There is no such thing as choice. We are all driven by fate. Only Neo may or may not have the capability to grow beyond fate and become in control of his own choices.  It seems like a good idea except that they kept telling us this over and over again.The Architect for example basically said nothing we did not already know or could have figured out. He just used a lot of big words so it he would sound intelligent. In fact that's pretty much what everyone else did too. They dragged out two word concepts (no choice) into crappy monologues.I was very disappointed in the plot of this movie. It was very thin and showed little real creativity. Go see this movie. but be warned it might suck.",5,0,0,16 May 2003
