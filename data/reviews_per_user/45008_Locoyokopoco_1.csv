Sucker Punch," A Trip!
","Sucker Punch is an intense journey in which you already know what's in- store for you at the end. It provides you with all the tools you need to begin your trip. Your imagination is the only obstacle in the path that sets you toward the inevitable finale. Bliss becomes the art that transpires the woeful reality. Regrets give you the strength to fight. Fight, for a greater purpose. But all good things must come to an end, and as end draws near, you let go of the regrets. The regrets that flow alongside you, until you let go, for something only bigger than yourself. All bad beginnings must have good ending. To have arrived at the end, where it all began.Snyder has really outdone himself on this one.PS: Pay close attention to the beginning of the film where Baby Doll first enters the asylum. You'll notice that she passes by 'The Boss' with the lighter (fire), then Blue's office with the map, then the kitchen with the knife, followed by Blue with the key on his neck, and finally Baby Doll herself. Very clever way of foreshadowing.",10,1,2,5 February 2012
