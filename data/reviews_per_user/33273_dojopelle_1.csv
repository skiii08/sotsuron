United 93," Trashcan movie
","Well, if this film wasn't based on a tragedy I wouldn't spare on my disappointment on this movie.You can tell this is a low budget movie by the actors and the whole scenery. You don't get any real answers to the happening itself. At least not more than you already know from watching the news. The director is doing his best to make the movie a good drama but its really just stupid and tasteless. When you see the families of the victims in the plane talking on the phone there is always a bunch of children somewhere just to emphasize the tragedy. The movie consists of phone calls and tears and closeups on babies. This is not a 'hey Americans are the greatest' movie and that is good but the director doesn't make you feel as upset as you would have if this movie was made by someone more skillful. You get the feeling that the director wants to make it a movie but halfway into the movie its just stalling. Nothing happens but people making phone calls. This movie shouldn't have been released or at least 30 minutes shorter. Go buy candy for your money instead of spending it on this crap!",1,36,99,26 April 2006
