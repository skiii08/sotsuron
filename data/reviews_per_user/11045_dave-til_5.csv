The Blair Witch Project," SAVE ME
","I saw this film for nothing and i still felt ripped off at the end.  I just wish I could think of a way of turning a bag of pants into loads of money. It's really hard to find any words to say how bad this film is.  I gather it's meant to be scary or spooky.  Well Big Bird has got more tension in his alphabet song than the Blair Witch. How it worked for so many people, i do'nt know.  It's a while since i've seen the film, so facts may be wrong but i'm not going to watch it again to correct them. Lets just say something like this did happen.  You'd be up and out of that wood before you could say brown trousers.  It's not something you'd stay for if you were actually there.  Also when you're really scared, it's always the same is'nt it.  Your camera sticks.  It happens to me all the time. Please save me from these pointless films. Just don't spend your time getting involved with this garbage.  Instead, watch the next one, where all the English politicians are chased round London by the Prime Ministers wife in 'Blair Witch, the Downing Street Dragon'",1,12,22,18 January 2003
The Others," Gripping
","This is probably one of the best films i have seen for quite a while. I was very surprised to see Eric Sykes in the film and he did quite well in the small part he had. But Nicole Kidman was outstanding and the two children excelled, and i don't think i have ever been so engrossed in the final 20 minutes of a film.It's just one of those films you want to talk about for ages after.  If there is one fault, it is the part half way through when Christopher Eccleston appears as Kidmans husband.  A bit pointless and they could have changed that part of the story a little.Apart from that, a great film and that should have been Kidmans OSCAR nomination. I bet you jump at the wardrobe bit.",9,0,0,22 July 2002
The Exorcist," Do not bother
","This film is not in the least bit frightening.  There is a slight chance it was in the early 70's but that was because the horrors of Rikky Lake had'nt been revealed.  An English film critic (Mark Kermode) thinks this is the best film ever made but he also thinks Elvis is the greatest actor?????  I expected great things from this but after an hour, i really struggled to stay awake.  Really, really slow.  It may just be worth a watch at home if someone has tied you to the floor and stuck your eyelids open but other than that, avoid it like the plague.  Not quite as funny as evil dead 2 but it comes close.",2,3,14,23 August 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," Class. You need know, no more
","Simply the best film i have ever seen.  Every cast member is perfect, the plot is faultless and the acting, (especially from Stewart, is unbeatable). I think, that in the 56 years since this film was made, only The Shawshank Redemption has come close(and extremely close at that) to equalling this wonderful film.Some people have given this film 1 out of 10, but they are due to be released quite soon.If you have never seen this film, do so, with no interruptions.  It is nothing less than utter class.",10,0,3,12 July 2002
The Matrix," PLEASE RETIRE NOW KEANU.
","Keanu Reeves.  What the hell are you doing, continuing to act.  GO AWAY, YOU HAVE NO TALENT.  The Matrix has got to be one of the worst film of today. Why do we need all these special effects, it's just not needed.  If somebody gets shot at, you don't need to see anything in slow motion.  Or if they are about to jump across a large gap, do i need the action to stop just so i can study their long jump technique, i don't think so.  Answering the phone to transport themselves to another place.  OH PLEASE.  I know i am in the minority but one day this film WILL be forgoten about because basically it's toss.  Keanu - retire now and go and haunt someone else for a change.",2,8,18,21 December 2002
