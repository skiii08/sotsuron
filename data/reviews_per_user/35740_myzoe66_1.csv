Marie Antoinette," Trivial
","Very disappointing. I was looking forward to this supposed new and fresh look at the making of - or not trying to make - a period piece. Great idea, bad execution. Forget about the historical inaccuracies and the complete disregard for the political context, the screenplay is simply bad. Poorly written dialog, undeveloped characters, all in all a superficial view of a group of people that presented an incredible rich source of material. While Kirstin Dunst did her best, she was miscast for the very young version of MA and Jason Schwartzman is just totally out of place. Yes, I know, King Louis XVI was supposed to have been only interested in food and hunting, rather inhibited and boring and uninterested in his wife and most other things. But as an actor, you need to make an effort in getting these traits across rather than just minimize your engagement and make everybody think you stink.",4,3,8,18 October 2006
