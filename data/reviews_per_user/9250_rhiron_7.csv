Skyfall," Old Dog, New Tricks
","At the end of the day, liking 'Skyfall' depends on whether you are a Bond fan. If you like mindless mayhem and some interesting characters, like the good old days of 007, then this film is for you.My own sister says that this is the first Bond film that she has really enjoyed since Roger Moore hung up his shoulder holster after 'A View To A Kill' (1985). Even this film's villain looks creepily like Christopher Walken's Max Zorin...Those who knock 'Skyfall' (and I haven't found very many of them), surely can't deny that Adele provides one of the best Bond songs ever, closely recalling Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' and Tina Turner's 'GoldenEye' with her powerful vocals that are so Bondian and right for the franchise's Golden Anniversary. The fact that it was being played in every shop, supermarket and on the radio shows that it must have been good!Again, yes, the plot doesn't make tons of sense if you look at it practically, but this is James Bond - he's had fights in hollowed-out volcanoes and in outer-space in the past!! It's not John le Carre and the escapism of it is what has made Bond endurable for all these years. So just sit back and enjoy, rather than being lost in a convoluted plot!Javier Bardem makes a superb villain, bringing back to the series the sense of Blofeld or Scaramanga alive and at play in the world of politics, business, culture and intrigue. He does some pretty incredible things, which you could either take as an outrageous shoe-horning in of plot elements, or actually the machinations of an incredible vindictive schemer. He's definitely not as lukewarm as Mathieu Amalric from the previous film!Dame Judi Dench gives one of her best performances as 007's boss, 'M' and is, indeed, a central figure in the plot, thus repeating the excellent decision made at the outset of Daniel Craig's assumption of the Bond role to make 'M' more important. There is certainly no shortage of references to the mother-son-style relationship between the two characters. And, also, it is interesting to see Dench paired up with another stalwart British actor: Albert Finney.Naturally, as with 'Die Another Day' (2002) having celebrated the Fortieth Anniversary of the cinematic Bond, there are some classic Bond elements. The Aston Martin DB5 is a courageous warrior in itself once again here, there are some very beautiful women at points, the exotic locations and the ones closer to home are gorgeous, the villain has an incredible lair, and the classic 'Goldfinger'-esque sheen as showcased in 'Casino Royale' (2006) is back.In fact, this film may be Bond's latest 'Goldfinger', just as 'GoldenEye' (1995) was to Pierce Brosnan.The action and stunts here work to advance the plot rather than being mere spectacle. Although, of course, there is one stunt in particular that is an homage to the epic flipping of an 18-wheeler truck in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). A hint that the producers have been trying to lure Christopher Nolan into the franchise, or an affectionate affirmation that the producers are taking as much inspiration from him as he has from them, perhaps?At the end of the day, this is the highest grossing Bond film - ever - and there is a reason why. The old sparkle is back, but with a few new elements sprinkled in here and there. And, who knows, with the rights to Blofeld and SPECTRE now held by the official Bond movie-makers, 007 aficionados may be in store for a very interesting set of new adventures...",9,1,5,23 November 2013
Alien," A pleasant surprise
","I went into 'Alien' expecting a terrible, low-budget space-age horror film in the form of 'Jason X'. How wrong I was!A friend introduced me to the 'Alien' series after I loaned him 'The Omen' franchise and, while I watched it mainly as a gesture, I discovered that this is truly an awesome film. And the fact is that, even for others out there like me who probably aren't too keen on sci-fi films, this does not really strike you as one. Indeed, chances are that through things like 'Family Guy', 'South Park' and 'The Simpsons', you've probably seen reworked scenes from 'Alien' already!!!For one thing, the cast is excellent. Sigourney Weaver broke into mainstream films here, John Hurt got the most memorable scene, even Yaphet Kotto who played Bond villain, Dr. Kananga in 'Live And Let Die' (1973), and Ian Holm in a particularly memorable turn early on in his film career. And, for horror aficionados, Veronica Cartwright, who made her debut in Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' (1963) and appeared in the disturbing remake of 'Invasion of The Body Snatchers' (1978), gets a key role here. As does a cool little cat named Jones. Oh, and don't forget 'Mother'.The model work, set design, costumes and even all the space-style gobbledegook that would usually put you to sleep - it's all great. And did I mention that the legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith provided the musical score? To savour this film, all you really need to be is a fan of horror and/or action films, or just an adventurous audience member.So this really was a pleasant surprise for someone who's proud to admit that he was wrong. I even have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' DVD set because of this film and its sequel 'Aliens' (1986). I can really recommend this set of DVDs (or Blu-Ray, if you prefer), because it includes both the theatrical version and the Director's Cut, the latter of which includes so much stuff that wouldn't have appeared in the cinema and adds to the plot.If in doubt, read some of the other reviews. Hopefully there are other people like me who have been turned by Ridley Scott's genius! Sit back and enjoy a different kind of classic!!",8,0,1,6 November 2013
Aliens," For once, a sequel worthy of the original!
","Usually, I don't enjoy sci-fi, but this and 'Alien' (1979) are the exceptions.I watched 'Aliens' in a state of apprehension. Seven years between the original and a sequel (especially a sequel starring one of the original cast members) can be a very long time. A long time for things to go wrong. And this was, perhaps, what was going through the minds of executives at Twentieth Century Fox when they green-lighted James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's masterful horror film set in space.If anything, if you're going in to 'Aliens' blind or having already watched 'Alien', you're in for an interesting sequence of events.From the beginning, it's very clear that, as an audience member, you're getting a rare treat, not just in terms of horror or action -- literally in terms of any genre of cinema. You are getting a proper sequel!But, a sequel that establishes its own rules.Sigourney Weaver was feisty and held her own in 'Alien', but here she becomes a pure bad-ass! If you have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' set, you can see from the Director's Cut that her character, Ellen Ripley has a lot of issues going on. The perfect early example of a conflicted, brave and determined heroine. The theatrical release gets these things across well, too. As does the fact that Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance -- in a time when horror/action flicks were largely denied such honours. Forget Lara Croft - here's the real deal!But it's in Ripley's interaction with Carrie Henn's character, Newt and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks that the film develops its pathos. A chance for redemption and a life beyond being terrorised by a load of slimy space monsters.Not to give too much away, but 'Aliens' is, in an odd way, drawn from similar threads as 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and 'The Lost World' (1997). It's distinct from those films, obviously, but the gung-ho element of an overpowered military force confronting a swarm of devilishly sly and powerful creatures rings similar bells. For die-hard fans of the 'Alien' franchise (or even of films in general), they will know what I am saying when I mention that 'Aliens' also shares key links with Tim Burton's original 'Batman' (1989), from its design to its filming.There's a really great and touching story here, though, which develops James Cameron as the worthy successor (perhaps even an equal) to Ridley Scott himself in terms of developing the original ideas of Scott and his crew. Incidentally, this is the only one of James Cameron's films that I have seen and enjoyed.Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton in some of their best known and pervasive film roles are all superb and a perfect match for the extremely well cast original film. Goldstein, in particular, has the ballsy attitude of Grace Jones, whilst still remaining a likable character, and Paxton steals some of the film's best dialogue. Even Jones the cat returns!For once, a sequel that is just as (if not more) enjoyable and hard- hitting as the original. If I had to raise a qualm with the film, it is that the 'Alien' series went into serious decline after this instalment. And, even though I've seen the other sequels, I prefer to accept things as they happened here as rote!!",8,1,1,6 November 2013
Quantum of Solace," 'When You Can't Tell Your Friends from Your Enemies, It's Time to Leave!'
","The first time I watched 'Quantum of Solace', I was nonplussed.The promise of a 007 adventure being a direct sequel to the previous instalment was, for this franchise, thrilling and unusual. The last time one adventure was something of a sequel to the last (i.e. Diamonds Are Forever (1971)), things went terribly wrong, even slipping into inexcusable tacky campiness.Thankfully, 'Quantum of Solace' does not get things quite that wrong, but it is hardly a credit to the film that gave birth to it, 'Casino Royale' (2006).The teaser trailers were full of the promise of a tense semi-political action film, unlike anything seen in the Bond canon before. It seemed that the best thing about the film was, indeed, the vagueness of the trailers, which created such an intensity and anticipation that made this a must-see film. But, running at a shorter length than 'Dr. No' (1962), this film left a lot to be desired.Daniel Craig, however, was again on form with a dark, edgy and human portrayal of Bond - the Bond of the novels, devoid of his dependence on Q-Branch and cheesy one-liners, even though Craig does have some briefly (and oddly) humorous, if not hysterical, lines dotted around the place.The film, as said, should have been the successful second chapter to 'Casino Royale', but ended up detracting from that film. Scenes in which the writers clearly intended Bond to be bitter about his tragically lost love, Vesper Lynd, instead convey denial and ignorance on Bond's part - almost as if the writers had forgotten the subtle intricacies of the previous adventure, which they had also scripted!The editing is also awful, making the film almost un-watchable as Marc Forster takes a hand-held camera to most scenes and chops and changes between shots so much that it is confusing as to what is happening on screen. In fact, the pre-credits car chase is filled with so many references to previous Bond car chases (mostly those conducted in a Lotus Esprit or a Citroen 2CV) that it is blatantly clear how Forster had no experience directing an action flick - he simply drew on the inspiration of his predecessors to craft a half-decent Bond film. Dialogue scenes also suffer incredibly from this tendency to imitate the Bourne films and, whilst Bourne can carry it off by hosting quite understandable exposition scenes, 'Quantum' instead introduces plot points and discusses complicated-sounding (but actually quite straightforward) things simply, it seems, to confuse the audience.Olga Kurylenko, in what has become one of her most mentioned roles, is an intriguing ally to 007 and, whilst it would be interesting to see her in future Bond entries, behaving as an even more capable ally to Bond, her involvement here is simply the result of an unnecessary sub-plot involving Bolivian water supplies, an assassination that happened too long ago to care about, and a villain that Bond isn't even really concerned with.Said villain is played by Mathieu Amalric, who can be summed as being a creepy French sexual deviant. Talk about stereotyping!And poor Gemma Arterton, whilst thankful for her role in the film, is only seen fleetingly before embarking on one of the worst homages to a previous Bond film seen in any 007 adventure.Only Judi Dench really gets to sink her teeth into her role, having some incredible scenes alongside Craig and a certain Bill Tanner, now played by Rory Kinnear. Again, she's full of swearing and her trust in 007 is waning (again), but it's so much fun to watch!In fact, the only weak point of 'M' in this film is that she has been transplanted from Peter Lamont's conservative MI6 HQ into Dennis Gassner's ultramodern typical Bond villain-style lair which, although an interesting twist, is never explained. How could MI6 completely redesign and relocate their London offices from Vauxhall Cross to the Barbican in the space of the few hours that separate this from the previous film?!I'm not saying that this is a bad film, or even a bad sequel, but it was clear to me, after watching this that, after having led the field back through the Sixties and Seventies, 007 was slipping back into becoming an old man redundant in the modern world and that all the lessons learnt in making 'Casino Royale' had been forgotten. Back to the Pierce Brosnan days of tying together set pieces purely for the sake of doing so, whilst sacrificing interesting pieces of plot!Still good for an occasional watch, though!",6,0,1,23 November 2013
The Dark Knight," You've Changed Things...Forever...
","There are very few people I've met who did not like 'The Dark Knight' (2008). They tend to dislike the fact that it is so rooted in reality but, for me, when compared with how outrageous the Batman mythos can get, this is a major plus that wins this film 10 out of 10 stars.Let's start off with the best: Heath Ledger, whilst different as The Joker, incorporates so much from the Batman comics character into his performance that, even though he's punk-ish and diverse in the role, I totally bought him as being an updated version of The Clown Prince of Crime. His untimely death cheated the cinema of an up-and-coming name, but this is such a great legacy for him to leave behind. This is not to say that I prefer him over Jack Nicholson, or vice versa. What Nicholson did in 'Batman' (1989) was loyal and apt, for that film. But this film charts dangerous characters in a dangerous world that has clearly changed since Tim Burton's first 'Batman' opus and Nolan proves that, whilst the 'old' Batman films may have been made for sheer entertainment value, he is trying to convey a message to his audience. Whether you buy that message or not is all a matter of interpretation.The return to Chicago as the main spread of Gotham City was a fantastic idea and, even though I miss some of the landmarks of the previous film (particularly Wayne Tower), I accept why Nolan changed pace with this sequel and, hey, at least the monorail makes a discreet return in some scenes here!The use of locations is absolutely stunning. I am not sure if it was Nolan's filming style or the fact that this film did things that seemed so new in an age where everything seems to have already been done, but there are plenty of memorable stunts and dialogue sequences here.Unlike many, I also enjoyed the character of Rachel Dawes and, whilst I accept that Katie Holmes was a little inexperienced in 'Batman Begins' (2005) her character wasn't used to being confronted by crooks quite as freaky as The Scarecrow, was she? Holmes' replacement here by Maggie Gyllenhaal, albeit complicating the continuity between the two films slightly, seems quite appropriate. Gyllenhaal is more convincing in her work with both Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger, but I agree that she is heartless and ungrateful to Christian Bale's Batman/Bruce Wayne. But, in many ways, that adds to the poignancy of both this film and its sequel.Moving along to Harvey Dent, you may be a Billy Dee Williams fan or a Tommy Lee Jones person, but you cannot deny that Aaron Eckhart gives equal consideration to both Dent and his twisted alter-ego, Harvey 'Two- Face'. In fact, I think that Harvey and Two-Face have rarely been adapted in a better way, with one of the other great interpretations being 'Two-Face Parts I & II' from 'Batman: The Animated Series'. But this is the first live-action depiction of the character/s to really come through in showing both of them, although I would have liked Two- Face to be carried over into another sequel.But we must not sideline Batman/Bruce Wayne, must we? Christian Bale continues to be one of the better performers to play Batman, but I know that his gravelly Batman voice has irritated many. Sure, Bale's Batman voice is sometimes difficult to understand on a first viewing and is certainly hilarious when taken in isolation or imitated on youtube but, if Bruce Wayne didn't disguise his voice, it would be even more obvious that he was Batman, wouldn't it?Michael Caine again lends warmth and even more depth to his depiction of Alfred Pennyworth, whilst Morgan Freeman remains charming and refreshing as Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman is given quite a wedge of the plot himself and it is interesting to see that, whilst other actors to portray Jim Gordon were restricted in what the character could do, he undertakes almost as much as the Dark Knight himself!One other character from the previous film makes a playful (and often overlooked) return just after The Joker's opening bank robbery, but it is awesome to see that Nolan didn't just shoot the scene using a stuntman.And the Batmobile and its successor remain the stars of the gadgetry rolled out for this instalment, especially in a chase scene that will literally knock your socks off. In the gadgets section, however, there is a new sonar toy that can be disorienting to audiences on the first few viewings of the film but, as you get used to it, it's not a lot of trouble at all.Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard deliver a tense and exciting score that showcases The Joker's chaotic new theme, whilst developing the themes for Batman and Bruce Wayne's personal life as introduced in the previous film.On that note, even though viewing 'Batman Begins' isn't essential viewing for this instalment, it has surprised me how many people were unaware of it before seeing this film. It's okay to miss out 'Batman Begins' here but, if you're intending to watch 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012), you had best watch 'Batman Begins' first, as you will be very lost when it comes to understanding the final instalment!Anyway, now that we've got all of that sorted, sit back and enjoy a film that undoubtedly is a modern classic that raised the bar not only for comic book films, but continues to serve as a massive inspiration in many other areas (i.e. 'Sherlock', 'The Avengers', 'Skyfall', etc.)!",10,0,1,8 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Incredible, but questionable
","At the time of 'The Dark Knight' (2008), it was reported that future Batman sequels would descend further into fantasy and, thus, further away from Christopher Nolan's original intention to adapt Batman as closely to reality as possible.'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) is certainly the most fantasy-based of his Batman films, sometimes raising incredible plot holes and questions like: how did Batsy get the Bat over to John Blake's location without alerting the criminals attacking Blake? And: how did Bane know where the super-secret Applied Sciences Division was or that it was actually under Wayne Enterprises at all? And: with Commissioner Gordon apparently cleaning up Gotham's streets so well, how did Bane's plan go unnoticed for so long?!But, all in all, given reports that Nolan needed to feel invested in a third and final Batman film in order to make it happen, especially after he raised the bar so dramatically with 'The Dark Knight', 'Rises' is still very good -- albeit probably a little over-hyped compared to its stunning, character-driven predecessor.The eight-year fictional gap between films shows us Bruce Wayne in his most incredible state -- a fallen and broken warrior who builds himself back up into the hero that we all know and love. If you sense similarities to Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns', then they are entirely intentional.Christian Bale and Michael Caine again prove themselves to be great collaborators, whilst Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are given substantially more to do (particularly the former), effectively taking Caine's place in the second half of the film. Newcomers Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also most welcome, despite the fact that their casting (particularly Cotillard's) seems primarily based on their participation in 'Inception' (2010).And, for fans of Nolan's Bat films, a cameo or nod is made to practically all of the trilogy's most important characters. Alas, of course, except one -- the one who raised the bar for on-screen villains everywhere. I, too, pondered why some reference was not made to The Joker, until I realised that, in the wake of the tragic and senseless violence in Colorado, a society will usually strive to put the acts of a maniac behind them. It only seems fitting that The Joker is probably locked away in Arkham, whilst Gotham tries desperately to forget him.And that leads us quite fittingly to one of the messages of this film. The heroic acts of The Batman and his allies get honoured, whilst all those bad guys, even though they are fun to watch, are a nightmare to know! A recurring theme in this series is that anyone can be a hero and that, although this is the last of the Nolan Batman films, the Dark Knight will continue to serve as an inspiration, not merely to fictional Gothamites, but to real people everywhere, even though Nolan has retired his version of the character.The Bat is a bit far-fetched and, even though The Tumbler appears, the Batmobile does not. There's a welcome return from the Batpod alongside some old and new gadgetry, and I suppose it should be re-branded as the Catpod after its use in this film!On that note, Anne Hathaway is refreshingly neat and effective as the dark and feisty Selina Kyle. After the horrors of Halle Berry's stab at the part (and I mean stab), Hathaway returns the character to a more human element closer to the character's roots. Although not christened as 'Catwoman' as such, she double-crosses the Dark Knight to defend herself, she is finally shown to be a cat burglar (something other interpretations have neglected) and Hathaway proves that, despite the absence of the whip, Selina still has plenty of feline wiles to make her a fascinating character.Tom Hardy's Bane is a massive improvement over the mute brute of 'Batman & Robin' (1997), but his voice was a nightmare to understand in the cinema which, of course, twisted the focus even more in Hathaway's favour. His plan, though even more far-fetched than those of Ra's al Ghul and The Joker, is still quite exciting, with several sequences depicting Gotham as an American-based Iraq or Revolutionary France, set against Bane's rallying war cries and Hans Zimmer's gripping score, lending genuine tension and excitement to the proceedings, coupled with an obvious (even if it was unintended) political message.Fans of the Nolan trilogy will be rewarded with some interesting revelations that help to bring the series to a satisfactory close, whilst the series regulars still shine. However, it is a shame to consider that this is the final Nolan Batman film, even though there are so many characters out there that could still be adapted in a realistic or, as this film indicates, a semi-realistic light. It is also a shame that Nolan did not return to Chicago, given its status as the bedrock of Gotham City in the first two films, but his style is still evidently there. At least Wayne Manor, the Batcave and the Batbunker return, albeit be prepared for some visual changes!If it helps, the first half of the film, up until Bane truly takes control as the villain of the piece, feels unnervingly like 'The Dark Knight', albeit without either The Joker or Harvey Dent and, as the film progresses, it churns in a healthy amount of 'Batman Begins' (2005) to bring this trilogy full circle.A fantastic swan song for the Nolan/Bale alliance, even if some areas aren't clarified as well as in previous instalments!",7,0,2,7 November 2013
Casino Royale," 'I'm The Money!'
","You certainly are 'Casino Royale'!!A perfect reboot, the film takes the inadequacies of the original Bond series (fun though it was) and brings 007 into the Twenty-First Century!Yes, for Fleming die-hards, it would have been great to see a vintage Bond adventure with old 1950s cars, styles, mannerisms and locations, but the production costs would have soared and the producers would still have been left with the question of how to repair the franchise after the frivolous excesses of 'Die Another Day' (2002).This way, rebooting the franchise allowed the film-makers some artistic licence over Fleming's original (and probably most celebrated) Bond novel. Events taken from the novel are ramped up a bit to appeal to modern audiences (i.e. changing Soviet agents into terrorist cells, switching from chemin de fer to Texas Hold 'Em Poker, the climax in Venice) and others are added in afresh, but the essence of the novel is there.Even though this was sold as a more realistic Bond film, 007 still drives a sporty new Aston Martin DBS; travels to exotic locations such as Nassau, Miami and Montenegro; dresses suavely, and is a killer with most of the ladies.One lady in particular, Dame Judi Dench, is the only obvious reminder of the previous twenty Bond films (or at least Pierce Brosnan's entries), but even she is altered from her previous form, making her more aggressive and giving her a personal life this time around. A new 'M' (in a way) for a new James Bond. She even starts to sympathise with the new and rebellious 007 towards the end of the film...But, 007 is also more human here, despite being Fleming's cold government-sanctioned killer who dislikes his job, but is good at it.Without a doubt, beautiful French actress, Eva Green is the belle of the ball. Just as the other elements of the novel have been updated, so has the bewitching Vesper Lynd. Whereas previous Bond Girls have claimed to be 'the female 007', Vesper is James Bond's intellectual equal, as accustomed to reading people as he is. Rather than being an MI6 operative, she is a Treasury official and highly sceptical of Bond's uncontrollable ways, pinning down his weaknesses in seconds. However, there is a deeply touching story here, magnified beyond Fleming's concept of Vesper by Green's perceptive and honest performance, by which she lights up the screen whenever she appears on it.The villain, Le Chiffre has previously been portrayed by the great actors Peter Lorre and Orson Welles. However, for his performance as the disfigured, cold, ruthless and sometimes even a little humorous banker to the world's terrorists, Dutch actor, Mads Mikkelsen has become internationally renowned. He is supported (if that is possibly the word), by fellow Dutchman, Jesper Christensen, who plays an important role that hints back to the days of the shadowy SPECTRE organisation.The locations, pacing, action, dialogue - all are great, not least because this is the second Bond outing of Martin 'GoldenEye' Campbell, who once again invigorates audiences by introducing the latest incarnation of James Bond. But, this time, it is a James Bond who is earning his stripes and is walking a perilous tightrope between falling victim to his dangerous adversaries and being eaten alive by a Select Committee of MPs investigating the actions of MI6. And only by winning the trust of Dench's 'M' can he prove that he deserves to be on her team.'Casino Royale' also gradually reintroduces the elements that have always made Bond great from the beginning - from the action, the cars, the girls, the playboy lifestyle to the attitude, the shaken not stirred Vodka Martinis, the tuxedo and, of course, the James Bond Theme. This film strips it all back and then subtly reintroduces it all to show us what James Bond is really made of.Another modern classic that effectively merges the cinematic James Bond with his literary counterpart!",9,3,6,23 November 2013
