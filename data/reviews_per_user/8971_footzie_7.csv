The Blair Witch Project," Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?
","The Blair Witch Project is really about an animal. The kind that has wings. The one that immediately comes to mind is an awkward Turkey,  not fit for viewing or acceptable for Thanksgiving Dinner. Obviously, cineastes find more to this film than I. I'll stick to the cranberries and pass the bird.",1,1,4,6 September 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," A great American film.
","Grapes Of Wrath is utterly faithful to John Steinbeck's sad document of Dust Bowl Okies seeking a way to survive. The cast is perfect, the direction the great achievement of John Ford's career, and the photography a work of art. Although Citizen Kane is generally acknowledged to be the greatest of American films, Grapes of Wrath is right up their nipping at its heels. No one who takes film as a serious medium of expression should fail to experience this work.",10,1,4,9 July 1999
Forrest Gump," Please....
","This film is a major piece of drivel. Its popularity is an alarming sign of the 'dumbing down' of art, thought, taste and education. It is no wonder that it made many millions and is so well loved. At least it was Tom Hanks who made the millions and not Charlton Heston. Harrumph!!!!!",Null,0,2,22 August 1999
Cast Away," Hanks needs better material
","Tom Hanks is fine in Cast Away. It's too bad the script is another of Zemeckis's uplifting pieces of puffery.Hanks does a fine job in the center of the film, the portion devoted to his stranding on an island, with little hope of return to civilization. Here the character is well drawn and his strength of determination is admirable. It is when he is rescued that the film falls apart. Instead of all the product pushing of Fed-Ex and his evident affection for those responsible for the loss of a large chunk of his life, it would be a great deal more satisfying to see him getting a high powered lawyer to sue the blazes out of them. It is time for Hanks to stop being likeable and take the role of a thoroughly despicable character. He runs the risk of continuing to be the Jimmy Stewart of this generation. One of those was enough. No more treacle!",6,0,1,25 December 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Be quiet!!!!
","I loathed this movie. It's star Benigni, is like a wind-up Jerry Lewis doll on speed. I could not buy the idea that this very nice woman (who in fact is his wife in real life), would do anything but have him arrested for harassing her. His behavior at the Academy Awards is a very good preview for those who have not seen this film. If you thought he was cute and endearing, by all means see it. If you thought he should have been carted away and tranquilized, stay away.",4,2,5,12 July 1999
The Departed," Dreadful
","Here we go again. Another chapter in Scorsese's love affair with slimeballs. Whether it be Italian or Irish he has an unreasonable fascination for the genre.The central baddie is played by Jack Nicholson who does nothing but play Jack Nicholson. He chews every piece of scenery with a reprise of the malevolence he exhibited in 'The Shining'. You would think that a director with the skills of Scorsese could control him. But, perhaps he didn't want to do so. In any event, his performance is operatic and intolerable.Damon and De Caprio do well, as do Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, but not well enough to make sense or meaning of an atrocious script.Scorsese showed us that he can be skilled in material other than sewer trash, with 'The Age Of Innocence'. Please Martin, give this garbage a rest.",1,31,65,15 October 2006
Gladiator," Cash the check Russell and get on with it.
","Gladiator is Ridley Scott's attempt at a Quo Vadis/Ben Hur for the year 2000. Scott has been responsible for some rather good films, i.e.Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise. He has also done some TV commercials that are dazzling. Gladiator is beautifully filmed, although the special effects are labored and somewhat annoying. It is basically a popcorn epic without a thought. What holds the film together is Russell Crowe's remarkable presence. Together with Ralph Fiennes he may be the most talented screen actor before the public today. The camera loves his face and the soundtrack his voice. Supporting his efforts is a cast of absolute perfection. Connie Nielsen as the quasi- love interest is not a great beauty, but is hypnotically interesting. Joaquin Phoenix as the resident 'mad hatter emperor' leaves no scenery unchewed in a sort of Freudian twist on the genre. They are backed by a veteran British cast of absolute perfection: Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, a bloated David Hemmings and the late Oliver Reed. What in the end makes the film come a cropper is dialogue from the screen writers that is utterly laughable. You won't be bored by the film, but I wish Russell would just cash the check, ( I hope it is a large one), and get on with his appropriate business of making first rate films that can make use of his enormous talent.",7,0,0,8 May 2000
