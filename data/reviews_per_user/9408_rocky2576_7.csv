E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My best movie ever
","What can I not say about this movie. This movie is awesome. I LOVED IT!!!! I was six years old when this movie came out and my father(Jose) took us to see the movie. It was the only movie my father ever took us to see. What is funny about that is that it took about 16 years to figure out why this was the only movie he ever took the family to see. My father always loved and believed in aliens. 16 years later I realized he took us to see this movie because it was about an alien from outer space. I remember the ending of the movie. As we were leaving I was crying so much. I asked my father is he coming back and he said yes he will. (He told me that so I can stop crying). The movie is a pure classic 80's movie. It takes me back to being young, playing with all the toys that were our there are the time, the music, the clothes. Ahhh Great. I LOVE E.T.",10,1,2,12 February 2005
Alexander," Bad movie.... good luck next time
","This movie was awful. I mean, if you want a brief (though not really brief) history of what Alexander did in his life, watch it. Otherwise... DO NOT! This was the first time I watched a movie in a theater and was dying. I could not wait to get out of there. I was growing impatient. I am very disappointed in Oliver Stone. I loved, LOVED all his movies up until now. The film shots were not realistic. Peter Jackson made his fight sequence look realistic with orcs and elves. However in this, where this story really did take place, a 10 year old with my sony dv camera could make the sequence look better. The dialogue was repetitive. Jolie always said the same think about herself. And the ending... what a cheap fast way to end the movie. THIS MOVIE WAS JUST BAD!!!",6,0,1,27 November 2004
Cloverfield," Oh man stay away from this one
","No....No....No.... I am so angry. I have never seen practically the whole theater full of people walk out of a movie so angry. This movie was horrible. The concept was a pretty good idea I guess, but the movie sucked. Okay so I waited 20 minutes in the beginning to see a whole bunch of people talking and drinking and seeing this guy behind the camera trying to hook up with this girl. And when the action really started, it was just like looking at a video of September 11th and the movie the mist. I could not believe J.J. It also seemed like the smaller creatures that would jump on people were the bugs stolen from Starship Troopers. Except that he made them smaller. Those small buts attacked like the bugs from the movie. And was J.J. serious by have that camera move so much. I mean yes I understand that we are suppose to be viewing the movie from the point of view of a guy who is running for his life but still!!!! After all, it is a movie, how are we suppose to follow what is going on when almost everything is blurry. Another thing, what the heck was up with that scene when they medics take the girl who was bitten behind the screen. Did she explode or did they shot her brains out. The movie sucked. I was very angry and disappointed. I know it was going to suck because it was rated pg-13 after all, but for it to suck that bad ....oh man. He should stick to the show lost and really get lost.",2,103,170,19 January 2008
The Mist," This movie proves why Stephen King is the master
","The movie was great!!!! When I heard this movie was going to come out I wanted to get the book and read it before I saw it since I know that books are always better then the movie. But after I saw the movie especially the ending, I'm glad I did not because I would have known how it ended. Even thougth I had an idea on how it would end, I was not 100% certain. At first when I saw the first monster attach the bag boy and I saw the special effect, I thought Oh no, not another bad Dreamcatcher bad special effects alien. But then when I saw the face on those mosquito and spiders, I was like cool!!! I loved this movie. I thought it was great. Yes one would say it had a lot of drag with all the talking, and yes maybe that's true, but still, the line in the movie was true, it shows how people react when put in that situation, when put in a position of having to decide 'what should I do?', a situation of fear. I was so hopeful when they got in the car and tried to get out of the mist. I so wanted them to see clear land. That is what was so shocking to me, I was expecting them be free from the mist. I was shocked that the old man and women want to kill themselves. I could not believe that the father would kill his own son who he is suppose to protect against anything. How dare he end it. How dare he not try. But yes I would suppose that once they saw that huge creature at the end that that would have seem like that was it... that was the end of the world. But to think that in the end, if he just would have waited one more day, or stayed at the mall the 4 would have lived. But no, now the people in the mall are going to live. Can you believe that? The women who left the store early on and the people in the store are going to live and the man with his son, the women, and the 2 old couple who fought for their lives died. That is not fair. I think that father is not going to live that long anyway. I'm sure the grief of killing them will cause him to take his own life. If he just would have waited!!! As I left the movie I was depressed. But yet still amazed that King had the mind to still think of all these ideas. That is why he is great. I loved the praying mantis.",10,2,6,9 December 2007
War of the Worlds," The movie was alright.. but not the greatest and here is why.....
","The movie was okay but not the greatest. Like everyone else, I loved the original. I went to see this version with the notion that it will be like the original except with a lot more special effects. However, I was a little disappointed. Number one, why did Steven Spielberg dress up Dakota like Drew Barrymore in by beloved movie of all time E.T., with that 79 style shirt with rainbow strips and fluffy jacket. Number two, if bacteria has been around for millions and millions of years, how did the aliens get to bury the machines on earth without dying. Number three, once the lighting hit the floor, everything went dead, the TV, phone, car, light. So how did the old guy in the intersection with the video camera (when the first machine rose near the church) have power to shoot the machine. The video camera should not be working. Number four, okay so you suck with the original a little bit, but the part where Ray had to kill Ogilvy was uncalled for. I mean yea, he had to be silenced so that he would not make noise, but come on, to kill him!!! I did not like that idea that the aliens buried the machines in the ground. It would have been a lot better if they came from outer space. Number five, I doubt very much that aliens foresaw the future in that humans would one day populate the earth. There is a line in which Ogilvy said 'It's an extermination.' Why would the aliens bury the machines to one day enter them to kill humans if they never even knew of their existence. Number six, did it not occur to anyone writing the script that Ray drove from NJ to somewhere upstate NY without stopping to get gas for the car even once. HA! When the hatch opened up in the end and the blood came out, why did it look orange. Come on in this day and age, you can make blood look so real... Just look at Dawn of the Dead =) Even thought I knew how the movie ended, it was kind of stupid to have Ray and his kids drive all over the east coast when the real lesson was to 'Stay in your basement and wait it out until the bacteria killed the aliens.' Do you know how many people would have lived. So, all in all, I was a bit disappointed with Steven's version. I expected more than this. I loved the original. Another reason why the original and classics should never be messed with or touched!!",7,1,4,2 July 2005
Hitch," Very good
","I love Will Smith. This movie was very surprising. Everyone who know me knows that I am the first to hate love sappy movies. However I decided to see this because it was filmed by my job. I liked this movie. Even if they did cut my scene out when I was standing across the street while Smith was catching a cab. They took a love sappy movie and made it into a really good funny movie. There were a lot of laughs here. And it was good that we were in a large theater to watch it. And see everyones reaction to the funny parts. Good lighting on trying to make NYC nice and clean. Do I consider it a movie to take a girlfriend during valentine's Day? Not really, but is is good for a few laughs. Good job Will.",8,6,12,12 February 2005
