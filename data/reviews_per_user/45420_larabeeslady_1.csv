The Ring," Way overrated
","It's minute after ponderous minute, stretching into hours, followed by perhaps 3 to 5 minutes of true creepiness near the very end. And I do mean creepy. But that's a long wait for the few minutes you get out of it. Lots of plot holes you can fly a Boeing through, lots of things set up and then never resolved or even slightly explained, heavy on unexplained symbolism...The list goes on and on. In the end, I was bored and confused, and one creepy scene just isn't enough to justify the string of clichÃ©s and 'atmosphere' you have to sit through. I'm glad I rented it because I'd have been highly annoyed to have shelled out the full price of a theater ticket for this.",2,1,2,24 December 2004
