Source Code," Source Code. What is Source Code?
","A mystery-thriller that starts off with a bang!. Source Code will keep you engaged from the moment it starts. You will have a lot of questions like:Why did the train explode? How did Colter Stevens (Jake Ghyllenhaal) survive after the explosion? Wait, what is Source Code? Why cant I get off my seat?All of your questions will be answered as the movie progresses and no plot-hole will be left unturned.Character Development:We have a twitchy Jake Ghyllenhaal who does justice to his character of an anxious soldier who wants answers, who wants to know why he's in a train, who doesn't recognise his face. He slowly understands that he is on a mission. Colter Stevens (Jake Ghyllenhaal) is a well developed character who has a lot of back story and reason to be in the movie and his back story makes you have a special bond with him.We have the girl next door Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) who doesn't have anything to do before the 2nd half of the movie. Although, they did need someone talking to the protagonist in the entire movie and the way the movie starts-off, one would think that she was needed since the beginning but after re-watching several times, one would then start to raise questions over her character. A decently developed character no doubt.We have a bossy but good-hearted Colleen Goodwin (Vera Fermiga). Who plays a crucial role in the movie, her staying to the topic type attitude does save a lot of time for the movie to show us the things we want to see. There was no back story for this character but to be honest, it wasn't even needed because this character was complete without one.We have a strict Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who aims for the goal he sets and nothing else. He performs just like any government agency top gun would. Doesn't want to answer any questions and only wants answers. The maker of the source code and an egotistical man who would sacrifice anyone (not himself) to get the job done.While watching Source Code, you will accuse everyone you see in the entire 93 minutes. Source Code doesn't only give you chills but also explains itself. This isn't the type of movie where the main focus is only on finding the villain. It gives you a great concept of how a man can go to the same place again and again for answers, it shows you the importance of life, it shows you how a man fights for his rights and it shows you how one lunatic can harm so many people.Direction: The scenes are brilliantly directed, being in the train for most of the 93 minutes, the director made it look so easy and the setting for all the scenes was perfect.Pros:*The acting by all the characters*The direction and the movie's setting*The fresh idea*Focusing on more than one thing*The mystery and thrill*The length of the movieCons:*The character Christina Warren being bland *The antagonist's foolish motive for the bombingVerdict:Source Code has it all, the action, the thrill, the chill, the love story, the bonding with the characters, a fresh idea that delivers. You will be seeing more than a mystery thriller. The direction and acting delivers, the story delivers but a couple of things fail.Christina Warren, a main character looks a bit bland and out of sync with the story in the first half. And the antagonist who has one of the most idiotic reasons to kill people even for a movie. Maybe, it's not his fault as over the years, we have seen so many evil masterminds with stunning reasons to be evil and then we get to see this villain who is just plain bad. A stunning movie no doubt and is recommended for everyone9/10",9,1,3,18 February 2015
