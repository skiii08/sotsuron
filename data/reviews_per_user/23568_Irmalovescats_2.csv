The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the life story of a shy boy and how he grows out of his shyness and goes through the best and worst times of his life.
","I would have to say that this is on my top 5 list of favorite movies.I love movies that I can relate to. Many people can look at me or be around me and know that I'm very shy and awkward. I like to see it in a good light and see it as one of my quirks. Charlie has to be my favorite character in this movie because of the amount of quirks he has.I love that this movie takes me on the roller coaster that is his life. I enjoy it when in a movie I can escape what ever situation I'm in and get sucked into the story.This movie makes me go through so many emotions, happiness when he makes friend, sadness when I found out his friend killed himself, and I felt the conflict when he couldn't be with Sam. It made me feel so many emotions that it even make me cry. For a movie to make me cry it has to be extremely emotional. When Charlie almost committed suicide ahh it was so dangerous because I was getting to know the character and in a way seeing him grow.In the end it was a fantastic movie.",9,0,2,30 September 2015
Edward Scissorhands," a story of an outcast creation taken in by a 'normal' family.
","This movie is a must if you want to experience laughter, heart ache, joy, and anger. In Edward Scissorhands there was an inventor that lived in a castle he was very old but so creative and intelligent. He was working on inventing a boy he was at the point of finishing him but he DIES he leaves Edward to live alone in a castle unfinished with scissors for hands. But one day many years later an Avon saleswoman dares to ring his doorbell there is no answer but she walks in any way. She finds Edward and she decided to take him home with her. They soon find out that he is an expert at hedge sculptures and hair cutting because of the fact that he has scissors for hands. During his experiences living in a normal town he finds that the towns people don't like him because he is so weird and an outcast. I loved this movie because I could relate to him being different and naive and just awkward I loved the emotion this movie repelled it expressed laughter every time Edward did something awkward or funny. Heart ache when Edward started to grow feelings towards Kim. joy was shown when the community started too accept him for who he was. Lastly anger when they teased him badly and kicked him out when he didn't do anything bad. overall i love this movie its definitely in my top ten especially since Tim Burton was the director. He adds just the perfect dose of creepy weirdness I enjoy so much in movies. GREAT MOVIE RECOMMEND TO ALL.",9,1,1,29 October 2015
