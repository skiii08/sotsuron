Blade Runner 2049," Utterly disappointing. Dreadful score. Ford struggles to stay awake.
","Where to begin.
this could have been so much better but clearly nobody involved really was that interested.
The musuc score was an assault on the ears. None of the iconic Vangelis of the original. I kept waiting for that uplifting euphoric score that defined the original. (Apart from the initial dam scene and a brief resurrection of the Vangelis original theme during the snow scene which is quickly blotted out.)
Gosling does the best he can but he knows he's fighting a losing battle, on his own, with this slog of a plot, clunky script, predictable direction and overly pretentious minimalist cinematography.
In parts it feels like a budget warehouse movie. The CGI ruins it, nothing feels genuine, too many pastiches of the original that aren't necessary, other and to remind you that it's Blade runner.Robin Wright is still in her Clare Underwood role I'm afraid.
Jared leto is unconvincing and underutilized.
Harrison Ford has clearly been brought along against his will, in order to add box office $$ validation to the movie.
He looks like a tired aged captive in this movie. He's meant to look old and reclused but its evident he's unfit and bored with acting and bored with this role. Its agony to watch the shoots he clearly struggles to get through.
There is a remarkable performance by Carla Juri however and Mackenzie Davis is always fascinating. Excellent casting here and their work should not be lost in the overall weakness of the movie.
The ending us weakly inconclusive because I guess they hoped for a few more sequels with the underworld resistance of the replicants. Unfortunately its a tired old trope that has been used too often before. ( underworld resistance v. wicked corporation v. benign but shady government...think Maze runner etc etc). I doubt however that we will be seeing BR 3 anytime soon.Sadly they should have left it at Rutger Hauer's parting shot.
' all those memories, like tears in rain, Time to die'....
....theres no sequel that should or could follow that.",4,3,6,12 February 2020
The Big Short," Good but not the best. Lacks relevent analysis.
","As a financier myself I love a good finance related movie provided the plot is accurate and sophisticated enough not to patronise the audience.
This movie unfortunately fails to a certain extent on those factors.
The key drivers of the 2008 crash are discussed but they are revealed in a somewhat flippant and over simplistic way that doesn't really properly explain real events.
We have cuts to famous celebs explaining to the dumb viewer in a ridiculously convoluted manner, the workings of CDOs or Synthetic CDOs. OK it probably decently educates many who are clueless on these systems and correctly displays how the banks and brokers and investment trusts manipulate and suck the money out of the average working person through shady deals and counter deals but this is only just the tip of the iceberg.
The daylight robbery of the American people began long before 2008 when Nixon took the US Dollar off the Gold standard and turned it into fiat. The printing began robbing Americans of their savings, their salaries and their wealth on a drip drip basis. Asset bubbles already began to build long before 2007 and the SubPrime Scandal was only one of many pins that popped the bubble.
The banks and investment managers are crooks but the biggest crook of all is Uncle Sam and the Fed.The Big Short has good enough suspense with great performances by Carroll & Gosling. Bale
tries a bit too hard on a slightly autistic caricature of Burry and Pitt is largely superfluous to the dynamic.Its way better than Dubuque's 'The Accountant' in its sophistry but well short of the reaches of 'Margin Call' , 'Inside Job', 'Wall Street' 'The Wolf of Wall street' or 'Equity'.Nevertheless, more of this genre please.",7,0,0,17 June 2020
