Casablanca," casablanca
","The writers of Casablanca put the history into the movie which I found was unique, because how many writers do that today? Not many. One thing the writers could have done was show more of the history instead of talking about it. The war shoots were incredible because they looked like real war footage. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) was a young man who ran away from the law and government once in America and wasn't afraid to loose all of his money and/or his life in Casablanca. Rick (Bogart) plays a big role in the movie, in a way he was a symbol, a symbol of freedom. The Captain Renault (Claude Rains) also is a symbol, he is a symbol of command and conquer, meaning he can control every one and everything. In Casablanca his role is an officer that make women sleep with him in order to allow them out of Casablanca. He even broke couples, and husband and wives break up because he would only give them one visa allowing only one of them to go. By him doing that caused a great love to come and then go which comes to bite Rick (Bogart) butt, So Rick (Bogart) prevents it from happening again to the newlyweds. Rick (Bogart) was a softy and now wanted what was once his, by setting him up and ends up helping in the end. The last scene was also a symbol because one, the part where Captain Renault (Rains) was going to drink water that had a label that said `VISHI' which means it was French, and he throws it away showing Rick (Bogart) that he is a freedom fighter. Another symbol part was when his ex-lover Ilsa Laszlo (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) walk into the darky fog, this means that she is out of Rick's (Bogart) life forever, And the finally symbol part was when the Captain Renault (Rains) and Rick (Bogart) walk into the fog saying one of the many famous lines ` this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. Other noticeable famous line is `here's looking at you kid'.",Null,0,0,26 April 2004
Citizen Kane," A Classic????
","What makes a classic? 'Citizen Kane' is considered a classic, because it was a black and white film. The film was also one of the first films made that had the fading effect. It was also considered a very high tec. for 1941. In the opening seen showed a locked gate and behind the gate was a big mansion. That whole seen was a model. Then the fading came into effect, there was so much that it became boring right off the bat. It would have been fine if they maybe had them fade faster or not so many of them. The cinematographer did a great job putting together a seen. Kane (Orsen Wells) was dancing with the dancers then the shot goes to a group of men talking about Kane (Wells) in the back ground there is a window in the window you can see Kane (Wells) still dancing away. The acting was a little dramatic. When ever the men were speaking they projected their voices so much and so loud that it was hard to hear what they were saying. Some times there was music playing when the men were talking all's you heard was blasting music. The music however was fitting to the time period, and the womens clothing.",Null,0,3,10 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove was strange
","Dr. Strangelove really was strange. Peter Sellers made that very clear by acting strange, his arm has spasms, and the way he speaks. Sellers also played the president, and group captain Lionel Mandrake. The Director had a weird aspect to this movie it's kinda unique, you have to look at the movie from a totally different perspective from the beginning, but you'll have to find that kind of perspective on our own. The movie actually is mainly history in s certain way. The main theme is about nuclear bombs and refers to the bodily functions a lot. There is a specific scene where Major T.J. King Kong' is straddling the bomb screaming it has to do with both, if you know what I mean..... The Director used unique names like Jack D. Ripper, King Kong, Miss Foreign Affairs. The director also made the characters seem very stupid, I mean the president doesn't even know the important phone numbers, the Russian's acted very stupid in some aspects, when the Major King Kong was listing off the materials that they might need for the special mission they are going on and in the box it has famine products, it was kids funny. The move was more funny then historical, what is it for you????",Null,0,1,9 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," Is it hot?
","Some like it hot is a lesson in it's self. The title doesn't really fit the lesson but it draws the audience's attention to the movie. Joe Junior (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) witness a crime and to get away from being killed, they escape Chicago by going to a warm place and being female musicians. During this time period in the movie the alcohol prohibition but there is still a lot of the drinking, and we all know what happens especially two of them are men. Josephine (Curtis) happens to fall in love with Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) and Daphne (Lemmon) is left with a weirdo. They run into the mafia again and Daphne (Lemmon) was purposed to and the Â‘ladies' fled with the weirdo and Sugar (Monroe) went with them, that's when ever thing unraveled and the weirdo said that it was ok even though it was two men. The lesson here is don't run, just go to the authorities, because if you don't it might be worse then the situation that you were in, in the first place.",Null,0,4,12 April 2004

Psycho," psycho...
","When you watch Hitchcock's thrillers you can make a game out of it. For example, Alfred Hitchcock puts himself in small shots in the movies that he is making, weather it's walking in the street, or on a bench reading a newspaper, etc He also uses the same prop or theme though out the scenes. It's kind-of fun and hard to find these key elements on the movies. Because Hitchcock was `The Master of Suspense' you were not supposed to give out the `spoiler' so the reviews are made up of the technical aspects of things. 	The music in the movie fits well. It puts the audience on the edge of their seats in terror. The music is a key to determine what was going to happen next, it was easy to foreshadow. 	The technology for the 1960's wasn't all that great, because when ever some one was driving and the shot was in the car it was easy to tell that there was a green screen behind the car, but you could tell that the car was really driving when the shot is out side of the car. There are mess-up's in the great movie that were some-what knowesablt. For example, when the camera did a close-up you could see the camera's in the scene. Everyone knows this movie for the shower scene, and yes, the best scene ever can have a mess-up when Maryann is screaming you can hear her laugh for a split second.",Null,0,1,17 February 2004
Rear Window," Hitchcock does it agian
","How this movie was made was interesting. When Alfred Hitchcock created this movie he wanted to explore different things in movie making, privacy and community. When it came to making the set, Paramount Studios allowed him to destroy the main floor to use the basement as a part of the set, making the set the biggest indoor set made (probably for that time) Hitchcock also explored with the dialog, there were a select few people talking. The way the actors acted was their dialog. He also puts you into the movie by making you guess what's going to happen and also the excitement, he does this by showing you what happened then Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) reaction to what just happened. Stewart also in the move resembled himself so it wasn't hard for him to act. When Hitchcock was shooting rainy scene he told one actor to go one way and the other another way, and they didn't know about the water so when you watch the movie watch it closely.When the movie was made it actually was based on a true story when a man killed his wife and tried to cover it up, that didn't work. The movie was also based on the book `It had to be Murder'. Then Hitchcock put into his own perspective, creating a original piece of work",Null,1,3,26 February 2004
The Godfather," the transitions
","The Director of the drama hit `The Godfather' Francis Ford Coppola, was unique at directing this film. There seem to be a lot of transitions in this film and mystery. He also was sneaky at who is the real main character.	The movie is full of suspense and disbelief, The casting director was remarkable at finding the right people to play the part. When watching this movie ask you self one question, do you feel sorry for this family, that's full of hatefulness and war? I asked my self that question and yeah, I did because of the way Coppola took the movie apart and pieced it back together in a different way. The transitions are some-what noticeable and there are others when you might have to watch it again to see it. 	The one thing that could have been changed was when ever the Italian family or even when ever they were speaking in Italian it was hard to understand what was going on, but it also could have been used as a tactic to throw the viewer off. Another thing that could have been changed was the timing was difficult to comprehend, between 2 days or a year.",Null,0,2,17 May 2004
