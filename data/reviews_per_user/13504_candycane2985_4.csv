The Ring," HOLY MOLY
","I went and saw the ring last night, and I must say I have never been that scared in a movie in my entire life....It was scary from beginning to end...there was never a dull moment. This is the best horror film I have ever seen. If you are in the mood to get the crap scared outta ya, go see the ring...but dont expect a bunch of gore and killing people every second or anything like that...its a psychological thriller that messes with your mind BIG time.... 9/10 stars",9,0,0,27 October 2002
Memento," Intense...inspiring, mind boggling...wonderful
","Wow...My best friend and I were at the video store, and the guy who worked there suggested it to us..and I must say it was incredibly good...it was so intense, and kept you  on the edge of your seat...and I must say it was really confusing at times, but that is what made it so good. It had so many twists and turns, and was just absolutely wonderful, so if you like movies that keep you waiting for more, and that are really deep...I definitely recommend Memento!I give it... 9 1/2 *'s out of 10",9,0,1,16 June 2002
Vanilla Sky," crazy, confusing, and incredible
","This film was just absolutly brilliant.  It actually made me think. During the whole movie I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it...it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. All of the actors were phenominal, and no one could have done a better job...This is one of my favorites of the year...it deserves an ocar.",10,0,1,27 January 2002
A Walk to Remember," Wonderfully Suprising
","When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought it looked pretty good, but I didnt expect much out of Mandy Moore.  My friends and I decided to have a girls night out and see A Walk to Remember.  Much to my dismay, it was extremely good.  It made me want to just sit in a ball and cry.  I discovered during this movie how talented Mandy Moore is.  Not only can she sing, unlike some other 'pop icons' she can actually act, and very well. However, not only Mandy had a great performance.  Shane West was breathtaking as well.  So after leaving the movie, and wiping all the tears off our faces, my friends and I were very suprised at how much we liked it. It was so great!! 8.0/10",9,0,0,27 January 2002
