Ford v Ferrari," Another story of American success, but Josh Lucas goes over the top
","American films tend to sing glories to the achievements of their citizens and in this case, an Englishman is involved in the ultimate success of an adventure to beat the top representative of speed and quality in car races.Undoubtedly Matt Damon and Christian Bale give their best -as usual- in their performance, but Josh Lucas as Leo Beebee happens to steal the show from them as the corrosive, hypocrite, and false villain of the narration. He becomes THE MAN ONE LOVES TO HATE and in top form, indeed.The whole atmosphere of a gripping script is enhanced with his presence and the way he shows how he can plan underground strategies to try to sink Ken Miles, but in the end -and even if he humiliates Miles- the spectator ends with a bitter flavour remembering his presence.KUDOS for such a superb piece of acting, Mr. Lucas.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
