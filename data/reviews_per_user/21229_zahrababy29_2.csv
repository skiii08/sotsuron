Captain Phillips," A must see with some screws loose.
","I truly enjoyed this movie it has a every intriguing essence and it is very gut wrenching. I wont like to you without Tom Hanks in this movie it would have been garbage considering that it was based on a true story it was very fascinating to see what one would do for life. But I found the portrayal of Somalian Pirates to be stereotypical but the acting of the pirates was top notch for a film debut. The thing that plot lacks is both accounts of the story, I researched about the plot of the story and the true events explored in the film and crew members who recount there experience with Captain Phillips when the hijacking occurred some described his actions as heroic and reckless and it was sad to see that the both accounts were not portrayed in the movie. Emotion is one of the main themes in this movie that you explore towards the end when Phillips is rescued and the one pirate has been captured and 3 others shot and killed in front of Phillips he shouts and cries in the lifeboat. He is taken to a doctor where he is asked if all the blood on his body is his and he replies in a shocked manor 'No this is not blood' repeatedly. But overall this movie is very suspenseful and it is a must see and Tom Hanks truly perfected and some great acting by Barkhad Abdirahman ... Bilal Faysal Ahmed Faysal Ahmed ... Najee Mahat M.

Prisoners," Heart Wrenching Piece
",I have watched various films much like a psychological thriller but nothing has ever come close to this. The prisoner with the talents of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall keep you on the edge of your seat. The most interesting thing is when you finally get to grips with what is going on you see the plot go the opposite direction. But be warned that this film is very related to reality and the emotions experienced by parents in the most unimaginable darkest hour of ones life. The emotions explored in this film will leave you will a scar that will never be removed I felt as though I was somehow glued to my seat. Hugh Jackman has very much secured himself a Oscar in my eyes and I hope you agree with me to. Jake plays very much out of his comfort zone and it is a wonderful ride. But the cinematography really opened doors don't be fooled by the dark moment in between every scene it is very much worth it. If you have not yet seen this film it is one to keep in mind because it is one that will surely be worth while.,8,1,2,19 October 2013
