Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Somethings are better left unsaid
","A lot of today's films are just plain old stupid. In fact, that is probably an apt description of the typical mainstream film: film purely for amusement. A cheap laugh. A brief thrill. Nothing else, and most certainly nothing that truly matters in the long run. Sure, people need to laugh and have fun as a part of a healthy life, but amusement for amusement's sake is like a drug. You want more and more and more until finally your view of amusement is literally insulting to any respectable person. Borat manages to accomplish that with all barrels blazing. The film is literally vulgar excess that can be best described at excrement of an ever rapidly declining art form. An utterly shameless glob of phlegm that you cough out with blood, because it is clinging to your throat like a determined parasite. However, this parasite infects your brain, which, in a sense, makes it more painful. Not to you, but to society as a whole. People are dumbed down by this sort of trash and our view of what in art and entertainment has really fallen.It is not the tasteless humor that is insulting, but the presentation of the United States as a nation consisting primarily of bigots and simpletons. The people of this great country are not perfect, I in no way want to imply that and we've had our share of bigotry in this country (like most others), but somethings are just better left unsaid and to keep on bringing it up is just in poor interest of everyone. You have a wound, you let it heal. You don't keep probing it with the hope of it speeding up any sort of healing. As if that wasn't enough, the film also manages to insult the National Anthem. Out of all the silly music out there they just had to pick the one piece that is truly important in this country. Then if that wasn't enough, they present a humorless and insulting piece which poses as the 'national anthem of Kazakhstan.' In fact, the film goes as far as insulting everyone that appears in it and, as irony would have it, Mr. Cohen insults himself by making it all happen. How can a graduate of any respectable university (Mr. Cohen is a Cambridge Grad.) use his talents, effort, and creativity to produce such worthless slime as this? I don't know, and I am not sure I want to know, but I just hope that this sort thing will stop when people realize how stupid and pointless it is. Then the so called 'filmmakers' of these types of films will stop making them when they all of a sudden have no audience.That will be the day. When the Borats, the Jackasses, and the lot them just realize their stupidity and the people who make them (who undoubtedly have ambition) will focus their efforts of something else. If that is at all possible for them. But, let's be positive, even the town fool deserves a chance to repent his blunders.",1,6,13,24 December 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Thought provoking and intelligent horror
","Out of all of the horror movies that come out today, too many rely on cheap thrills and gore to give the viewer a scare. That was scary when it was new, but now it is so old that almost any gore based horror flick is bound to be disappointing and just cheesy entertainment. The true symbolic nature of the art of horror has almost all but vanished completely. First the gore based movies became popular, but they they virtually dominate the horror shelf at rental stores. This is the case since gore is easy to make. Relatively easy. Just like explosions are easy to make in an action movie. But a true horror film and a true action thriller need something more: plot.This film was much misunderstood due to film audiences misunderstanding of the word 'horror.' Viscerally it is a love story, but the symbolic vile nature of what is really going on is so well hidden that no one got it. It is simply too intelligent for today's typically mundane film goers.Take the title: Brokeback Mountain. What does it mean? It is where Ennis and Jack realize what they mean to one another. Two men in love. The film going audience interpreted this as a cultural step towards the acceptance of homosexuals as normal day-to-day human beings that also have feelings and can also fall in love. But the title of the film says it plainly: Ennis and Jack are the poison to society. They have to hide what they feel. They must keep it a secret and they do so at 'Brokeback Mountain.' There they commit there sins of infidelity and homosexuality and they 'break the moral back' of society with the weight of their sins that has now, symbolically, taken the weigh and immensity of a mountain. There are other mountains nearby and theirs seems to blend in to what is a beautiful landscape, but the film almost always focuses on mountain of the title. It is only natural, because if you see or feel a problem you direct your attention toward it.Like the loose tooth that you keep probing with your tongue, you have 31 other teeth, so why put so much effort into one when you hardly think of all your teeth except when you are washing them? Because it is a painful problem that you want to get rid of. With all that in mind, watch the film again, but with this attention to subtlety and see a truly thought provoking and intelligent horror film that makes a powerful moral commentary.",8,3,19,4 December 2006
Rules of Engagement," When you order a man to do a dirty job, you trust him, since he is doing it for you.
","This is a brilliant film portraying the trust that citizens need to give their soldiers. The duty of a soldier is hard and involves lots of training and preparation for something there is no real training and preparation for: war. Only the hardest and most determined men become good soldiers and the best of that elite become good officers.Colonel Childers is a good officer and solid war veteran who knows what he needs to do to get his job, defending America, done and done well. He pulls of compromises and makes his decisions crisp and clear. However, when faced with the task of protecting an embassy and American soil in a hostile Middle Eastern country he is faced with a dilemma any soldier would face: should he order his men to fire into a hostile crowd in order to get them to stop? He decides through agonizing minutes after three of his men are down and he himself is wounded to give the order to fire. Shockingly, instead of being treated as hero who made a tough but necessary decision he is accused of murder on 83 counts.There is an investigation into what happened, but evidence is slim as the embassy security cameras have been destroyed and the soldiers have trouble remembering what happened in the chaos. They were taking cover and only rose up to fire, anyway. One camera was left intact, but the tape to it has vanished as a part of a conspiracy by diplomats to write this off as the mistake of one unstable man. But Childers knows the truth and his friend and brother in arms Hogdes (who represents Childers on court) knows it too. Hodges has his doubts, but realizes that Childers is not a glory hound, he isn't eager to say that he willfully ordered his men to fire into a crowd that had women and children, but the important thing is that Childers did what he decided was best: protect America from hostility. It had to be done and was rightfully done so.The courtroom scenes in the films last act are particularly shocking as nit picking diplomats and prosecutors pick apart little details and question the integrity of Colonel Childers, asking him to recall the minutest details. The point is that Childers's decision as a USMC Colonel was made from his heart and gut, not from a measly piece of paper called 'the rules of engagement.' That's what defending America is all about and it comes from the heart of every citizen and the gut of every soldier. It's about time people, mainly liberals, got that. Also the film isn't racist, it treats offenders of America equally. The Viet Cong get it for endangering and killing Americans in the beginning so the Muslims get it too. The point transcends race and is ever more relevant in today's political spectrum.",10,3,10,25 September 2007
Wedding Crashers," Brilliant metaphor for US foreign policy
","Once again, a largely misunderstood movie that speaks wonders about the great nation of the United States. The liberals thought this was a sex-comedy about to promiscuous men who 'crash weddings' by showing up uninvited. But it is actually a profound statement about American Politics and how we can use it to succeed in the world struggle.First off, the film takes place in Washington DC, the nation's capital city which is not a coincidence. The protagonists of John and Jeremy are not just Americans, they are America! Move over Stephen Colbert. The opening sequences shows how our all American heroes go to various weddings of different cultural back grounds, but it is their American culture that makes the weddings exciting. They are at the center of each event just like the US is at the center of the World's most important political events that take place in different countries. And it is the US that sets things right and makes things end up like they should - with foreign cultures learning the American way of Liberty and Freedom.But like all great studies this film is also very self-reflective as most of the action takes place in an American Families weekend retreat were one wedding just took place and another is in preparation. John and Jeremy boldly refuse the sexual advances of the promiscuous mother and homosexual son thus keeping their purity. I won't give the whole story away, but by the end they really shape that family up and help them make some very tough choices but in the end the American way is preserved. The closing shot on the Washington Monument confirms this: America Stands Tall and Proud. We go through our ups and downs, but we prevail.Bravo to all involved in this cinematic masterpiece of metaphor and transcending ideas. They have truly created an ideologically sound film that was viewed by the largely liberal audience since it was a hit and retains a good rating here on IMDb. Let's just hope that they understood the right way.",10,1,4,17 February 2008
The Breakfast Club," A societal horror commentary
","A group of students have been put in Saturday detention for breaking the laws of their school. Foolishly the school principal puts them together in the library and each is to write a paper about why they think they are here. Naturally they rebel and break even more laws of their superiors. This leads to the establishment of a cult run by powerful mysterious entity.Once again, this is a much misperceived film. The liberal hugging audience thought it is about kids maturing and even teaching their adult superiors a few things, but upon closer inspection you can see the evil axis that is at hand. The students do learn something, but it is that they can exploit the weaknesses of their adult superiors for furthering the Devil's work. The principal just puts them into a room and expects them to listen to him! Fool! He should have done something himself, because 'idle hands do the devil's work.' The students proceed to indulge in drugs, profanities, and sexual fantasies as they are guided into a deep inner corruption. This is powerful message that good people can never truly rest in their mission of ridding the world of evil. The principal in the end recognizes this as he reads one paper that the students wrote and is an excuse for what he ordered them to do in the beginning.The final images are particularly shocking as the students even display their inner corruption in front of their parents who do nothing. Nothing! Is it out of shame? No, it is because they didn't do enough before and now the, just like the snowball that rolls down hill and gets bigger and heavier with each revolution, the evil is impossible to stop. The students have been recruited by the devil to further his plan of liberal take over. The final image of one of the newly recruited hellspawns as he salutes the evil force that has now the town under its umbrella is one of the most disturbing. But only if the film is understood correctly.",8,2,4,4 December 2006
