Frost_Nixon," Good film...but
","This was an enjoyable film for the most part, thanks mostly to Frank Langella's performance as Nixon, but be warned, if you have one single conservative bone in your body, steer clear of the bonus features. Without going into a whole political diatribe, I fail to see why these Hollywood drones have to inject their own political views into everything. Just let the damn thing speak for itself for once! Throughout the cast and crew interviews, nearly everyone involved felt it necessary to constantly label G. W. Bush a liar and compare him with Nixon, and state and restate the standard mass-media B.S. that we've all heard again and again and again. Opie seems to forget that while every president does things that upset both opponents and supporters, this nation is still a 50/50 split. This guy's been a filthy rich TV and movie star since he was a kid, so I guess I can understand how he would be disconnected from most of society.And speaking of disconnect, I understand the need for drama, but I wish that Hollywood would stop over-dramatizing of just plain making things up when dealing with factual events. Frost/Nixon is loaded with inaccuracies and made-up parts; parts that only exist because this film was adapted from a play. I think in most situations, as in 'Apollo 13', the fact is every bit as dramatic as the fiction.Anyway, the film was well made and engaging and while it couldn't help but trumpet the 'we got Nixon GOOD!' angle, it nonetheless was entertaining. That's all I have to say about that.",6,1,6,2 May 2009
Star Trek," Mixed feelings...
","I use to watch the original series with my father back in the '60's and I watched it in syndication most of my adult life. I was not opposed to a reboot, but the time travel/ alternate reality thing has been done to death. While I enjoyed the film, there were some troubling plot holes here and there. Here's a few I noticed: (1) Vulcan is minutes away from being destroyed and Spock decides to beam down to save his folks. He goes to the turbo-lift and heads to the transporter room. Kirk and Sulu are falling without a chute and Chekov gets up and runs around a few corners and into the transporter room. He beams up Kirk and Sulu and THEN Spock comes walking in. Where did he go? (BTW, how come Chekov could beam up Kirk and Sulu when they were falling but not Spocks mom when she was falling?)(2)Cadet Kirk convinces Capt Pike that they are 'warping' into a trap. Pike orders the shields to be raised and when they arrive at Vulcan, the ship gets hammered by debris. Shields do not deflect debris?(3)Black holes either destroy things OR can be used to time travel. It just depends on the needs of the story.(4)Why could no one detect the supernova heading towards Romulus? Spock was supposed to stop it, but it consumes the planet before anyone knew what happened?(5)As others have pointed out, one doesn't need to drill any holes in a planet if you can create a black hole.Although he doesn't come off quite as 'cool' as a younger Nimoy, I still liked the casting of Zachary Quinto as Spock and the casting of Karl Urban was inspired. The 'Bones' McCoy character was a true embodiment rather than a cheap imitation. Zoe Saldana was fine as Uhuru although the Spock/Uhuru romance was a bit too out of character for Spock. Simon Pegg was amusing as a younger, higher-energy Scotty and John Cho filled the Sulu role adequately. The portrayal of Chekov was over the top and quite annoying to me. Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike injected just the right amount of gravitas and confidence into the role. I enjoyed every minute that he was on the screen. And that brings us to Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. As a fan of the original series, I found this Kirk to be lacking charm and grace. That 1960's Shatner had a swagger and was a master chess player in space battles. I'm not sure if it's the way it was written or his performance, but Pine plays Kirk as a class-A jerk with a bad attitude. The joy of the characters as they were originally written was the triangle of Spock, Kirk and McCoy. McCoy would loudly make his voice heard to the captain in one ear, with virtually no check on his emotions and Spock would be in his other ear, coolly stating the facts with no emotional bias. Kirk would take all of this input and more and invariably make the right choice. Pine's Kirk seems to get by on brashness, cockiness and determination. (BTW, who had the awful idea of making a beer brewery into the Enterprise's engine room?)The shaky cam bugged me a few times but the effects were very good. Overall, I enjoyed the film and was able to overlook many of the flaws because it was a great popcorn flick. 7 out of 10 stars",7,2,5,6 January 2010
The Prestige," Dark, moody, but fun!!!
","I really enjoyed this film and Christian Bale turns in yet another solid performance in Christopher Nolan's capable hands. I'll admit that it didn't take me very long to figure out most of the Jackman side of the plot but I freely admit that I never considered the 'twins' twist. I barely recognized Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine did his usual seamless work.I was confused for a bit but when the story threads started to come together, I began to really get into it. The story was fascinating and David Bowie as Tesla was an inspired casting choice, adding just the right touch of murky mysteriousness. The sets were just awesome and the cinematography was spot on, conveying a dark but not oppressive mood. I usually judge a film by the impression that it leaves (or doesn't) on me hours or even days after viewing it, and this one had me running through all of the puzzle pieces in my mind for some time afterward. It was dark and somber but not enough to make one feel like it was a 'downer' experience. It did, however, leave me in a contemplative state of mind--and that's a good thing. This was a smartly written, solid piece of entertainment on all fronts.***-As a side note, I wish that Chris Nolan would get another sound designer---I'm sick of all of his movies having dialogue that you can barely hear, even with your sound system cranked up, only to have the next scene rattling the windows!***",8,3,5,2 May 2009
The Hurt Locker," This thing beat Avatar? Not in my book!
","I truly wanted to love this film, but alas, 'twas not to be. Not to get off on a tangent, but the fact that this film beat James Cameron's Avatar simply boggles the mind. It had to be some kind of political force to make that happen.The Hurt Locker is a tedious, unrealistic and plodding film about an EOD (bomb squad) team in Iraq. According to this film, these squads work completely independent of the rest of the military, make up their own missions and don't really answer to anyone for foolhardy, illogical actions in the field. Simple common sense was thrown out the window at nearly every turn in this movie and the characters did the stupidest, most irrational things that defied explanation. This was not a true testament to the men and women who serve the United States in a military capacity.The story, if you can call it that, revolves around three members of the EOD team: Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), an adrenalin junkie cowboy, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), a by-the-book man that keeps his emotions in check at all times, and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) a rookie who constantly looks to his superiors for guidance and is obsessed with death. We follow these three men on mission after mission, trying to discern what the hell is going as we look on through the myopic lens of the almighty shaky-cam, a little cinematic trick to try to make things look edgier and more realistic; this is a trick I grew tired of long ago. There was just too damn much camera movement and too many nauseating close-ups for my taste. I felt like I was watching Hancock all over again - but without the entertainment value. The loose excuse for a plot leaves us meandering through one tense little situation after another until the tension was non-existent and I just didn't care anymore - not that I cared to begin with. The characters are all stock clich√©'s and the development of those cardboard cutouts was practically nowhere to be seen. They just were.The entire film boiled down to the main character, Sergeant James, being ridiculously foolish and being completely dismissive of the guidelines for his job. He had no problem putting his team into unnecessarily dangerous situations just to fuel his own needs for...whatever his need were. His was uncharacteristically nonmilitary in his thinking and seemed to care only about himself. Military men do not think that way, and if they did, wars would be a lot shorter and much more bloodier.There were some glaring inaccuracies regarding the way in which the military functions and these guys would have been court-martialed on a daily basis. Other reviewers have covered the worst problems with this film but I'll just repeat that there didn't really seem to be any direction to their missions and things just seemed to happen. The actors all did fine jobs, but I implore anyone who wants to watch this film to not think that this is how the military really is. 'Cause it just ain't so. My grade: D",5,2,5,26 April 2010
The Dark Knight," Not bad...not great, either...
","I was terribly torn between liking this movie and not, but it was so hard to shut out the hype surrounding the whole Heath Ledger performance. It WAS an incredibly nuanced performance and quite creepy to boot, but I did have a problem with the script a time or two.CONS: Apparently anyone can move untold numbers of large barrels filled with explosive materials with ease into hospitals, ports,...etc. Many of the characters seemed to be clairvoyant; knowing exact movements and reactions of everyone. The whole bullet/fingerprint scenario made absolutely no sense. The Joker was an incredible accidental planner. Too little time spent on Two-face. The soundtrack was downright annoying at times. You have to really strain to hear some of the dialogue but the action sequences bordered on too loud. (when watching at home, I have to keep the remote in hand so that I don't bother my neighbors). Bruce Wayne seemed very one-dimensional. Car chases are becoming so routine that it's hard to get excited about them anymore!PROS: Maggie Gyllenhaal was quite an improvement over Mrs. Cruise. The tone and pacing were right-on and the film looked gorgeous. The mob heads were very well cast, especially Eric Roberts. The whole Hong Kong sequence seemed contrived just for the action sake but was very well done. Great supporting cast all-around. All in all, it was a very entertaining film, but while I completely bought into 'Batman Begins', here I couldn't fight the feeling that Christopher Nolan was just trying too hard to wow everyone and went a little too far. I couldn't quite figure out if it was supposed to be gritty and realistic or fanciful fantasy. I certainly hope that the next installment goes back to a character-driven piece like the first one.",8,2,5,27 December 2008
The Happening," M Night Shame-on-you!!
","Most of the reviews here have already covered this pile-o'-crap fairly well, so I'll try not to repeat any previous comments, but it's so hard when you're talking about this lame effort from the wunderkind of Hollywood. One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is the lion-mauling scene. I was unaware that an animal can pull off a man's arm with only a slight tug, AND that man can continue to stand so that another lazy lion can coax the other one off! WTF? The plot holes are big enough to drive Jupiter through and yes, the acting was bad! Marky Marks wife, played absently by Zooey Deschanel, just comes off like someone that just drank a pitcher of Nyquil, and I was reminded of Karen Allen's demented portrayal of Indiana Jones's long lost love, smiling and laughing maniacally at the most dangerous times! There was no real suspense in this movie and the idea of people outrunning the wind is way beyond preposterous. And, as some others have pointed out, the wind would essentially dilute anything airborne and make it LESS potent!! Mark Wahlberg constantly looked confused, but not by the events surrounding him, but by the script. (How do I act like any of this is believable? He seemed to emote) Also, Is it believable that being inside a house will stop airborne particles small enough to not be seen by the naked eye? I liked the first ten minutes or so and had high hopes that the film would take some of those frightening elements and take it a step further, but instead, what we got was one community-theater feeling scene after another and the characters were strangely dispassionate about the whole thing. All in all, one boring movie. It's pretty hard to defend a film that starts out strong and gets increasingly ridiculous and confusing as it goes along. Don't waste your time, money or brain cells on this half-hearted attempt!!",1,2,5,26 October 2008
War of the Worlds," Cinematic crud
","This film is so bad on so many levels, it's hard to believe. As many posts have noted, there are some SERIOUS plot holes in this piece of drek, and some pretty bad writing. The performances were just okay, but if you've seen the first ten minutes, then you've seen the best parts. Just a recap of some of the stupidest parts: Annoying little Dakota Fanning needing to go ten miles to pee. A bitch ex-wife,and two, no make that three neurotic kids, if you count Ray (Tom Cruise). Selective electronics being zapped, others not. Selective people being vaporized, our star not, much to everyones chagrin.The teenage kid gets incinerated but shows up at the end, no worse for the wear. Cars dead on the freeway, but somehow ALL of them off to the side to leave a nice path for our intrepid idiots. Airplane wreckage also leaving a nice path for aforementioned idiots, and on and on and on. Mr. Spielberg forgot one the basic tenants of summer fun film making and that is, if you're going to put your characters through hell, the audience needs to CARE ABOUT THEM! Most people that saw this film were rooting for the aliens from the word go. These characters were annoying, spiteful, bitter, clueless and oh yeah, did I mention annoying? The aliens looked about as menacing as your average teddy bear and Tim Robbins' psycho character was merely an odd diversion at best. I would like to be all high and mighty and say 'Ha, at least I didn't pay to see this crap in a theater!' but I instead spent twice as much and bought it on DVD. This film was a monumental waste of money, talent and time. The 1953 version while not sporting all the fancy-shmancy CGI, was far superior in every other way. If you see this film and it makes you wish you had those two hours back, you can't say that you weren't warned.",1,3,6,3 June 2008
Inception," If this is brilliance, then we are so screwed!
","First off, it's clear that these IMDb ratings are no longer valid. This film was just 'ok' by anyone's standards, except maybe the plethora of teenagers that love anything that includes lots of gun fire and 'splosions. The plot was unnecessarily convoluted and chock full of lazy writing. I have really liked Chris Nolan's work, so this is not a personal attack on him; it's just nowhere near as slick as others have claimed. The biggest symptoms of lazy writing are: constant exposition in the guise of conversation, constant changing of rules set up earlier in the movie and supposedly brilliant people making illogical choices, when the plot demands it. Many have said that those of us who didn't like it were just clueless and didn't 'get it'. What's to get? The plot was not difficult to understand, just difficult to accept as anything that made any sense. A dream with a dream within a dream. Big effing deal! I bought this film on DVD and couldn't wait to see it as so many people had hailed it as the best thing since Citizen Kane. I was left feeling empty and ripped off, then again, there is an entire generation that claims 'Transformers' and 'Independence Day' are two of the best films ever made. I fail to understand how this over-blown, over-hyped film could garner such high ratings unless the people doing the rating have never seen a movie over 20 ears old. The concept was high-minded but the execution was pure popcorn-munching tripe. While I'll admit the cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was fairly well done, it was just so empty. As others have pointed out, when it's all just a dream, there's not a lot of tension when faceless people are shooting at you. Just plain silly, I say. (as an aside, South Park did a very funny dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream years ago!)",4,9,14,4 January 2011
Iron Man," Now that's how you make a fun film!!!
","I can not say enough good things about this film. The story, the writing, acting, direction, casting, production design,...etc, were ALL top-notch. This is the film many Summer films aspire to be.Robert Downey Jr. struck just the right note with this character making him a bit of a playboy cad, but still immensely likable. The audience was rooting for him from the word 'go'. (Note to Mr. Spielberg: Remember when you used to create likable characters instead of annoying overly-flawed morons? War of the Worlds ring a bell?)The sexy Gwyneth Paltrow was spot-on and Jeff Bridges showed how years of acting experience can bring such weight to a role that in hands of a lesser actor most certainly would have come out as over-the-top. There were no superfluous subplots or wasted shots and the character development was adequate and came in the course of the storytelling rather than being heavy-handedly shoved down our throats. The pacing was just right and all of the action sequences were directed with a competent hand; none of those 'what the hell is happening now?' moments that are seen too frequently in other films where action scenes mean too many blurred shots and quick cuts that leave you confused. Mr. Favreau has made an intelligent film that actually has a heart and one can only hope that he keeps the sequels up to the standard of the original.Watch 'the Dark Knight' for Heath Ledger's performance, skip the Hulk and don't damage your brain with 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Just watch this flick and actually ENJOY A FILM for once in a while. I wish that Hollywood would get it right like this more often!!!",10,2,4,30 November 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard 4 kicks butt!!!!
","I normally don't care too much for action flicks mainly because in the last 10 years or so action films tend to rely too much on CGI and also tend to have extremely weak scripts, but this one has all the spirit and heart of the first one and man, oh man the stunts are jaw-dropping! This film knows when to be serious and when to wink at the audience, and the director seems to have taken to heart some of the basic tenants of movie-making that directors like Steven Spielberg have forgotten (War of the Worlds, anyone?), namely; If you're going to put your characters through hell, the audience first has to care about them, and secondly, action films should be...FUN!!! This film succeeds on all accounts and had me chuckling to myself several times at the wit of the script and the chemistry of the leads. Intelligently written, well paced, oh, and did I mention the stunts? Brilliant film-making and a good time to be had for all!!! If you like action, don't miss this puppy!!",10,2,5,18 December 2007
Valkyrie," Good film...Cruise should do more like this...
","Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise, is the true story of World War II German army officer, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, one of many German army officers who saw that Hitler's war was not only a suicidal one, but one that could ultimately bring about the destruction of the whole of Europe. Von Stauffenberg, like many of his fellow conspirators, believed that if Hitler could be assassinated, the Allies could be negotiated with and perhaps Germany could be saved from defeat and hopefully, untold destruction.It is 1943 and the German army is taking a pounding from all sides; losses of life and machinery are piling up and the Allies are showing no signs of weakening. Stauffenberg is in cahoots with several officers; Major-General Henning Von Tresckow(Kenneth Branagh), General Friedrich Olbricht(Bill Nighy), and the nervous, reluctant General Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard), along with retired General Ludwig Beck (Terrance Stamp) and The hopefully soon-to-be new leader of Germany, Dr. Carl Goerdeler (Kevin McNally). The plan is to sneak a bomb into one of Hitler's high-level meetings, kill the Fuhrer, round up the SS with the troops serving as the reserve guard, and with any luck, put a new government in place before anyone knows what has happened. It would be a very risky coup' and everything had to fall into place in order for it to be a success. One major stumbling block is General Friedrich Fromm(Tom Wilkinson), who is the man that would have to give the order to put Operation Valkyrie into effect, essentially mobilizing the in-country reserves and taking control of the government and the armed forces. He is aware of the plan but is quite on the fence about the whole matter. There is a scene where he tells Von Stauffenberg and General Olbricht in no uncertain terms, that he will stand on whatever side the victors are on. He will not sacrifice life, limb or his position unless the deal has already gone down and the conspirators are successful. This puts the pressure on the entire rest of the plan going off without a hitch, and most notably, Von Staffenberg's ability to makes sure Hitler is in fact dead.It goes without saying that the plot failed in the end, but that does not diminish the tension of the story and even though we know how things come out, the sheer fact of the risks these men were willing to take, makes for a riveting film. These men are, and should be, remembered as heroes; men who were far more loyal to the nation of Germany than to the chain of command that of course ended with Hitler at the top. They were true patriots that believed that the fate of the fatherland was doomed if Hitler remained in control, and were intent on stopping a madman from taking everyone down with him. Von Stauffenberg has been a loyal soldier, even losing an eye, his right hand and several fingers of his left hand in battle, but he knows all too well that if his children are to ever know peace in their lifetimes, Hitler must not be allowed to continue his self-destructive rampage into oblivion.Valkyrie is a well made film, focusing on the mechanics of the plot and the passion of the conspirators. These are men that have an abiding love of their country and know that if they fail, they will all certainly be executed and their families would be in peril as well. Cruise, while not my favorite actor, does two things very well in movies: he does cocky well and he does intense well. Here he is required to be intense and pulls it off well. Cruise plays Von Stauffenberg as a man who cares deeply about his family and the future of his country. He is a man that has given a lot to his country, including bits of his body. The one thing he will not part with, however, is his soul. He knows that in the grand scheme of things, his life is a small price to pay to bring his beloved Germany back from the brink. Cruise plays Von Stauffenberg as a cool customer; professional and reserved and determined.Branagh's Von Tresckow is seen only periodically throughout the film, but he is one of the key conspirators. Branagh plays Von Tresckow as a confident, thoughtful man, who like Von Stauffenberg, is close enough to Hitler's inner circle to see his insanity and to fear it. After placing a bomb concealed in a drink bottle on Hitler's plane (a bomb that does not go off), he calmly retrieves the bomb from one of Hitler's aides, saying it was given to him by mistake. Not knowing if anyone was wise to him, he plays it as smoothly as if he were in no danger at all.Bill Nighy's General Olbricht is scared right out of his wits about the whole plot, but bravely pushes forward, showing that he is a man of honor, but still just a man.The sets are as much of a character as any of the actors and everything looks stately and grand, just as it did in the 'glory' days of the Third Reich. This is a very authentic looking film, and the uniforms look more like uniforms than costumes, something you don't always get to see in movies. Also, David Bamber did a chillingly creepy version of Adolf Hitler, maintaining the presence of a complicated, detached madman.Director Bryan Singer has portrayed these men in a very honorable, ethical manner and has done real justice to their memories. The plot unfolds with time line titles and clear direction. We collectively hold our breaths watching the events unfold, understanding what is at stake and what is to come. These truly were honorable men, and although they failed, history would bear them out to be the heroes that they were.",10,2,3,9 August 2009
