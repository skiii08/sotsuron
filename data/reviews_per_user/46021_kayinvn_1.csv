It," A great movie that lives up to the hype.
","IT is one of the best horrors of the last 10 years in my opinion. Using many different camera angles to draw fright Andr√©s Muschietti really tries to make IT a visual feast. At times the CGI is a letdown, with many of the monsters (especially a flute painting) looking unrealistic, however this is made up for with the amazing looking Pennywise, who does not fail to live up to Tim Curry's well regarded performance. When the movie focuses on the story of the losers club and their personal bullies, IT shines, the characters have great chemistry that really forwards the story, and each character has their own distinct personality's. All in all, IT was a great movie that lived up to the hype.",10,10,18,25 September 2017
