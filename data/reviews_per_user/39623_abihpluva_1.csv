The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Amazing.
","Amazing. No words can explain how easy it is to relate, understand and sympathise. I loved it so much, and Emma Watson and Logan Lerman are the perfect two for this. Best movie ever, inspiring, special, never seen anything like it. Would recommend this to anyone, great if you feel like you've lost yourself or are down for any reason. Set in the 1960's, it has Thee Smiths and Rocky Horror crowd-participation shows. It shows all the awkward things that happen in high school- but the depth is so much more. Many inspiring quotes that'll make you think about your life and how you're living it. It was great how the author was also the director of this piece, and it was just so perfect. Words can't even describe. If you haven't seen a good movie in a while, or read a good book for that matter, watch/read this.",10,1,3,13 January 2013
