10 Cloverfield Lane," I never thought I feel like this again
","Oh, my, god. I grew up reading John Christopher's trilogies, staying awake all night to finish them. I never thought the mystery, sci-fi and bizarre, so gratifying to me as a teenager, would repeat now as an adult. I'm so glad I was proven wrong.I'm just gonna praise the film some more, so not to ruin anything for you. Oh, did they pull this off. This is a story very, very well-told.This is the kind of mastery in sci-fi story-telling I thought was lost forever. And this isn't a remake or just a good mishmash of previous short stories or films, but is totally original. Despite its mastery, I wouldn't have been surprised if it became a cult classic. But it seems it's having more audience than a niche group of nerds with good taste!",10,11,17,11 June 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Well, what would you expect?
","It's part of the franchise so you gotta see this. I mean, if the previous installments was fun for you. But let's be honest, as we got further away from the first X-men, which was a fantastic, full-fledged coming-to-life of the comics, it's got boring and boring. This one was just CGI.You couldn't much improve on anything. Acting was very good and so were the visual effects, but pretty much everything else was nothing cohesive.The point is, lower your expectations than you would, keep the TV on and have some popcorn, maybe do the dishes if you're at home. It's nothing serious in the story department.",3,1,4,20 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Meh!
","All the bad reviews were creepy, so I checked a bunch and to my disbelief so many came from users registered only recently and only reviewing this one film. That made me believe it's a smear campaign. But smear was it not!The film is good enough to enj.. to enterta.. Look, we all should stop expecting what was an exciting, whole-new-other-world-imagined in our childhood to be recreated or renewed in any sequel to suit us as adults. Maybe this is exciting for teens, as we were then. Although it now lacks all the world and character developments we had in the original installments and is left with meaningless action, underdeveloped figures and, honestly, a crappy story -even this description and that production still worked in the 80s and 90s. What we enjoyed as teens, this generation won't get from this. The J.J. Abrams' was the only version made for adults with genuine attempt at growth in complexity.",2,9,14,15 March 2018
