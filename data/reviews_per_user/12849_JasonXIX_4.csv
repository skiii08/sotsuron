First Man," Emo Armstrong
","This movie would have you believe Neil Armstrong never had a day of fun in his life. Sure, he may have been a quite and reserved man in real life, but this movie makes him out to be some brooding antisocial manic depressive. He's literally one step away from applying black nail polish, and listening to the Cure alone in his bedroom.The effects are great, and really give the impression of what it must have been like on the moon. Other than that, you're better off watching 'Apollo 13' or 'The Right Stuff'. At least those movies don't treat space travel as a strictly somber affair.",7,1,2,3 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," This is why we go to the Movies
","This is a movie best enjoyed on the Big screen, with a large audience. We can nitpick and overanalyze small plot details, but overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a great experience. To tie all these movies together, as best they could, is no small achievement. As more people continue to stay home and stream content, this movie is a reminder of the true power of cinema.",8,2,3,27 April 2019
Insidious," An Insidious Reboot
","Basically a reboot (or ripoff) of Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, The Sentinel ect. Barbara Hershey even has a part in this movie, just so the Director can acknowledge how much he is ripping off The Entity. Overall, a simple plot with plenty of jump scares and loud noises to add excitement to an otherwise lazy, by the book horror film.",4,1,1,14 September 2019
Marriage Story," Kramer vs Kramer 2
","Another movie about divorce and child custody. We all know divorce is terrible, a 'death without a body' as the movie states. But, this movie isn't concerned with sending a message. It isn't really about plot, or story, it's about great acting, and fully developed characters. The characters are so well written, each with their own flaws, it's difficult for the viewer to take sides. It's a character study of two well meaning people that just shouldn't be together.It's a well made film, but at the end of the day you could also just watch Kramer vs Kramer, Mrs. Doubtfire, or one of the other thousand movies about divorce.",8,8,11,14 January 2020
