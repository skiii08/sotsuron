The New World," Why did they make this movie?
","I expected this movie to be a cross between Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans. Unfortunately it proved to be a cross between a boring storyline mixed with weak fighting scenes.As a drama it's weak. As an action story it's weaker. As a historical tale it's even worse. The only saving grace is an A-list cast...Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. Sadly, none of their characters are explored in any great depth. Coupled with constant Shakespearian a-la-'how do I love the' monologues, this has to be the worst movie I've seen in recent years...and I've seen Gigli! Stay away from this movie. Don't rent it. Don't watch it. Just don't.",1,22,36,14 June 2006
The Longest Yard," Stupid but Funny
","An ex NFL football player (Paul Krewe) gets thrown in prison for DUI. He's then forced by the warden to train the prison's convict football team for a match against the prison guards. The team just happens to made up of the biggest misfits in prison history. Simply hilarious if you enjoyed movies such as Major League, Bul Durnhahm and Smokie and the Bandit. This movie follows the same type of off-beat, silly and laugh-out-loud humour.Loads of muscles, slap-stick gags, fantastic one-liners between the characters and sheer madness.Good think-free fun, perfect if you're in the mood for silly humour. Don't expect 'A League Of Their Own', expect 'The Mighty Ducks' on steroids gone mad.Not a master piece but perfect for it's genre.",6,0,0,10 November 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," This is what movies are all about
","Silly, over-indulgent fun with a great cast and crazy storyline.The Cast in Ocean's 11 was spectacular. To add Al Pacino in the mix makes it even more spectacular. The departure of Julia Roberts makes it even more fun.This time it's not for money...it's for revenge...and money. Lot's of silly humour, funny dialogue and bad acting. Perfect! The director and actors try to remind you that this is a film and as such none of them take any of it seriously. However this has the effect of putting a smile on your face and adopt a 'just go with it' attitude.Clooney and Pitt don't put any effort at all into their performances, they might as well be sitting on their couch at home scratching their nuts. But neither did Dino and Sinatra. But the chemistry between them is amazing. The final scene sees them making fun of George's real life bachelorhood and Pitt's real life Kid-fostering obsession with Angelina Jolie.A noteworthy performance from Andy Garcia, who usually doesn't do 'Hollywood' movies. He joins Pacino on screen again for the first time since Godfather 3, although they don't share any screen time together.The one who steals the show is Matt Damon, Look out for him trying to seduce Elen Barkin.See this movie, it's great fun and reminds you that cheesiness done properly is fantastic.",7,1,4,27 July 2007
Jarhead," All wars are different. All war movies are the same
","Jarhead follows the dramatic experiences of a US marine (and his unit) during the first gulf war. The movie makes an effort to stay away from the justifications for the war, focusing rather on the effects it had on the marines involved.If you enjoyed Tigerland, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, this movie should high on your ratings list...until you watch it.The film will does not make a deep impact. The experiences of the marines are shown as dramatic, but not traumatic. The casualty scenes are graphic but not shocking. The scenery should be captivating but it looks fake and digitally enhanced. As a result, it has a clinical, almost distant, feel to it. It feels like you are watching a story rather than being able to relate to any of the characters.In a genre that demands powerful and thought-provoking film-making, this film is not even a shadow of Platoon or Apocalypse now. It lacks the ground-breaking style and sheer impact of either.The lead actors, although talented and charismatic, don't have the screen presence nor power of delivery needed to transform the story into a memorable film. That said, Jamie Foxx turns in a wonderful performance and steals the show as the platoon leader. But he's definitely no Robert Duvall or Martin Sheen.This is an interesting movie, with some touching scenes and fantastic dialogue. Ultimately it lacks depth and impact. Consequently it becomes just another movie in an over-exploited genre that hasn't seen anything ground-breaking in years.",6,0,1,30 October 2006
Inside Man," Wait for it on DVD
","I was disappointed with this film because I expected great things from the incredible cast list. This movie is extremely slow-paced and won't keep you on the edge of your seat.A bank robbery turns out to be more than just a bank robbery. It's apparent right from the beginning that there is another motive for the bank to be hit other than money. The director uses too many clues to hint to you that things are not what they seem, eventually making the predictable twist even weaker than expected.Considering that there are 3 Oscar winners in the movie, the performances are not very memorable. Denzel's lines are not strong enough and his character lacks charisma. Jodie Foster steals the show with only a few minutes of screen time and Christopher Plumber is a pleasure to watch but doesn't have enough screen time to make it a strong performance.As for the main actor, Clive Owen, his character is so boring I almost fell asleep...and my friends actually did.This movie is being compared to Dog-day Afternoon, but Owen is no Pacino.Wait for it on DVD. Don't buy it. Don't go to see it at the big-screen",6,1,2,28 September 2006
American Gangster," The Black Scarface
","This movie is a true story based on the life of an African-American drug dealer rising through the ranks of New York drug dealers, using his charm, intelligence and sheer determination to overcome any obstacle to live the American dream. Sound Familiar? The best way to describe this film is a toned-down version of Scarface. Not as gritty and 'in your face'. Volatile but not very violent. Aggressive but not explosive. Interesting but not thrilling. In the end, it goes a long way to be extremely entertaining but falls short of being gripping. It lacks the charisma and rawness of Scarface and the result is a low-impact but extremely watchable gangster movie.It delivers your staple gangster diet of shootings, threats, revenge-taking, power-trips and 'what you gonna do about it sucka?' lines that you crave so much as a gangster movie lover. With the added bonus of showing you not only how powerful a man can become but also the price he pays for it. Or does he? Definitely worth watching to find out.I'm a great gangster movie fan and I watched this movie purely based on the fact that I thought Denzel Washington would make a fantastic gangster. I saw his performance in Man On Fire and thought he is ideally suited to play a cool, collected and deadly man. He plays the role more like a professional hit-man than a loud gangster. Class and dignity is a key theme. Crowe throws in a good performance too but more forgettable. They're both Oscar winners but they lack the enigmatic factor. Don't get me wrong...the acting is descent but you get the feeling that the movie is somewhat saved by the actors, not by the acting itself. The headlining A-list names attract you, not their performances in the role. They've both had much better roles in the past (Training day, Gladiator etc). In other words you wouldn't go to see this movie if it were Ted Danson and Louis Gossett Jr in the main roles but you would be equally entertained when watching the movie itself? You will enjoy this film because you love gangster movies and because there hasn't ever been a decent African-American gangster movie made until this one. It is worth watching but don't expect a masterpiece.Ultimately you will be very aware throughout the film that you're only watching it to find out what happens to the main character, not because the movie is good.I'm giving it a 7/10 but only because I know you'll enjoy watching it if you're a gangster movie lover. If this isn't your genre, then it's still entertaining but would only score a 5/10.For lovers of Gangster movies only then.",7,0,1,15 April 2008
Defiance," A masterpiece!
","This is the story of the Bielski brothers who fled to the forest's of Bela-Russia when their little farming town was attacked by Anti-Semites during the Nazi invasion of that region. Using their knowledge of the woods they find an area deep within the forest where they eventually settle. Realising that leaving the forest would mean certain death, they eventually build a small settlement and plan to stay there until the war is over.Word soon spreads amongst Jewish refugees that the Bielski's offer protection from Nazis to any Jew, with the result that eventually there are hundreds of Jews running into the forest to join them.True to their word they never turned away any Jew.The movie centres around the disagreement between the two older Bielski's, who have different points of view on what is the best way to lead and protect their fellow Jews. Tuvia (Daniel Craig) would rather 'save 10 Jews than kill one Nazi', whereas his brother Zeus believes that attack is the best form of defence.As the Nazi's eventually find out where the settlement is and begin to attack, the question is now whether to run and hide or to stand and fight. In the balance of the Beilski's decisions hangs the lives of 1500 people, including the life of their two younger brothers. What decision is best? This move is an epic tale, masterfully filmed and superbly acted. It is a triumph on par with Schinlder's List and Life is Beautiful. There is enough suspense and drama to keep you on the edge of your seat, fragmented with small scenes of humour and love in just the right places.The story itself is a testament to the strength of the human spirit at the centre of history's darkest hour.The finest film this decade. The finest holocaust movie since Schindler's List.A MUST SEE.",10,1,5,6 March 2009
Heat," Good but not fantastic
","This 'De Niro Vs Pacino' showdown could never possibly live up to the the hype surrounding such a movie. And this is basically the problem. For huge De Niro and Pacino fans (such as me) the two of them on screen together could never meet my expectations.This cops'n robbers movie feels like less than the some of it's parts. There is a slow, almost romantic, feel to the movie. Pacino's performance feels tired. De Niro looks uncomfortable with the two of them on screen together and even a little intimidated by the prospect. I think Michael Mann must have had a hard time deciding who would play the cop and who would play the robber. Watch the film and find out.The rest of the cast includes Jon Voight, who's character is supposed to be some sort of sleazy criminal master mind. Voight however looks extremely old and you get the feeling the director just wanted another big name to place on the poster. Val Kilmer's performance is surprisingly good, considering the titans he's sharing the screen with. You immediately feel sympathy for him.It is however a little-known actor (in comparison) by the name of Dennis Haysbert who steals the scene with the few minutes he has on screen. He plays an ex-con who's decided to go straight and is heavily supported by his wife. There is a scene between them that brought a tear to my eye when she tells him she's proud of him and doesn't understand why.What Michael Mann does get right is the depth of the characters. Each character's life is explored in every area. The effects of their chosen profession on their personal lives is a central theme. As a result you feel sorry for both criminals and cops alike. All characters are shown with flaws, even the good guys.The problem with pitching Pacino against De Niro is that one of them has to win. Throughout the movie I hoped that both would. You'll have to see the film to find out.All in all, I really hope that Pacino and De Niro team up again on screen, although it's probably unlikely. If this is to be the only movie where they share on-screen time then it's a disappointment.Conclusion: If it wasn't for the cast, this film would have gone straight to video. It is a fine piece of work but not fitting for kings of Hollywood.I recommend watching it if you're die hard fans of Pacino and De Niro. If not, then it's just another Cops'n robbers movie.",7,1,6,24 August 2006
