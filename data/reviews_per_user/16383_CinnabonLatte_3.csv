Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," How many times can you tell the same story?
","Like the Pirate's movies before it, this movie is entertaining feel-good, action packed comedy, but how many times can you tell the same story? While, Captain Jack sparrow still manages to amuse the audience with his dazed intelligence, the story and screen shots lacked freshness and ingenuity. Surely, Mermaids and Blackbeard add new twists, but plot is identical to the first movie. On top of it all, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp had next to no chemistry on screen. The days of the movie 'Blow' are behind them, its too bad. The 3D is more of a headache than an entertainment. The lighting of the movie is dim and smoky, and through the 3D glasses there are moments the audience sees very little. It is time to quit making these movies before they lose their appeal entirely.",5,5,17,17 May 2011
Limitless," Limitlessly possible?
","Bradley Cooper really surprised me in this movie. He plays a character that is different than his mainstream role of the good looking, but funny guy. He convinced me that he had brains, which are usually missing from a great deal of his other roles. Good job, Mr. Cooper. This movie's plot is pretty intriguing, and its possibility really excites the audience. But the plot has so many holes, that it does not take a genius to offer alternate ways to respond to the various crisis in the movie. The visual effects and color alterations effectively take the audience into 'an alternate state of mind', which really adds to the plot of the movie. Over all, this movie is worth watching because it is visually and intellectually enjoyable. However, the plot and writing could have been better.",7,1,3,19 May 2011
Thor," Thor could have been SO MUCH MORE!
","This movie had the potential to be, for lack of better word, epic. But it was not. The movie was good, but it could have been extraordinary. The story moves along much too quickly for the audience to develop any real connection with the characters. But there are a great deal of action shots, especially towards the first half of the movie that most people are going to really enjoy. The use of storyline from Asgard and the nine worlds is brilliant. This movie has the potential to make so many different categories of viewers happy because of the choice of story and actors, but I don't know why the director and writers failed to develop it fully? If you're going to spend that kind of money on the movie, why not push for serious completion? The movie felt seriously rushed. Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed, because I had high hopes. Nonetheless, I would watch it again for sheer brute fighting scenes. The movie does manage to get your heart pumping with adrenaline, which is a good sign. The 3D was well incorporated into majestic and powerful scenes, so kudos to the digital artists for that one! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!",5,2,5,17 May 2011
