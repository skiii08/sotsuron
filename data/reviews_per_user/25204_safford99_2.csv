United 93," A Powerful Film About True Heros
","Much criticism has been lodged against the makers of 'United 93' saying the film is too recent to document the horrors of 9/11 and that it is exploitive of the passengers aboard that doomed flight. Having seen the movie, I can say nothing could be further from the truth. In less than an hour those passengers had to overcome confusion, fear and shock in order to attempt to take back control of their plane. This film is a tribute to those passengers, and an important testament to human courage and the will to survive.Filmed in a cinema verities style, the first two thirds of the movie concentrates on the air traffic controllers and the military as they struggle to come to terms with what is occurring aboard several aircraft, and what they might do to avoid further casualties as the events unfold. One of the main strengths of 'United 93' is that it makes these events more human, and avoids laying blame in regards to what was an unprecedented and chaotic situation.Interspersed throughout these scenes are the happenings aboard flight 93. The movie doesn't provide us with back stories about the passengers and yet we come to understand and identify with them as we witness the horrific incidents that occur. The movie shows the struggle in the cockpit, and the murders of some of the crew, but it doesn't exploit them close ups, rather it simply films what is believed to have happened.The last thirty minutes of the movie is devoted entirely to the passengers and their fight to take back control. It is during this last half where the movie takes a brilliant turn with direction, acting, editing and music all merging together to make for powerful and gut wrenching conclusion. It is also during this half that we see the passengers making phone calls to their love ones in an intense montage as they express their love, their emotions, and their resolve to stand up for themselves. It is raw, it is hard to watch, and yet it is beautiful to see.The criticisms that I have are that I think there was too much hand held camera work in the control room scenes. I did feel a little nauseous at points as my eyes tried to focus. I also am not sure how true some of the events are that movie documents towards the end (there seems to be a little artistic license), but these are very minor criticisms. Overall, I think this movie is one of the best directed films I've seen since 'Requiem for a Dream'.I can understand people not wanting to see this movie. It's not easy to sit through, but for those who can, I do believe they will come away feeling moved, and oddly a little more optimistic about life and the events of 9/11.",10,3,7,29 April 2006
Paranormal Activity," Puts many main stream horror films to shame
","This movie is certainly a companion piece to the 'Blair Witch Project', but it is a much better film for two reasons: (1) everyone can relate to it due to the fact we all have to sleep at night and what might go on around us while we're sleeping puts us at our most vulnerable; and, (2) the climactic scene is a much better payoff than the ending to 'Blair Witch'.The film also puts most of the more recent Hollywood horror films to shame because its plot is simple. It's not trying to remake 'The Sixth Sense' by providing you with an unexpected twist ending or convoluted plot that ends up making no sense at all. You know at the start what's going to happen at the end and much of the movie's suspense comes from that sense of dread as well as from small, mundane occurrences filmed in a very sinister way.There is a little too much comic relief from the banter and squabbling of the two main characters which becomes annoying after awhile, but this is a minor complaint.Definitely a horror movie worth seeing, which stays with you after it's over, which makes it the best kind.",8,1,3,9 October 2009
