Men in Black 3," Back in Black
","They are back to prevent Earth from alien threats once more. And once again they do it with style and fun! MEN IN BLACK 3 is a sequel of this franchising that doesn't disappoint because it has all the adventure, fun and great CGI we were used to in the previous films.In this plot there's a time travel back to 1969 what makes AGENT K to be played by a different actor almost the entire film, but Josh Brolin does a nice job playing the young AGENT K. Nevertheless Tommy Lee Jones appears in the beginning and in the end of the movie.I did enjoy it especially for the fun and the great CGI, which is even better in the 3D version I did watch!",6,0,1,1 July 2013
The New World," The two lovers of Pocahontas
","Why doesn't this movie was just called 'The two lovers of Pocahontas' instead of 'The new world'? I think it would be fairer to the viewer! This movie wasn't what I expected. To resume my review I could use just one word: DISAPPOINTMENT, but I prefer to explain why I was expecting to watch this movie for a long time, but what I expected was something more related to the exploration of the New world itself, as the title, by the way, suggests (!) and not this 'lovely' romance of the princess Pocahontas (as the main topic of the plot)! I really think it's too centered in the Pocahontas story and it reduces much of the movie's interest, at least for me! As it wasn't enough, the film is too slowly paced, too melancholic, too 'poetic wannabe', and very boring at parts! Besides, it has some incredible lacks in production. I can remember one scene, right in the beginning, after the ships have taken off to England, the colony (Jamestown) was infected by disease, the men were dying, and one of them said to Captain Smith that they were just 38 a few scenes later, when they are fighting the natives, WHITOUT ANY REFORCES, they seem to have dozens of men, a number too larger than 38 But that's just an example There're much more The soundtrack is also awful! Orchestra music, with strings and piano sounds, in a movie which its main topic is the exploration of the New World? Come on! It has no sense! The only music piece which I liked in this movie was a Renascence piece, near the end, when Pocahontas is meeting the King of England. It was the only one appropriated All the rest was nonsensical (to the movie's theme) and pseudo-poeticWell, what else can I say? Just maybe this movie was one of the biggest disappointments in the last times and it explains it all!",3,1,4,16 August 2007
Walk the Line," The man in black
","WALK THE LINE is a biographic movie about the country music legend Johnny Cash. It begins in Cash's youth and it goes until the moment he marries with June Carter. It describes some crucial moments in the artist's life and, as far as I learned, the film is quite accurate about them (about what really happened in Johnny Cash's life). I enjoyed it as I also enjoy Cash's music.The performances of Joaquin Phoenix (which plays Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (plays June Carter) are quite good and convincing, especially if we take in consideration that is not easy, for any actor, to play a role of a real character (someone that actually exists in real life)! I think that both of them did a good job as actors and also as singers! They both sing very well too! In fact I must I say I enjoy their versions of Cash's songs as much as the original ones!",7,0,0,6 April 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Kazakhstan is the greatest nation in the World'
","This false documentary about a Kazakhstan's journalist that is crossing America (or the U.S and A, to be more specific!) to do a cultural research to improve is own country is just hilarious! I already knew Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat from the 'Ali G' series, so I really was expecting something like that: funny from the first to the last minute! The movie is of course a caricature of Kazakhstan, but in many moments it also makes fun of the Americans and their way of life it's made with some refinement, but it's done! Do you want an example? When 'Borat' is singing a stupid lyric with American Anthem's music or when he's learning some good manners to be at a dinner's party In fact, I'm start thinking that the Kazakhstan's character 'Borat' is just an excuse to make fun out of the Americans! The footage and the music are also very good. They make a great ambiance to this character and really made me remind some old Soviet movie from the 80's!Basically it's another great work from Sacha Baron Cohen. Now that he made two movies based on his own characters (Ali G and Borat), can we expect another one for his other character, Bruno, the fashionable homosexual?",9,3,11,4 December 2006
Requiem for a Dream," 'Feed me Sara, Feed me...'
","It's a great drama about dreams, hopes, disillusions, loss of control, and self destruction. When you become a slave of your own dreams and are disposable to do everything to achieve them you will for sure do things you weren't expecting and you might lose control. If this single loss turns into a permanent loss of control you will not control your life anymore because those 'little things' which were 'nothing special' become into an addiction. Once addicted you will have this feeling always asking you to feed it... Like that scene where the TV show's host and the 'contestant SARA' ask to the 'addicted SARA': 'Feed me Sara, Feed me...'! I enjoyed that scene because I think it was great portraying her state of addiction. In the particular case of this character what turned her into this state was her obsession with the TV show and her loneliness. The other characters were drugs and their ambition to make money. Nevertheless in both cases there's a dream that becomes a nightmare because of their loss of control. This film is hard because it's about a very delicate matter, but it's also excellent because it confronts us to our most deep fears in a very crude, and sometimes even cruel, way. The acting job is great from all actors and the cinematography is just excellent! From the great camera shots, to the 'accelerated scenes' or to the 'cool combination' between images and sounds, it's really great! I think it's not completely original but I don't remember to watch many films with this kind of cinematography. The soundtrack is also very good mixing classical with electronic music. Globally it's a great film indeed; I score it 10/10.",10,1,2,24 November 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It might be great for the fans, but not for me!
","Not being a great fan of Hollywood Adventure/Action movies I never cared too much about Indiana Jones trilogy. However, with the recent release of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' I thought about give it a chance. I had in my mind to watch the trilogy in a row and then go to the theater watch the new film. But after seeing this 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' I changed my mind! It's not really my type of movie! I think it really is a classic and a top film for the fans of the genre, but not for me! I just don't appreciate this kind of cinema. Period. So, I won't waste my time (and money) watching the other films. Even so I will score it with a 'polite' 5/10 in order to respect one of the greatest legends of the movies' industry: Indiana Jones!",5,4,13,27 May 2008
Deja Vu," It's about one of the most Human's ancestral fantasies: To change the past!
","How many times do we want to change something we didn't right in the past? How many times do we have this feeling which tells us that one little detail could have changed everything? And how many times do we want to have the chance to come back into the past and do it right? That's the main topic of this movie It all begun when a terrible terrorist attack happens in New Orleans, a ship full of people explodes in the river. More than 500 persons were killed and there were no survivors. An agent of ATF, Doug Carlin (Danzel Washington), is called to investigate the case, and soon he starts finding some important clues. Then the FBI appeared and Doug Carlin is integrated in FBI's investigation, which is using an experimental (and revolutionary)technology that permits one to see what happened in the past, through a complex flux of energy When this movies starts it seems that there is something really original/new (the experimental project, at the beginning, is really nice! It's very well done and, by some way, it shows 'some credibility') but when the plot is growing the originality starts to disappear, and all that we see is some clichés that we all have seen before, in other Sci-Fi movies. I think the movie starts to lose its originality and interest when the main character wants to get back in the past and change it we have seen it before in the movies, haven't we?! And that ending This 'nice looking ending' fits so badly in the story! Wouldn't it be so much better if the 'time' and the 'happenings' could be faithful to themselves? I mean, the things just happen again the way they had happened before In my point of view it would have much more logic and would be a 'lesser romantic' ending than it was! Though it was an entertaining movie, a typical Hollywood one!",6,0,1,5 February 2007
Gravity," A different film!
","GRAVITY is a different film. At least it's not similar to any other movie I've ever seen and it clearly has some particular issues which turn it into a different and unusual film. Some of them are good, I would say even excellent, some of them are not so good The good things: GRAVITY setting is beautiful! The views of the Earth from outer space, the sunrise scene, the cosmonauts floating on space, all of this is done with beautiful images and scenes and with incredible CGI. The special effects are just amazing, superb, I would say! And I also did watch it in 3D and it was wonderful! A magnificent 3D experience, the best one I've had so far (I didn't watch too many films in 3D though). The acting by Sandra Bullock is great; she does an excellent job, but she's alone The soundtrack, it's also very good and every single track fits very well in the film.Now the bad issues: The plot! It's so tiny so little that it almost doesn't exist There's one plot in this film of course but it's so simple and short that I think that a movie with all this visual greatness and excellent CGI would deserve a better and more elaborated plot, even if it was around the same thematic! It could have been done with more characters, more subplots, etc I think it fell a bit too short that way (One example that this movie is too centred in the character performed by Sandra Bullock is when she arrives either on the ISS and the Chinese stations and there were nobody there, dead or alive! Why weren't there any cosmonauts? Did they were taking a walk on space? I don't think so :) So, together with some usual and typical Hollywood clichés, this lack of plot and the absence of other characters are the most let-downs in this movie to me. But as I said in the beginning all the rest is pretty good!",7,1,3,31 March 2014
Meet the Parents," 'I've nipples GREG, would you milk me?'
","GREG FOCKER (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse that loves his girlfriend PAM (Teri Polo) and wants to ask her in marriage, but after he gets to know that his future Father-in-Law (JACK BYRNE, played by Robert De Niro) would appreciate he would ask him his daughter first, he decides that would be fine to meet her parents on that purpose. So he goes to spend a weekend in her parents' home. Well, that weekend will not be easy to GREG, as an amount of unlucky occurrences happen, having always the same protagonist, GREG. Or I should say GAYLORD FOCKER (his real official name! LOL!).One more time Ben Stiller is great doing this kind of character. He's perfect performing the unlucky guy who just want a change but for whom everything gets always wrong! Robert De Niro, on his side, also performs a good and funny character, but that stills too close to his image. I thought that at least in this movie (a romantic comedy!) he wouldn't be a member of CIA Anyway I liked the performances from all actors. I just think that Owen Wilson's role is too short. Funny as he is he deserved better, but he was at the beginning of his career I suppose It's a funny and entertaining movie, with great laughs. Some of them made me cry of laughing! They're plenty I won't mention them all, but the scene (and the whole context) when De Niro says: 'I've nipples GREG, would you milk me?' was purely hilarious! Ben Stiller do it again! A good comedy!",7,1,3,24 October 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Could have been better
","When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times: 'It's not really what I expected, I thought it would be better', but now that I finished watching it I realize: why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn't it just a 'love story' made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? Captain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the 'Hollywood standard's' touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of 'plot holes' as this one is!) instead of this 'sweet story romance, with the perfect ending', which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a 'forgotten' Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! But the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History's knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe.Globally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the 'Hollywood show's standards' up-mentioned.",6,17,27,11 March 2007
Shaun of the Dead," The zombies are going to get you!
","It's a middle-laughable comedy, with many typical characteristics of the British humour, about a guy who is a loser but doesn't want to accept that! He lives with the typical friend who is 'even loser than him' and has a girlfriend that is fed up of him because he wants to do always the same things and wants to go always to the same pub: the Winchester! One morning, after his girlfriend dumped him, the world around started to change, people started to have strange reactions and an ugly face but he didn't even noticed! The TV news tried to warn him to a strange epidemic, but he didn't care! Until he found a sympathetic young girl in the garden that he, and his friend Ed, thought just to be a little 'stoned'!! Then, they woke up to the reality: Yes, there were Zombies to get Shaun, his friends and his mum!It's a spoof movie, a clear parody to the zombies' movies, having some great jokes  the ones that the British are specialists to do  but it's not the kind of movie that you start to laugh in the beginning and just stop in the end! It has its moments. Some of non-sense comedy; some of intelligent humour; but also many of typical clichés. It's not excellent, but it's not bad either, it's just in the middle. In my particular case I got one extra element of humour: I found our 'friend' Shaun a bit similar (especially in his face) to a husband of a friend of mine (girl, of course)! It was pretty amazing imagine the film's title with his name, instead of Shaun's!!!",6,0,3,16 January 2007
Hostel," There's always an American hero!
","The idea I had about Hostel (from what I had heard and from all the marketing that was made around the film) was that it would be an extremely gore movie, one of those we just watch blood flowing everywhere and mutilated bodies on the floor. Ah! I also heard it had lots of sex (some people even call it pornographic I wouldn't go so far!).Well, Hostel has actually all those 'nice things' (for a gore movie, of course!), but it also have three features that are not so good! The first one is the nationalist crap, which I really didn't expect for a movie like this! The 'pride of being American' thing is so deep at some moments of the movie, that I felt even sicker seeing those scenes than the gory ones! The second, a good American movie must always have a hero A guy who does the divine justice and revenges all his dead friends It's so typical! The third, the portrait of Slovakia! Man, if I was Slovakian I would be insulted with this film! All that is showed is filthy buildings, old cars, abandoned kids on the street (in one word: misery!) and free sex! I know Slovakia isn't a rich country, that's for sure! It's a new democracy and they are reforming many important issues of their society, but I think the portrait done in this movie is the typical description of 'the civilized guy who's coming from an occidental industrialized country'. He's there (in the eastern country) just to search beautiful women and have some cheap sex!... It's so typical too! It would be a fantastic tourism advertisement: 'Slovakia, land of misery, wild sex and butchery!' But there was one detail I really appreciated in Hostel, in spite of being truly sick! It was something that I had never seen before: when the 'hero guy' was escaping from the cell where he was arrested he gets into a room that seemed more like a bath-house and, suddenly, enters a guy who asks him if it was goodif he did it slowly or fast if he liked to kill his victim! Then he realized he was in a kind of a 'Butcher's Club'! Those guys were paying to calmly torture and kill their victims, as they were going to a gym to do some relaxing exercises It's so sick, weird and cruel that I wouldn't even imagine that someone could create a thing like that! Sick, sick, sick! Globally I think Hostel is fine, but it could have been much better if the three 'issues' I mentioned before didn't exist. I would give it 7 out of 10, but,because of those reasons, it will be just 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,17 April 2006
Hot Fuzz," 'This is something I've to do myself!'
","HOT FUZZ is a nice cop movie that we can easily insert in the action/comedy genre. It has very intelligent humor with nice and sharpened jokes, but also silly scenes with brainless funny moments.Simon Pegg does the main role and one more time he does a good job; a bit different from what I was used to see from him, but good. The rest of the acting is also fine.I'm not quite sure if it was a tribute or a spoof but that clear reference to BAD BOYS II near the end was kind of strange and explicit I must say! However, I guess we can split this film into two parts: one before that reference, and another after that. In the first half, it's a bit slow paced and centers in the investigation on the murders NICHOLAS ANGEL (Simon Pegg) did. The second half (about the last 30 minutes) begins when NICHOLAS says 'This is something I've to do myself' after see the BAD BOYS II DVD cover on a gas stationThis part is all about the action in a very fast pace! Nice action scenes were done here I must say.I did enjoy this movie, especially for the action and the jokes.",7,0,1,25 December 2009
Orphan," The evil ESTHER
","ORPHAN is a horror thriller about a little girl that is adopted by a family which suffered a recent trauma about losing a child. The family already has two kids, but the parents decide to adopt one more child probably trying to overpass that trauma. They choose a 9 years old girl which was born in Russia but speaks English very well as she's living in the USA for some years. At first the child is very kind and quickly calls their attention, but when she goes living to their home, some problems start appearing This film is not quite original because this kind of argument has been done for many times, but it has an unexpected twist near the end. At least it was unexpected for me in spite of not liking it too much! In fact I didn't appreciate that twist but I must say it was unusual in this kind of plot. I don't know if it's absolutely original though.About the production I think it is average for a horror flick. I must say I didn't find it particularly scary in spite of recognize it has two or three nice horror scenes.I appreciated the main character, ESTHER, played by the young actress Isabelle Fuhrman, because I think it's very rich and was very well created for a plot like that, but I also think it could have been a bit more explored It's not a great horror thriller but it's not bad either, I score it 6/10.",6,2,3,11 October 2009
Yes Man," Entertaining? Yes! Great? No!
","This movie has a nice message: Be positive in life, and it will be as you wish it would. This idea of positivity resumed in the 'Yes to life' quote is quite interesting and even being over exaggerated in the film is really good to use as an ideal for living... It's not really a novelty that positive feelings attract good things and negative ones deliver you into emptiness and loneliness, but it's always good to remember that. Even knowing that in real life things are not so easy to solve like in the movies, especially those made in Hollywood, is good to remember that positive thought! Well, in fact I think the real good feature of this film is its message. As a film itself it's so so... There're a few nice jokes, some good laughs but nothing exceptional. The acting is average. Jim Carrey has a role to his measure, as expected, and Zooey Deschanel does a regular performance either. Rhys Darby who plays NORMAN does a funny character. He and Jim Carry look stupid but hilarious with those HARRY POTTER suites! Globally I think it's an interesting film especially because of the main message, but it could never be great because it follows too much some Hollywood's canons, what make it a 'pop corn flick'... therefore entertaining but not great!",6,2,3,21 May 2009
Zodiac," It's more like a documentary than really a movie!
","This film by David Fincher based on the real story of an American serial killer that called himself Zodiac, is more like a documentary than really a movie! OK that Fincher's work probably has some fiction, that's not the point, what I really mean is that this 'movie' is almost all done in a reported way. The plot is about the all investigation since it's beginning in the later 60's to our days; so there are too many time holes. If there's fiction (I don't know the real facts and I didn't even read the book, so I can't be sure), and I suppose there is, it's probably just some insignificant details, because the main elements 'seem' to be true I don't know, I just didn't appreciate too much this 'documentary style' in this movie. On one hand it's more faithful to the true events, but on the other hand it turns the film a bit boring and not suspenseful. And it's a bit long too. All in all it's not a bad film, but could have been better.",6,0,1,10 January 2008
Cloverfield," A false documentary
","CLOVERFIELD is a movie that - like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT did some years ago  is based on a false documentary. I mean there's an amateur film, shot in the first person, about something else and then something strange, which was definitely not supposed to happen, occurs, creating the point of interest of this false documentary. That's what happened with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and that's what happens with CLOVERFIELD. However there're too many differences between these two movies, and almost all of them, in a good point, in favour of CLOVERFIELD. I can tell two of them: First, CLOVERFIELD never tries to induce the viewer that what was been taped was real, was actually truth, unlike BLAIR WITCH which tried to do so with terrible consequences... Second, the plot is very different and definitely CLOVERFIELD has a lot more of action, interest and suspense. Yet the ending is very similar and, again, too many people claimed a typical 'Oh, that's it? Has it already ended?!' But in my opinion I think it's a very good ending, the most logical one, and it could have happened even earlier I must say! About CLOVERFIELD I have to tell I enjoyed the experience of seeing a false documentary shot in the first person, more than I did with the BLAIR WITCH. Because of the above, but also because it was well done.",7,0,0,1 January 2009
Silent Hill," An entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell
","Based on a video game with the same title this movie is a good and suspenseful horror flick. The plot, which clearly follows the video game's story, is well built and leads you to a dark and atmospheric setting, the little village of SILENT HILL From the beginning it has mystery, suspense and a Gothic dark atmosphere that combined create an enjoyable ghost story. Following the game's premise the movie dwells into two parallel realities, the dark sub world that haunts Silent Hill, where the main character ROSE (played by Radha Mitchell) has fallen, and the 'real world' from where CHRISTOPHER DA SILVA (Da Silva is a Portuguese surname by the way – played by Sean Bean), ROSE's husband, never came out In fact by plot's developments we see they are not in the same dimension The CGI are good but we can notice the clear inspiration in the game's computer graphics. A good example is the little creepy monsters of the dark world that appear along the movie; they are absolutely inspired the video game! The special effects are nice though The other issue that is brought by this movie and which is the most important one (on a social perspective) is the religious fanaticism. The entire plot ends being around this topic and I might say I did like its final disclosure (and its message) All in all I did appreciate SILENT HILL, it's not a movie to take too seriously (it's a video game adaptation!), but if we think about it just as an entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell, I guess we have a nice horror flick here!",7,2,3,18 June 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," 'The world is a cruel place'
","A good surprise! When I decided to watch this film I didn't know very well what to expect, since I had heard it was about the fantasy world created by a little girl; I generally don't appreciate and don't use to watch 'enchanting stories', but as this one won so many awards it called my attention, and I decided to give it a chance. I didn't regret! It's not really an 'enchanting story', but one related to the cruel world where we live! That's what I found more deep and interesting in this film: its message! We can live in a world full of war, hate, violence, that there's always a place to fantasy and innocence! The character OFELIA is the proof of that! She lives in a place full of death, violence and stupidity but she can create her own personal world of fantasy, where she truly belongs I really did appreciate the plot of this movie, more than its special effects; while at the beginning I would bet it would be the opposite! The plot is very well constructed and clearly separates this cruel world where OFELIA lives and the world created in her own mind. I guess there are no cross points between them, what makes this story real and more interesting in my point of view. The background scenario to the plot  the communist resistance after the Spanish civil war  is also very well created. The production and the special effects are great as expected, and the acting is very good too, especially by the main characters. CAPITAN VIDAL (played by Sergio Lopez) included! He's the typical cruel and inflexible fascist, but the actor did a nice job. I liked it more than I was expecting!",9,3,6,15 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," It would be a nice film if it wasn't so musical!
","This new movie directed by Tim Burton would be a nice film if it wasn't connected to the musical genre! The plot is good, the cinematography is excellent (as always happens in Tim Burton's films) but this thing of putting a song in almost every dialog of the movie is quite annoying! Irritating at parts! I saw MOULIN ROUGE and I liked it because I think the songs and the melodic dialogs are perfectly connected with the scenario and the plot of the movie, but in this case it has no connection! They just sing what they are saying, sometimes even without any musical sense or even harmony In my point of view it really puts this film down! I will score it with a few points just because of the plot and the good cinematography! It's a 4/10.",4,1,5,3 February 2008
21," The game is called 21
","21 is a movie about game, money and greed and also about how someone can lose his self control when it's all about making 'easy money' In the materialistic world we live nowadays money is the center of many things, even those which were supposed to have nothing to do with it, like love or friendship; so making 'easy money' is a real temptation even if you have to lie, forget your old friends or to do schemes to achieve it! The main character of this movie can tell it very wellIt's a nice movie about this subject and it shows us the frightening world of Las Vegas casinos'. The plot is quite interesting and appealing and the cast is also good. I score it 7/10.",7,5,6,5 December 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," You shall never give up!
","It's a touchable film. Most of all I think this movie has a clear message, that is transmitted to the viewer in a growing wayFirst, it just seems to be a slogan, one of the 'nine steps' to win, but then we start realizing that it's really a strong message, the main idea of the film: be yourself, do what you want to do and don't care about what other people will think, never quite, never give up, even if you are afraid to lose, and you will be a winner because 'losers are people who are so afraid of not winning, they don't even try' (it was said by 'grandpa' in the movie)And that's so true! Sometime we are so afraid of what can happen that we just give up and don't even try to do something that we would like, just because we are afraid of the consequences! I see myself here, and I think that's the point of the movie, make people think about themselves, and the others around them, especially the closer ones, family and friends I won't say it's a comedy, in my point of view it's far from that. I think it's a drama with a sarcastic humor. It had some comic moments, but I guess that many people will review themselves in those moments I really appreciated this film, it's not so hilarious as many people told (it's not the comedy of the year!), but it actually has a refreshing touch and made me think about some issues that I didn't expect to when I decided to see this movie.",7,7,11,12 October 2006
The Shining," Terrific essay on Human's insanity!
","There's no doubt that SHINING is a major classic of the horror genre, but it's even a bit more than that. It's the horror movie elevated to the 'art status'. I mean, unlike the majority of the horror films which use the same kind of plot, stereotyped characters, clichéd scenes, and worst of all, are produced and reproduced in endless sequels, SHINING is a single and unique piece of 'Horror Art' (as PSYCHO was until they remember to do the first sequel in 1983). It doesn't mean that SHINING doesn't have some clichéd scenes, because it has indeed (I can remember the scene when WENDY lock herself in the bathroom and tries to escape through that little window where barely could pass her head), but if we 'forget' about the few clichés it has we really have a good horror film here. On the other hand, in this movie, horror is more symbolic than actually gory. It is mainly symbolic icons which create the horror scenes, so we can definitely say it's more a psychological horror movie than really a gore fest. In fact, there's almost no blood, if we exclude those 'blood waves' gushing out through the corridors (here it is one of the symbolisms I did refer). More than a horror film, SHINING is a terrific essay about Human's insanity, because it explores until the edge the loss of self control and the irrationality of the Human mind! And to do that disturbed character, JACK TORRANCE, who better than Jack Nicholson?! He really looks like a true lunatic! Superb acting I must say! He has the perfect face, expression, sarcasm! On the opposite side it's the acting by Shelley Duvall, which plays WENDY TORRANCE! It's really bad! She doesn't convince at all playing the victim, as her acting just seems too fake to me! Danny Lloyd, the small kid, also does a nice performance. Excellent film, I score it 9/10!",9,5,9,20 May 2008
Disturbia," 'THE FAMOUS FIVE' in Famous Three version!
","LOL! A big laugh was what came out of my mouth when I saw the IMDb general users' rate to this movie (7/10), after watching it. How can a 'FAMOUS FIVE' type of movie like this have such rate? In fact watching this I felt like watching a 'THE FAMOUS FIVE' episode but with the difference that this one tries to be a real suspense movie! Well, it tries, but of course it fails, because everything looks so pathetic in this film! First, those 'kids' are too old to play the 'FAMOUS FIVE' kind of adventures (spying a psycho killer in the neighbourhood! What idea could be more childish and 'FAMOUS FIVE' type than this??). Second, what kind of psycho killer tries to kill his victims in his home, at night, with the windows open, the lights open, and near the windows??! (I'm still thinking why he didn't come to the window and shout out loud: 'Hey neighbours! I'm killing someone, don't you want to see it??!). Hummm, thinking better I guess I found a kind of psycho killer that could do a thing like that: the psycho killer from a film like 'SCARY MOVIE'!!! Third, everything else looks so clichéd and boring: the predictable 'romance' between the main characters; the figure of the psycho guy, so stereotyped and close to the figure of a 'bad guy'(!); his house (he also has the clichéd type of house that looks so small outside but it's so biiiiiiig inside and full of slashing rooms!); the pseudo-suspenseful scenes like that one in the basement when the main character was surrounded by floating bodies! Oh, so scary! Oh, so suspenseful! Why didn't anyone told me before it was a teenage movie trying to be a pseudo-suspenseful movie?! I wouldn't have spent two hours of my time with it!",2,2,4,8 April 2009
Being John Malkovich," This film is completely odd, but also refreshing and innovative.
","I was curious to watch this movie since I read its plot synopsis, but I never thought it would be so good, I mean, this film is great! Some people say it's a just shameful auto-promotion by John Malkovich, but who cares?! If it's so, just let it be, because I don't care if the title is 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Being Cameron Diaz' or even 'Being the Pope' (!); what really matters here is the movie's concept, its original idea and its message to the viewer! And about that I must say you something: it's really fantastic, one of the best movies I've seen latterly by Hollywood! The plot is original, fresh, and really different from what I've seen so far. At the beginning I just felt oddness, because the story was completely senseless, out of any possible and reasonable logic, and to increase even more this feeling of strangeness it had an alternative kind of humor, which passed too many times from the hilarity to the absurdity. But it was great either! (I can remember that scene when Lotte, Cameron Diaz's character says: 'I think it's kind of sexy that John Malkovich has a portal, you know, it's sort like he has a vagina! It's sort of vaginal, like he has a penis and a vagina!' LOL! That's crazy stuff, man!). But if the first part of the movie is completely strange and out of any logic, the second part start giving us some answers, a bit crazy too, but at least with a little logic The performances of the four main actors are great too: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine keener and John Malkovich did excellent acting.This film was really refreshing and innovative. It's good to see Hollywood making alternative and excellent movies again",10,5,10,30 October 2007
The Machinist," When you're guilty, you're never alone!
","When you're guilty, you're never alone, there's always a shadow persecuting you Your head just seems to feel heavy and your eyes will not close to sleep Guilt will control your life, your feelings, the relationships you have. Anyone is suspect, there's a plot against you! You must find who's behind all this but it's all in your mind! This movie is just E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T! It has an exceptional photography as the entire film seems to be shot in a dark room! It's a 'film noir' for excellence and all the grey and dark colours just give it an intense atmosphere. We can feel the dark ambiance, the dark emotions and the suspense just through its photography, but there's morein fact, there's a lot more! There's a tremendous plot, there's great characters(Christian bale is just unbelievable!), there's mystery and suspense until the end of the movie At the middle is a bit hard to understand the plot, because the clues are confusing, some characters are mysterious and sometimes it just seems that they don't even exist but all the questions will be solved I really appreciated this movie not only because of its plot or its photography but especially because it has a message of hope and redemption. There's always a solution for something you have done wrong and you just need to find it to make yourself free! It's in the end of a dark and tortuous labyrinth, but it is right there... you just have to choose between the 'Highway to hell' or 'The Road to Salvation!'",10,7,10,5 May 2006
Bad Teacher," She's possibly bad on teaching, but she's very good on many other things!
","BAD TEACHER is an enjoyable comedy featuring Cameron Diaz on the main role. It's funny, entertaining and it shows us a 'bad ass' Cameron Diaz, which is a teacher that does everything except instruct her pupils The plot is quite nice and even a bit uncommon, at least for this type of comedy. The jokes are very good, especially some of them which are very subtle but effective. One thing that I did appreciate - and it's not very common in this type of movies - is that the main character ELIZABETH (played by Cameron Diaz) didn't get punished by her 'dirty schemes'. In fact the end surprised me a little bit because her personality and her behavior didn't change as much as I had imagined when the movie started. And that is good because it didn't feel clichéd. Overall I think BAD TEACHER is a refreshing comedy that deserves a 7/10.",7,2,4,10 November 2011
Tropic Thunder," It's refreshing and funny.
","This movie is very refreshing, because it's a spoofing comedy but not a 'common one' as SCARY MOVIE, HOT SHOTS, or the awful recent spoofs like DATE MOVIE or EPIC MOVIE. No, this one is original and very well done, because it mixes great jokes (some of them are excellent black humor), good action scenes and critics to the own movies' industry (and also the music industry). All this inserted in a real plot. It's not an amount of pasted spoofing scenes, as some spoofing movies use to be.I liked the story, the acting, the jokes and those trailers at the beginning (in spite of that idea not being so innovative like that. We had seen it before on PLANET TERROR by Tarantino and Rodriguez).About the acting I enjoyed the performances of Ben Stiller, Jack Black (He's completely crazy!...) and Tom Cruise (nice make up).",7,1,5,22 September 2008
The Butterfly Effect," What if this what if that what if
","BUTTERFLY EFFECT is a thriller with alternative realities and past changing as subject. It is suspenseful, fast paced, thrilling and has a lot of imagination; however, it falls into a serious problem: the 'what if' matter! And if I changed that moment, how would it be? And if that instant was changed, it would be different This film is a constant roller-coast of 'what if(s)' that turns it unrealistic beyond unrealistic! What I mean is that the film 'forgets' about one important detail: our lives and this reality where we live (I won't even discuss the time and space matter, and possibility of time travelling, which is also brought up in this film) is a constant of 'what if(s)'! So, even if he could change a moment, in a very distant past (all the changes he does are from a distant past, when he was a child or a teenager) nothing could assure that this distant future would only depend of that particular change! That's what I find more unrealistic in the movie! He changes a lot of years based just in some particular moments when he was a child or a teenager. And in those years, nothing happened that could have changed his life? There's a kind of a hole between when he's seven, when he's thirteen and when he's twenty! Nothing happened in his life during those years?! However I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie. I think it has a good premise (in spite of being bad explored, by the reason I up-mentioned) and it definitely has a suspenseful and entertaining plot. And I did appreciate the ending I must say! In fact I think that was one of the fewest logical modifications he could makeThe acting is also good, especially by the actors who have changed characters, and in particular, Amy Smart. I think she did a very good job! Globally it's a nice film, I just think it has an unnecessary lot of 'what if(s)'",6,0,0,28 March 2008
Meet the Fockers," 'I'm going to be PAM MARTHA FOCKER'
","The sequel of MEET THE PARENTS was absolutely necessary since in the final of the first movie JACK said he wanted to meet the FOCKERS It's in the same line of the previous movie but now with the crazy (and I mean crazy!) FOCKERS. In fact I must say these characters BERNIE FOCKER (Dustin Hoffman) and ROZALIN FOCKER (Barbra Streisand) add something to the sequel; especially Dustin Hoffman, who does a very funny and unusual character. Like in MEET THE PARENTS there're lots of gags and funny scenes in this movie, with new elements and a new scenario, the FOCKERS' ISLAND! I did enjoy the first movie a little better, but I also enjoyed this one; and once again is proved that people so different can be part of same 'circle of trust' many 'troubles' later, of course!",6,1,2,25 October 2009
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," 'Hillbillies' vs. 'College Kids': Let the battle begin!
","What a hilarious film! I don't remember to laugh so much for a long time! TUCKER&DALE VS.EVIL is an amazing horror comedy that completely messes up with all clichés of the average horror film. I mean, the typical formula of 'group of college kids + woods + cabin in the woods + one or two hillbillies = horror film' is totally messed up in this film, but in a very intelligent and funny way.Through the entire film we see both sides, 'the hillbillies', TUCKER and DALE, and 'the college kids' and that's what make it funnier, because we see how they are both mistaken about each other ('college kids' think TUCKER and DALE are two homicidal freaks and they think the same about the kids when in fact nobody is a psycho killer well, nobody, except one But I won't spoil that). It's in this mood of bad misunderstandings and incredible (I would say hilariously absurd!) accidents that will occur the first deaths of college kids, and increase even more the animosity between them. Only ALLISON, a girl that was saved by the hillbillies from one of those accidents, will understand they're all mistaken, but it's too late and she can't do anything to stop the killing rush It's really an awesome comedy with a very good argument (and script) making fun of horror films (mostly the ones in the same genre of Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE), but as told, in a very humorous and intelligent way. The comical scenes are always based in the weird accidents and also in the DALE's character which is very naïf and insecure. All the characters are well built and are important to the plot.Beside all the fun and the jokes this movie also has two 'serious messages', both related to DALE's character: 1- You should never judge anyone by his/her appearance. 2- We should always believe in ourselves and fight for what we want. That is the 'serious part' of the film but for me what is really great in this movie is its humor.So, if you want a good laugh and see some gore too (it also has some nice blood scenes) you got to give it a try. I bet you won't be disappointed! (After watch the trailer my expectation about this movie was high but it was absolutely fulfilled). I score it 10/10.",10,0,0,28 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I Know I'm the one who is out of context here
","Not being a fan of superhero movies I watched a few days ago this Spiderman with a friend and the great conclusion I got was that I really don't appreciate this genre, at all! The good part was that we watched this film in an IMAX 3D theatre and the action scenes and the 3D effects were pretty good.Even so I can't score it higher that 1/10 because of the plot, the characters and all this 'superhero thing'!...I Know I'm the one who is out of context here though, because it seems to be a good film to the Spiderman fans",1,15,53,29 April 2014
The Nightmare Before Christmas," It has a very simple plot but it's visually stunning
","This long animation from Tim Burton is already considered a cult classic and surely a reference from this director. It's visually stunning and it creates characters and 'worlds' that can only truly exist in Tim Burton's mind and it is, in my perspective, its most valuable feature. The plot is very simple and straight to follow but in fact it's what matters the less! The scenarios, the colors, the strange characters, the black humor and its final message are what really matter in this long animation! I think it's a good movie in its particular genre Just to make notice I watched the 3D version. I score it 7/10.",7,0,1,30 July 2013
Mulholland Drive," Lost hopes and dreams in a twisted surreal puzzle
","I won't try to explain this movie, the plot or the characters, because the two most voted reviews here on IMDb do it very well and there're a few more sites on the Internet that also do it. All I can say is that the very first time I watched it, back in 2002, I didn't understand the plot, like anyone else (I suppose!), and I just start realizing it for myself when I watched it again today, passed all these years, for the third time. My conclusions were very close to the reviews mentioned. I just failed in a few details, which have little importance. What matters is that I came very close to the most important subject of the film: It's all about frustration, anger, jealousy, sadness, remorse and lost hopes and dreams all together to end in one single word: suicide! That's what really resumes MULHOLLAND DRIVE! Of course the plot is twisted, allegoric, symbolic and at parts even poetic and dreamful, but it's all part of the very particular and peculiar David Lynch's cinematographic universe. David Lynch's movies are full of symbols, enigmatic characters, and weird scenarios, like it all was just a part of a surreal puzzle. That's what I most love in this director and what makes me say with pride that he's my favorite director! Of all types of cinema! And what I really love about him and his movies is all this iconography and the visual elements and/or characters he creates to represent all the evilness, dirty and perversity that dwells in the Human mind, or to be more generic, in the Human condition In Mulholand Drive, these elements and characters are present, as they were in BLUE VELVET, TWIN PEAKS, or LOST HIGHWAY, some of them change, some of them are the same The enigmatic red curtains or the mysterious little man are two examples often used by Lynch. The 'Cabin of Fire' in LOST HIGHWAY or the 'Club Silencio' here on MULHOLLAND DRIVE are two more examples of these Lynchian allegories.The best two scenes in this film to me are precisely the minutes of 'illusion' both girls pass inside the weird 'Club Silencio', and the very last scene of the movie when those little old man and woman quickly transform themselves into those creepy monsters of guilt, remorse and despair that lead the main character to commit suicide! That last scene is sinister and weird! And even today when I watched it again, perfectly knowing what would happen, I couldn't avoid this chilling impact! In MULHOLLAND DRIVE I think David Lynch creates something that we can really call a masterpiece, because it has plenty of elements and ideas of his previous movies, as said, but it's all done in such incredible puzzle that turns it very difficult to figure it all out at the very first look.It's a 10/10 of course!",10,2,3,28 June 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Just the innocents always pay the price
","That's an intense and dramatic story set in the WWII about a little boy, BRUNO, son of a Nazi official commandant of a concentration camp, that doesn't understand why the 'farmers' that live next to his home wear strange pajamas (of course these 'farmers' only exist in his innocent imagination, as they are the prisoners of the camp). So, his curiosity (BRUNO claims himself as an explorer!), takes him to go next to the camp borders and meet a new friend, SHMUEL, a Jewish kid. Without the consent of his parents he starts visiting his new friend regularly, taking him some food. Their friendship starts growing until one day that SHMUEL's father disappears and BRUNO decides to help him to search his father It's a story of innocence set in a time and place of cruelty and completely disrespect for the Human life.I think the plot is very well built because it starts leading us to think it's just child' playing, completely innocent and harmless, but in fact it takes us to an ending of tragic and dramatic events.The characters are also good. There aren't plenty in this movie, but each one of them represent very well a different type of 'person of that period'. I mean BRUNO's father, the commandant, is a man of the regime. He's a convicted Nazi that thinks the elimination of the Jews will make Germany stronger and prosperous. His wife, in opposition, is the kind of person that is submissive, but is against Nazi's ideals and its cruel methods. BRUNO's sister, GRETEL, is the typical young teenager that is start 'waking up to the world outside', leaving childhood, but she's educated under those rules and those Nazi ideals, thinking any Jew is an enemy just because he's Jew; she represents those who belonged to 'Hitlerjugend'. PAVEL, a Jewish prisoner that works as a slave in their house, he used to be a doctor and now he's just treated like a dog! SHMUEL, the Jewish kid, represents all the prisoners and the Jewish victims; and finally BRUNO, a little kid, too naïf to understand the cruel reality that surrounds him. He represents the innocence and the goodness that exist in the Human soul when it's not corrupted by absurd ideals.As told the end was quite dramatic and intense, but I appreciated it though. In my opinion the final scene was a nice way to 'shock' the viewer and to let us thinking that just the innocents always pay the price",8,2,3,6 February 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," Like GRINDHOUSE, this movie is half Tarantino, half Rodriguez
","This film is a bit peculiar because it mixes two very different kinds of plot and movies' genres, and that's just because of that it works so well. In the 'first half' we watch a crime story with two outlaw brothers, SETH GECKO (played by George Clooney) and RICHARD GECKO (Quentin Tarantino) running away from authorities, after robber a bank and kill a few people. They kidnap a family, composed by a Pastor who lost his faith, JACOB FULLER (Harvey Keitel), his daughter KATE (Juliette Lewis) and his son SCOTT (Ernest Liu), and cross the border into Mexico. Arriving there they all go to a motorcyclist's bar, in the middle of nowhere, which claims it self to be 'open from dusk till dawn'. The 'second half' begins! After a great show by 'SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM (Salma Hayek)', a bloody and gory fight starts between these mentioned characters (and some new and funny ones which only appear in the bar, like the 'SEX MACHINE') and some vampires (which are the owners of the bar and the stripper girls). A very different kind of plot and 'movie' begins! From a crime and kidnapping story it passes to a gory vampire slasher! The main idea is quite original and funny, and we can feel Tarantino's touch on it. The screenplay is from him, in spite of the original story not be. I think it's another classic of the 90's, not because it's an excellent movie, but because its main idea worked very well and was quite refreshing. I also appreciated its humor and the great acting from the main actors. Tarantino included! The soundtrack is also fine, especially when they arrive at the bar. On the other hand, we can also notice Robert Rodriguez's directing through the many action scenes, done in his personal styleÂ… In fact, I would say it was the first experience where Tarantino and Rodriguez joined their personal styles to create a film. We can watch such idea more developed and matured in their recent GRINDHOUSE, but I think it was the very beginning. Because like GRINDHOUSE I think this film is separated in two very different parts: the first one with Tarantino's cinematographic style; and the second one with Rodriguez's!",8,0,1,13 April 2008
Black Snake Moan," The chains of freedom
","This is such a beautiful story of friendship and mutual aid! When I went to see this movie I didn't know what to expect, because I had heard nothing about it. I just knew it had excellent actors (Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci) and some blues but I didn't know anything about the plot, what it was about, and I must say I got surprised! I didn't expect something so strong, emotionally speaking! The message of the movie is great. It's about truly friendship and how people can help other people being better human beings! Sometimes people aren't what they would like to be, but many times it ain't their fault. What happens is that there are some 'ghosts' in their heads turning them into worse human beings and it's something that affects their mind and their emotional stability, and it makes them feel bad. But when they find someone that helps them to surpass those bad feelings, through friendship, affection and love (on a non-sexual way), that's the best thing that can happen in their lives! This movie is just about that To give strength to a story like this would be necessary excellent performances by the chosen actors, and in my point of view they did it! Samuel L Jackson is always an excellent actor, but this time he did a really good job. I would even compare this performance to the one he did on PULP FICTION. Christina Ricci is also great as the 'disturbed girl'. She really gave some deepness to this character.The photography and the production are also good.Beside, there're some nice blues! Excellent soundtrack I must say! I was also surprise about the Samuel L Jackson's voice! He has rhythm to the blues! Very nice movie! I'll score it 10/10 (mostly because of its message)!",10,3,6,16 November 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," It's a weird and different movie, but it's not that good!
","I was expecting something more from it With such high rate here on IMDb, some promising plot keywords (as 'amnesia', 'erased memory' or 'surreal') and great cast as it has, I was certainly expecting something much better! The main idea, in spite of not being bad, is not completely original and the way the plot was developed was not the best. I think it turned too much melancholic, repetitive, and too centred in this night of the 'erasing memory' process The 'surrealism' of this movie can only be connected to the mentioned process itself or to some weird settings that appear in some scenes of the film, since I don't think it's a 'traditional surreal' story. And the plot is not so non-linear either. It's pretty understandable indeed.As positive features I will refer the cinematography (there are really good settings in this film, and the idea of the things start to disappearing around him while his memory was being erased was also pretty nice) and the acting, which is not bad either. Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst were very hot in this film! The soundtrack I didn't appreciate too. I think it's too poor and sometimes it's just too weird, on a bad way Generally I think it could have been better, so I will score it 5/10.",5,5,11,13 February 2008
Avatar," Great fantasy epic tale which is inspired in real Human history
","New James Cameron's film AVATAR is an epic that mixes Sci-fi, drama, adventure, fantasy all together, which joined to the 3D technology was really a new and pleasant experience to me. I liked the 3D feature, but most of all I did appreciate the plot and the story which was told. That was one thing I thought I wouldn't like In fact I was afraid I would enjoy the 3D experience provided by this movie but would dislike the plot, but it didn't happen, at all! AVATAR tells us a story of fantasy in a distant world called PANDORA where Humans seek for a precious mineral which back to Earth would be worth millions. Their greed is so big that they don't care if they have to destroy its nature and a native race called NA'VI However they send an Avatar (a body with NA'VI's shape but controlled by a human) trying to make the NA'VI get out of their land peacefully in order to the Humans get the mineral without nobody getting hurt. But of course they don't, it's their land, for god's sake! So Humans need to use force, and a battle between races begins! So, in short words, that's AVATAR's plot, but what I found more interesting in all that is that behind all that fantasy, all those strange animals, vegetables and race we can easily link what happened in PANDORA to what really happened in Human history! I really think there're too many bonds between this epic tale and all what happened when European civilizations discovered, conquered and colonized America to pass unnoticed. In fact didn't the European force all native cultures to their rules, destroying those who opposed them defending their lands? And if we think about the Spaniard greed for gold in South America which conduced them to destroy advanced civilizations, as the Aztec or the Inca, we can easily compare the tale in AVATAR to the real facts of history (the difference is that real history facts' disclosure was not the same of the movie) Therefore, in my point of view, AVATAR has this merit of being a great fantasy epic tale which is inspired in real Human history. And it provides an extra dose of interest, veracity and emotion, at least for me Not being a brilliant movie AVATAR is a good one providing entertainment, action and emotion to the very ending moments I score it 8/10.",8,0,1,25 January 2010
Grindhouse," Planet Bizarre
","As many shall know 'Grindhouse' is being released, in Europe, separately, so what I will comment is just the 'Planet Terror' segment.'Grindhouse  Planet Terror' is absolutely funny and ridiculous at the same time; and the movie just works out because of that. It's all done on purpose! It's so absurd and bizarre at parts that just make me like it a little bit more because of that It has the cinematography that we all are used to see in Roberto Rodriguez's movies, with all the explosions, the intense action, the 'impossible scenes', the nice looking girls; but it has something else: a brilliant dark humour! The purpose of this project 'Grindhouse' is clearly 'to restore', in our fresh and young minds, the old 'horror garbage' from the 70's, the kind of cinematography present in the horror b-series movies that nowadays we only can find in the bottom of some old video-store; and that goal is achieved, especially because it has a Roberto Rodriguez's touch OK, the movie is a bit ridiculous, exaggerated, bizarre, absurd, but all the fun is just there, because it was meant to be like that!",6,0,0,24 September 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Society is a rotten orange!
","Today I've watched A CLOCKWORK ORANGE for the very first time. I had already seen other films from Kubrick as SHINING or EYES WIDE SHUT but I had never picked up this one, which is called to be one of his greatest masterpieces. Today I did it and I didn't regret as it is in fact a very good film! It stills not my favourite from this director since I liked those I did refer better, but it's a great movie with a great message.It's not the best film ever made as some people say but I would not mind to call it a masterpiece because it really has some brilliant scenes, messing up with the 'standards of modern society', religion, politics, and some of them are done with great sense of humor! One scene I recall, to be against the 'correct standards' - and it should have been a 'shock' back in 1971 - was that one when the leading character, by reading the bible, imagines himself whipping Christ on his way to the Calvary, wearing a Roman centurion uniform! It's done in such a way that it's even a bit humorous! On the other hand I did appreciate the final message of the movie (at least what I understood from it...), which is either you play right or wrong, you do good or evil, you are always protected if you are with the mighty ones... Not that I agree or follow this, but it's in fact what happens in real life, and I see this film and this message as a way to criticize our 'modern societies' and the way they are ruled nowadays. 1971 or 2015, at this issue the difference isn't that much...The soundtrack is superb, it's based on classical music, but they put some 'futuristic' electro-synthesized pieces of Beethoven in the most improvable scenes (violence, WWII...) A great movie from a master called Stanley Kubrick!",8,0,3,13 February 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," Open your eyes to this masterpiece!
","The last film directed by Stanley Kubrick, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a masterpiece, or by other words, a magnificent way for a director to finish is career. This film is too straight to follow, but at the same time very complex, because it's a deep reflection about a couple's relationship and intimacy. It's about love, jealous, matrimony, loyalty, and adventures outside matrimony, whether 'they are real or in dreams' The viewer watches the plot through Dr. William Harford's mind (played by Tom Cruise) and we feel his fears, his tension, his insurance about his matrimony and the loyalty of his wife. We can feel the tension growing and how lost he is! His wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), is also lost and confused, but she's controlling the game, to the point of testing him, telling him an affair she once had with a sailor man But did it really happen, or is she just telling her sexual fantasy to instigate him, to make him jealous? I think the end answers that! Aside from their relationship, this movie is also great for many other reasons! It's mysterious, suspenseful, odd and mystical! The scene where occurs that weird and mysterious party is amazing, because it creates a magnificent ambiance of seduction and mystery, but also obscurity and weirdness. No one knows who is who, behind those creepy and sinister masks, what increases the mystery. The ceremony scene is simply astonishing. Together, the music, the voices, the masks, the women, and the ritual it self create this bizarre and mystical ambiance, that is so seductive at the same time. It's one of my favourite's scenes ever I must say! From all types of cinema, from all movies I ever saw! The acting is great, especially by Tom Cruise, which does one of the best roles of his long and succeeded career. His character is quite lost, scared and confused and he plays it very well. Nicole Kidman also does a good job, playing his tempting wife.The soundtrack is amazing! I know it's not an original OST, since it's a very well known classical piece, but it's just brilliant, providing suspense and tension to the film.This movie is a masterpiece, and it resumes it all!",10,4,8,19 May 2008
The Descent," It had potential, but got lost with some clichés!
","This movie had a great potential to be a really scary movie, I mean, I suppose it's one of the darkest movies I ever seen! Darkness suggests fear, anxiety, expectancy, tension, the strange feeling of not knowing what is right there in front of us; and I think that in a scary movie a dark ambiance is a great way to create suspense to the viewer. So, this film had it, the dark ambiance but did it create suspense? No, not at all! At least for me, it didn't. In fact, I must say that the scene which scared me the most was right there in the beginning, with an intense daylight (!) Yes, it was the car crash! Absolutely unexpected, it provoked me a felling of 'wooohhh! What was that?! Three minutes of film and we see a car crash like that! Damn!' That really was a big surprise; the only one of the movie, the rest was very predictable. And those little creatures that were supposed to scare us I must agree with another user's comment which says 'they escaped from 'X-files'!The good points of the movie are the great ambiance of the cave, really dark, claustrophobic; the tension created between the girls (the feeling of disloyalty between them, that could have been increased to make more tension to movie); and finally the gore scenes, that were not 'strong bloody horror' as the DVD edition says, but were reasonably fine for an horror movie. I only think it was a pity that these 'nice bloody scenes' were made by those silly 'X-files' creatures So, to sum up, it had a nice potential but got lost with some old 'horror movie's clichés'!",5,1,4,20 January 2007
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's masterpiece!
","PULP FICTION is a great film, but it's not just a 'commonly great' film, it's a masterpiece! It's really a genius' work! It possibly was one of the first movies I ever saw with a non-linear plot, and at the time, probably 1995 or 96, I found it a bit strange and different but I liked it. Today, after all these years, I just don't find it different or peculiar, I find it brilliant, because now I can see so many details that probably, at that time, I didn't notice. In fact, there're so many 'little things' in this movie, which I remembered no more, that are crucial to understand the real meaning and significance of the film. It is very sarcastic and full of dark humor, but it also is a very good social and moral critic to the occidental culture where we live Even if it seems, at first sight, just a movie about gangsters and the criminal world where they belong, it is not, because it shows us a large number of scenes where friendship, honor, forgiveness, mutual aid, and the good Human values are present. So, it has a very strong message, behind all that blood and those killings. I guess I didn't notice that the first time I saw it But this movie isn't just brilliant because of the excellent argument, the remarkable acting, its great message or the nice soundtrack. No, it has an amazing and unforgettable humor! The entire film is full of sarcastic moments and phrase lines which stay in your head for years! Who doesn't remember the 'foot massage' conversation, the '5 dollars milkshake', the 'Royalle with cheese', the quoting of the bible or the guy which kept a gold-watch up his ass for five years?! These are classic moments of the modern cinema, as the film itself! It's definitely a movie which changed something in cinema, and it is, for sure, a classic of the modern times!",10,1,2,6 April 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Jesus Christ: One of the most famous personalities in History
","First of all I must say I didn't read the book (reading is not one of my favourite hobbies), so I wasn't one of those who went see the movie knowing already the entire story. For me it was all new! The movie wasn't really as I expected, because I thought it would be a lot more around a 'theological discussion' and not this 'religious thriller'. Even so, the plot is interesting and has great suspense until the end of the movie, when all 'mysteries' are reveled Now talking a little more about the Dan Brown's masterpiece itself, 'The Da Vinci Code', I think what really matters there is that he's trying to change something in history, especially in our Christian societies. We all used to see the Christianity through the point of view of some untouched dogmas. There are some 'truths' from we can't even have the littlest doubt, because they are just like that, and they will be this way foreverWe cannot change it, because it's sacred, it would be a Heresy! It's called a Dogma, and the Catholic Church has plenty of them. But the Dan Brown's novel tries to change some of these Dogmas, transforming some details of the life of this myth called Jesus Christ. And if he was a human being, with wife and kids, like all of us? Would it change the faith of people? Would people disbelieve Christ's words just because some Dogmas about his life were changed? I don't think so, but the Vatican doesn't have the same opinionOne thing is for sure, 'Son of God' or 'just human', Jesus Christ is one of the most important personalities of all Mankind's history. His life changed many things, and it's still being important to many people; so, either we like it or not, Jesus Christ's life will still be discussed, theorized and even 'invented' (in some details) for many years, as it has been so far!",6,4,8,18 May 2006
The Happening," The BAD happening!
","One more time Mr Shyamalan does a work with some potential in theory that ends being a tremendous crap in practice! Please Mr Shyamalan stop wasting Hollywood money and talent! Or on the other hand you can still writing, but please let the directing job for people who can really do it! In fact, Shyamalan writing in its essence is not bad because he can create arguments with some originality and alternative issues but, aside from movies like THE SIX SENSE or UNBREAKABLE, he just sucks as a director! In this movie, the only good issue is the plot's main topic: the idea of the plants create a toxic substance which make people commit suicide, protecting themselves against the most aggressive race on Earth, the Human race! This background idea is the only good thing of THE HAPPENING. All the rest is just pathetic. The film is too slow paced, and almost nothing really happens, as it is totally non-suspenseful and really boring. And what about the sub-plot concerning to the main characters' affections? Quite pathetic! One more time Mr Shyamalan does a movie with plenty scenes that can easily be spoofed in the next 'SCARY MOVIE'. As did happen with THE VILLAGE",2,5,11,15 June 2008
The Fountain," The search for eternal life
","'The Fountain' is a different film. The visual effects, the poetic style, the mythology and the non-linearity of the plot give it a unique style and form, different from everything else! The movie is not easy to understand, because it's all around a metaphysical and philosophical subject: the rebirth after death and the possibility of an eternal life but in the end its greatest value is to present the viewer a beautiful and poetic love story with great visual effects. In fact, visually, the film is very good, in spite of having some 'cliché ideas' about what could be an eventual life after death, and the ancestral idea of the Human soul floating in the Universe However, I liked the insertion of the Mayan mythology in the movie. The idea of parallel lives was also good, because it makes us think that time and space are not important, what really matter are the feelings",7,1,3,15 September 2007
Psycho," A major classic!
","Definitely a major classic! This film by Hitchcock is for sure one of the major classics of all times in movies' history. The argument is very good, the plot is well constructed and if we forget about the dated production we really have a great film.It's a mystery-horror story that grabs you until the end. Of course that I already knew the final twist even before watch it (because of this film being so fairly known), so it wasn't really a surprise; but I guess that if I was seeing it for the very first time without knowing anything about the movie it would be different I bet I would be surprised! Anyway, the story is good, the characters are quite known (who didn't heard about 'Norman Bates'?!), the acting is fine and the soundtrack is a classic! Fantastic! Those string sounds are effective to create suspense! There's no doubt that this movie is 'the father' of the modern horror! It clearly inspired many horror movies from the 70's and 80's and is still being a reference!",8,2,3,17 January 2008
Wedding Crashers," Some really good jokes, but nothing else more!
","How can a movie be, at the same time, funny and entertaining, and boring and completely pointless? This movie proves that it can be possible! On one hand we have some really nice jokes, that turn this film funny, but on the other hand there isn't much more I mean, without the jokes the plot is a mess! The acting is good, there're some really nice names (I especially appreciated Isla Fisher's role, as Gloria Clearly, she was great), that's no the point; the real problem, in my perspective, is when the movie tries to be 'serious'. Why to transform what is supposed to be a crazy comedy into a romance comedy, with always the same plot lines: so typical, repetitive and boring?! This movie would definitely work much better it was just a crazy comedy from the beginning to the end! That's why I think its only value is just the jokes!",6,0,0,4 December 2007
The Wolf of Wall Street," Well, it did result for me...
","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort this movie show us how greedy and vicious the sub-worlds of financial markets can be. It's like a lions lair waiting for the next victim... Greed for money is above everything and you must do everything to get it, otherwise you can get a job on McDonalds, as it's said in the movie...I liked the way Martin Scorsese directed this film, but I also agree with some people who say it's a bit long. 3 hours is a bit too much indeed, even to a story like that! But, on the other hand, I did enjoy the aggressive way he built the plot, with lots of explicit scenes of sex and drugs. I think he shows these worlds of corruption and greed in a hard but vibrating way, with great doses of enthusiasm I would say... Well, it did result for me...Leonardo Di Caprio also does a great job, he really seems like a lion on those speeches! Besides there are a lot of funny scenes. I can remember so many from sexual dirty jokes to the most silly and pathetic situations. This movie is hilarious at parts! In fact it's one of the main reasons why I score it 8/10...",8,0,3,14 February 2015
The Mission," To fight for a cause in a time of slavery and greed
","THE MISSION is a history drama about the expulsion of the Jesuits' missions in South America in the middle of the XVIII century. By what I've learned the plot's background is accurate to history and all we see in this movie truly happened in real life, unfortunately! The search for slavery work was continuous at the time by Portuguese colonists and the Spanish in spite of slavery not being directly allowed by their crown they also used the indigenous slaves. The Spaniards which had been creating Indian reductions since the middle of the XVI century, as a form to convert and control those indigenous people, were followed by the Portuguese, and both built Jesuit reductions in their territories. But after the 1750 treatment the Jesuits would be expulsed because they refused to leave their missions where their lived together with the indians, in peace. And the indians themselves they didn't want to abandon the reductions too because they knew that in the main jungle they would be an easy target to slave traders (known as 'bandeirantes' in Portuguese colony). So it's just the main plot's topic of this movie which then focus on the personal story of father Gabriel (played by Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary, and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert de Niro) a former slave trader which was converted to the Christian faith (and to the Jesuits) after kill his brother (because of a woman). The movie has good moments, especially in the last hour, and it describes very well the feeling of injustice and desperation those native people felt by the furious anger of the greedy imperialist armies! There're a few scenes, which focus the sad and empty native children' eyes, that worth more than a thousand words! I enjoyed this movie and the plot's main topic which portrays a sad period of our history (unfortunately empires were always built under massacres and the subjugation of other people, and I know Portuguese empire was no exception!).",7,2,2,10 February 2013
Hancock," Bad job asshole!
","OK, I must admit I'm not a fan of the Super Hero movie type. Generally I don't use to watch it and I don't use to appreciate it, but even so I can distinct when it is a good Super Hero movie, or a bad one, full of clichés and 'Hollywood garbage'! That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad! To sum up: Bad job asshole (I can call you that how many times I want!)",1,36,66,6 July 2008
1408," Don't enter that room!
","1408 is a movie which is refreshing and full of clichés at the same time. In fact, if the main idea is somewhat new (at least I don't remember to watch too many movies about haunted hotel rooms!) the way the plot develops and the kind of suspense used is everything but a novelty! The plot is a bit confusing, but it's not even a big deal, since I use to like puzzling stories; the main problem is that it's too confusing in the middle, being even senseless at parts, just to have an incredibly common/average ending! Why create those 'pseudo'-twists in the plot? Were they to create suspense? If so, I think they totally failed! On the other hand, I think the visual effects are pretty good (but only if we exclude those shallow-ghosts, which seemed to come out from a comic book!). The acting was also fine, especially if we consider it's almost a 'one man's movie', since the role of John Cusack is a great part of it! Globally, I don't think the film is bad, but it's nothing special either",6,0,1,7 October 2007
Bruce Almighty," 'I got the power'
","It's an entertaining comedy with a clear and nice message: it's not easy to be almighty! I enjoyed this movie because of two main reasons. First, it has some funny jokes, especially in the 'first half' of the film. Second, its main message: the great difficulty of being too much powerful. In fact, should not be easy to have the power to control everything, because we can never please everyone! People are so different that is impossible to please them all! On the other side of the message there's the point that many people don't even know want they want to themselves, so how could they be God and rule everything? That's the case of the main character of this movie BRUCE NOLAN (played by Jim Carrey).This movie, and the kind of comedy used, was done in Jim Carrey's measure, as he fits perfectly the character. Though, and in spite of the good message I did refer above, it's a 'pop corn comedy' done in Hollywood's standards, so I can't score it more than 7/10 (and a great part of this score is for the jokes!). A story like this but with another kind of cinematography I think I would give a better score! However, it's an entertaining and enjoyable film.",7,0,1,23 February 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Barcelona, art and romance
","This new film by Woody Allen is a comedy/drama romance set in Barcelona with all the typical 'Woody Allen ingredients': irony, humor, failed relationships, but all with the charm and the elegance we are used to watch in Woody's films! I enjoyed the movie especially because it's quite realistic and unrealistic at the same time. I mean, by one hand it has some kind of situations that just happens in movies, like that scene where the two girls accept the invitation to go to Oviedo, but on the other hand it describes very well the undefined feelings people sometimes feel for each other. In this particular case I really appreciated the role played by Penelope Cruz. I think she does a fantastic job, playing this stressed, lunatic, jealous but passionate girl! And one interesting idea I took from this love triangle composed by the characters played by Cruz, Barden and Johansson, MARIA ELENA, JUAN ANTONIO, and CRISTINA, respectively: Love can happen between three people. In the film CRISTINA is the bridge between MARIA ELENA and JUAN and she's also the 'equilibrium point' of all them, as was said by MARIA ELENA. So CRISTINA was the piece that was missing to complete the puzzle between MARIA ELENA and JUAN, and their relationship would be incomplete without her. Love doesn't happen always just between two people... But in the film this connection was also broken and the puzzle stilled incomplete!...(SPOILERS)... As the movie begins as the movie ends: CRISTINA who started seeking for adventure stilled seeking for adventure; VICKY who started engaged stilled engaged; and MARIA ELENA and JUAN who started angry with each other stilled angry with each other!",8,1,3,29 January 2009
300," 'Hey, you, what is your profession?'
","First of all I must start saying this is NOT a Historic movie but an Inspired in History Epic movie! It is, as we all shall know, an adaptation of a Frank Miller's graphic novel inspired in the Greek legend of the 300 men who fought until death, under King Leonidas' orders, against thousands of Persians. So, as the movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel based on courage and bravery it acts like that, meaning by other words, it's just an epic movie that illustrates bravery, courage and glory. That's nothing else. It's inspired in historic happenings, but it doesn't follow them faithfully, it's not its intention/purpose. If we see the film by this point of view, we will find it pretty good, in spite of not being the best epic movie I've ever seen In fact, I think there are a great number of epic movies, based in history, that are better than this one. I can remember BREAVEHEART In my opinion was better than this 300 Anyway, 300 is definitely a good quality epic movie. On the other hand, what annoyed me the most – and it has nothing to do with the movie – was some comments, here on IMDb, saying this movie is Fascist, based on propaganda, racist, that terrorists and Hitler would appreciate it OH MY GOD! From WHERE came out these people who keep saying such silly crap?! Let me just ask you something:Is it a violent movie that praises violence, rage, and hate? YES, it is. Is it a movie that discriminates the strong people from the weak, suggesting that the weaker and the disable ones should die to let the strong live? YES, it is. Is it a movie that proposes us to fight for a cause and die, if necessary, to defend it? YES, it is. Is it a movie that worships war instead of peace, ignoring the loss of 300 lives, just to claim an ideal of glory and pride? YES, it is. It's ALL TRUE! but HEY you BLIND people just LOOK into HISTORY and search for yourselves:if in the Ancient Sparta the children were not educated and military trained like the movie describes; if they didn't kill the weakest and disable ones to just maintain the stronger in order to create the best soldiers; If they weren't trained in the worst possible conditions and weren't ready to die for their land! These men were just professional soldiers, born and trained to do just one thing in their lives: fight! They had no other professions like blacksmith, farmer, pastor – like one scene of the movie clearly portrays! No, they were warriors, just that! This film is just portraying realistically the ancient Sparta nation, so all those comparisons are absolutely absurd and without any sense. We can't look to the Ancient world with the same moral standards of our modern societies. We can't say this film is fascist just because it portrays a social behaviour (truth at that time) that nowadays we consider absolutely barbaric and salvage! The History is like that, we cannot change it! If we want to do something with historic sense we must be faithful to it, and not change it just because nowadays it's morally incorrect!About the terrorist propaganda another one that makes me laugh! This 'western world' in going out crazy about the terrorist issue! If this film was shot just 15 years ago nobody would say it has a terrorist message! You all are PARANOID with terrorism! Just because it shows us glory becoming from death and suffering, just because it praises the death for a cause, it's terrorist propaganda! So did BREAVEHEART, and nobody said it had a terrorist message! Other people say it's propaganda to the US army, because it shows us a gigantic force (Persians) crushing a small group of rebellions (the Spartans), and those would be the 'terrorists' crushed by the military power of the bigger force What they forgot is that either in History as in the movie, that Persian gigantic force (the invaders, just like the US army!) was defeated by the Greeks (the defenders of their land) – not those 300, but the complete army – so even here the comparisons are absolutely ridiculous!Now, back to the movie, after all is what really matters! I just loved the characterization, especially of the Persians! The King Xerxes (played by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro) and the Persian Immortals are simply fantastic! They may not be faithful to real history but they are amazing! As I said in the beginning the characterization mixes the 'real' world with a world of fantasy and mysticism used in the graphic novels I think the movie was improved by this type of characterization and fantasy. Definitely, not a brilliant, but a pretty good epic movie!",7,3,7,5 April 2007
Cube," It's a cult movie that has clearly inspired other pictures
","The CUBE is a cult movie that has inspired many other films since it was created. One I can easily remember is SAW - the similarities are just too obvious. However CUBE has one thing that SAW hasn't: an incredible capacity to abstraction! In fact, if SAW has a plot and settings which we can easily understand, based on a psycho-game 'in the real world', CUBE is passed on a gigantic cube full of thousands of small rooms (also cubic). It's really based on an abstract concept and it keeps it until the end. We start to know nothing about what's going on, and we finish the same way All that we can find out along the plot is the 'stories' and the personalities of the characters. And the intention of the movie is just that: to be an abstract mortal game to watch Human's emotional reactions: fear, despair, paranoia, suspicion I found this movie very interesting because of that. It might be a little boring that the scenarios are always these Sci-fi cubic rooms, but the tension and the suspense created are enough to maintain viewer's attention until the end. And the ending was great too, because it doesn't give you any answers but just proves that sometimes innocence and weakness can be stronger than anything else.",8,0,1,30 March 2007
Jackie Brown," It's not a masterpiece, but it's a great work!
","JACKIE BROWN is, like PULP FICTION, a movie written and directed by Tarantino, or by other words a work that completely came out of his mind. If there're plenty differences between these films there're also some similarities, starting by the criminal world background, Samuel L Jackson and the character done by him. However the differences are bigger. JACKIE BROWN might not be so brightly like PULP FICTION but it is a great movie full of suspense and twists.The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciated especially three acting jobs: The one by Samuel L Jackson, which does one more time the role type he does best; Pam Grier, which plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal; and Robert De Niro role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, but I appreciated it because I think he does a character with a different personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies. Here, he's silent and nervous and almost seems like a 'poor little devil' thief I think Tarantino did a great job one more time. It's not a masterpiece like PULP FICTION but it's a very good film.",8,1,2,8 April 2008
The Simpsons Movie," 'Spider pig, spider pig do whatever a spider pig does'
","The corrosive humor of The Simpsons is back, and for the first time in a 'movie'. It's very funny and has the typical kind of jokes that made this cartoon so popular all over the world. The movie doesn't really bring anything new to the cartoon series (but I guess it wasn't supposed anyway), so it's more like a 'larger episode' than really a 'movie' Like the series always did it satirizes the American medium class typical family and the American society in general, but this time the damage over the environment is the main topic of this 'larger episode' Just because of Homer Simpson and his 'eternal irresponsibility' the 'movie' deserves an 8/10 score: 'Spider pig, spider pig do whatever a spider pig does'",8,1,2,6 August 2007
