50 First Dates," Better than the Wedding Singer
",This is a great movie. It is so much funnier than the Wedding Singer.It has a lot more heart than the wedding Singer. This Adam Sandler's best movie. I love this movie. It is the best romantic comedy in a long time. I hope it makes a lot of money and everyone goes and sees it.,10,0,0,16 February 2004
