Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Those Killjoy Critics can go and sulk at something else.
","Okay, so the plot isn't up there with Usual Suspects, and the acting won't win much at Cannes, but at the end of the day, it's a kids film.I sat through the whole thing with a huge smile on my face, unable to take my eyes off of the screen for a second. That in my eyes is what a good film should accomplish. If you go into the cinema expecting a moving, complicated plot, you will be disappointed, but come on, it's a Star Wars film!Lucas has aimed his trilogy at the next generation of Star Wars fans, where it should be aimed. Liam Neeson is great, and Ewan McGregor offers a strong supporting role, but through all of their attempts at serious Jedi screen faces, they fail completely to hide the fact they they are enjoying themselves too much, hitting each other with glowing rods and somersaulting over everything.Two words to sum this film up? Timeless Classic.If you don't enjoy this film as much as the first three, then buy a lap dog, a pipe and some tartan slippers and stay at home.",9,7,9,19 July 1999
