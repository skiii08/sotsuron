The Blair Witch Project," Really bad. The worst of 1999.
","Not scary.  Not original.  Not worth the money.  Not interesting.  Can't believe they squeezed out a soundtrack album for this.  Kidney stones are more enjoyable than this celluloid garbage.  Of course, a lot of people enjoy The Backstreet Boys and N'Sync and consider that to be music.  I can only assume that the fans of those 'bands' who will no doubt detest them in another year will be just like the fans of this movie who will eventually see the light and realize what a crummy z movie this is.",1,2,4,20 October 1999
