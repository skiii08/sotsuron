Casablanca," Casablanca(1942)
",Casablanca is a great movie. There are many things that make this movie what it is. From the lighting to the timeless quotes I believe every aspect of this movie was done excellently. The two areas besides what the average viewer would notice that I would like to comment on are the lighting and the camera movement. First off the lighting through out the film helped to set every scene and the search light at night especially served as a reminder that despite the night clubs and the open markets Casablanca was not a totally free town. The other technical aspect that set this movie apart was the camera movement. The director managed to always have the cameras in the perfect place and all movements were very smooth. This film will always be a must see for any movie buffs.,8,0,1,4 April 2011
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977)
","Boring!! No offense to anyone who liked this film but I found it to be the best sleep aid ever. It was a little clever and funny at times but it has definitely turned me off to trying other Allen films. I found the filming to be very bland, the acting to be mediocre and the dialog to be dry. This was meant to be a romantic comedy but but failed to accomplish that since it wasn't very funny. It seemed like someones everyday life. I'm sure if you are a Woody Allen fan or have a dry sense of humor you will enjoy this movie. I think Allen is the kind of director you either love or can't stand, either way watch the movie and form your own opinion.",3,4,8,11 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
",I'll be the first to admit that I've never been a fan of musicals and probably never will be but I have to give a lot of respect to this film. The main reason I respect this film so much is because along with all of the singing and dancing there was a story line I could follow and stay interested in. A big reason I don't like musicals is because nobody runs through the streets singing and dancing in real life without being committed to a mental institution. The best part of the movie was when Cosmo was doing his comical routine on the movie set. In my opinion Donald O'Conner stole the show with that performance but he was my favorite character through out the movie. Another thing I liked about the movie was how they showed how the industry worked and the difficulties of bring sound into movies.,7,0,1,4 April 2011
