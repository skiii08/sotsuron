Blade Runner 2049," It appears you either love it or hate it
","I just returned from seeing the movie in IMAX. Just before seeing it, I watched the original Blade Runner with a friend who had never seen it before. I won't bore you with the details and reasons for my poor rating. I will simply say I'm deeply disappointed in the overall story, and I found it difficult to follow. So, as one reviewer noted, I must have the attention span of a 5-year-old. The original Blade Runner is a far better piece of work.",5,5,10,9 October 2017
