Blade Runner 2049," 2049 is the Game of Thrones of films
","2049 is a tragic story following our main character K. K is a replicant with a heart of gold, expressing it faintly odd. He has been ordered to continue his case in search of a replicant who possibly gave birth, 30 years when Deckard (lead character in Blade Runner) was around. Everything from the directing, the music, the CGI, the cinematography, the colours, the acting and the sets is what we should expect in a sequel. Bigger! Better!",10,1,14,18 November 2018
