United 93," I Felt As if I Were On That Plane.....
","United 93 will no doubt become one of the most controversial films to be released by a studio this year. It is a film that is difficult to watch in that the events that took place happened only five years ago, and for most of Americans, happened in a place no one would actually see with their own eyes. It is, in fact, a sort of surreal event most of us experienced through television and newspaper. Yet with United 93, we are put into the positions of the air traffic controllers and the passengers themselves as they go on about trying to de esculate the situation that would become 9/11.The camera is a first person point of view of the events that took place that day. We are never given a particular character to connect with, instead connecting in unison with all Americans with the events that unfold during that tragic day. Greengrass edits this film with precision and power, smoothly flowing from one air traffic control tower to another, as the controllers try desperately to understand the hijackings taking place. These shots are inter cut with the passengers on board United 93, not knowing the events that have begun to unfold, even before they take off.The experience of watching this film is intense, and quite difficult to watch in many areas, yet I found it hard to turn away from what was unfolding on screen. The camera boards the plane as if it were just any other passenger, quietly observing the small talk, the flight attendants carrying on about their jobs, the pilots preparing for their flight. We see the terrorists calmly seated in first class, knowing what is to happen within a few minutes, yet being unable to stop them from carrying out their murderous plans.By the time we see the actual take over of the flight by the terrorists, the WTC have already been attacked, the fear on display in that plane is so overwhelming, and so real, I didn't know what to think. The messages to loved ones by the airline phones broke my heart, yet we never hear or see the other side of the line. We wouldn't if we were actually on the plane, so why would we in this film? The rebellion is heart pounding, and before you can blink, the film ends, and you remain in your seat, heart pounding, hands shaking, and in total shock of what had been witnessed.Paul Greengrass did absolutely amazing work with this picture. Using no name actors in the roles of the passengers and the air traffic controllers made the film more real and that much more of an experience. It doesn't sentimentalize the events that took place, nor does it become judgmental or linear. It was a day of grand confusion and fear, and Greengrass was able to take his camera and quietly observe the chaos that took place that day.United 93 is not an easy film to witness, and I don't recommend everyone to watch it because of its subject matter. But if you feel emotionally strong enough to witness these events, I whole heartedly recommend this picture. Very few times can film be considered an actual work of art. I consider this to be one among the few.HIGHLY Recommended.MJR",Null,2,6,30 April 2006
Fight Club," Where Is My Mind? Spoilers Are Here, So Beware!!!
","Ahh yes. The closing song to one of the more brilliant movies I have seen in quite a while. First, let's clear some things up. Yes, I am a girl. I am under the age of 18. And yes, Fight Club is one of the best movies I have seen in quite a while. And it's not because of Brad Pitt or Edward Norton (although I do admit both are quite tasty here). No, this movie speaks about truth. The type of truth that people hate to admit about their sorry little lives. So what is 'the truth' exactly?I believe truth in this movie is that people spend too much of their time following rules, believing they are whoever someone tells them they are. Take for example the Narrator in the beginning of the movie. Life was unlivable for him. Why? Because he took so much time listening to what others told him he should be. He could not form any opinions for himself. And isn't it true that we all are like that? We can admit to changing who we are just to be accepted by society, right? The cause of his insomnia.So the Narrator starts to attend groups for people who are dying of disease. Why? Because these people really listen to what YOU have to say. They don't try to change you because they know you're going to die anyway, so what's the point? Here, the Narrator can really express himself, till in walks Marla Singer. The 'tumor' for our poor, insomniac Narrator. The turning point of the movie, and the start of a very interesting plot that I don't think I'll carry onward with.Fight Club. A new plot, with complex characters that are developed and keep you entertained. Yet this movie makes you think about the life you are living. Is it worth it? What you are going through? Do you really need all that 'crap' as Tyler Durden would say? Probably not. Want something life changing to happen in your miserable life? Watch this movie. I don't even think it should be labeled a movie. It's too good for that.

Memento," MEMENTO WOW OTNEMEM
","IN a nutshell, this is the best, mind blowing, thought provoking, question asking film I have ever seen. It is utterly unique, enchanting, and flips your world upside down. One of my friends recommended that I see this movie since I love watching complex movies. After viewing this picture, I stared at the end credits trying to figure out what exactly I had just saw. Leonard Shelby is on a mission for revenge for the brutal murder of his wife. He pursues a man, known to him only as John G. and recieves help from someone who is supposedly his friend, Teddy. While I was watching this film, I realized that in a way, I had become Leonard, that I didn't know where I was, or what I had just down. Having the movie played backwards was ingenious, and I praise Christopher Nolan for the screenplay. Guy Pearce did an excellent job as Mr. Shelby, and he was darn cute, too. I HIGHLY recommend this movie, not just for entertainment, but for sure thinking. Watch it with a friend, and get ready for an hour if debating afterward. Prepare to get your mind blown away.....MJR",Null,0,1,14 February 2002
Constantine," Awesome Effects Keep Constantine From Going To...Well...Hell....
","Keanu Reeves is the coolest looking guy around. Take for example in his newest film, Constantine, where Keanu Reeves plays the title character John Constantine, a chain smoker, dying of lung cancer, and is one of the few who can see the demons and angels that walk the earth. He walks with an internal brooding, for he is a man who committed the ultimate of sins as a a young man, and has spent his whole life since trying to redeem himself in God's eyes.Jon Constantine is one of the most interesting comic book characters I have seen in some time, The Character has a complex and troubled past, and does good deeds only so he can somehow buy his way into heaven. Now Keanu Reeves may look the part of John Constantine, but he most definitely can't act the part. Any scene where he is simply walking around, he's wonderful. Pick ANY scene where he actually has to talk, well, that's a different story.The one character that I just found to be annoying as heck would be Shia LaBleof, who basically plays and even DRESSES as the exact same character he plays in I, Robot. Here, Shia acts as Constantine's private taxi driver and wanna be apprentice. He's your stereotypical wise guy, given the funny lines, and always left behind till the final act where he proves himself. the movie would have been better without him.What really saves this movie from total disaster is the awesome visual effects that are used. There are genuine creepy moments in this film, such ads the demons themselves, or the hell that Constantine enters several times throughout the movie. the world Constantine lives in is utterly cool, dark, neutral. You have to be tough to live in a place such as this (here, LA). The plot comes off as somewhat trite, in that it never fully grabs your attention and en cloaks you in its story. there's no plot holes, per say, but there is a definite lack of meaning behind what happens to these characters and how the viewer only observes them but can't really relate.Constantine is a total guy movie, boasting a cool character, and placing him in a world full of danger and action. The movie is mostly that, with an ending that takes its sweet time concluding and a hot chick (Rachel Weisz) who for most of the movie wears wet, low cut shirts. Can I recommend it? Sure, but I'll be the first to say, it has got plenty of faults.MJR",Null,4,11,9 March 2005
L.A. Confidential," Three Phenomenal Actors Give The Performances Of A Life Time
","Six years ago, a director by the name of Curtis Hansen came out with a small time film named L.A. Confidential. Though the movie garnered several big nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards, the nation had been swept up by the gigantic and romantic blockbuster, Titanic, thus shrinking the chances of this brilliant movie from garnering any real awards. 1997 completely screwed this phenomenal film, in which three brilliant actors gave the performances of their careers.Russell Crowe plays Detective Bud White, a tough L.A. cop who bends the rules in order to bring justice to the city. He is ruthless, and unforgiving of anyone, which brings him into direct conflict with Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley, played by Guy Pearce. Russell Crowe became with this role a full pledged character actor,: the cop with a steel physique, and a vulnerable heart. He becomes so believable and real to the audience, you can not help but sympathize for his character under the circumstances.  From this role, Crowe went on to garner three best actor nominations, winning for his role in Gladiator.Guy Pearce, the little known Australian body builder, became the character known as Ed Exley, a straight, uptight detective trying to live up to the legend his father created before him. Exley has so much to prove to the LAPD, trying to show them that he is just as good, maybe even better, than his father. He plays the politics in a corrupted police department very well, and is able to use these skills in solving the corrupt and mysterious case of the Night Owl murders. This film officially put Guy Pearce in the big leagues of film, making his next appearances in Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. He is a severely underrated actor who deserves better than what he has been getting.Finally, the ever wonderful Kevin Spacey. Spacey plays Lieutenant Jack Vincenes, a cop who gives a popular LA police show, Badge of Honor, real solved cases in return for money. Jack sees his life as an ever going soap opera, until he comes across a case that somehow has a connection to the Night Owl murders. Kevin Spacey has proved time and again his abilities as an actor, and he continues with this performance. Curtis Hansen does a wonderful job bringing this story to the big screen. His talents, although recognized, have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday, someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents. Highly Recommended.

Crash," Powerful, Hard Hitting Drama About Racial Stereotypes
","In Paul Haggis's feature directorial debut, Crash, several different characters walk the streets of Los Angeles, their minds already made up of the different ethnicities that surround them. Because of these stereotypes, not one character is able to clearly see the people that stand before them. And it is in that universal characteristic that makes Crash such a wonderful film.There is no better place to exhibit the loneliness, pain, and fear in America better than Los Angeles, which is a melting plot of different cultures within a twenty mile radius. Watching a film such as this questions your own views on how you see people of different races, as well as surprises you at how quick we are to judge someone who is not like ourselves. No on exhibits this finer than Sandra Bullock's character, Jean, who is only too quick to judge a Latino locksmith as a gang member. Jean is so blinded by these racial stereotypes that she makes, she does not even realize her actions till the end of the film, where she comes to realize her Latino housemaid knows her better than her supposed white friends.The Latino locksmith, as it turns out, is the furthest thing from a gang member. He is a family man, with a wife and angelic little daughter to whom he tells a sweet story about an invisible and impenetrable cloak that renders her impervious to all harm. That little story comes back into play when a Persian immigrant, whose store was broken into and ransacked, tries to take vengeance on the locksmith by threatening him. What ensues is one of the most climatic and heart pounding scenes I have seen on film in quite some time.Yet this is simply skimming the surface at the amount of character development and characters that are involved in this film. We have Don Cheadle as a detective who is having an affair with his Latino partner, Matt Dillon is a somewhat corrupt cop who performs an inappropriate search on a light skinned African American woman that comes back to haunt him. Ludicrous is a man who car jacks white people's cars and sells them to a car garage, all the while preaching about how white people give the 'black man' a bad name when he is giving the 'black man' a bad name himself. So much is packed into only 100 minutes that I only wish that these characters had more room to breathe with their intertwining stories.There is amazing use of score throughout. A score that hauntingly fits that chaos and tragedy that fill this picture. THe music alone may very well bring you to tears, it is that moving and in perfect synchrony during a car crash scene where Matt Dillon rescues a woman trapped in her car. This is what thematic score is supposed to e: symbolic to the characters on screen.Crash is a powerful and moving film that is not to be missed. Paul Haggis has debuted with a hard hitting drama that will hopefully be remembered come awards season in 2006. I can only wait to see what this remarkable screenwriter and director has in store next.Highly Recommended",Null,1,8,3 June 2005
Alien," Mommy......
","I tell you, I was scared s***less when I first saw this movie back in 1993. Of course, I was only seven at the time, but that just goes to show you that even little 7 year olds have guts to watch horror movies like this. Even today, I still can't watch this movie alone. The special effects and the music is what really makes you scared. That, and the fear shown on the character's faces. What makes this movie really great, is that a woman, not a man, plays the hero. And Segorney Weaver does a magnificent job of playing Ellen Ripley, the woman who manages to escape the evil Aliens and save her life. Ripley is a complex character, one who does what she's told, yet is able to put her fears behind her, and get the job done. That takes courage, something not even macho men have. The movie is one of the best sci fi movies ever made, surpassed only by The Matrix. I highly recommend this movie. Watch it at night, and definatly not alone..................................",Null,0,1,19 February 2002
Gone Baby Gone," Baby Don't You Cry...Here Come The Afflecks To Save The Day
","45 minutes into his new film, Gone Baby Gone, sitting in a darkened club with a thug across from him, his girlfriend and private detective associate to his right, Casey Affleck delivers one of the most threatening speeches placed on film this year. One wouldn't think so, given the boyishness of Casey, and his struggle to prove himself as a viable and relevant private investigator. The thug pulls a piece out on him, and threatens to kill him for negotiating the release of a little girl who is being held ransom, with which the thug claims he has no knowledge of. Patrick (Casey Affleck) calmly backs off, and engages in a sixty second monologue of the most amazing, threatening words of which I wish I could reproduce and yet am having trouble finding at the moment.The opening shot of Gone Baby Gone thrusts you into a world that is cruel, unkind, and with no easy answers. As matter of fact, there were no answers. Only decisions, and living with the consequences of those decisions. Our protagonist is not a hero, though he is portrayed as one. The subject matter dealt with is not good versus bad, though it would seem as such on the surface. Life for the average joe is a cruel, unkind force to be reckoned with, those who give into addictions and cause others around them to be hurt. Yet when something catastrophic happens, it doesn't change you, or the type of person you are. It only changes the world around you, and your adjustments to that new world.Casey Affleck has given his greatest performance to date. More accessible to his audience, more engaging than his character in The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, and faced with a moral dilemma of how to distinguish if there really are opposites in a society which paints them as so. Taking comfort in his native Boston accent, Casey Affleck loses himself in his role. This was not the little boy I grew up watching in the Ocean series, the secondary character who shoots off wise cracking lines to his buddies. This was a young, fresh faced man faced with the impossible task of finding a little girl declared missing. He's loving, but cynical. He's tender, but tough, and not afraid to do what is necessary to get the job done.Ben Affleck, of all people, has given me a film I've long desired this entire year. A smart, intelligent, realistic film that thrills and saddens. The script is amazing, the way everything falls into place by the end of its run time. My body was tense throughout the film. The acting of all involved was impeccable, from Morgan Freeman (whose character takes a surprising turn), to Ed Harris (the man is a chameleon), to the tragically underused Michelle Monaghan. He gives them the room needed to give their characters the dimension and emotion they deserve. If he can continue with this much care and detail to his films, he has a bright future behind the camera. Absolutely brilliant his first time out.Much like life, this film leaves you with no answers as to what a good decision is or is not. The moral dilemmas we face everyday are embodied in Patrick Kenzie, and like him, we sit, dazed and confused, at the implausible and unbelievable atrocities that make up our society.",Null,2,5,29 October 2007
Bridget Jones's Diary," Perfectly Charming Tale of the Average Woman
","Year 2001, a heroine entered theaters whom women could identify with. A woman with insecurities over her looks and weight, over drinking and smoking her life away, and not being able to find and hold onto the right guy. And that right there played into all the insecurities every woman on the face of the planet faces everyday. Who is this woman? Why, Bridget Jones, a 32 year old British woman living in London! Normally, a character in Bridget's position would in a typical movie be the supporting player, the one off to the side with the sub plot and the witty one liners, becoming very two dimensional and stereotypical. Yet with this film, that stereotype is given prominence, and how wonderfully it succeeds! Depressed over the comment Mark Darcy made about her (He called her a spinster) at her parent's annual Christmas party, Bridget decides to finally take control of her life, to cut back on drinking and smoking, to lose weight, and to find a nice man to make her happy. To keep track of all this, she decides to keep a journal.Renee Zellweger was perfectly charming in this film, creating Bridget Jones into a sweet, adorable, likable character that was very easy to relate to. People thought Renee wouldn't be able to convincingly pull off her British accent, but watching the film you sometimes forget that she is actually American. Renee was able to convey the stress of keeping her spirits up after discovering that her boss was cheating on her, and slowly discovering that her perfect man had been in front of her all along. Her Oscar nomination was absolutely deserved.Colin Firth was amazing in his role of Mark Darcy. Though he really does not say much throughout the film, you could always tell what he is feeling just by looking at his eyes. They convey so many words that Firth could have been silent the whole film and you would be able to understand him perfectly. But it is wonderful that he does speak, for the speech he gives to Bridget about 'Liking her just the way she is' was so sweetly put, it makes you long for someone to say those words to you.Hugh Grant, who before this was type cast as the dorky-sweet romantic lead, breaks from this with his role as Daniel Cleaver. Hugh Grant is one of those actors who brings so much more to the role that you could ever expect, and with this character, Grant does not disappoint. Hr plays the wanker down to a T, is convincingly caddy, and the playboy everyone wants but knows will be in trouble if they have him. Not to mention, watching Cleaver and Darcy fight near the end of the film will have you rolling in the aisles!Bridget Jones's Diary. Probably considered a total chick flick, but has a wonderful theme: Being yourself is all you'll ever need, and accepting yourself for who and what you are will lead you to happiness.Highly recommended.MJR",Null,1,2,14 December 2004
The Aviator," Spectacular Effects, Beautiful Sets, Fine Acting, Yet Lacks Heart
","The Aviator,helmed by legendary Martin Scorsese, had so much going for it: spectacular visual effects, wonderful costuming and set design, and extraordinary acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. And you would think that a film that has all the elements OF a great film would also have something that The Aviator unfortunately lacks: heart.The film opens with Howard Hughes as a child, his mother bathing him and telling him how dangerous the world is. It then cuts to Howard Hughes in his twenties, on the set of Hell's Angels where it is immediately apparent just how powerful this young playboy's drive is. He wants absolute perfection at his craft, which is making a realistic and believable film about war and combat, which he succeeds at. His peers do not take hi seriously, however, because of his age and his somewhat childish look on things. Howard Hughes begins the film young and powerful, an by the end, has aged and started to let his infatuation for cleanliness and germs to wither him away to just an obsessive compulsive loner who locks himself in his office for months at a time.Leonardo DiCaprio has never been a more finer actor, taking his boyish features and completely transforming himself into Howard Hughes. Every gesture, the accent, his compulsiveness, it is amazing just how wonderful Leonardo has evolved from the pretty faced boy in Titanic to serious Hollywood actor in The Aviator. Not to mention, the chemistry he and Cate Blanchett had on screen jelled, bringing Hepburn's strong will and Hughes's dependence on that to function.Cat Blanchett was, not to say the least, amazing at recreating a legendary Hollywood icon, playing the part of Kathrine Hepburn to a tee. It was quite apparent that a lot of research by Blanchett was done to perfect all of Hepburn's little mannerisms, and larger than life character. Blanchett is in much need of an Oscar for her portrayal in the film, for it is nothing short of amazing.The sets and costumes were extraordinary, to watch The Aviator is a trip down memory lane for older generations and an eye opening educational venture for the younger generations. The Hollywood premieres that were recreated, the legendary actresses such as Ava Gardner, it gives a sense of longing for the golden years of Hollywood before everything became so commercialized. There are spectacular camera shots throughout the film such as the flight of the Spruce Goose, the filming of the air battles in Hell's Angels, and the spectacular plane crash in Beverly Hills. All these make for one adventurous film.Yet, with all these elements going for it, The Aviator really lacks heart. Though the first half of the film, Howard Hughes is at the top of his game, and the audience is entertained, yet kept far away enough where they will not really care that Hughes is slowly letting his OCD take over his life. At a nearly three hour run time, by the end of the film when Hughes's has finally completed his decent into madness you may be fidgeting and squirming from boredom. Martin Scorsese put together the life of Howard Hughes, yet kept him emotionally far way enough from the audience that they are more an observer of Hughes than actually caring for him. And that was the biggest problem of the film. Great films have characters you deeply care for, and that is all that prevents The Aviator from being that: Greatness.Come Oscar night, there is no doubt that The Aviator will walk away with some awards, that is a given. The Aviator is recommended for it's stunning recreation of old Hollywood, the pioneering of aviation, and the incredible acting by DiCaprio and Blanchett. Unfortunately, by the end, you may be fidgeting, waiting for the film to finally end.Recommended.MJR",Null,3,5,31 January 2005

","First, let me say that I have not read the Lord of the Rings. Not a single book, yet after viewing this movie,I went to a book store and bought all four of them. From the first battle scene to the last minute, I was enchanted with the quest of Frodo, Sam, and his friends to destroy the evil ring. I felt a connection with the movie.

Armageddon," A Misunderstood Film
","I've seen this film over three times, and I still haven't tired of it. Yes, the film does move a little slow at times, and yes, it is pretty predictable. Yet These are quite small and far in between with all the action going on. The dialoge between some of the characters like A.J. and Grace are utterly sweet, and the comments made by Rockhound were absolutely hilarious! And even though I knew what was going to happen at the end, I still teared up. Bruce Willis (One of my favorite actors) was wonderful as usual, and he played his part well for a character who is nothing but a boy in a man's body. I recommend this movie for all the action, and compassion shown between the characters. Go see it!MJR",Null,1,1,14 February 2002
American Beauty," Have you looked in the mirror lately?
","If you haven't, then see this movie. Lester Burnham is a man, miserable in his marriage, has a horrible job, and is rejected by his own daughter. He's depressed, and 'jerking off' in the shower is the only thing that brings him any joy. Then, one day, for no good reason, he sees things in a new light. Why should he follow the stupid rules in life if all they're doing is holding him back? This is one thing I love about this character: how he is able to seize his life and start controlling it the way he wants to control it.I admire the way this film shows life in many middle class families. The husband doesn't abuse the wife, or cheats on her, yet they are constantly fighting. The daughter, who openly despizes her father and mother and is looking for a way out. The boy next door, and his abusive father. All these people who look so 'normal' when you pass them in the streets have so much more to them. This film deserved Best Picture, and Kevin Spacey did an absolutely wonderful job playing the man who finally takes control of his life. The funny thing is, I'm only 15, and a movie like this depicts life in my family pretty well. Bravo to the film makers and directors. And to the actors who played the characters. Highly recommended.MJR",Null,0,0,21 February 2002
Collateral," Plot, Acting, Directing, Top Notch!!
","Collateral is without a doubt one of the best films to come out in recent years. Not only does it feature a stellar cast and crew, but a prominent soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, and a knock out story that is not only unique, but believable and realistic.Tom Cruise is in top form as Vincent, a contract killer sent to LA to kill four people involved in a drug bust. Cruise delivers one of the best performances of his career, bringing a certain coldness to his character: A man who has no compassion or mercy for human life, making him seemingly robotic and non human. Every move Vincent makes, whether it's holding a gun, or having conversations with Max, he is always in control, aware of his surroundings. Cruise becomes Vincent, the boyish charm hidden by a stony exterior.Which brings us to Jamie Foxx, breaking from his well known comedic skills to try his hand at a drama, and how nicely he succeeds. Foxx is the standout in this film, bringing a vulnerability yet a strong willingness to survive to his character Max, a man who before meeting Vincent lets people walk all over him. Yet over the course of one night, through his interactions with Vincent, he gains the courage to stand up for himself, to do what he believes to be right. His conversations with Vincent awaken him to the kind of life he is currently living, and that he can be so much more than what he had become. The story to this film is never slow, always picking up the pace and keeping the viewer involved in what is happening on screen. The score and music choices to the film do not take away from it, but rather enhance it, creating a mood that is calming and soothing at times, and tense and suspenseful at others times. Not to mention, the cinematography, seeing LA at night is a beauty all in itself, to see the city at night is a wonder and a privlage. Collateral, directed by Micheal Mann, is one of the best films to come out in recent years. Both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give outstanding performances to characters who each give something to the other: Vincent is ever slightly humanized, and Max is given more confidence in himself. The story of a hit man is given a fresh spin with this film, one the boasts beautiful cinematography, and an outstanding story. Highly recommended.MJR",Null,2,3,15 September 2004
American History X," One of The Most Important Films About Racism
","I have seen Edward Norton in The Italian Job, and found him to be the standout in the ensemble cast, playing the villain quite convincingly enough for the type of film it was. I saw him in Fight Club and thought he was a knock out, playing his character to absolute perfection. Then in Rounders, where his character is not only charming and funny, but had deep emotional problems concerning his personal life. He was wonderful in that role as well. But his performance in American History X certainly without a doubt tops them all. I knew before hand that Edward Norton would play a neo-Nazi type character, but I was expecting some sort of lapse in his character. Thoughout the two hours and some odd minutes, he had me in utter shock as to what he put those around him through. It amazed me how much change happened to him, how his character went from respecting other races, to plain despise, anger, and hate, to redemption. His eyes say so much throughout the film, were so penetrating to the audience, that it amazed me that I couldn't turn my own eyes away.  His actions were so powerful, his voice so convincing to others, that for a second there, he had me thinking his own views. If I had been under his leadership, I would have absolutely believed him.The film revolves around Derek Vinyard the day he gets out of prison, and how he tries to convince his younger brother from taking the same path as he did. The flashbacks are in black and white, and the story told in the first half through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny. Edward Furlong, though not as powerful as Norton's, was still very convincing, though I thought his character was too trusting too fast near the end. The ending had me in tears. It had shocked me so badly. The film is powerful, will deeply pull at your heart, and leave you with a lasting impression, not only about American society, but at the never ending racism that occurs within the world. It will never end, but this film shows that even those with so much hate and anger within them can be redeemed. I highly recommended this film. MJR",Null,0,1,9 January 2004
Gone with the Wind," I'm GOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE....
","I saw this film for the first time in 8th grade. We were studying the civil war, and my teacher had us watch the 4 hour film in two days. Although I hate to admit it, this was a great movie for me to watch. The way Scarlett O'Hara acts is provoking to those even today, and the character of Rhett Butler is so charming, it kills me that Scarlett could'nt see how much he loved her. This is one of the most romantic movies of all time, and an utter classic that will live on in film forever. It still amazes me that in 1939, a film of this magnitude could be made. Bravo to all those who were a part of this classic tale.'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.' (I love that part!)MJR",Null,1,5,14 February 2002
Good Will Hunting," Don't like swearing? Make an acception for this one.
","Some people here have commented on why the characters in this wonderful picture swear so much. They believe that it's unnecessary and takes away from the movie. But they are wrong. The cussing in this movie is only part of their background. It shows the imperfections in them, and their words are backed up by their actions.That's all there is to it.    Now to the movie itself. This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Matt Damon did a marvelous job of playing the flawed but gifted Will Hunting. Will is flawed in that he pushes people away, he doesn't allow himself to become emotionally attached to anyone. Where he is gifted is in his extraordinary mind. He and Minnie Driver have great chemistry, and both are able to take complete control of their characters and play them to the fullest. Will is a complex character that will keep you entertained the whole movie, and in my opinion, I believe that Damon is a much better actor than Affleck. Too bad he has not gotten the attention he is worthy of.   Besides the excellent performance by Damon, Robin Williams has also proved his ability to play completely different characters, and seemingly with out much difficulty. Before watching this movie, I thought Williams would continue to remain in childhood films such as Hook and Jack. Characters that were always happy in a way. In this movie, however, he plays the troubled therapist, Sean Maguire, a person still grieving over the loss of his wife to cancer. The scenes with Damon and Williams light up on screen, for both of these characters need each other in order to move on. You'll understand when you see the movie. Williams deserved the Oscar he got for portraying Maguire.    Is there a lot of swearing? Yes there is. But who cares? After seeing a movie like this, you'll have a feeling that these people are no longer trying to waste their lives, but move forward. I highly recommend this movie. Enjoy!MJR",Null,0,2,10 April 2002
Amadeus," My Dusty VHS Tape, And An Unforgettable Experience
","It had been a few years since I had seen this picture, but a sudden longing to learn to play piano, a sudden need to listen to Beethoven, Chopin, Bach, and Mozart, lead me to dig through my dusty VHS tapes and to bring out a film I thought I would never watch again: Amadeus.I could not believe how quickly I was to forget such greatness of film making. At a little over two and a half hours long, there is not a minute that goes by where I am left feeling bored, uneasy, or figgity. On the contrary, the absolutely marvelous acting, dialogue, sets, and scope of this film made me realize that it had been quite some time since I had seen a film of this magnitude grace theatre screens in a while.F Murray Abraham is a revolutionary actor in his role as Salieri, a man who only wished to devote his love for God through music. So grand was this love and lust for music that he prayed earnestly for the opportunity to show his love for life by music. Yet, even from a young age, Salieri had been one upped by child prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one he would come to love, admire, hate, and loathe throughout his life. I could not keep my eyes away from Abraham. He is able to carry such scenes with laughter, mockery, jealousy, contempt, all together in a scene. As a viewer of this madness, one can't help but feel conflicting emotions of hate and happiness for this man who only wanted to show his love for God. And to have it mocked by Mozart, a young, arrogant, and supremely talented man seem like a slap to the face of Salieri. Abraham fully deserved his Oscar win for this performance, which is quite possibly one of the best in the history of cinema.What I find the most admirable of Amadeus is the tone of the film. It is not a film about the tortured soul of a boy wonder musician, but one of childlike play. Mozart is portrayed as a young man who knows he's a great musician, yet does not know his words of confidence mock the work of musicians who pale in comparison to his. Tom Hulce, in a role he has embodied and will be remembered for, was able to, in the course of a few hours, bring Mozart from the cocky, self absorbed young man to a man struck by the tragic loss of his father, and large debts. That laugh, even thinking about it brings a smile to my face.Milos Foreman did amazing work in the production of this film. His use of telling Mozart's story is a series of flashbacks was amazing to say the least. The sets and extravagant and true. I especially loved how Foreman handled the opera scenes scattered throughout the film. Music fills the screen, with Salieri's interpretations of Mozart's music for better understanding of the operas themselves. Watch how Foreman edits these sequences. It amazes me to no end.And, of course, the music. It is as Salieri says throughout the entire film, music embodies Mozart in ways you never though possible. Lovers of classical pieces will be brought to tears hearing these beautiful sounds, while non lovers can at least admire the influence Mozart has had on composers who came after him.Amadeus is one of the greatest films to come out of the 1980's, one filled with a grand scope of imagery, score, music, sublime characters, powerful direction, and perfect dialogue. It is my wish to someday see this magnificent piece of film making as it was intended to be seen: on the big screen, surround sound blaring. It is a film that may never leave you.HIGHLY Recommended.",Null,1,2,22 April 2006
Moulin Rouge!," 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love....'
","This is a movie about love. Above all things, the one emotion we all long for is to love someone, and be loved in return. This movie showcases it powerfully, with humor and a type of grace that leaves you wanting more long after it is over. Ewan Mcgregor is introduced first, and the first ten minutes, I couldn't help but keep a smile on my face. The sound effects and the camera angles made it entertaining to watch, and this is what I expected for the whole film.Yet, as soon as Christian breaks into song for Satine for the first time, I knew I had found something much more than just a musical. Mcgregor has a wonderful voice, and along with Nicole Kidman, is one of the more talented actors I've seen in a while. It is still sort of shocking that the singing was done entirely by the leading characters. The ending had me tearing up, and crying along with Christian for what happens. This movie is so much more than a musical. And I'm a little upset Ewan Mcgregor wasn't nominated for an Oscar, for he portrayed Christian with much emotion. This movie is a wonderful see, not just because of the colorful costumes, songs, and dancing. But also for the one emotion we hope to once experience  in our lives: love. Highly recommended.

Million Dollar Baby," One of, If Not, THE BEST Film of the year
","Million Dollar Baby, 25th feature directed by masterful storyteller Clint Eastwood, brings the art that is boxing and implants such raw emotion into it, not one person will leave the theatre with a dry eye.Million Dollar Baby tells the story of an old boxing trainer, Frankie, disowned by his daughter, left by his boxer, and has been attending mass almost daily for the past 23 years in the hopes of finding some sort of solitude from the sins he can't seem to forgive himself for. eastwood has never been a more finer actor, who's skills only seem to improve with age. Mr. Eastwood has for so long been honing his acting skills, he disappears into the role of Frankie, played with such remorse, such pain, the audience immediately sympathizes with him over the events that have happened in his life. once he meets Maggie, he tries so hard to not let her in, but due to her strong will to succeed, he gives in, grows and builds a relationship and a love that is so deep, he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, that maybe life is worth living after all. Mr. Eastwood took full control of his character, taking his acting to such depths that it's amazing to think of all the other aspects he put into this masterful film besides his extraordinary acting.Which brings up Hilary Swank, who in the past few years has experienced a bad run of scripts since Boys Don't Cry, again proves to Hollywood that when given the right material, she is absolutely stunning at becoming and knowing her character. Her face is so expressive the film very well could have been carried off of her facial expressions alone, she was so open to what she was feeling. Swank has cemented an Oscar nomination with this performance and quite possibly her second win as well. Just stunning...Which of course also leads to the wonderful Morgan Freeman. How this talented actor has not been recognized for his achievements by the Academy is astounding, as he again turns in a tremendous performance as Scrap, an old boxer Frankie feels responsible for for the loss of his eye. freeman plays the exposition or the narration in this film, and given to any other actor the performance would have been average. Yet Freeman has such a presence, such power on the screen, that he turns a semi-small part and makes it a standout.The score was poignant, thoughtful, and enduring. the screenplay was stunning, the words these characters said to each other, the story, the plot, the list goes on and on. Do not come into this film and expect not to be moved in any way. The film touches you, stays with you, and makes you think of the own decisions you have made in your life and how you've dealt with the consequences.Million Dollar Baby is hands down THE BEST film of 2004, bar non. See this extraordinary film while it's still in theatres, and prepare to be moved by it's emotional story about overcoming adversity, and fighting with all your heart for what you want in your life.HIGHLY Recommended.MJR",Null,99,147,7 January 2005
Garden State," Wonderful Soundtrack, OK Film
","Andrew Largeman comes home to New Jersey after nine years of estrangement from his family. He has been numbed by drugs that render him immune to all emotion, yet decided to purposely forget his medication for his mother's funeral. Life lessons ensue about finding yourself as well as making that one connection with the person you are desperately trying to find.The film has a promising premise, and succeeds on many levels. For first time writer/director/star Zach Braff, this was an exceptional first outing. Having the talent to write and direct a film as involved as this is an achievement with the experience he has. His musical selections were wonderful, fitting each scene with the right amount of emotion, and enough zeal to be part of the scene, yet not distracting from the story.That being said, the film is also less successful on other levels. Being a first time director, Braff must learn not to jump around from shot to shot so much for it ended up making the film feel very choppy. The ending scene to this film is one particular case, where the song sung by Frou frou holds the quick camera shots together, as they jump from one to another.Braff had so much to take care of on this film as well, that he should have casted someone else for the part of Andrew Largeman. The emotion that he does eventually show comes off as fake anyway, and the audience is supposed to think he's finally experiencing some kind of emotion. But due to his still weak acting skills, you can aways tell that Braff is acting, or simply repeating the lines off of a screenplay he wrote.Natalie Portman, the big name in the cast, was also unfortunately miscast int his film. To be in a film like this, there must be two ordinary people who make a connection and become something together. With this film, Portman's beauty distracts the people from the relationship between Samantha and Andy, not to mention the strange appeal there is of seeing Braff and Portman together as a screen couple. She does what she can, however, and turns in a decent performance as Samantha.Braff truly has a career in the making with this film, however. Though not perfect, it is one step in the road to a hopefully successful career. With more improvement, Braff could indeed be one of the next top directors/writers in the business. Film recommended for the awesome music choices and intriguing story.MJR",Null,0,1,28 October 2004
Saw," One Of The Most Disturbing Films To Come Out In Recent Years
","What sets SAW apart from the usual slew of horror films is that this one gets into your mind. It puts you into the situations themselves and makes you wonder what you would do yourself. And, of course, a steady pace of creepy images such as scary clowns and spine tingling figures does not help you feel any better that you are watching a scary film of this magnitude.Cary Elwes plays Lawrence Gordon, a doctor who wakes up trapped and chained inside a rundown, cracking, dirty bathroom with a younger man named Adam, who is played by SAW's screenwriter, Leigh Whannell. A dead body lies between them. As soon as Gordon comes to, he receives clues from his captor, saying he must murder Adam before a certain time or his family will be murdered. Elwes acts well enough in this movie, although in some scenes he tended to over act, or try too hard in some of the more terrifying scenes. Some takes would come off as forced, like he was trying very hard to impress the crumbling walls just how wonderfully he can play the part of a scare But it's not the acting that makes SAW work. What DOES work are the filming techniques and camera work. The film's picture is grainy, shot with hand-held cameras to give a more realistic feel to the film's dirty, claustrophobic set. Visual style is something that has not been seen since David Fincher's Se7en, with outrageously mind numbing images. This is a wonderfully filmed picture, with a great score to intensify the mood.SAW is one of the most disturbing, scary, psychologically draining films I have seen in quite some time. Compared to the other horror films being chucked out by Hollywood these days, SAW is for sure a horror film that will be remembered for some time and is very much something I would recommend.MJR",Null,1,2,9 March 2005
Pretty Woman," You KNOW You Can't Deny The Power Of Roberts and Gere....
","Man, my mommy and I get together for our monthly viewings of Pretty Woman and Top Gun, her favorite films of all time, and every single time, I take pleasure out of spending time with my mom and watching these two movies. Pretty Woman is a charming, witty, dream like movie that no matter what you say or think, will end up brightening your day because of its lovable characters and outrageous story.Yes, you all know the story now, mongrel Edward Lewis picks up free spirited Vivian to be his 'escourt' for a week and during that week, they mesh and fall in love. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I always enjoy myself, thanks to Julia Robert's beautiful smile and cute little quirks at trying to make herself fit in Edward's world. It's the most evident at the dinner scene where Edward calmly states he is going to buy a company and sell it bit by bit. All the while Vivian is just sitting there with her lack of any etiquette, making the audience fall in love with her even more.Gere and Roberts have such chemistry and presence on screen, they just click from the get go, and look like two people having a great time at work. Gere has never looked more handsome, and I love how Edward changes his views on his business life after one week of time with Vivian. And I love how Vivian slowly lets Edward into her life, her feelings, and who she is as a person. I'm so glad Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is what cemented her on Hollywood's A list.Yes, Pretty Woman has an outrageous story, and in real life can probably happen once in a blue moon. But hey! That's what those famous lines that bookend the movie are for: 'Welcome to Hollywood! What's your dream?' Pretty Woman will have a special place in my heart always, me sitting on the couch with mommy, having a great time at the movies.",Null,0,1,29 May 2005
A Beautiful Mind," Emotional, Jaw Dropping Performance by Russel Crowe
","Russel Crowe did a fantastic job playing the part of John Nash: a renowned mathematician who unfortunately had multiple personality syndrome. The movie, though slow in the first twenty minutes, became interesting when Ed Harris's character was introduced. This is where the audience sides with Nash, believing that he really did work for a secret organization, and that his best friend was the only one who didn't take him for being crazy. Yet, in the middle of the film, we discover his true problem, and become emotionally attached to the way he must now 'ignore' his visions.
Jennifer Connelly also did a fantastic job playing Nash's wife. She too took the part of Alicia Nash to the fullest, playing her with much emotion and depth. No matter what happened to her husband, she never stopped loving him, or helping him overcome his illness.Crowe has so much potential and has truly reached the top with this drama. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend you rent it and see how far you can stretch your imagination to the depths of the lead character. Be ready for a tear jerker.

When Harry Met Sally...," Best Romantic Comedy of All Time....
","When Harry Met Sally is a film that not only supports witty and memorable dialogue, it provides a great analysis of the interaction between the two sexes: and poses the universal question of whether men and women can truly be friends. This is the film that launched Meg Ryan as queen of the romantic comedy lead, as well as established Billy Crystal as a strong leading man, both becoming their characters with such unique tastes they are destined to become cinematic icons.This is the film so many other romantic comedies try to live up to, yet most often fail to accomplish. Creating two memorable and likable characters such as Harry Burns and Sally Albright has proven to be more stereotype than unique. Harry with his easy going attitude towards women, and Sally with her obsessive compulsive ways. The two are seeming opposites personality wise, and at first, these traits keep them apart. It takes them ten years to even have a real conversation without tension between them because one is a man, and the other a woman. Yet it takes one event, both getting dumped by their significant others, to bring them together to bond over.What makes this film so memorable is the dialogue, with an outstanding screenplay by Nora Ephron. The Oscar nomination she was given for writing this film was highly deserved, for penning such lines as why men and women can never be friends, as well as Harry's declaration of love t the film's end.The film also supports a strong supporting cast from Carrie Fisher, as well as Bruno Kirby as the best friends to the lead characters. Every supporting player here remains memorable, down to the cameos such as director Reiner's mother who states the now famous, 'I'll have what she's having.' line.The ending to this film can bring tears to those who watch it every time. It is films like this that give hope to people that one day, they will find that one person who challenges them, and loves them for exactly who they are. When Harry Met Sally is the perfect film to watch for people of all ages, and will certainly stand the test of time. Highly recommended.MJR",Null,6,11,15 September 2004
Hitch," Three Charming Leads Make Hitch A Winner
","Hitch is the perfect formulatic date movie that brings a charming cast and hilarious situations together into an enjoyable popcorn flick that will not disappoint.Will Smith plays Alex 'Hitch' Hitchins, a date doctor who helps out hopeless men get the women of their dreams. He sets up situations that get the woman to first notice his client, then consults them on three dates before sending them on their way to a blissful and happy life with the woman they love. His business is by reference only, which is why he is able to keep what he does a secret from the public. This being Smith's first outing in the romantic comedy genre, he handles it like it is the only genre he has ever done. Smith is wonderful since he is playing his charming self, only as a date doctor out to prove to the world that any man can sweep any woman off her feet.His newest project is Albert, a seemingly hopeless case who is madly in love with Alegra Cole, lead owner of a prestigious company who doesn't even know he exists. Kevin James is suitable cast as Albert, playing the clumsy, asthmatic, all around good guy who only wants to love someone. He and Smith play off of each other with good comedic timing and a natural chemistry. The especially funny scenes come when Hitch is consulting Albert n how to act on his first date with Alegra, and hilarity ensues. It proves again the versatility of Smith, who before Hitch had primarily starred in action films.Eva Mendes is perfectly cast as Sara, a gossip columnist who, for some reason, falls for Hitch's charms even after a botched first date. Hitch has an over all comedic tone, but that's not to say that there are a few sentimental parts that could have either been handled differently or left out, such as a scene between Sara and Hitch that takes place in her apartment. The scene was a little too sappy, and broke the rhythm that had been set. It felt very much out of place, but once the scene ends, Hitch picks up momentum and becomes a lot of fun again.Take your date to this movie, and it is a guaranteed good time. Although Hitch is the formulatic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, with charming leads and a happy ending. There's no way you can go wrong! MJR",Null,2,4,4 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The film that started my love for dramas
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was twelve when I first saw this movie in 1998. I was flipping through the channels on my TV when I was first introduced to the character of Andy Dufresne. I watched with amazement and was fully absorbed by the happenings and events that took place. When a commercial break came on, I was impatient for it to end so I could find out what would be next. The beginning of the movie has Andy being imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. He says he didn't do it. And I believed he did, until the plot twister changed my whole perspective. Red is the man narrorating, and to me, is the main character about how is life is changed around over the twenty years he knows Andy. And if it's anything that made me cry, it was at the end where Red is finally free. This film started my compassion for movies with meaning behind them, and if you view this picture, be ready for a new look on life.In other words, DON'T pass this movie by.

The Matrix," There is no spoon.....
","Let me tell you, a movie like this is hard to come by these days. not only is this the best sci-fi movie ever, it as advanced as one of the greatest movies of all time. Before the Matrix, I thought of Keanu Reeves as a cute looking guy who couldn't act (except in Speed). But no. Instead, I see one of the most complex heroines of our generation. Neo, the One, comes to terms with who he must become. He is awakened after spending his whole life in a reality that isn't real. What is real? what isn't? He doesn't know, until at the end where things fall into place. Don't start watching this film thinking you'll get it the first time through. I had to watch it three times in order to fully understand the movie. And don't just watch the movie because of the special effects (although they too were fabulous). Watch it because of the plot, and the amazing performances by Carrie Ann Moss, Keanu Reeves, and Laurence Fishbourne. This is a movie that has something for everyone.

Gangs of New York," Well It Wasn't All Bad...
","The first time I heard of Gangs of New York was way back in February of 2002. I was hearing from all over the place that this would be THE film of 2002, and suddenly I couldn't wait to see it. So for ten months, the anticipation built, and when opening day finally came around, I grabbed a friend and we sat back to enjoy the show. Well, I really hate to admit it, but I was disappointed with what I saw.What is going to happen with this epic film however, it that the audience who sees it is going to be so caught up in the stunning sets, costumes, and accuracy in historical events that the main plot is going to slip form their minds. If you want the truth, I saw no main plot being developed during the course of this film. Gangs of New York starts off with a bang, and for the first five minutes of the film, I was caught up in 1860-s New York. We are introduced to Priest Vallon and Bill The Butcher in the beginning of the film, and the scenes with Liam Neeson were absolutely stunning. As soon as we jump forward sixteen years however, the film goes downhill.
For the rest of the film, I found myself being bored with what was going on on screen. Nothing happening kept me interested at all. Little areas here and there caught my attention, but these were far away from each other. And those little areas that sparked my attention involved the ever wonderful Daniel Day-Lewis. He is amazing here, and assures himself an Oscar nomination next month. Leonardo DiCaprio was very surprising on his acting abilities in this film. He was able to hold his own on the screen with Day-Lewis. So really, the only problem I had with this film was the story. It just so happens that story is the most important element in a movie. Martin Scorsese did a supurb job as far as visuals, but story fails in this picture. He could have done so much with this film. Even still, I'd recommend this film simply for the great sets, costumes, historical accuracy, and a chance to see Daniel Day-Lewis become Bill The Butcher. A visual feast, yet I was left disappointed. Others were blinded by this, and I wish I was one of them.

Atonement," An Artistic, Technical, and Emotional Masterpiece
","Atonement opens on a young Briony Tallis jubilantly finishing a play to be performed that evening for her family. She stands and walks through her home, searching for her mother, and we follow her, ghostlike, looming above, as she searches. In a way, the themes of this film are summed up in this first shot: Briony, aimless, searching for truth in her imagination and fiction. And if this sounds like a contradiction, trust me when I say you will come to understand this by film's end.I have not read the book, written by Ian McEwan, but after viewing this film, I am eager to pick it up and follow the thoughts of the characters more intimately than what is shown on film. What we have here is amazing work, both technically, artistically, and emotionally, yet on some level, it is unable to grasp the concept of writing fiction from Briony's point of view. There are no doubts about the talents of Joe Wright, who at 34 has now made two exceptional films (Pride and Prejudice being the other one) with his lead actress Keira Knightly, who herself grows in her abilities with each passing year.James McAvoy cements his position as a leading man, creating a brilliant life in Robbie that glues your eyes to his predicaments and his thought on the world around him. He carries the weight of the film, and is the one who undergoes the most change. From his fresh faced boyishness in the opening scenes to the rugged, worn, and tired eyes in the latter, McAvoy is able to successfully convey the innocence of young love to the brutalities of war, and we love him for it.Joe Wright has again, proved his talent as a film director, whose use of the tracking shot will be among the greatest, up there with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Children of Men, and Magnolia. His use with a camera lens is so poetic at times, they could be freeze framed and placed on walls as pieces of art in themselves. My only qualm is sometimes these shots are too technical, and distracts from the film itself. Though that is more of a personal observation than a general one.And let's not forget to mention the score, which only enhances the epic feel it brings, successfully weaving diegetic noise (the typewriter in particular) with the non-diegetic, Dario Marianelli, composer of Wright's previous work, Pride and Prejudice, creates moody, dramatic pieces that perfectly set the tone of the scenes they play in. It's one that will be recognized in years to come.Without a doubt, Atonement is one of the best films released this year, and certainly a must see for lovers of film in general, if only for its amazing tracking shot of a war torn beach in France. I, for one, look forward to viewing it a second time in the near future.",Null,3,6,16 December 2007
