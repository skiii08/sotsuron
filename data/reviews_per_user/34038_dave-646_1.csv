The Blair Witch Project," Camera that runs 4 days and 4 nights on one battery pack
","This has to be a joke. I don't know of any camera that can operate for four days and four nights on a single set of batteries. Scary NO! Anyone who has spent a little time in woods could tell that they were shooting the same areas over and over. Almost impossible to run in woods while filming in daylight, impossible in dark.
