The Blair Witch Project," A different kind of scare.
","I heard a lot of hype about this movie.But that kinda spoiled the experience a bit for me.Since this film would have been way scarier if people thought it was real.Oh well. The movie was still pretty good.Its a whole different kind of scary movie,since the enemy ( enemies?) are never seen,not even a glimpse.So the audience keeps guessing untill the end,:was there actually a 'Blair witch'?Or just some very sadistic killers that enjoyed playing games with their victims.And its cool that virtually no gore is used at all.And thank God no cheap 'jump at ya' scares.I was actually getting chills and gripping my seat at the dark screen,the darkness reminded me of when I was a child scared of the dark. ( This movie works great in a dark theater,but I'm not sure how it will work in a living room TV.Maybe too 'Home-movieish?')Its great what filmakers can come up with,when there is no money for flashy fx.The only thing missing is a slight glimpse of what was hunting them...a shadow, a shape...but nope,maybe it does work in the movie's adventage in the end for some people.But I wanted a bit more, but still a very cool idea.Great job guys!",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
Alien 3," This sequel has gotten a lot of flak from fans and...
","This sequel has gotten a lot of flak from fans and critics alike but after seeing the pathetic Alien ressurection I realize that this movie was a decent ending for the series.Sure I didn't like it that some other survivors from Aliens got killed off right off the start of the movie and yes some of the Fx looked pretty cheesy...and no weapons?? What???Boring!But the things this movie has going for it is the sleek atmospheric look, the hybrid Alien ( Finally we see the alien take the features of an different non-human host). Some good acting from Sigourney and the rest of the cast. And a smart unexpected ending.",Null,0,3,7 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ohh! This is where it all began!
","As the first episode of the star wars series this movie works quite well,it introduces us to all the familiar characters and finally shows us where they all started out in this epic saga.This movie has the BEST light sabre battles yet of all the movies,the Darth Maul/Obi wan kenobi battle scenes are SWEET!And the pod race sequence was jaw dropping and utterly spectacular and the reason why I will see this movie again.But the movie has some serious problems that make it a chore to watch sometimes: Jar Jar Binks ....( barf!!)..he is so annoying that I hope they kill him off in episode 2!Just imagine a CGI Roger Rabbit with an high pitched annoying voice. And while the special FX are hyper awesome they tend to be overused and seem to overstay their welcome at times. And this movie has some VERY dull spots,especially when they keep talking about all the senate/treaty crap...uhh!...give us more light sabre fights already.But overall a good start for the series and I cant wait too see how episode 2 and 3 turn out.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Lets kick some Nazi butt!
","What else can I say? Indiana Jones is the coolest hero ever, he is always reluctant at first but then his'Oh,what the hell' attitude shows and he gets down to his Nazi bustin'business.  This really shows how much of human character he is. This was the first jump-up-and-cheer-on-the-good guy, movie I ever saw and I had such a blast that I will never forget it. But then what do you expect when George Lucas and Steven Spielberg team up?Lets hope Indy will come back for another adventure soon!",Null,0,0,7 May 1999
Se7en," A SINFUL pleasure...
",A great thriller that will leave you guessing and breathless till the electrifying ending.Great acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.And superbly stylish direction by David Fincher this movie is such a great trip...it might be considered a deadly sin by itself.,Null,0,0,17 August 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Alien Putrification!
","At the end of Alien 3 ...we see a our heroine: Ripley.Tired and beaten.Finally succumb to the Alien that she tried so hard to stop.She was a fighter that sacrificed herself in her battle to save mankind. A sad but fitting end to a great sci-fi trilogy.WHAT?Whats this..another Alien movie...what the?This cant be good.In the fourth Alien movie...they revived Ripley and put her in this pathetic film.All that was classy and real about the series has been replaced with cheesy FX,dumb action and bad one liners.Please try to forget this movie...and stick with the first 3 instead.",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the best!
","Return of the Jedi is my favorite Star Wars flick for many reasons: 1) We get the best action and fx in the series.2)We see where all our favorite characters end up.( Who cares if they don't end up where some of the pimple faced fans want, its George Lucas' movie so he'll do whatever he wants and you'll like it!)3)We see Luke finally have a great balanced light sabre fight against Darth Vader.4)The best space battles in the whole series.5)The battle on Endor.Gotta love those speederbikes and cuddely wuddely Ewoks (Can't help it they grow on ya!)6)The final touching redemption of Anakin Skywalker.7)Princess Leia in a bikini ( Va-va-voom!)8)And see the death star blow up REAL good!( YEAH!)Ok the movie isn't perfect,I was disappointed that we won't get to see more of Boba Fett.And there is some cheese here and there,but WHO cares? IT'S STAR WARS!Can't wait to get this on DVD",Null,0,1,7 May 1999
Alien," Uh,my chest hurts....
","This movie really impressed me for one thing....the introduction of the ALIEN....no cute spielbergian ET ,no grey colored big eyed dwarfs like in the X-files.I'm sure if we ever encounter Aliens in real life they will look like this creature,black, slimy,eyeless and insectious ...and that double fanged mouth...brilliant!This creature is our nightmares visualized in latex.The movie on the other hand is pretty good,the ensamble acting is great and the fx are very good.But there are some very slow spots,but all that is rectified once the creature starts having lunch on the crew members.Good movie but Aliens is better.",7,0,2,7 June 1999
Forrest Gump," A very original movie.
","This movie is everything entertaining,funny,touching and insightful. Tom Hanks is amazingly charming as Forrest and you'll truly feel like you have made a special friend by the end of the movie. Enjoy this one,its quite different from the usual crap Hollywood puts out ,so go see it and love it!",Null,0,2,7 May 1999
Predator," Ain't got no time to bleed!
","What a great movie! From the great cast ,the cool FX that still look good today ,and of course AHHHNULD!One of his best movies! The action is relentless and just doesn't let up,of course what do you expect from director John Mctiernan ( Die hard) Also I gotta say isn't the predator the coolest looking alien badguy EVER?...Gotta be those dreads!",Null,0,0,9 May 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," A true gem!
","Here is a truly great film,I would call this film a drama with some action elements (that are quite good!)This movie is driven by great and quite out of the ordinary characters ,a hitman becoming the best friend of a 12 year old girl??...How about a psycho,pill popping cop??You can really see that this movie did not come from an American mind. Watch it and be pleasantly surprised.",Null,0,1,10 May 1999
American Pie," Nothin' says lovin like somethin' from the oven!
","Now this movie was a pleasant surprise! I haven't seen a good teen sex comedy since the 1980's but this one is raunchier,funnier...and 'Ghasp'...more sensitive than the others.The movie has some great laughs and some hot babes too! Go check it out and have good old potty inspired fun!:-)",Null,0,0,10 July 1999
Armageddon," 150 million dollars of wasted cash.
","It's amazing that producers are willing to throw away that much money to make this piece of trash, while they could have used the money to produce ten low budget films with some real substance.While Bruce Willis is likeable as always, he can not save this obnoxious film. The director Michael Bay has a flair for style,he does not have the talent to make this film exciting or involving. Here is his formula to show the audience an 'exciting' scene: 1) Blow up everything...big and loud! 2) Shake the camaras non stop...cuz we all know in order to excite the audience ,they shouldn't know for a second what's going on. 3)Show the same scene from 1000 angles.( Keep shaking!) 4)Close the scene with a really goofy slow-motion shot...and bring in Aerosmith!! Uhhhhhhhhh...kill me please!",2,0,1,2 March 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An hard core action movie with a heart.
","In my opinion James Cameron has never made a bad movie in his career and T2 ranks as one of his best work. The movie is a fascinating continuation of the 1984 original (basically a feature length chase scene like the first.)As always Cameron takes the time to flesh out his characters in this movie and by establishing an emotional connection with his audience he amplifies the impact so much more. Linda Hammilton is fantastic as the tortured heroine ( Another great female character from Cameron.)The special fx are eye popping, and this movie introduced the word 'Morph' in the english vocabulary.I also liked Robert Patric as the indestructible T-1000 (one of the best villains of all time.) and too bad he didn't have more screen time ....what villain will Cameron cook up in the third sequel?? Phew!Overall a spectacular actioner with a touching (what??) ending not to be missed.",Null,1,1,16 February 1999
Aliens," A butt- kickin' ride you won't soon forget.
","How do you make a sequel that equals or even 'gasp' surpasses the quality of the original? Well as the director of this movie puts it: 'More is more.' And that is exactly what he did is this spectacular sci-fi actioner. More xenomorphs, more firepower, (way) more action, a surprisingly involving storyline, and more well-written characters.After a slightly slow introduction this movie accelerates to a heart pounding pace that grabs you and never lets go. But what sets this movie apart are the smart involving characters, this is an action movie where you actually care whether the characters live or die. Sigourney Weaver is spectacular as the reluctant herione.( She got a well deserved Oscar nomination.)The special effects are awesome and manage to look better than some CG effects today, also note James Horner's thrilling score. ( The climactic score of this picture has been re-used to spice up many movie trailers).Overall every self-respecing moviegoer HAS to see this masterpiece. Forget about all the crappy sequels 20th Century Fox keeps releasing to milk the popularity of this movie.Note that this movie has the most spectacular man vs alien fight scene EVER. Once you see it you'll know what I mean.",10,0,0,13 February 1999
Die Hard 2," Blow stuff up real good!
","At first I didn't think that the second instalment of the Die Hard series could live up to the original, but this movie is a blast (literally!) from start to finish.Bruce Willis is awesome as the wisecracking John Mclaine and the true thing that keeps his series going.While this movie is not for the faint of heart, after you see that disturbingly horrific plane crash sequence you'll think twice before boarding a plane again.Overall a great action movie that more than does the original justice.",Null,1,1,23 February 1999
Independence Day," Ka-BOOM!
","This movie was one of the best marketed movies ever... I mean the trailers where you simply saw people looking up at the sky and see a giant shadow blanket a city was brilliant! It sure made me pumped up to see the movie.And you know what? I really liked this flick,yeah there are some REALLY dumb moments and the some characters are stereo typical.But I didnt care...this movie has enough action,laughs and eye popping fx to keep everyone entertained.And some of the best dog-fights and explosions I have EVER seen.Gotta love it when they vaporize the White house ( Hillary!RUN!)Great fun!",Null,0,0,14 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Heartwrenching drama.
","Together with 'Platoon' one of the best war movies ever made. From the guesome realism in the battlefields ,to the good performances by the cast and the masterful direction by Spielberg.This motion picture is unforgettable and truly proves that war is hell.A honorable salute to every man and woman that has ever had to experience such awful events.",Null,0,0,20 August 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Missed the mark .
","I was really looking forward to this movie, I had already read the novel by Michael Crichton and couldn't wait to see how Steven Spielberg would film it.But from the opening scene I went:'What the..?'The opening scene where the girl meets the compy was actually taken out of the ORIGINAL Jurassic park novel! So from there I knew something was wrong.And yes my fears came true, bad acting,giant plot holes and overused special effects( Oddly the dino's seem less fleshy and more 'plasticky' than the first film....don't ask me how.)The sequence when the T-rexes attack the trailer is the only good part of this film.But sadly that doesn't save this movie from being one of Spielberg's worst.",Null,0,0,29 May 1999
Ghostbusters," Supernatural laughs
","I first saw the movie when I was 7 years old in 1986.And I was actually pretty scared by some of the scary scenes.And it wasnt untill 1999 when I checked out the DVD I really enjoyed the movie.While some of the FX shots look a bit dated,most hold up quite well to this day.Ya gotta hand it to Dan Aykroyd and the other writers for coming up with something this cool and fun. My only gripe...show me more of Slimer!He is one of the coolest 'class 5 vapours' ever.",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
Pulp Fiction," Whoa!
","This film hits you with so much energy,it leaves you almost drained afterwards. Its cool,crazy,funny,sexy,freaky,sick,fun....and did I say cool? It's so different from anything else you've seen before ,that's why some people love it or totally hate it. I in my turn LOVE it...now lets do the dance floor hip  rocking'two fingers in front of your eyes dance!Groovy!",Null,0,0,7 May 1999
Titanic," The best Titanic movie yet.
","I'm a BIG James Cameron fan and am really happy this brilliant director finally got his due. While die-hard Cameron fans might be surprised that the movie isn't the non-stop thrill-a-second yarn they are used to, they will really appreciate his involving characters, flawless eye for detail and spectacular special fx.The movie isn't perfect though, while Jack and Rose are warmly human ,fleshed out characters, most of the others are reduced to dissapointing cardboard charcters too bad...maybe they will be explored in the directors cut. While Gloria Stuart is very touching as old Rose (She was robbed at the Oscars by Kim Basinger...Grrrr!)While the movie is more than 3 hours long, it never feels like it, you experince total awe as James Cameron whisks you back in time allowing you to explore the worlds most famous liner in PERFECT detail. After the 3rd class dance scene you actually hope in your heart the doomed liner never hits that iceberg.After the ship hits  we are exposed to the sinking of the Titanic in equal (almost scary) detail.And here Cameron is in his best form.(I found the realism of the ship breaking in two almost disturbingly real ).A great, unforgettable motion picture that should not be missed. Truly deserving of its best picture Oscar.",8,0,2,16 February 1999
Die Hard," Welcome to the party pal!!
","What can I say? This movie was so cool and exciting that many other movies tried to imitate it (but very few have been able to duplicate it!) This movie is quite different from most other actioners,John Mclaine is not the big-dumb-ball-o-muscles-with-a foreign-accent action hero.He is smart witty and not quite too thrilled with his situation,but hell ya gotta do what ya gotta do! The bad guys are also quite different ,not a ugly dirty brainless bunch from the wrong side of the tracks,but Hans Gruber and his group are sleek ,sophisticated, and ruthless! The action is non-stop and so much fun you'll watch this movie many more times after the first viewing.Oh yeah and here comes the mandatory Die Hard cheer: YIPPIE-KA-YAY MOTHERCLUCKER!!!",9,0,0,10 May 1999
Jaws," The movie that etches itself in your soul.
","What can I say about this timeless classic? This movie is so good that EVERY single person that has seen this movie and has wandered off to the deep end of the ocean feels that unmistakable uncomfortable feeling that 'something' might been lurking underneath. And then...while you are not sure you start hearing that throbbing score...tum,tum,tum,tum.....need I say more?",Null,0,1,23 February 1999
The Lion King," An animation masterpiece.
","This film is one of the best Disney films to date. Together with 'Bambi','The Little Mermaid','Beauty and the Beast',that suggest that animated movies aren't 'Just for kids'they are an art form.Once seeing this film one sees the power that this genre can exude.I have to comment on the voice acting in this film that is brilliant,especially Jeremy Irons as 'Scar',the best animated villain ever.",Null,0,0,26 September 1999
Scream," the movie that revived the 'slasher' genre.
","After the slasher genre virtually disappeared for a couple of years this movie sneaks from left field and thrills the hell out of us!The plot is witty,smart,hip,very exciting and the ending was quite a surprise...it will keep you guessing!",Null,0,0,11 May 1999
Speed," who knew public transportation could be this exciting?
","From the opening credits to the final shot this movie is a lot of fun,I liked that this movie avoids most of the cliche's that many action movies overuse nowadays. The action is fast and exciting,just don't nick-pick at some of the scenes that the bus defies the forces of gravity. So go ahead and catch the bus!",Null,0,0,9 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," A chilling drama..or is that a dramatic chiller?
","I was very surprised by this movie...I was expecting a horror flick (Thats what the trailers led me to believe).But what I got was a fantastic drama with some genuinely chilling moments.With fantastic peformances by the young boy ( wow!this kid is great!)and Bruce Willis (In a great subdued role.) This movie reminded me a lot of 'The Silence of the Lambs'... since it also had that great balance of  great plot,acting,cinematography and chills.And then of course the ending...WOW!..not to spoil anything for you..Its great! and will have you thinking about it for hours after the movie is over.Go see it....NOW!",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Braveheart," A true epic.
","One of my favorite movies of all time. It's amazing how Mel Gibson has been able to grab a virtually unknown Legend and bring it to the silver screen with sparkling intensity and passion,and not like a snooze-o-rama history lesson.A great story with fantastic acting and the most realistic battle scenes I have ever seen,(you almost feel a sword swing over your head and chopping a guy to bits behind you.)A must see for anyone that loves great stories of human triumph.",Null,1,2,7 May 1999
Jurassic Park," Don't Move!
","Another great film by Steven Spielberg. Based on the book by Michael Crichton,an exciting ride in the 'what if' realm.A great techno thriller that gives the creepy impression something like this can actually happen. Some of the first great digital FX shots are used here to bring dinosaurs back to life.I absolutely LOVE the T-rex,the first time I saw the film I felt like I was looking at an actual living,breathing Dinosaur.And you gotta love that T-rex roar!KEWL!Cant wait to hear it on DVD ( Hear that Steven??!) Even though the movie is FAR from perfect (This movie has the most goofs I have EVER noticed in a film,but nobody likes a knit-picker...now do they?)And no more crappy sequels please 'The Lost world' was bad enough!",Null,0,1,14 August 1999
