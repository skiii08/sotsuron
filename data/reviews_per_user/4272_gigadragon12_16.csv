Black Swan," Black Swan (aka Everyone wants to bone Natalie Portman)
","Directed by: David Aronofsky Ho-lee crap I don't think I can quite express in words how awesome this movie was. If you need a short version, its absolutely amazing, probably the best movie this year, and shoves all the complexity of a great work of literature into some of the most interesting two hours of film ever.Now then, Black Swan is about the ballet Swan Lake, in which the ballerina who plays The Swan Queen must show both the innocence and virginity of the role of the White Swan, while also playing the opposite role, the lusty and seductive Black Swan. Natalie Portman plays Nina, who is one of the hardest working dancers in her ballet company, who gets picked to play The Swan Queen. The conflict arises when her director, played by Vincent Cassel, tells her that her White Swan is perfect, but that she seems to lack in the role of the Black Swan. This is followed up by the director attempting to unleash Nina's inner Black Swan through means of seducing her, and waiting for her to go and seek her darker persona.Meanwhile, Nina's Mother is over-bearing and highly protective of her, in what ends up being a very psycho kind of obsessive nature. Also, Mila Kunis plays Lily, who is the opposite of Nina, perfect at the Black Swan, but not the ideal White Swan. Nina feels pressure from her director to adapt to the Black Swan, pressure from her Mother to remain the White Swan, and pressure from Lily's presence and the possibility that she will lose her role as Swan Queen to her.All of this is built up over the fact that Nina herself is popping up all over the place with bloody wounds, scratch marks, and in general experiencing a full on mental breakdown, in more ways than one. When it all combines it brings the damn house down.What is really so great about Black Swan is how seamless all of this feels. There isn't a single moment in the film that feels forced. Every aspect of it is set up early and remains as much a part of the film until the very end. The psychological aspect presents itself slower than most, but makes up for it by ruling over the final act of the movie. Furthermore, the pressures that Nina feels are not the pressures of a ballerina that has to play The Swan Queen, they are the pressures that everyone feels, pressures of parents, pressures of playing your role, pressures of competition, all of it applies universally across men and women. Once the movie wraps up it seems to be about breaking everyone's expectations, rising to the challenge, and doing what you want to do.But this aspect also bring out other more challenging aspects of playing a role. Nina is originally seduced largely by her director, what she does subsequently largely has to do with how she is told to adapt to the role. The movie seems to play an underscore about how far do you go to break the expectations? Furthermore, whose expectations are you really playing for? At what point do you stop being yourself and become your role? The complexity of all this is all presented really well, through beautiful dance scenes, and a brilliant classical score. This movie has blood, sex, dance, and art, all mixed up together in a blend that has been seen before, but nowhere near as great as it is presented here.If you like movies, you'll love Black Swan. This is absolutely a must-see!! Go see it now. Now! NOW!!!",10,7,15,18 December 2010
The Hangover," Take a coffee after you see this...
","The Hangover is about four guys who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. In all recent comedy fashion and just what you would expect from the title, these guys wake up, after having spent a night of being blown out of their minds in Vegas. Unfortunately, one of the guys is missing and they start out on a terribly misguided adventure to find out where he is.So in other words, The Hangover follows the formula of Dude Where's My Car, with comedy that is overall more shocking and less about stupid comedy and more about shock comedy. If you can let yourself go for a little while, and try not to think about the thousands of moral implications brought on by the storyline, then you're liable to enjoy some good dirty fun, and one of the funniest comedy movies this century.Unfortunately, there are some down sides. This movie really is ONLY about the misadventures brought about by their actions from the night before, nothing deep or meaningful here. While you do have to let yourself go every once in a while, it's a shame the movie didn't take more of a shot at the corrupt morals it takes to ruin your life in Vegas, and simply promotes Sin City's decadence of stupid young twenty something lifestyle being played out by mid thirty aged actors.That being said, the actors do a great job. The shining role here is played by Zach Galifianakis, as the brother of the bride, and his lines of really screwed up shock comedy, rather than every other actor in the movie. Ultimately the second best actor is the guy you see the least of, the groom.The Hangover is good for some nice, not so clean, fun. Basically it is what it sells, and that is what every other after-the-party comedy sells, and that's decadence in a lifestyle that really isn't that great. Still, let yourself go, and you'll find some belly busting laughter several times at this movie.",7,0,3,19 May 2010
The Prestige," The Prestige is a Magical piece.
","The Prestige is a movie about two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Agnier (Hugh Jackman) work as apprentices to Cutter (Michael Caine). During their work for him, one of the tricks suffers a terrible accident and Agnier develops an obsession for being better than Borden. When Borden develops a trick that Agnier can't figure out, things continue to escalate until both men are at each others throats.This movie is great. It plays with the time line and actually starts at the death of Robert Agnier. The viewpoint shifts between Borden and Agnier to keep you involved with both men, and while the movie goes through both men manage to become ambiguously protagonist and antagonist. The movie is a mystery, when the magicians develop tricks, you aren't told how they are doing their tricks right away. In a way, its like seeing a magic show while seeing the movie. The movie is filled with twists that keep you on the edge of your seat, though near the end it can seem like its getting dragged out a bit, you eventually catch up to the present events taking place and the actual ending to the story.Even though this is a great movie, its not without its flaws. Near the start in particular, it was hard to tell what was going on exactly because of the non-linear time line that the movie uses to tell the story. You might be confused a little bit on the characters and what all is going on for a good part of the opening, but it clears up quick enough, and maybe its just me. There's also a bit of a problem with the female characters. The main female characters, Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall) and the stagehand secondary love interest (Scarlett Johanson), manage to garner attention and seem to be written to be really important to the plot of the movie. Unfortunately, this just isn't realized very well, and by the end of the movie its questionable if they even had to be there in the first place, or if they were just put on to the set to be eye candy.Overall, The Prestige is a great movie, perfectly done and well performed. I haven't read the novel (yet) and therefore can't comment on how well it did with the source material, but from a basic movie stand point, it is very exciting, and a movie you should see, even if it doesn't take highest priority.8.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,15 August 2010
Horrible Bosses," Word of Mouth Review: Horrible Bosses
","Horrible Bosses is a crude, sexual, racial comedy that shocks you with its amoral characters without regard for morality, consciousness, or common sense.And we all love it. -Review Score: 8/10In case the previews weren't clear enough, this movie is about three friends who hate their bosses to the point they want to kill them. What lacks in the preview is how each person is 'trapped' in their jobs (more on that quotation later) and some background on how they got into their various situations is touch and go, but that's a good thing because this is a comedy and not a serious movie.All the actors are good in their roles, Kevin Spacey is easily the star of the show as the only seemingly serious person in the entire plot. Charlie Day is probably going to be everyone's favorite as he essentially plays his character from Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia, except with a soul.The big issues (if your a real stickler like me) are the plot, and perhaps if I had gone to see this movie in a different mood, I wouldn't rate it so well. The sticklers are the plot. Just about every character threatens to leave their job at some point in the first part of the film, but something stops them. Not a single point that stops them is anything that would really stop someone in real life, so in essence it sort of dumbs down the characters, which gets really irritating as a reminder later on when Jason Bateman's character is attempting to be the moral center of the group. Also Jason Sudeikis' character's boss is so thrown together for the sake of having another bad guy that he is literally in the movie for a total of 5 or so minutes, the movie focusing a lot more on Jennifer Anniston and (even she takes a back seat) to Kevin Spacey's character.So a better title might have been Horrible Boss (Sexual Harassment, and Thrown Together reason to get a third comedian in here), rather than Horrible Bosses...BUT This movie is funny, and not just normal trashy funny its good trashy funny. Charlie Day is already associated with Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia which is GREAT Trashy Comedy, and this movie follows in the same footsteps with the annoying mild moral reasoning thrown in (though mostly as a joke). Also Ron White cameos about halfway through and literally does nothing, its like they just got him in there to surprise us with the fact that he's there, but he doesn't even make a funny, or at least not a memorable one.So... overall its fun and funny and there's no reason not to see this movie. Catch it when you can. I'm the Mouth and this has been the Word.",8,8,15,10 July 2011
Lost in Translation," Word of Mouth Review: Lost in Translation
","Review Score: 9/10 – Beautiful Cinematics and an alien culture create some of the best atmospheres for a uniquer love story than most movies.Lost In Translation is the story about aging actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) as he goes to Japan to film some whiskey commercials. Along the way he meets and shares a deep relationship with Charlotte (Scarlet Johansen) in a down to earth and adult relationship.Where Translation manages to wow and impress is largely in its visuals. There are several expanses of the movie that simply observe the city of Tokyo and other areas of Japan. It examines its plant life, parks, industry, religions, cultures, all without a single word of explanation. This works as it allows the viewer to take it in and form their own opinions about these things. They aren't just placed out of context however, they are always following a character or both the main characters and have reasons for being there.This also plays largely into the comedy of Translation, as Bill Murray winds his way through various media sets from photography to film to TV and even his encounters with a Japanese prostitute and hotel staff are rife with cultural humorous and add to the entire shroud of being misplaced.Being misplaced is a huge central theme of the movie. It accomplishes this by having its American characters in a Japanese setting and going through the most zany and out of whack parts of that culture. The characters both feel misplaced in their relationships and their futures (Bob Harris' failures as an actor and Charlotte's useless seeming position in her marriage and job (she has a degree in Philosophy)). But I do wonder if this effect can truly be felt by everyone especially a person from Japan perhaps, might understand the physical comedy of things like a shower that's too short for Bill Murray, but what about the cultural displacement? So as such, this is the films only true downfall is that it does rely on cultures to shift the difference and apply the alienation to its characters. While this could probably be easily observed by anyone, I do wonder if it can be felt by audiences that aren't innately so Americanized. Of course, that being said, its like having a Japanese person watch an episode of Jersey Shore, and even most Americans know whats wrong with that public face, right? A bit off track there, oh well.Anyways, Lost in Translation is heavy with cinematic sections, a good unique love story, and a very rich and powerful setting that impresses even as it enchants. It is a great movie, and no one should miss it.",9,1,2,4 July 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A formula whodunit cake sprinkled with intrigue and an unexplored better storyline
","Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is essentially a whodunit layered by a story about an investigative journalist getting his professional dignity stripped from him and then reaffirmed. It's central focus being that the title character Lisbeth, is a bad ass never back down girl who is stuck in between a rock and a hard place and performs several lewd, violent, and otherwise 'bad' acts in order to get what she wants. Where the movie loses its center is in emphasizing the seemingly usual whodunit plot line that is the heart of this story, but not its soul, which lies in the personal stories of its characters.Before the bad stuff, let's talk about the good stuff. The stories of Lisbeth and the whodunit are both crafted superbly. While I can't say either of them are different or challenging the mainstream craft of these types of story lines, it doesn't change how visceral the scenes within are. I don't want to give anything away, but I want to say that there are a minimum of three scenes in this movie that made my skin crawl and my seat feel physically uncomfortable, but in a great way that only movies can manage. Note: This movie is really not for the weak of heart.Both lead actors do well with their roles. Lisbeth is brought to life in every blank stare and movement, yet something about the whole character seems very statue like, I can't figure out if it's good or bad, but it was believable in any case. As for Daniel Craig, I've enjoyed his turns as James Bond, and this role is like a less secret agent version of that role.In all reality I look at this movie and I believe that what's been done here is very good, possibly the best film of this year, but I would assert that that statement is not saying much. This has not been a great year at the movies.However let's address what I was alluding to about the heart of the movie and the soul of the movie. Where the movie spends much of its filming genius and storyline is in the whodunit plot line. Intricate set pieces with perhaps one too many family members and flashbacks and pictures all lend themselves to a formulaic mystery plot line that serves as the driving point of staying with the movie. However, before starting that plot line and for about the last thirty or so minutes of the movie, that's not what this movie is about.While the movie spends so much time working the whodunit, several other more interesting things have happened and eventually happen that get skated over because the biggest part of the running time was spent on David Fincher's version of noir, without all the pulp that comes with the cop drama. Just about every moment of the film that doesn't have to do with this central theme has more interesting elements, but none of them are spent with much time, its almost like they were put in the movie just so people couldn't point and say, 'You left this this this and this out of the movie when they were in the book,' but they are thrown together so fast and recklessly that it leaves me wondering if the book truly skated over these plot points with such abandon or if I have to go read it to get what feels like the actual story.The biggest issue comes from its central characters only participating in the whodunit because there in lies something they want. For all the time the film spends making Lisbeth a bad ass new age woman that gets what she wants for herself, they spend a lot of the film showing that she really is just a dressed up girl, who makes her self out as a vamp. None of this is more painfully shown than in the last shot of the movie, which I'll let all of you experience for yourselves.While I like this film, something about it is just unbalanced from the story perspective. Why in a story rife with intrigue into the inner ties of corporate leaders and secrecy and shadows and computer hacking type activities must the plot butter up the seen a thousand times whodunit and skip the icing with the stories centered around these overarching elements? It doesn't make sense, and I firmly believe this film misses something from the book. Maybe I am wrong about that, but it makes the film seem unbalanced in that aspect.And yet it is a good film. I will give it an 8 out of 10.",8,4,9,22 December 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim is a shiny tinfoil wrapping around a mediocre movie
","Well to be honest, Scott Pilgrim is a movie that completely confuses me. That's not to say I didn't get the movie or the story, I just don't understand what its doing or what effect its trying to have.Scott Pilgrim v. The World is about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who is a Canadian punk rocker trying to break out with him band Sex Bob-omb. Shortly after the start of the film, Scott has a dream about Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who then shows up to him in real life. Crushing big time, Scott maneuvers his way to win Ramona's heart, only to realize that he'll have to battle Ramona's seven evil ex's. Insert tons of video game references and implications and you have Scott Pilgrim.Now as a huge gamer I'd like to say that Scott Pilgrim presents something wholly new to the spectrum of well entertainment in general. Most of the references to video games are the old school retro style platformers, either through music or the existence of life ups and points, but these really only exist as a backdrop to the whole thing. It could be a symbol of the immaturity in Scotts own mind as he battles to win the heart of the princess whom he dreams about, but the movie never directly points this out, or even embraces it. The lack of pointing it out of course doesn't mean that such implications do not exist, and indeed it is a great way of pointing out the simplified way that Scott's mind works, and may point to something in our own society, but again, the lack of direct influence of this way of thinking leads me to think that its nothing more than a shiny coating to what is really a very mediocre romantic comedy.Now maybe you understand why I'm confused about this movie. I could get more in-depth about this way of thinking, or the symbolism or what a battle against seven evil ex's could mean in the age of today and how it reflects upon a boy who feels he has to prove himself to win the heart of a girl, but I also feel that by pointing this out Scott Pilgrim would simply give me a +10 points for missing out on what the movie was meant to be, mindless celebration of gaming through romantic storytelling.So to sort of recap, Scott Pilgrim does things visually that make it seem spectacular and actually ties in tongue in cheek reference and examination to make it a major part of the point and the appeal. However, with what we were given in the film any of this ultimately plays out to the tune of a boy who wants to prove himself to a girl. No matter how epic the proportions, no matter how perfectly executed the marriage of gamer humor and reference is I find myself still looking at what ended up what I've said several times, a mediocre romantic comedy that didn't even provide much of a point.So shoot me in the kneecap but Scott Pilgrim was only slightly better than most romantic comedies. Its probably worth seeing, movie or rental is your choice.",7,2,11,6 September 2010
Kick-Ass," Kick Ass Kicks Ass
","Kick Ass is a superhero movie, and while it offers a satirical first act of what a superhero is, it rolls out as a true action movie by the time your watching the opening credits.That being said, you haven't seen this movie before. The situations are going to seem familiar, but the character are all brand new, especially the little 11 year old that takes the spotlight, Hit Girl brings in what I would like to guess is the next big Character Archetype. Now you've had little girls, and you've had bad ass little girls, Hit Girl fits into Bad ass little girl, but way different than before. She says a few bad words at the start, but it seems like that quickly dies out before the opening. What is not changed is that she is in the scenes were the most gratuitous violence is depicted and she is almost always the one committing gratuitous violence.Nicolas Cage works surprisingly perfect as a satire of Batman, and he ties in what unfortunately is probably a largely missed joke. Not going to spoil it here though.Ultimately, it sets off as a spoof, and works its way backwards into being one of the most awesome movies you're likely to see this year, and definitely the best so far this year.9/10",7,5,16,18 April 2010
Gran Torino," Can someone tell me the Gran Torino means??
","Gran Torino is the story of Dirty Harry I mean Walt Kowalski (this is obviously Eastwood), who is a Korean War Veteran with a strong racist streak. A family of Hmong move in next door that includes the young and brave Sue (Ahney Her) and the younger and unsure Thao (Bee Vang) When Thao gets rough housed into joining his Cousin's gang, he tries to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt then starts on a journey that will make him a hero to the whole neighborhood.First off I have to say that I learned more racist terms for Asians in this movie, than I even knew existed. Eastwood shoots them out every chance he gets, pretty much throughout the entire movie. This isn't a complaint. It actually gives the character a good multi-sidedness to him that evolves throughout the whole movie and serves as a reason to hate Walt, a humorous couple of situations, and remind you of the steely coldness behind it all.This movie really did most things pretty good, it focuses a lot on themes of family, expectation, and even throws in a few religious themes to go along with it, both accepting that religion and making fun of that religion. The movie really does good in dealing a blow to the whole gang banger community as a whole, as well as exposing the trashiness of it all, including the bottom feeding depths they will sink to.When its not dealing with overarching themes, Gran Torino focuses on the relationship between Sue and Thao with Walt. After Thao attempts to steal Walt's Torino, Sue starts a small friendship with Walt, and eventually works her charm and introduces him to her culture. This relationship leads to Thao working for Walt, who teaches Thao how to 'become a man' in the most humorous part of the movie.There are only a couple of complaints that I have with the movie. First, the climax was obvious and long coming for a while. Even the 'twist' that it has I felt was easy to read and figure out. This is only because the ten minutes between the climax and the conflict that arises before it. Not to mention it had that mildly cheesy and overused montage of the old guy *ahem* preparing himself.The other complaint is that both the Asian Actors (Ahney and Bee) had scenes where the sincerity of their acting seemed to drop, or just wasn't very good. That being said, Clint Eastwood was always acting best when his mouth was closed, but I can reasonably say that Clint Eastwood is aware of how Clint Eastwood can and should act. That is why I expect he has always been Dirty Harry in a different role.But in the end, these are small complaints that only poke small holes in the very enjoyable experience of watching Gran Torino. My recommendation is that you absolutely must see this movie, especially if you have any mild misogyny at all. It sucks that it isn't in movie theaters (not that I think you need theater quality to see this movie at all) but let me say this: If you own a movie theater, take the film and watch it there.",8,0,3,26 September 2010
Super 8," Celebration of E.T. and Close Encounters comes with mixture of humor and horror that works brilliantly.
","Review Score: 8.5 – Go see it.Super 8 is the story of a young group of kids who are trying to make a zombie movie in the summer of 1979. They're filming when they witness a terrible train wreck that causes their small town to become the hot spot of an Air Force Military Investigation. It quickly becomes clear that the military is attempting to keep something secret from everyone else and when people and mechanical items from around town begin disappearing things get even more hectic.First off, if you couldn't tell by the trailers, Super 8 is a celebration of old school films Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. (1980) and mixes it with J.J. Abrams' two big secret dangerous monster staying off camera until further and further into the movie, a la Cloverfield (2008) and Lost (2004). This ultimately makes for a unique blend of sad child hood misfortune and scary dodgy monster movie tactics, which is a great mixture and works very well.While I have a few quips with the movie, there is nothing particularly negative to say. The movie has brilliant development and revolves around a central theme of loss. The pacing seems appropriate and nothing seems terribly out of place. It does seem to have a love of needless explosions, though this seems more like a tactic to draw in the less enthusiastic action blockbuster crowd to see a movie that is ultimately more mystery and drama than action and explosions.Which brings me to my one major quip, the train wreck scene and some of the plot developments around it (a stolen car that would at least be a bit dirty after a thousand explosions go off around it) seem to be ignored for the sake of letting the children get away with it. A few other plot points never seem to pan out, and really just seems like the director wasn't entirely sure they could control the plot lines (like say the children being arrested by the Air Force). Also the ending is unfortunately thin and easy to see coming.But, as I said, any quips I have are minor. Another great thing is that its filled with quite a bit of humor, particularly the character and relationship of all the children making the film together blends together perfect and none are left without real character development by the end of the movie.Great movie, catch it when you can.",8,21,41,18 June 2011
Inception," Inception is a Dream Come True
","Inception is a mind-bending, intelligent, action packed movie. In general, those are three things you don't expect to see together. Inception's story revolves around Cobb (Leo DiCaprio) and his work as an extraction agent. I'm not going to give much away, but Cobb has to do one last job in order to get what he wants, and for that he needs to get a team together. Eventually the team embarks on their job, and secrets revolving around Cobb start to unfold and affect the mission.Now this movie was AWESOME. It manages to fill itself with enough intelligent conversation and ideas to keep the intellectual crowd thinking, while making it simple enough for simpler movie audiences to understand. The action scenes are all great, with only a few distracting moments. There is a lot of action in this movie, but it all has its place, and it takes breaks at the right moments so that you can calm down and think a little bit.Now as I said there are a LOT of action sequences. While they belong and they don't necessarily feel out of place, they all seem to take away from the screen time of the actors. Every actor is really good and besides Leo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, and Marion Cotillard (in a surprisingly great performance) no one gets much screen time to beg for that Supporting Actor Oscar.But in all reality, this was a great, great, great, movie. It is completely worth seeing, theater or home, so long as you see this movie before the end of the year, it will have been worth it. This is easily the best summer movie so far.I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.",9,2,5,17 July 2010
X-Men: First Class," Not the Dark Knight, but not Wolverine
","As we all know the genre of interest in the past decade has been superhero movies. They're probably the biggest most popular group of action blockbusters and if recent trends are any example we're about to get more of them than ever. So kick up your britches because if my personal expectations are accurate X-Men: First Class might be the last good superhero movie we get, before producers with money in their eyes take over everything.X-Men: First Class (as if you need me to tell you) is about Professor Xavier and Magneto and how they united as the X-Men for the first time before the stories in the previous trilogy took place. Mystique is the only other X-Men that really gets a developed back story, and the others in the mutant cast are there almost as replacement for the more popular mainstream teams from the trilogy. It all takes place amid the mounting frustrations between the U.S. and Russia (because Watchmen proved that's the best sort of place for a superhero movie to take place, too bad the developers of this movie didn't quite understand why that was such a great setting) during and up to the Cuban Missile Crisis where the film takes its climax.Let's cut to the chase, X-Men is good because it offers great action lets perhaps the most interesting X-Men in the original movies (come on who cares about Wolverine, am I right??) Professor Xavier and Magneto take the spotlight. Powers are shown off in nice cool ways, and they even had another bad guy step in to take Magneto's place, a role in which Kevin Bacon does very well. All the actors did great with their roles, especially the two main characters. If you liked the X-Men trilogy (or at least the first two) then you'll find more to love with this movie.But this is by no means the next Dark Knight (as I've heard multiple people saying now) this movie is not an origin story, this movie is a prequel, and it quite visibly suffers from things that all prequels suffered from. First off, why does X-Men need a prequel? Because the third movie offered a crappy end to the first two movies? In a world where Spider-Man and Batman are already getting reboots to their story lines, why can't we just remake the third X-Men movie and actually make it good? Enough gripe about that though, this movie suffers from Prequel syndrome. While the story is centered around Charles Xavier and Magneto it doesn't do anything that's unexpected with the characters. Mystique even gets her storyline rehashed and set at an earlier date with little to no explanation of a background or anything. Its simply a movie about characters that already have detailed and finished story lines and this movie by no means attempts to mess up that cycle. This movie delivers all the character to the points they start at by the time the first X-Men movie roles around, and that, frankly, is incredibly disappointing.I'd like to say that the character in the movie are so extravagant and well played that that doesn't matter, but for a two hour long movie almost none of the characters get as much development as they deserve, they're like the little electronic cars that some of us to play with as kids, they're predestined to circle around the track right to where we expected them to be. This isn't like the Dark Knight this is like someone made a prequel to the Batman Begins explaining exactly how Bruce's parents made him and why they were destined to got shot in that alleyway. There's almost nothing there to tell that hasn't already been said, and everything else they try to do with them are just curves in the track making sure the warm-up is all said and done before the actual plot begins with the first movie made way back when.Look, as much as I want to like this movie, its simply just another X-Men movie. If you are fine with that than so be it, but don't fall into the trap that so many people are. Just because they made two bad movies before this one doesn't mean that this mediocre rehash is the next gold bar on the pile.I give it 7.5/10",7,1,5,4 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Not the greatest, but still worth it.
","Quick Review – 8/10The Dark Knight Rises is not The Dark Knight 2, its much closer to Batman Begins 2. While all the actors are just as solid as they've ever been, the series newcomer Anne Hathaway steals the show as the strongest actor featured the longest. What things I can take away from the film (pacing, character strength) are balanced by the things I can give the film (quality and quantity of content, actor strength). As such, this movie is more or less perfectly balanced, far more akin to the recent Avengers film than the Dark Knight.It isn't one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.Full Review – 8/10The Dark Knight Rises is the last chapter in Christopher Nolan's now legendary Batman reboot, a Batman series to define Batman series, which has always been a case for Batman. Nolan has taken the series in a dark, real direction, that has never sacrificed intellectual story line development for the sake of a metaphor. It's Gotham has served better as a Proxy Real World than any other fictional setting in history. It has dealt more closely with politics and people than perhaps even a strictly political movie like The Ides of March.That's no different in this movie. Bruce Wayne has been retired for eight years whenever a professional thief (Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle) steals his mother's precious pearls. In chasing after Selina, Bruce finds himself discovering a plan that is going to call Gotham down to its base level, a full scale revolution that is designated to be for the people and by the people (doesn't sound like any 99 percenters at all) to shake Gotham's privileged class down to their true nature.The movie shows Bruce's journey all the way down and all the way back up, from his very lowest point to his very highest.And yet despite a strong plot that carries things forward it sure does trip itself up a few times. The series is well known for an almost overwhelming amount of star power. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Mr. Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon have carried the series with the power of their acting, but this movie really negates them in favor of its new characters, Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as the never-called-as-much Cat Woman, and also Joseph-Gordon Levitt's young police officer Blake. All these actors are strong, Anne Hathaway may have the best role in this movie, and she has considerable acting talents.However, all of this underscores the fact that series doesn't seem like it knows what it wants for its other characters. The focus on Batman has proved as memorable as always which is to say it isn't. There are many points in this movie where it references the other Batman focused movie, Batman Begins, and despite seeing it twice (and paying attention twice) I cannot honestly say that I recall any of the information it wants me to remember. Batman just isn't a strong character, no matter how much the series is trying to force him to be. Dark Knight was good because it had a crazy strong antagonist in the Joker. There was also Harvey Dent who was a strong character. There was always Rachael as well who was able to balance Batman's sad face act no matter which actress was playing her.In the first movie Alfred, Mr. Fox, and Commissioner Gordon filled in the gaps. But with the exception of Gordon, the others are all snubbed for the new characters or for Batman himself, and Gordon spends most of his time in a hospital bed and getting mostly fan-service moments which don't speak for a whole lot of writer effort to give him something to do. Alfred has a moment and then disappears from the movie almost completely. Mr. Fox is there, but also doesn't get to do anything. These previously strong and welcome characters have devolved to things that are taken for granted, and their noticeable absence hurts the movie.But that being said, this series is about Batman, and comparisons to the Dark Knight cannot be considered in true critical evaluation of a film. A film exists separate from its series, and Dark Knight proves that by itself.Another issue in this movie is its pacing, however, I must say that this is far less noticeable. It occurs in moments where the intense issues are avoided, transitional scenes, or scenes that establish real character purposes seem to be missing or fall out of line, which I'll admit takes an eye or a wandering mind for that sort of thing. It feels like if the movie had focused a little less on establishing certain aspects, it could improve character quality without sacrificing any plot detail.It feels like the film makers we're working in constraint of an ending. Its obvious that this wasn't the planned ending for the series, but its surprising that this is how things should end. They have plenty of fan service moments at the end, and at least one surprise twist within the plot network (although if you are observant you'll sense it coming).Overall, I did enjoy the movie. I want to remind people that its a well deserved 8. I have complaints, but this movie did still manage to squeeze a ton of content into a two hour and forty-five minute running time. Its by no means an empty movie, you are never given much time to think about what's going to happen next, which works for the movie and against it as well. But in this case, Nolan is a competent film maker and he's made just that, a competent movie. It's good enough to get the B, but it isn't really striving for an A either.",8,1,3,21 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter is Harry Potter
","Review Score 8.5/10 – You've seen it, you love it, you won't stop now. Lacks some of the magic of previous films, but it's the conclusion so go see it.HPDHP2 (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2) is well you know, it's the final Harry Potter film. It picks up where the last one left off, Voldemort has three horcruxes left and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out to destroy them. The film wastes no time recouping anything except the fact that Voldemort just retrieved the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's Grave. The film largely rests on the final act of the Deathly Hallows, namely the Battle of Hogwarts.The film has probably the most pure action sequences in these films since ever. If the group isn't fighting or fleeing they're probably just licking their wounds for the next scene. Dialogue is sparse, and explanations are momentary distractions from all the different colored lights running around. And the action is great, its some of the best in any action film, but then again that's what action films are supposed to be about.But this film has perhaps more negative things that can be said than previous Harry Potter films. All the gooey stuff is over, all the characters have been set on their paths and the film isn't about to remind you what path they've chosen. There is no struggle within the group of friends, how to destroy horcruxes is known, what the deathly hallows are is known, and above all, what's going to happen is known. The film does not spend even one full scene talking about what its doing or where its going, there's action to be filmed.This is particularly disappointing, because I felt that HPDHP1 was one of the greatest Harry Potter films, but that film remembered one thing that HPDHP2 doesn't remember and that's that among its frenzied and confused action it knew how to slow down and allow for character to bleed out. In this movie Hermione and Ron get hardly any lines. Story is completely side-boarded except for the most climactic part of the film, which is about half an hour before the end of the story. Explanation is so sparse, that unless one were to read the books they'd not know why particular actions were taken and this can mostly be blamed on the fact that someone decided to cut down on the sentimentality and explanation.BUT I save my rant for more personal moments because despite a few issues that dig at me, HPDHP2 is one of the best action films I've seen recently, and it's the end of a series that everyone has loved, either as books, as films, or as both, and whether or not this is a success should not be measured based one less that shiny part. Therefore I say this movie has something for everyone to love, but it is a movie, and its never felt more like a movie than this one and that is a negative thing.",7,0,1,15 July 2011
The Truman Show," Great Story, Great Acting, and Great Movie!
","If I were to sum up The Truman Show with one word, it would be brilliant. The Truman Show is a film on the level of grand classics, a frenzy of Bizarro Humor and life time morals. The movie manages to touch on themes of Life, Faith, and all while being a satire of Reality TV.Now I'm about twelve years late to the party, but even in the new decade Reality TV takes over the airwaves like no ones business. The Truman Show is still culturally relevant if not more so nowadays than when it was released. Seriously, the movie came out in an era where Flavor of Love hadn't existed yet.The story of The Truman Show is easy enough to say. Truman (Carrey) is the center of a reality TV show, and has been since his birth. The story begins to unfold as he begins to discover this fact. And if I said anything more I'd spoil the movie. Needless to say, the plot weaves through the key themes I mentioned before.There is no reason to not see this movie. It's a classic, an instant love. Its easy on the real melodrama, and if you were going to poke holes in it you'd have to work hard to find one that mattered very much. Overall, this movie leaves a message that is resounding.One of the best films to be released last decade, one of the best films ever made.",10,0,1,24 July 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," A review well thought out in the beginning but failing near the end
","When I was going in to this movie I was thinking that 'this movie is going to make me think,' and lo and behold that's about the only thing I was able to think throughout the whole movie.In all honesty though, Law Abiding Citizen is a movie that in trailers presented itself very well, but ends the movie by jabbing a pencil into its open eye socket. We open with a scene that depicts the brutal crime against Clyde (Gerard Butler) and his family before jumping to the trial. Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) cuts a deal with one of the offenders against Clyde that lets him off the hook. Jump years into the future and Clyde has turned full circle and decides to take a full out revenge against the killers and the justice system.I'm sure most people are thinking, 'well bonkers (yes bonkers, I said it) this sounds like a culturally significant movie that challenges the morals of today's justice system with such a plot line as that,' and that is precisely what the movie trailers wanted you to think. Law Abiding Citizen is one of those movies that has a first act interesting (and by interesting I mean intelligent) enough and raw enough to make you lean forward in your seat close enough so they can smack all the intelligence out of your brain with the rest of the movie. In short, Law Abiding Citizen is misleading, and at the very best, killed by limitations.The main reason for this is because it spends the first part of the movie making you feel sorry for Clyde. Its something we've seen happen before. It is the story of the man whose daughter gets raped (in this situation family killed) and he sees the rapists go free. He then jumps into action by doing what the law couldn't do, and that is serve justice on their asses. This movie takes it a step further, reminiscent of Death Note (simply in the taking the bad guy and making him easy to identify with at first before making him absolutely bat **** insane). It then proceeds to realize that it might be getting a little too intellectual for the normal blockbuster crowd and proceeds to add explosions and to completely drop all the points it was trying to make but inserting the picture of the story writers genitalia in your face.No, in all reality, what Law Abiding Citizen feels like to me is a movie that got cut short, either in money, time, or manpower. It feels like the writer got choke chained by the producers and didn't have the time to write the challenging cultural piece he was going for. Either that or someone told him Gerard Butler was going to be in it, and somewhere a black guy was falling down an oddly placed hole.While I can't say this movie is lacking at all in the acting department, I can't stress enough how misguided the previews and indeed the movie itself are. Bottom line, you aren't getting a well thought out movie here. I would honestly like to say don't waste your time, but like a few recent Dean Koontz books, there are just a couple parts of this movie that everyone could see. What is lucky about this movie is that it isn't the only challenging moral movie ever made. If you feel this movie is lacking just give it another five or ten years and someone may come along with a good enough schedule or budget or idea to actually get the point that got lost in the explosions in Law Abiding Citizen in some other high brow titled movie.Final Rating 7/10.",7,3,5,28 August 2010
