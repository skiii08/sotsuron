The Rock," ...fast paced...awesome...enjoyable...
","This movie rocked the house. Fast paced action scenes kept you on the edge of your seat or leaning back to try and take it all in. Everything from the plotline to the character choices were awesome, as the script makes this event almost believable - something rarely obtained in action movies. The cinematography performed by Mike Bay is outstanding, and some of the shots leave you saying 'that was cool.' Hanz Zimmer and his crew provide much of the heart thumping music, which is in itself a feat. all in all, this movie was incredibly enjoyable, and mixed together the right amount of action, seriousness, comedy, and even a little romance...******* out of ***** stars - not too shabby!",10,1,1,13 December 1998
The Matrix," ...well...
","Immediately upon seeing the first trailer for the movie, I thought that they were showing us all of the cool parts, and that the 'No one can be told what the Matrix is, They must see it for themselves' line was just another ploy to get you into the theatres.I never would have thought how right I was.While the movie was ambitious, truly, truly ambitious in what it wanted to say, and with what it attempted in scope in action and plot. Ultimately it fell flat. The action scenes were played out (can you say Jackie Chan?), the SFX are tired and old (c'mon now, if GAP is doing something, it is apparently a fad and no good), the plot was tired after Dark City, and the acting was truly terrible. The only one to pull off a decent job was -gasp- Keanu Reeves.And this isn't going to be a popular opinion. I was in the theatre and in the car with my buddies after the movie. The audience ate this movie up...I just can't figure out why...",7,0,0,10 April 1999
