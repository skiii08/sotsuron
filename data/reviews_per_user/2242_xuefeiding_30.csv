The King's Speech," The king also needs to grow up like ordinary people
","No matter in life or on stage, stutterers often appear in the image of public jokes. People often make fun of their language barriers, or even ridicule them. No one can understand the sufferings of stutterers, but they often get ridicule when they have the potential to express. Their sufferings are only understood by nature. The king's speech begins with Colin. Fissner's trembling lips and tense facial muscles vividly expressed the pain that he could not express when he wanted to express his feelings. Maybe it was not only the pain, but also the anger, which originated from the hatred and helplessness of his own defects. This kind of emotional performance touched me instantly, and the balance of emotion immediately fell to this plain and vivid biography film.",8,0,0,24 March 2020
