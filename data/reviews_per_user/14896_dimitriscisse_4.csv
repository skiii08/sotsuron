Black Swan," Before you see this movie:
","Black swan for me was an outstanding film. It was about a young ballet dancer who takes the leading role of black and white swan. Only that what happens in the scenery seemed to become true affecting Bella's life.So the title says before you see this movie I recommend you to be alone ( without your parents I mean ) because some scenes are very weird and might thrill you. Also you must attend this movie not for the artistic side of ballet because you might get bored but from the social angle. This movie shows the reactions of people when they get a leading role and how anxious they are because they fear the replacement. Nina feels like that , she is very introvert and she creates with her mind situations that herself would like to be just like the love scene with her friend which Bella thinks that she tries to take the leading role of black swan using unfairly means.Nina is feeling all this pressure from her mother and her teacher. I believe that her mother is envying her when she takes the leading role. On the other hand when Nina had taken all the previous supportive roles she stands up her. So I conclude that her mother is an hypocrite ,arrogant person who in the whole movie pretends an old star of ballet when at the same time she had never taken a leading role instead of her daughter.For the end I just want to say that Nina hasn't conscious of her actions. '' She felt it and it was perfect''. The combination of applauding and these words it was a really success just like the general sense that black swan creates you.",8,0,2,25 March 2016
American Psycho," Crazy Or Not? You Decide
","American psycho: what a well-aimed title for film! This film does not concern at all the history of PatrickBaitman, a perverted person at most of you. Patrick is narcissists and is becoming o a symbol of all humans. Really , how many from you have not thought the same for their competitors. Simply into this point enters the mental factor that appears in the film in order not to misunderstand the director. Patrick stops acting like a person but behaves as an animal, he tries to exterminates his enemies and he dominates. Patrick is above everyone. Money determines the relations of persons in this film. The Film moves between fantastic and real.The director excellently has attributed fiction verisimilitudewhile we are watching the conflicts that happen in our hero: leave his instincts to guide him or to rein? The more times first predominates but with Liz didn't kill her . Sadistis and schizophrenic is Patrick no because ''kills'' in his manner women but because he imagines that really kill them. The film remained in the middle because the thoughts will not be late becomes action! However Patrick isn't like the other murderers who have sense what they do. Tragic is that he does not have sense of his actions. he imagines what would want him shelf to become but alas social reality bounds him, he feels oppressed and the imagination is the best medicine in these circumstances, however his imagination is sick or no? Maybe he is afraid to know the true love and resorts to the market love? Or he just abominated his girl because she blatantly showed that she had relation with other man and in consequence he adopts such a behavior of the women? It is a film very searched, See it!",7,1,2,3 September 2015
The White Ribbon," Great imagination Hanecke
","So, starting my word with , I want to say that ''white ribbon'' is a movie about a small town of decade 1910 . Director wants to show how the relations of people formed by the happenings of strange facts. Michael Hanecke indicates who's responsible for them : the children of the town or the doctor with the midwife? I will explain to you why I believe that both are. The children live in a strict disciplined, religious, society . They seem to manage to get over with it but the conservatism of their parents sample their patience . So when they are starting to feel isolated they react with different ways. Clara cut the neck of the bird , they drop baron's son in the river and someone bites his hand. I must say that the kid's of poor locals farmers react to the rich and comfortable Sigi because they feel that they are inferior of him. The question which creating is can the children do things like these happened in the small village of our story? Hanecke shows the indignation of children but he indicates what children can do ( for example when Clara cut the neck of the bird). The other suspects are doctor and midwife. The school teacher who is the narrator of our story indicates that these two might have a connection with the death 's wife of doctor. Doctor has sexual behavior with her daughter . The teacher said that Clari's eyes have been wounded them by the doctor and the midwife. The question is who put the wire on the doctor's house and he fell from his horse? Was it midwife or the children? Generally this movie like Hanecke's movies doesn't give you free and easy answers but he wants to make you think, to make you imagine things just like the end which is an open end .Clearly answers are not given and I like these kind of movies because they make you search for the answers and think how your life would be in 1914 . Would you have been able to live in an environment like that ? For Baron's wife, I don't think so and I believe that Hanecke gave so much freedom of her . Don't be free thinker Hanecke ,women didn't act like that especially the wives of rich people. The shot in black and white is very good idea because Michael wants to transport you in a cruel society of 1914.Anyway very good movie",7,0,2,29 February 2016
It Follows," Is this a good movie or a bad?Lets see it
","Initially the film has a lot of voids in the affair. Does the entity walk but can't run? The all work has been structured round erotic andventures by young persons (subject topical after all are moved round them) and presents an alternative version of the dreams of director. Also the film leaves you with inquisitively for what it will become in the end, they will survive or no and finally who the entity hunts Paul or Jay? The film is scary no because of the abrupt scenes that the most wait to see in a film of terror(there is no scary scene) but the movie is scary because of the all idea that has been structured: imagine somebody who follows you but he does not run in order to catch you at the duration of the day. This is scary!! It would be scarier if there have been strongs interpretations.",4,5,30,28 June 2015
