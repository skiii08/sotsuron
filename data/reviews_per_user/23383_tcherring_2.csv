Casablanca," This is my all-time Number One Favorite Movie -- Period.
","Superbly constructed and presented, this movie stands as the standard by which all other movies must be judged.  The leading actors -- Bogie, Paul Henried and Ingrid Bergman, superbly supported by Claude Rains make the movie.  That they were not the first choice for their respective roles (Ronald Reagan, Dennis Morgan and Ann Sheridan were the first choices) challenges all understanding.  That Bogie and Raines didn't win oscars is beyond belief!  By the way Casablana was made before I was born.",10,1,1,22 January 2002
Cinderella Man," While boxing is the vehicle for the story , the heart of the story is character.
","Once again, Ron Howard directs a gem of a movie!. And once again, Russell Crowe demonstrates that he is at the top of movie actors today. Renee Zellweger complements Crowe's performance beautifully.This movie would make an excellent learning tool for today's young people, since it clearly shows true love and devotion -- not cosmetic lust. It demonstrates, superbly, that the essence of a person is the quality of character within. When Jim Braddock pays back, in full, the welfare money he was given, it stands as one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Here is a real man!!Can't say enough good about this movie, other than to say, it is a treasured addition to my movie library.If you haven't seen it yet -- SEE IT!!!",10,1,2,21 January 2006
