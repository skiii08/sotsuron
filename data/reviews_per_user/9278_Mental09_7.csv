The Blair Witch Project," Scary, original, well made and scary (did I mention scary?)
","This movie was something else. I saw it thinking: Oh, yet another box office scare smash hit. Just another 'Scream'-type movie. All hype and no chills.Boy was I wrong! This movie has it all. It would make Hitchcock proud, and I hope it makes Wes Craven really ashamed!!! Cause while Mr. Craven has spent his entire life on making the chills with SFX, he's forgotten the rule that nothing is scarier than what you cannot see, what's all inside your head, sounds coming from everywhere and nowhere, and the stories that scared the wits out of you when you were a child. This is what The Blair Witch Project is all about. And it's a bloody good movie(Don't take any offense in the language) Just watch it, and you'll know what I'm talking about!",9,0,1,18 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Hesitation and fear went bye bye
","I feared the day I'd go to see this movie. I'd heard all the talk about the romantic chapter in the Star Wars-saga, and I remembered with horror the disappointment I felt after seeing the previous installment (Phantom Menace).Attack of the Clones is perhaps the best movie in the saga so far. Only rivaled by Empire Strikes Back. Sure, the dialogue is at times cheesy at best, and the acting is not winning any of the actors an Oscar. But then again, this isn't Rain Man. It isn't Forrest Gump, and it isn't Titanic. It's Star Wars. Finally! After 19 years of waiting, a new Star Wars-movie has arrived! You have to watch this movie as one in a six part story. You have to watch it knowing a little about the saga. And you have to remember the tone of episodes 4-6 to even have the slightest chance of understanding it, even though it isn't all that complicated. Let me sum it up for you: Good versus evil, with all that that implies, sprinkled with the possibility that good can turn into evil, and that evil is stronger than good. There you have it. You are ready for Star Wars. About the movie: The effects are spectacular. You have to be REALLY grumpy not to agree. I saw it on a 100% digital screening first, and then I saw it at a regular movie theater the next day. If you can; choose the digital version. It's so colorful, all other movies look like black and white in comparison.The actors are great. Forget what everybody else has said: Star Wars has never had a finer cast. What people seem to ignore, or forget, is that even though the dialog is not exactly Tarantino or Shakespear, it serves its purpose: It tells the story. Plain and simple. If George Lucas wants to show you that a character is feeling vulnerable, he writes `I'm feeling vulnerable' and hands it to the actor. Top notch performances all over, but this really isn't about the words the characters say, it's about the story they tell. The action is as close to perfection as you can come. It keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout, and you cannot possibly ask for more.But let's focus on what turns this movie into a masterpiece: the details. The Star Wars-universe has found a new dimension. It seems almost every single shot has been put into the movie for a reason, every single shot tells a little piece of the story. There are some incredible creatures in this one, as there has been in every single installment before. And there are some amazing new vehicles. You have your spaceships. Possible hundreds of them, all sprouting a piece of genius. You have the landscapes; the huge numbingly beautiful landscapes. You have Dozens of Jedis, and you have hundreds of droids, clones and whatever your heart could desire. More than any other movie in this saga, Attack of the Clones delivers on every single piece of the puzzle. Tying up loose ends, filling in the blanks. I have said some bad things about George Lucas in the past, and I take most of them back. Attack of the Clones is a great movie. It's a piece of art, and it's the most fun I've had at the movies in a loooong time.
Thank you, George Lucas, for making this movie. Thank you for correcting everything you did wrong in the previous one. And thank you for bringing Star Wars back to life again. I can't wait to see the next one, even though I know I have to. I've seen it twice in two days, and I'm seeing it again in a day or two. You should too.",8,0,0,24 May 2002
Forrest Gump," Highly overrated movie about a geeky american hero
","Whilst this movie tries to be a serious piece of 'art', all it ever achieves is an incredible 'we-love-America-cause-everyone-can-be-someone-here'Tom Hanks gained lot of credit for playing Forrest Gump so brilliantly, but I can't really say I was impressed. All he did was behave more stupid than usually. Anyone could do that, as far as I'm concerned. But I have to give it some credit for all the good 'Gump-liners' like 'stupid is as stupid does'. Want to see a good American movie? Watch ID4 or As good as it gets. Don't watch this one.",Null,2,5,8 August 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Firing up your imagination
","Fellowship of the ring is the first out of three movies telling JRR Tolkiens incredible story The Lord Of The Rings, continuing where The Hobbit left off. This is a fact, and you should know it before you enter the theater. If you have problems relating to fantasy, this film is NOT for you, if you don't like elves, orcs and dwarfs, this film is NOT for you, and if you have problems following a long intricate storyline, with a lot of characters, this film is NOT for you. And it lasts for three full hours. All that aside, this is, without a doubt, the greatest film I have ever seen. The hype was big, the movie is even bigger. Spectacular scenery, great and believable acting, filming better than in any other movie, and the greatest story ever told. Could you wish for more? Well, more is on the way.There are no high-speed car-chases here, there is no Tom Bombadil, no naked women, the songs from the book have been left out almost entirely, and the main character is a ring. A lot of things to p*** off almost everyone who are either fans of Tolkien or fans of Hollywood-blockbusters. I am both, and I'm still immensely pleased. I have read the books by Tolkien, and I have seen most of Peter Jacksons movies. Some say it can't compete with Star Wars... Of course it can't compete. Can the Godfather compete with Police Academy? Can Indiana Jones compete with the Shawshank Redemption? We're talking different genres, different universes. The Fellowship of The Ring is a huge, epic movie, almost flawlessly done, depicting the evil and horror that could lead Middle-Earth to its destruction. But the most important thing this movie shows us, is that it's really all about hope. If hope is lost, ALL is lost. You can see this movie as a political statement, but please don't. It's a fairytale. It's the greatest of all fairytales, and you're never too old to enjoy it. You may be too young, however, or you may be too set in your ways and expectations to enjoy it. Forget all other movies, this one is beyond comparison. Forget the regular 90 minute timeframe, forget the stereotypes, you have to dig a little deeper. What will you find? Solid gold. Pure and simple. And when all three movies are out, I hope they give us moviegoers an opportunity to see them all in a row, as they were meant to be. It's a ten out of ten, expect nothing else.",10,0,0,6 January 2002
Independence Day," The best sci-fi thrill-ride ever?
","OK, it may not have the greatest story, or even the greatest actors, but as entertainment goes, you are not likely to find any better movie. It has all the fun, all the SFX, all the beautiful women, all the aliens, all the 'terminal threats' you'll ever need. It's one of the greatest. OK. You might say that the original Star Wars movie kicks it, but I'd say you're wrong. I love Star Wars, but this is a totally different category. This movie is about the laughs, about the thrills, about the 'wow''s and about that all-American-feel. And I loved it! They actually made all that crap from Forrest Gump work. It's all about how mighty, how powerful the US of A actually is. I give it a ten. Don't even hesitate to see this. Goldblum and Smith are incredible; this is the mother of all one-liners!And in case you wondered... I'm not even American. I still loved it. I watched it 5 times in the movie theater, and probably 10 times on the VCR. And I'm still not done with it. Go see it if you're after the fun. If you want an art movie, watch Pi. Other than that... enjoy!",8,0,0,14 May 1999
The Iron Giant," The most loveable movie in years!
","This is probably the best animated feature since The Lion King. And it's certainly a lot more! The story is wonderful, the animation very good (not Disney, but not everything has to be), and the voicing is perfect! On top of that you have the fantasies of a kid, only in this movie they are real.
The Iron Giant is a movie for the whole family. It's filled with laughs, sadness, a great moral and characters that you immediately fall in love with. I cannot recommend it highly enough. This is a ten, and you'll want to see it over and over again!",9,0,0,24 November 1999
Rock Star," It won't change the world, but it's good entertainment
","So, you wanna be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or you're REALLY into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good, and believable, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer. So you know what you're going to get. A movie about dreams coming true, being stepped on, and finally figuring out what life is really about. It's a good solid seven out of ten, no more, no less.",7,2,4,19 March 2002
