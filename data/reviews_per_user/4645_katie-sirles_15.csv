The King's Speech," The King's Speech: Sublime, indeed.
","This is the story of King George VI and the speech impediment that very nearly got the best of him. Seeking elocution lessons that will remedy his stutter, the Duke of York is faced with hopelessness. Nothing appears to be helping. His adoring wife, Elizabeth, is by his side through lesson after lesson. A lesson in which he is told to fill his mouth with marbles and read from a book ends in frustration as he is losing patience and his proverbially marbles.Elizabeth gets wind of someone she thinks might be able to help her downtrodden husband. The two meet with Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and the first session is not exactly a promising one. The Duke of York — Bertie, as he is known to his family — is manifestly troubled by this, but goes back to meet with Lionel anyhow. The connection between Lionel and Bertie is instant. One would imagine them to be the best of friends.The sessions go on and we are treated to a brilliant training montage in which the audience gets to see gentle improvements and a friendship, too. The good doctor knows all kinds of tricks to cure the stammer. One of my favorites is the singing. When you sing, you don't stall.With his father, King George V (Michael Gambon) ailing and likely to pass sooner rather than later, Bertie and his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) brace themselves for the loss and for new rule of the United Kingdom. Edward takes the throne to become King Edward VIII. Shortly thereafter, King Edward VIII abdicates the throne leading to the sudden and reluctant ascension of King George VI.Facing the dawn of World War II, it is now of paramount importance that Bertie overcome his troublesome stutter and take his place as King by warning his country that they are at war with Germany.I have to say that of all of the times we see Lionel and Bertie working together, the parade of profanities is one of the most entertaining. There are many times where the audience gets to see the more human, less regal side of Bertie. Take note of the story that he tells to his daughters, the relationship he shares with Elizabeth, and the darling friendship he builds with Lionel. At one point, Lionel tells Bertie that he was sublime after a lesson. I'd say they are both sublime.Director Tom Hooper has a real gem on his hands here. With immaculate A-plus performances from Colin Firth as Bertie, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel, and Helena Bonham Carter as the exquisite Queen Elizabeth, Hooper was set up for success and ran with it.Full of classic architecture, great halls, and marvelous costumes, The King's Speech radiates excellence and has Oscar written all over it.(www . mssilverscreen . com)",10,1,3,19 January 2011
Black Swan," Black Swan indeed
","I saw Black Swan on the opening night of the limited release. I luckily bought tickets in advance because even though I arrived forty-five minutes before the previews rolled, there was a line that wrapped around the lobby of the theater and the shows were all sold out.The film opens with Nina Sayers (Portman) inviting us into her world of dance. Vying for the role of Swan Queen in Swan Lake, she has worked day and night to impress Thomas Leroy (Cassel), the instructor at her New York City dance company. Erica Sayers (Hershey) is a retired ballerina who has an almost uncomfortably close relationship with daughter Nina. The privacy level between the two is non-existent and Nina continues to pull away from her over-bearing mother.Just when Nina begins to feel as though she has a leg up on her competition -- a slew of well-trained Swan Queen wannabes with immaculate bodies -- Lily (Kunis) shows up. The film leaves you guessing whether or not Lily is trying to destroy Nina or befriend her. Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre makes a chilling cameo as the long-time Swan Queen being forced to step down.Darren Aronofsky does an excellent job of keeping viewers in the dark -- sometimes literally -- as we try to figure out how much of what's going on is actually happening, and how much is all in Nina's head as she is consumed by the desire to become Swan Queen.As far as the most talked about scene of the movie, the sex scene between Nina and Lily, I found this to be more frightening than sensual.With the Academy Awards just around the corner, this thriller that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat is a shoo-in for a few Oscar nods.My personal reaction as I walked out of the theater: I found myself deep in thought as I left the theater. As I stepped outside into the falling snow, my eyes welled up with tears. This was puzzling as I did feel like crying when the movie ended. Upon deeper inspection I realized that I was crying because... are you ready? I didn't get it.After several days of mulling it over, I've decided that I will more than likely see this one again, but I also feel as though I understand more of just exactly what happened.I will leave you with that and say that this film is absolutely one that you should check out.(See more of my reviews and other odds and ends at www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)",10,5,11,26 December 2010
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes: dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle
","I've never read the books and I only just saw the first Sherlock Holmes movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law about a week ago. Guess what you don't have to be a total nerd to like this movie! I'm not saying that I'm not a total nerd. I know like three words in Elvish and I enjoy reading books about sharks, but when it comes to knowing everything about Sherlock Holmes, it's not at all necessary for enjoying this Guy Ritchie joint. Not everyone who watches this movie has read all of the books six times each and knows all of the other movies and so on and so forth. Some of us just have giant, raging crushes on Robert Downey Jr... I mean cinema.Robert Downey Jr. is really a perfect gent for a role like this one. He's funny, charming, and quit-witted to boot. He also has the right amount of crazy to pull off Sherlock Holmes. Because one would have to be at least a little crazy to do the things that Sherlock does.Here's a synopsis for you: Sherlock intercepts his love Irene (Rachel McAdams) when he finds that she is being followed, only she isn't being followed. She is doing a job for Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris – the only man alive who is directly related to frogs). When she screws it up he releases her from his services. How unfortunate for her. Holmes gets Watson wasted the night before his wedding. That night he meets Sim (Noomi Rapace) the gypsy fortune-teller. Gypsy fortune-teller has something to do with the unfortunate misfortune of Irene. His observation skills do not fail him and he is on yet another mission. After a meeting with Moriarty, Holmes learns of his beloved's fate and finds that tomfoolery is afoot. Instead of letting Watson enjoy his new bride, he must protect Mr. & Mrs. Watson from Moriarty's cronies. This includes throwing Mrs. Watson from the train. Dressed to the nines in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick, Holmes thwarts Moriarty's plan.The rest of the movie is much of the same. A back and forth between two masterminds and their attempts to stop each other. But the real glory of this movie is the hilarity. Knowing when to be funny and when to get down to business is a vital skill in making a movie like this one. Word to the wise: get all of your bathroom/food/drink needs out of the way before the movie and don't get up. You won't want to miss a minute of this movie. I – like a fool – got up to fetch a refill for a thirsty pest with whom I saw the movie. I came back and boy was I ever sorry that I left at all.I suppose the bottom line is that RDJ is a phenomenal actor, Guy Ritchie has a winning style of making movies, and Jude Law is the perfect match for Holmes's crazy antics. Without ruining anything for you, be prepared for a shocker in the last five minutes. I was the idiot in the audience who gasped loudly in an otherwise silent theater. I'm a sucker. All I'm saying is that when I grow up I want to be like Sherlock Holmes.",10,1,2,30 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","Based on the novel by Stieg Larsson, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO follows Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, a co-owner and writer at Millennium Magazine. Mikael seeks to escape the public eye for a while after a blunder of epic proportions. Lucky for him, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) is looking for someone to write his memoirs. Oh, and to uncover the mysterious death of his great-niece Harriet Vanger. How does Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) tie into all of this? Well, if you're like me and you never read books that movies are based on you might not know. Lisbeth is enlisted to do a background check on Mikael before Henrik will take him on. Blomkvist is involved with his married colleague at the magazine, Erika Berger (Robin Wright – who, by the way, looks like an old catcher's mitt these days) and with a world of trouble on his shoulders, he ventures out to the island. When he realizes that he is getting in over his head, he insists that he be given a research assistant. He gets the brilliant mind of Lisbeth to assist in all of his research needs.Now that we're all on the same page, let's talk about how excited I was for the last month and a half. My suspicions were that because David Fincher (The Social Network) was behind this film with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the turntables, this movie was going to — for lack of a better term — blow my mind. The story is an excellent one. Intriguing, smart, well done. However, I was not as impressed as I was with, say, THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Now, this is apples and oranges, really, because the two movies are entirely different in nature. So why was I checking my phone in the theater? Why did I leave to go to the bathroom when I didn't even have to go that bad? Perhaps it was the extra 45 minutes of unnecessary movie in there that turned me off. It is always a bad sign when an avid moviegoer like me takes a cellphone out or leaves the theater for any reason during the film. I have risked my ability to bear children more than once because a movie was so compelling that I couldn't tear myself away for as long as it took to use the facilities. I did both of those things last night.The movie starts off strong. It is ominous and leaves the audience wondering. Always wondering. What is the story here? Who killed Harriet? Why do rich families always have these deep, dark secrets? I'm just saying, if I had my own island and a beautiful mansion to live in on that island, I would be too busy dancing the dance of joy to even think about sinister plots and things of the like. But then my life wouldn't make for good movie material.When the film is introducing the two main characters to us, some light is shed on the troubling life of Lisbeth Salander. After her legal guardian suffers a stroke, Lisbeth is appointed a lawyer by the state. Nils Bjurman takes over Lisbeth's finances and does things to her that even my desensitized mind was bothered by. Forced fellatio and sodomy (the WORST kind) top the list. He's just a creeper in every way. Putting Lisbeth on an allowance system and then forcing himself on her when she needs money for a new laptop, making fun of her eyebrow piercing. Don't worry, though. He gets his comeuppance in a big way.The movie is fine. It really is. It's just that extra time they didn't need to have in there. Even the sad kids with the skinny jeans and the wacky hair-dos next to me in the theater agreed that it was too long. I don't think it is hard to over do it in a picture like this one. There is so much story to be told and only so many frames to tell it. David Fincher can make a great movie. I think that with this one it was just a matter of trimming the fat a bit. The acting is superb. Rooney Mara is excellent. Daniel Craig was even good. Christopher Plummer is sublime, but that goes without saying. Next time let's just leave out all of the extra bits, eh?",8,2,6,30 December 2011
Enchanted," Enchanted is enchanting
","Enchanted was by far my favorite film of 2010. This is funny for many reasons, but mostly because Enchanted came out in 2007. Being the Disney movie buff that I am, I can not fathom why I did not see this sooner. I was on my way home one day listening to the Alan Menken station on my internet radio and suddenly I'm practically dancing down the sidewalk. The Enchanted Suite by the brilliant Mr. Alan Menken is bursting into my ears and I can't help but smile.Just days later, Enchanted was sitting in my mailbox in a bright red envelope. I popped it in the old DVD player expecting more of what I love in Disney movies: A beautiful princess faced with a problem and lots and lots of cheese. Musical numbers, lovely dovey stuff the whole nine yards.What I got was so much more. The movie begins in classic Disney style with a voice over and a shot of a castle window. The camera takes us through the window to a giant storybook sitting on a pedestal. The pages magically flip by themselves and we are entertained briefly by a pop-up book illustrating an evil queen who doesn't want her son to marry, because she will lose her crown. We are then introduced to Giselle (Amy Adams). She is pretty and dressed in pink. She is chilling with her forest-dwelling friends and creating the prince that she saw in her dreams. The song 'True Love's Kiss' is fun and sweet and describes Giselle's desire to meet the one and share true love's kiss. It's the most powerful thing in the world. As if it were magic – which is something one might find a lot of in a Disney movie – Mr. Perfect, Prince Edward (James Marsden) happens to be slaying trolls not too far from Giselle's place. He hears her singing and he and his white horse Destiny are off to find this fair maiden. He finds her and they decide to be married in the morning. His mother has other plans.In an act of divine intervention, the evil queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) finds Giselle before she can marry Prince Edward, and sends her far away.In a somewhat rapid turn of events, Giselle finds herself crawling up through a manhole cover onto the streets of New York City. Thrust into a world she does not know, she searches for her perfect prince. Alone in New York City in the rain, she quite literally falls into the arms of the hunky Robert played by Patrick Dempsey. As Giselle spends her days searching for Prince Edward, she manages to initiate a flash dance in Central Park to the song 'That's How You Know', summon the rats, pigeons, and roaches of NYC to dance and hum to a 'Happy Working Song', make three new dresses out of curtains and carpet, max out Robert's credit card, and bond with Robert's daughter played by the adorable Rachel Covey.Amy Adams was a perfect choice in the casting of Giselle. Her whole demeanor just screams real-life Disney princess. James Marsden as the dimwitted but lovable Prince Edward is a stitch. Susan Sarandon is phenomenal, as usual, as Queen Narissa. Also as usual, Patrick Dempsey plays the hunk. Duh.Enchanted tickled my fancy so much because it was original and fun and the original music was done by Alan Menken. He also happened to do the score for the best movie ever according to yours truly, The Little Mermaid. This movie has so many references to The Little Mermaid. For instance, Robert's assistant Sam is played by Jodi Benson. The same Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid.Watch Enchanted and invite your 6-year-old self to come out and play. This movie is sweet and funny. Particularly enjoy Pip, the chipmunk, as he is in New York City. I happily give this movie two thumbs up and five stars.(Please check out this review and other fun stuff in my blog -- www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)",10,1,1,27 December 2010
Drive," Drive - Simply the Best Movie of 2011
","Why was DRIVE my favorite movie of 2011? Was it Ryan Gosling's awesome satiny scorpion jacket that I now have my very own hoodie version of? Was it the totally boss soundtrack? Was it Albert Brooks's complete lack of eyebrows? I would say it was a grand combination of these things and more. Ever since THE NOTEBOOK hit theaters I have always said to myself 'Gee, I'd really love to see Ryan Gosling kick some guy's head in. Just stomp it to pieces.' The story is a simple one that really just brings the awesome. Basically Driver (Ryan Gosling) does stunt driving for the movies. Malcolm in the Middle's dad AKA Breaking Bad AKA Bryan Cranston plays Shannon, Driver's boss at a garage where they work and his pseudo manager for his movie career. Shannon borrows money from Bernie (Albert Brooks) for a race car that Driver is to race. Are you keeping up with me here? Nino (Ron Perlman) is Bernie's business partner and is also a real nasty gangster type.Then there's Irene (Carey Mulligan). She is Driver's neighbor. Driver and Irene totes have crushes on each other and so he helps her out with things and looks after her son. When Irene's husband is released from prison, he comes home and promises to make a better life for his family. Like ten minutes later he blows it and is a bloodied mess in the parking garage. Driver happens by and presses him for information. Anyone with half a brain – which may be more than Driver has – can figure out what is going to happen. Driver has to help Irene's husband get some mob guys off his back so they won't kill him or Irene and the kid. Did I mention that Albert Brooks has NO EYEBROWS? A mob story about a guy who drives for a living and wears a scorpion jacket all the time what's so special about that? Well, if you drink when you go to the movies – like I do – then you know how easy it is to turn to mush at the smallest thing. Whether it's a vacant stare shared by two socially inept people, or a man's face completely lacking any kind of brow over the eyes. Ryan Gosling is perfect in this role. He's calm, cool, and collected at all times. He walks through the streets in a blood-stained jacket and everyone just assumes that he knows what he's doing so there's no need to worry.It's that icy, blank gaze. The movie has plenty of action and a great soundtrack to go along with it. Cliff Martinez had the joyous task of creating a score for a driving movie and did so incredibly well. Every beat fits like a glove. I also tend to enjoy a twisting, turning plot that I can follow while I'm buzzed. I knew what was going on the whole time. Good on you, Hossein Amini, for writing a screenplay all types of audience members could enjoy. Even the ones with a tummy full of rum.Basically, DRIVE tops my list for best movies of the year because it combines all of the elements necessary to create a movie that you'll remember. It stays with you. The story flows well and the movie doesn't drag on for an unnecessary 45 minutes. It jumps straight to the point. Still not convinced? Then you just go straight to hell.I'm kidding. In all seriousness, a great screenplay and performances that are strange but superb have this movie lined up to win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, in my humble opinion. Some award shows just don't know what they're doing. I'm looking at you, Golden Globes.",10,4,9,30 December 2011
The Hurt Locker," For War is a Drug
","'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug' – Chris Hedges Imagine the feeling you get when you are waiting for something to happen. The anticipation building up in the pit of your stomach. Your hands in tight fists showing white knuckles. The Hurt Locker is 131 minutes of that feeling. An intense and real war film that keeps the viewer in a constant state of worry and stress. You might be thinking 'Why would I watch that?' Because it is a profoundly moving film. That's why. This movie is outstanding and the message being conveyed is so clearly communicated. This movie takes a subject that makes people uncomfortable and shoves it in our faces. We are forced to see the ugliness of war. With tremendous performances by all involved, this movie is believable to an unsettling degree. Director Kathryn Bigelow took home the first Oscar for best director ever to be given to a woman in history. This makes perfect sense if you've seen the film, even though it is a shame that she was the first female to win best director when so many other impressive women came before her. But I digressThe Hurt Locker follows the story of an elite Army bomb squad. Sergeant First Class William James (Renner) makes disarming giant bombs look like a day at the park. His confident – sometimes overconfident – personality gets him in trouble one or two times, but he always manages to get the job done.Working with him are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Sanborn and Eldridge question the manner in which James conducts himself. Doing reckless things like removing his headset and bomb suit when disarming a car with a trunk full of bombs. James says 'There's enough bang in there to blow us all to Jesus. If I'm gonna die, I want to die comfortable.' as he's removing his bomb suit. With quips like this one and a few others, there is just enough lighthearted banter to keep the audience themselves from exploding.I really cannot say enough good about this movie. It is gritty and mean and completely disregards the ideological standards that Hollywood typically sets for films of this nature. The editing and cinematography are enough to get me to watch this over and over again. Not mention the explosive – no pun intended – performances from the actors.Though it is a difficult film to watch, The Hurt Locker makes a point and drives it home so well. War is ugly. This movie doesn't paint a pretty picture of the situation and it is clear that Hollywood didn't get its pandering hands all over it. You may want to cover your eyes, but definitely watch The Hurt Locker and try to keep your eyes open as much as possible. You'll be glad you did.<ul><li>Ms. Silver Screen founder of mssilverscreen.com</li></ul>",10,2,6,19 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," The Adjustment Bureau (Pandering Alert)
","Some of us believe that there is a higher power. Not necessarily a religious higher power, but a power that watches over us nonetheless. So what exactly is their job description? What are they supposed to do and see and control? The Adjustment Bureau makes an attempt to leap into the world of the higher power. The world of 'It's out of our control.' So what if you met someone you fell for at first sight? You know when people ask 'Was it love at first sight?' What if it was? And what if you clicked with that person from the moment that you met them and suddenly they were jerked away from you. This higher power, this force, this group of beings that control everyday 'happenings' they take that person away. They tell you that you are not meant to be with that person and they are not meant to be with you.What do you do? Especially if that person is Emily Blunt looking gorgeous Do you cut and run? Or do you stay and do everything in your power to figure out why these 'people' won't let you be with the one that you love and adore? The Adjustment Bureau is a romantic science fiction thriller. A movie that takes a politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), and shows what can happen when even the smallest tidbit gets out about someone running for office, and it shows us his life after a failure. Then he meets the alluring Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt).Blunt is hypnotizing in this movie. She is so attractive and so seductive how could David help himself? He sacrifices all that he has going for him to be with Elise. I love a good love story. This is a good love story. He puts everything on the line for this woman even though he has Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) breathing down his neck.Appearing as if he's just stepped off of the Mad Men set and onto the movie set, Slattery plays the role of the man who appears to be in charge of this whole operation. Not that it is laughable, but the fact that the men in this group wear fedoras makes it possible for them to walk through a door and have it take them anywhere but where it is supposed to take them. It's kinda neat I guess. It certainly adds to the sci-fi aspect of the film.Ah, the movies Putting a science fiction title on this movie gives it the believability it needs to thrive. I loved the movie. I loved the chemistry between Damon and Blunt. So often we see on-screen couples who appear as though they've just met in every scene. In The Adjustment Bureau, we have a scene where the pair meet up some time after the first meeting and they are just as charismatic with one another as they were when they first laid eyes on each other.Excellent chemistry, good plot, and some interesting turns make The Adjustment Bureau one to see. The ending, however, was not for me. It would be silly for me to ruin the ending for you, but let me just say I enjoyed the film until the end.",7,0,1,19 April 2011
The Artist," The Artist: Romantic and Magical
","Was becoming a siren of the silver screen ever as easy as being in the right place at the right time? It was for Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). When Peppy goes down to Kinograph Studios in – where else – Hollywoodland, she has a fateful drop of a pocketbook and literally bumps into handsome silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). A brief moment of mortification turns into a laugh and a laugh turns into front page news. A more realistic idea takes place after this meeting, as it really is who you know and not what you do when it comes to getting into show business. Thankfully, Peppy's wild curls and pearly whites were enough to catch the eye of George Valentin and she gets her first role in a big screen picture. The on-screen chemistry flows over into real life chemistry. George's wife is nonplussed with all of this and not even his adorable antics with his faithful pup can get him out of this one.Aside from his marital troubles, George has an even bigger matter keeping him up at night. Talkies have just been introduced as the next big thing. Now, I don't understand why George wouldn't just make the transition myself, but the film makes it incredibly clear that he is quite proud of his silent films. Fortunately for Kinograph, the wildly adorable Peppy Miller isn't afraid to get on camera and speak. Speak, sing, whistle she'll do it all. Guess this means they don't need George anymore. Cue sad, washed up music Call me a sucker if you like, but that silent film song and dance (no pun intended) always gets me. Black and white makes everything so glamorous. When you throw two attractive people into the mix, it's a guaranteed hit. I'm not the only one who ate this movie up. Hollywood will surely be kissing director Michel Hazanavicius's feet come award show season. Dujardin already won Best Actor at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and the film is carrying six Golden Globe nominations. God only knows what will happen at the Academy Awards, but I imagine that THE ARTIST will do just fine.There is just something so charming about actors that can dance in tap shoes and look damn fine doing it. Old Hollywood is always regarded fondly and with the way things are going there these days, I wouldn't mind seeing some of that again. The only thing fake about Peppy Miller is her mole. Oops. Spoiler alert. There's an innocence to this movie that our society doesn't experience anymore. Also, Ludovic Bource -, the man behind the score for THE ARTIST – truly captured the sound of the era. A lot of simple piano is a good way to stir emotions and make the viewer believe they are watching a movie that is really from the late 1920s – early 1930s.THE ARTIST took second place in my favorite movies of the year. Really, it is a fun movie with lots of pretty imagery and good toe-tapping music. It also flies by. It proves that we don't need boner/fart jokes and profanity to make an enjoyable movie. I don't mean to go all Will Smith 1999 MTV VMAs on you, but it truly is rare to find a film that makes us laugh and cry and emote all over without nudity/profanity/bodily excretions. In fact, not a word is spoken in THE ARTIST until the very end. It is just really well done and even though it is very obviously appealing to the vintage Hollywood style of doing things, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",10,1,1,30 December 2011
Rango," Rango - The Kids Movie that is not for Kids
","Last night while I was watching Rango, I felt myself putting an honest effort into really enjoying the experience. I haven't read any other reviews because I feel that is bad form for a film critic. It makes it difficult to concentrate on one's own thoughts and feelings. I did, however, see that my guy – Roger Ebert – gave Rango four stars and a standing ovation. This is troubling, as I feel that four stars is a generous rating for this one.Let me first say that just because the movie has the Nickelodeon name attached to it does not mean it is meant for children. Like the great Wall-E, this movie is one that appears to be marketed for children and adults alike, but is really for the older crowd. Whenever I make this judgement, I imagine my niece sitting next to me in the movie theater. Would she enjoy the film? Not Rango.Although the four-letter words don't get more extreme than H-E-double hockey sticks and one 'damn' thrown in, the peppering of 'hell' throughout the film appeared to be abundant. This is fine for my big girl ears, but I would have felt uncomfortable had my niece been there.I suspect some will say that the film is not marketed for the younger demographic. I beg to differ. Not only is it a cartoon, but it is a Nickelodeon film. These two things coupled with the fact that all of the previews show cutesy scenes with little cartoon creatures say to me that this movie will be kid friendly.I don't want to harp on this much longer, but there are a few scenes in which the movie is even scary. I think that PG rating could definitely be bumped up to a PG-13. Not to mention all of the political aspects of the film. Kids aren't going to get that stuff! Corrupt leaders and a seedy underbelly lead to many jokes that children will not get.Perhaps I'm just a fuddy-duddy.However, if you are an adult, you might really enjoy this movie. It has its laugh out loud moments. There are classic Depp moments as well. An homage to a former Depp film that was completely unexpected came across very well. Certain Captain Jack Sparrow characteristics were also present. 'That's interesting' Basically, Rango is the story of a little chameleon voiced by Johnny Depp who hangs out with a headless, naked Barbie torso with a missing arm and a wind-up goldfish. He knows nothing of desert living until he is thrust into it. In a little town called Dirt, Rango must save the town from a drought and find himself.It was nice to see a strong female role in the film, though in the end she still needed rescuing. Isla Fisher is barely recognizable in voice as Beans, the love interest to Rango. Also unrecognizable was the fantastic Bill Nighy whom I love dearly most of the time, but Rattlesnake Jake is one mean dude. Little Abigail Breslin (Signs, Little Miss Sunshine) voices Priscilla.The cast is great, the plot is good, and the movie over all is decent. I could have done without the owl mariachi band, but I suppose they served their purpose.-Ms. Silver Screen founder of mssilverscreen.com",7,0,1,19 April 2011
Despicable Me," Despicable Me
","It seems to me that with every year we get smarter, funnier animated features. Those just for the kiddos, and those for kids and adults alike. Despicable Me is amusing for all ages. I love a good change of heart plot. In Despicable Me, the hilarious Steve Carell voices Gru. Gru is an evil genius of sorts who is being shown up by someone who keeps getting to all of the good heists before he can.In an effort to get the spotlight back, Gru goes to the bank to get a loan for his newest project: shrinking and stealing the moon, of course. While at the bank we meet Vector. Vector (Jason Segel) is obnoxious and appears immature and incapable of being a great villain.After being turned down by the bank, Gru discovers that Vector is miraculously the one behind the latest great heists. In order to infiltrate Vector's lair, Gru seeks out the girls he saw selling cookies at Vector's house. They live in a local orphanage and are adopted by Gru to carry out his master plan.Margo, Edith, and Agnes (Voiced in order by Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and the extra adorable Elsie Fisher) come to live with Gru and you can imagine what happens then. Picture it: three young girls in the house of an evil genius. With weapons, ray guns, potions, and trap doors at every turn there is plenty of mischief for them to get into.Let's not forget the minions. The minions are many and they are all over the place causing trouble and acting as guinea pigs to Gru and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) as they build their rocket ship.Despite his best efforts, Gru starts to become attached to the little girls. Particularly enjoyable is the scene where Gru takes the girls to an amusement park. Agnes, who had a little stuffed unicorn that was disintegrated when the girls arrived at Gru's house, sees another, much bigger stuffed unicorn and shouts 'He's so fluffy I'm gonna die!' I hope I'm not ruining anything for anyone, but Gru wins the unicorn for little Agnes.Adorable, I know.No kids movie would be complete without some sort of gas-passin' joke. This one comes in the form of a gun that when fired emits a large greenish cloud and makes a farting sound, to which Gru says 'I said dart gun, not' well, you get it.With laughs, warm fuzzies, bad guys, cute kids, and little green minions, Despicable Me gets the recipe for a great animated film just right.

The Iron Giant," The Iron Giant: I dare you to dislike this movie...
","The Iron Giant is a movie that I can watch time and time again and never tire of. This one sits high on a pedestal with The Little Mermaid and Lilo & Stitch as one of my favorite animated features. I am going to skip spoiler warnings here because, well, if you haven't seen this by now, then shame on you.A lone man in a boat in the middle of a terrible storm with hulking waves thrashing him from side to side cries desperately into a radio for help. As he is starting to lose hope, he glances up and spots an illumination in the sky. Saints be praised! It's a lighthouse! A brief moment of rejoicing is quickly extinguished by terror when he realizes that this light is no safe haven, but they eyes of a towering metal man.Miraculously, the man makes it out of this little pickle alive and goes to the local diner where he tells everyone his tale. With guffaws of disbelief, his audience implies that what the man saw came from the bottom of a bottle, if you catch my meaning.At a nearby table, a wide-eyed Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) is listening to the man's story. Also listening in is Dean McCoppin who is voiced by Harry Connick Jr. He peeks over the wall to vouch for the man, only to be laughed at as well.Single mom to Hogarth, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston), is hard at work waiting tables. Hogarth and Dean meet and are fast friends. Dean is a cool cat and is always calm and collected. Hogarth has a wild imagination and while he would love to do what his mother asks of him, he manages to do the opposite quite often.Hogarth is home alone that night while mom works late. The curious young man ventures out into the night to investigate suspicious activity and is awestruck to find the same humongous metal man from earlier. Incredibly, Hogarth saves the iron giant from doom.The following day, Hogarth bikes off to the woods in an attempt to find this new friend. He places a piece of sheet metal, the giant's favorite snack, out as bait. After dozing off, he is awoken by a loud noise. The metal is gone. He turns around to see that he has done what he came to do. Afraid at first, Hogarth runs, but quickly realizes that the iron giant means him no harm.Hogarth must teach his metal friend, voiced by Vin Diesel that guns are bad and that he doesn't have to be one, even though he is equipped with some major fire arms. Without a place to hide him and no food for him to eat, Hogarth takes the iron giant over to Dean's pad. Dean is an artist who deals mostly with large metal sculptures. 'I mean, what am I? A junkman who makes art or an artist who sells junk? You tell me.' So you see, he has lots of metal sitting around. Perfect for snacking.Meanwhile, after reports of spotting the giant, a call is made and fast-talking government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) rushes right over to get to the bottom of things. With his initial disbelief, Kent spends his time making quips about the small town. Gems like 'The biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen.' After a close encounter with a car that appears to be bitten in half, Kent catches on to the situation. He knows that Hogarth is hiding the iron giant and won't stop until he is discovered and destroyed.The movie is full of funny and endearing moments. A couple personal favorites include the scene in which Hogarth, Dean, and the iron giant go swimming. When the giant robot does a cannonball into the lake, hilarity ensues. The heart-to-heart scene that Hogarth has with the iron giant about death is also heart-warming. 'Souls don't die.' When eventually the iron giant is discovered by the government, despite Hogarth's best efforts to tell them that he is harmless, Kent insists that they blow him to smithereens anyway. Hogarth tries to get a handle on the situation, but Kent — in a fit of madness — presses the obligatory big red button and launches a bomb that will destroy the giant, the town, and everyone in it.When it seems that all hope is lost, the iron giant bids his buddy Hogarth a fond farewell, shoots off into the sky, and collides with the bomb, saving everyone from certain death.Flash-forward. Annie and Dean are admiring what she says is his best work yet. A sculpture of the iron giant. Hogarth is given the only piece of the giant that was recovered, and is delighted when it lights up and jumps out the window. He knows the iron giant can self-repair and waves goodbye, hoping he'll see the iron giant again someday.Sweet. Funny. Touching. I really can't say enough good about this movie. I double dog dare you to make it through this one with dry eyes.(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)",Null,4,5,20 January 2011
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3
","Disney and Pixar have done it again. Toy Story 3 opens with an action packed scene in the old west with all of the old classics. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Rex, Jessie, Buzz, and of course, Woody. The suspense is at its peak when we are taken to Andy's bedroom. He is a little boy and he is just as we remember him from years ago. Flash-forward via camcorder montage to present day. Andy is getting ready to go off to college and the first thought I have is 'My, how you've grown! You've gotten so big!' As if I were watching a real child grow up and go off to school.The toys are in remarkably good shape considering it's been ages since we've seen them last. In the same old toy box from the days of yore, the group is devising a plan to get their kid, Andy, to want to play with them again. If they are very lucky, they will get to accompany him to college. In a clever trick using the house phone and Andy's cell phone, the toys make one last-ditch effort to gain back the love Andy once had for them.When faced with the question of what he wants to do with those old toys, Andy tosses Woody in a box marked 'College' but puts the rest of the toys in a black garbage bag. While Andy's original intentions were to take the toys up to the attic, an inevitable turn of events leaves the toys on the curb, dreadfully awaiting the garbage man. Woody races to their rescue and is swept up in the mix and taken with the rest of his comrades to be donated to daycare.Upon arrival, the group is welcomed by the other toys with open arms. Lotso, the huggin' strawberry-scented bear, comes out to act as tour guide for the toys and acts just as sweet as he smells. With his buddy for life, Big Baby, he shows the toys around and promises them that they will be played with everyday from here on out. The clan is filled with glee at the thought of being played with and start to accept this new reality.Woody wants to stand by his kid because even though the rest of the group believes that Andy intended to throw them away, Woody knows it was all a big misunderstanding and that Andy really does love them.Throughout the rest of the movie, the audience meets a slew of new characters, some friend and some foe. Notable voices include the charter members of the movie. Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm and Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom. Some of the same from the second installment return as well. Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Joan Cusack as Jessie, and my girl Jodi Benson as Barbie. The same Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid and more recently played Robert's assistant in Enchanted. I was simply ashamed of myself for not picking out her voice before the credits rolled.Newcomer to the trilogy, Ken, is voiced by Michael Keaton. Ken is dimwitted and hilarious and a welcome addition to the movie. One of my favorite bits in the film was when the team has to help Buzz come to his senses and discover a highly comical defect in his factory settings.Get your tissues ready, ladies and gentlemen, because my eyes were not dry at the end of this delightful little romp. The movie is fun, touching, full of laughs, and will surely remind you of those dusty old toys in your attic.",9,1,2,20 January 2011
The Social Network," Three cheers for The Social Network
","Love, jealousy, money, and greed. These are four of the most powerful driving forces in the world and they are also the primary driving forces behind The Social Network. I absolutely loved this movie. Director David Fincher did not waste anytime getting us right into the plot.A young Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) opens the movie by dazzling us with his somewhat careless yet brilliant tech skills. He moves quickly and does not falter. He is incredibly intelligent but has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth all too often. He's also neurotic and two-faced. One of his only friends in the world, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) blazes through the internet with Zuckerberg as they explore the world of dot-coms.Due to a prank of epic proportions pulled by Zuckerberg, he starts to get press and is suddenly under fire having to defend his actions.The movie moves right along with occasional laughs and we are able to witness the creation of the website that has become the most popular dot-com of our generation. We also get to see the controversy over who thought of it first. Is it really a stolen idea? Is Mark Zuckerberg and evil genius? Everyone in this film gives a superb performance. And I mean everyone. There is not one role that I can think of that was just O.K. Jesse Eisenberg was - as everyone has already said - incredible. I'm a little tardy to the party on this one, but I completely agree with the general consensus that this is surely going to get a few Oscar nods. I wasn't so sure about it before today, but I left the theater in a daze. Not many movies do that to me anymore.While I am sure that the most buzz was that which surrounded Michael Cera wannabe Jesse Eisenberg in a role that completely shattered that image, I was seriously wowed by Andrew Garfield who played Eduardo Saverin. If this movie is at all accurate as far as Zuckerberg's personality - and who knows if it is - being Mark's best friend was trying and most of the time emotionally exhausting. Watching the roller coaster of emotion that Eduardo experienced was difficult. Zuckerberg played the 'come here, go away' game for much of the film leaving Eduardo at the end of his rope.Brenda Song broke away from her squeaky clean Disney Channel persona to play Eduardo's crazy girlfriend. The Winklevoss boys played by Armie Hammer provided much-needed comedic relief in some of the tense parts of the film and also provided serious eye candy. Am I right, ladies? Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker started off weak, but as the film progressed I saw that N'Sync glow fade away and he became someone completely different.The movie was excellent and a must see. While I don't think this will win best picture, I do see a possible best actor award for Jesse Eisenberg and I have a strong feeling that Andrew Garfield could take home best supporting actor.One of the most memorable scenes for me was the very last scene of the film. Of course I won't say what the last scene is, but it reaffirmed everything I thought I knew the whole time.See it if you haven't and watch it again if you have. It's fantastic and entertaining and embodies all of the necessary components of a great dramedy.Also, Vega Choir did a marvelous cover of Creep by Radiohead for the trailer of the film.Enjoy!(Check out my other reviews and much more at www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)",10,0,1,26 December 2010
The Fighter," The Fighter is a TKO with an A-plus cast
","With all of the boxing movies already out there (Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, Cinderella Man and so on and so forth) why, pray tell, do we need another? They are all essentially telling the same story. A rise to fame or a fall from glory. What more can they do with the idea? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Fighter. I am not a fan of boxing in general, but I truly found myself becoming emotionally involved with the characters in this movie. There is so much heart that comes across.Our hero is Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg). He grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts where he learned everything he knows about boxing from his brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale). His mother and manager, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) is obsessed with her boys fighting and wants them to be the greatest. After all, in his heyday, Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. This is his big claim to fame and we hear about it at least one hundred times in the first half hour of the film. Dicky Eklund, the pride of Lowell.When Mickey is entered into a fight against someone nearly twice his size because his original opponent falls ill, he is embarrassed and walks away from everyone and everything with one exception: Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). As someone who has seen Enchanted more times than any sane person with most of their functioning brain cells left, I had a pretty squeaky-clean image of Amy Adams in my mind. She acted the hell out of an otherwise understated role and did it with all the strength of a woman who doesn't take guff from anyone.Charlene and Mickey start dating, much to the chagrin of Mickey's sisters and mother who think she is just going to distract him. My favorite is when they dub her the 'MTV girl' which means that she is wild. Mickey's sisters what can one say about this group of girls? With big hair, blue eye shadow, and a beer/cigarette in hand at any given moment, they are one tough crowd to please. See if you can pick out Kate O' Brien, Conan O' Brien's sister, in the group.But I digress Charlene has Mickey's best interests at heart and tries to get him back on track to becoming a great fighter and maybe winning a title. With Dicky Eklund running around and getting into all sorts of shenanigans, Mickey has to focus on himself long enough to forget about his crazy brother and get back in the ring.Christian Bale gives a spot-on performance. His likability in this film is a constant up and down. I found at one point I had genuine disdain for him. To me, this is one of the signs of a great actor. I don't know who he is in real life, though I've heard stories — 'No, Bruce. Let me finish.' — but he worked my range of emotions here and came out on top.One of my favorite characters in the film was George Ward (Jack McGee). He brings a levelheadedness to an prodigiously chaotic situation.Like I said, this movie oozes heart and is packed with tremendously talented actors. Sure to get a look from the Academy, The Fighter is one of the best from 2010.(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)",10,3,4,20 January 2011
