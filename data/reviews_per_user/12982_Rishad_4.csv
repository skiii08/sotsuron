Howl's Moving Castle," Not as good as Spirited Away, but alright
","Just came out of my local art house movie theater for the matin√©e showing of 'Howl's Moving Castle'. I had previously seen Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away', and was expecting a beautiful story with engaging visuals and an interesting eye on things. Unfortunately, for me, this movie only had 2/3 of those features. I found the story and characters not as likable or relatable as in 'Spirited', and the convoluted plot involving a war taking place in the background didn't really pull me in as much. The animation is still great, especially of the moving castle, and in general it's on the level of 'Spirited', but storywise, this one didn't really do it for me as much.Recommended for a rental, I guess.",4,4,15,14 June 2005
The Hunger Games," A stylish and sensitive adaptation of a complex young adult novel
","This film came out last year, and I grabbed a copy at the library last week. I knew a little bit about the back story, but made it a point not to oversteep myself in the story before watching it, because I'd heard good things. In a nutshell, it's set in a post-Apocalyptic North America. Most of the population has been wiped out, except for a large wealthy centralized city, with smaller populations in widespread districts who are forced to pledge allegiance. In order to maintain political control, the authorities enforce food rationing by way of brutal televised games involving children from the various districts. The games involve fights to the death out in the wild, 'Survivor' style, until a final winner is declared and their district is allotted food rations.Although the original novel is targeted at teens and young adults, I found the material rich and complex enough to satisfy older viewers. Themes of conflict, loyalty, betrayal, heroism, political intrigue, as well as a little bit of teen angst, are all composed against the backdrop of a constant fight to survive. The film has Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and a surprising good role by Lenny Kravitz.Stylistically, I enjoyed the portrayal of the futuristic Capitol and its upper class citizenry, shown as essentially colorful, ornately dressed puppets, compared to the stark utilitarian clothing of the district dwellers. It brought shades of 'Aeon Flux' and 'Metropolis' to mind, as did the entire film - a dystopian society on the verge of massive change and upheaval, brought about by gross injustices, founded upon its own underlying inhumanity. This film is part one of a three-part series, and I do hope the remaining films are made.",8,0,3,17 May 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," An atrocious waste of time
","I had more or less low expectations for this film, but after being semi-forced to watch the whole thing (social obligations), I was met with the unfortunate end of 'Low'.The film had some interesting and novel ideas to play around with (a bandit raccoon and a walking tree? Perfect!), but the word that constantly came to mind while making it through to the end was 'Overdone'. Too much action (yes, I said it), paper-thin characters, a plot that made absolutely no sense at all, and weak attempts at humor - the combination of all these left me checking the time every few minutes waiting for the all-too-predictable ending to be over.Oh, and a constant irritation (at least to me), was the 'soundtrack' -- songs from the 70's which grated on my nerves. I guess they were trying to be 'original', or something.Simplify the plot, develop the characters a bit more, work up some *good* actions (not just random explosions and bits moving about) and there might have been something here to hold my interest. Unfortunately I'm not a teenage boy who might think all this overkill is a-w-e-s-o-m-e, but I was bored within 30 minutes.Sorry - I wanted to like it, but it didn't happen.",1,19,39,26 April 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit of Career Goals
","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***I was quite disappointed in this film, and I'll tell you why. For starters, it's been on my watch list for quite some time now, since I've been exploring the topic of happiness, well-being, and all that good stuff. I thought this film would provide an interesting angle on this, and present a different point of view. It does indeed present a different point of view. In a nutshell, it tells you that making your family a lower priority, while chasing the dream of making gobs of money at a career you know nothing about, are the keys to happiness. I beg to differ.As a result of constantly letting down his wife, Will Smith finally loses her, and is left attempting to raise his young son, while essentially becoming homeless, but through hard work and gumption, he makes something of himself. And that's the pursuit of happiness. That's the entire film right there -- I just saved you two hours of your life.To be fair, Smith, Jaden, and Thandie Newton all did a great job with the roles they were given. But the plot, script, and overarching message of this film absolutely didn't sit well with me at all. I'd rather engage in everyday happiness, than get caught up in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' (sic), thank you.",5,1,1,6 March 2015
