Blade Runner 2049," An outstanding movie that's not without flaws.
","An excellent movie. The imagery was just astounding. The direction and cinematography were perfect though they don't match the look and feel of the original in every way, which is a little off-putting if you've just seen the original before watching 2049. The acting is *much* better than what you see in the 1982 original. God knows Harrison Ford hasn't emoted so much in any role in the last 30 years. And Gosling was outstanding; I really don't get the reservations so many people seemed to have when it was announced he was going to be starring. Ana de Armas (Joi) was wonderful. Robin Wright played Robin Wright excellently as always. I felt Jared Leto was a weak link in the cast. And I say that as someone who really liked his Joker in Suicide Squad. And given how (over)used he was this is a real problem with the movie. Sadly, Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is no Rutger Hauer (assuming she was intended to take that role, which isn't necessarily so and that also is a problem). There was, thankfully, no sexual assault/rape scene passed off as a seduction like there was in the original. -.- 2049 falls short of the original Blade Runner in several categories. But comparing it to the original is a really high bar. It's no shame that it falls a bit short. That still makes it one hell of a good movie.I give it a 9/10 and would absolutely recommend it. Go see it at the big screen. The bigger the better.Like I said I liked the movie. But... I might have enjoyed it just as much if it had been 2 hours of non- storytelling clips of 2049 LA and the other sets with the actors walking around emoting things plus the soundtrack.And that's something of a problem if you ask me.",9,2,8,8 October 2017
