Blade Runner 2049," First impressions, not completely what i expected...
","This is not an easy review because i just left the theater and i have some mixed feelings about it. First of all i am a fan of the original Blade Runner, i found it really unique and interesting but when it comes to Blade Runner 2049 even though it had crazy good visuals and sound effects i thought it was a bit dull. For starters i think that the movie was a bit too long. Even though the scenes had many details (which could be a great thing especially for people who don't know the futuristic world that was introduced in the first movie) i think they overdid it a bit which made some of the scenes a bit pointless and it felt like they lead to nowhere. The main thing that was missing in order for this to be a good slow paced movie was the lack of tension. The movie felt a bit flat for the first 2/3 of it(at one point i actually dozed off for a couple of minutes). I really think they should have spent a bit more time on developing the story instead of the visual look of the movie.When it comes to the positive things that i really liked, i think Ryan Gosling did an amazing job as well as Harrison Ford. The acting was definitely spot on. The cinematographer is definitely someone we have to keep an eye on this award season. The sound effects and the whole vibe bring that old feeling from the original movie which is something that i love. Overall i rate it 7/10.",7,2,5,10 October 2017
Dunkirk," Visual Masterpiece
",Im gonna keep this short. The movie is visually stunning. Im feeling confident that the cinematographer is getting at least an Oscar nomination. The movies flow was buttery smooth. There are a lot of comments saying that there was no character development but i feel that the movies intention was to paint the picture of the event in whole rather than to focus on an individual storyline. The sound effects were spot on and contributed a lot to the tension that everyone in the movie theater felt. I think Nolan did an amazing job. Tom Hardy was a real boss in this. I strongly recommend it! 9/10,9,2,8,22 July 2017
A Quiet Place," Slow buildup but it is worth the watch!
","I am going to keep it short.The movie concept is definitely unique and original. The movie theater was actually a quiet place for the first time and that was a result of the suspense and tension that was being built as the plot was progressing. This might not be the popular opinion but i have to say that i was not impressed with the child actors. When it comes to Krasinski and Blunt they were spot on. I am definitely looking forward to Krasinski's work in the future.
The only negative thing in this movie that i have to point out was the slow beginning of the movie. Some of the scenes just felt boring and i don't think that they helped with the development of the plot at all.
Loved the ending, it reminded me a bit of 10 Cloverfield Lane for some reason.Overall i give it 7/10.",7,0,1,10 April 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Did you all watch the same movie i did?
","Honestly, I am baffled with all the negative reviews that I have read for the final part of this timeless classic. The story picks up couple of years later after the second part ended. Michael's kids are all grown up now and they have different visions and ambitions for their lives that not necessarily correspond with their father's plan. Michael is doing everything in his power to finally turn a new page in his family's life and leave the dark past behind, but soon figures out that things are not as simple as he wishes them to be. We are introduced to a new character, Vincent (Sonny's illegitimate son), who has his father's temper but still menages to find the patience to listen to his wise uncle. The only thing that i really missed in this movie was Robert Duvall's character. Also i have to say that i strongly disagree with the critics who argue that Francis Coppola made a wrong decision by casting his daughter as Michael Corleone's daughter. I think Sofia Coppola played her role perfectly. And when it comes to the ending.. i never cried to any movie's ending (I was really close while watching the ending of One flew over the Cuckoo's nest) but man this ending left me speechless. If you are a movie fan do yourself a favor and watch all three movies because they are a piece of movie history that will be remembered for generations.",10,2,3,27 March 2018
Annihilation," Cheap visuals, looks like a TV Movie?
","Where do I start.. The movie is part of the new Hollywood movement where we have only females as leading characters (which is completely normal except that it feels a bit forced in this movie for me). What really annoyed me from the start of the movie is the fact that the story starts with the same old cliche that a lot of sci-fi movies follow. What i mean by this is we have couple of completely naive or should i say ignorant scientists (some of them are not even scientists but random women with a lot of issues) that go into an area which is contaminated without any gear or proper equipment. As the story develops you quickly begin to realize that they have a lot of troubled personalities (they are supposed to be handpicked scientists) which is basically part of the plot of every bad sci-fi movie.
Some of the scenes are completely ridiculous, like the moment where one of the girls gets attacked and the others including the team leader just freeze and you have only Natalie Portman trying to deal with the situation. Besides the things that i pointed out i think the story seemed unique but sadly the execution was done poorly.
The visuals in this movie seemed so cheap to me and my friends that watched the movie with me that makes me wonder if we watched the same movie with the people who praise the movie for its look. As the title of the review says this looks like a TV sci-fi movie at best!",2,5,9,12 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Disappointment
","I was a real big fan of Prometheus even though there were some annoying parts in it and was really looking forward to this one, however, the movie was a big let down. The story was really poor, the characters were really annoying and shallow (they were really freaking stupid for a group of handpicked cosmonauts). I honestly feel like Ridley has completely lost his touch with this one. Some of the scenes i couldn't even take seriously because they felt so off. The potential was really big because the prequel ended with a lot of exciting questions unanswered yet instead on focusing on that Ridley decided to make a movie about the most immature, incompetent, unprofessional, group of people that supposedly are scientists and cosmonauts. Feels bad man..",6,2,9,19 May 2017
