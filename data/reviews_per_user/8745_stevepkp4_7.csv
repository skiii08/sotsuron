The Blair Witch Project," ........
","WHAT THE F***!!!! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!! I could have made this same movie by running around the woods at night with some friends and a $100 camcorder screaming 'the blair witch is around''Let's shine this bright camera light around and run in circles like f***ing morons' This movie could have been SOOOOOOO much better. Its just that most of the time it was them going endless cycles in the woods.I know all the blair witch stuff was suppose to be in your imagination, but there was barely any time to imagine because it was pretty much just those three people argueing anyway.WARNING SPOILER:It got the most interesting at the end and the creepiest too when you see that guy in the corner(who was dead) of the house they found",7,0,1,21 November 2002
The Ring," The scariest movie i have ever seen!
","Even though this was the scariest movie I've ever seen , it really didn't scare me much because I don't get scared by movies.Very interesting and you pretty much have to piece it all together to figure everything out. This movie could use a sequel and a prequel like the original japaneese version(hint, hint) to further explain everything though. Otherwise a very descent thriller flick. Its something to see with a group of friends in the middle of the night.",8,0,0,19 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This is NOT another stupid pirate movie!
","Excellent movie. this is definately on of 2003's best. For all of you critics out there, the characters were well developed and this had a solid plot and moved along well as any epic journey should.For those of you movie lovers looking for a great entertaining installments, this is just right for you too. ^_^
10/10
For those who liked The Matrix Reloaded and thought it was one of the best films ever, this is almost as good!Thats right, almost as good!",8,0,1,9 July 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Everyone wants to be a Critic
","Visual effects were excellent. People will say the plot wasn't great, but to make a plot work right it has to be executed right. The plot wasn't anything special, but it was done well and Dennis Quad and Jake Gyllanhal are believable most of the time and good actors all together. The subplots themselves (Girl was hurt, needed medicine, some of the guys had to get it and there were some wolves chasing them and The mother in the hospital with the child who needed an ambulance to be rescued, views of space of the storm, and the whole love story) weren't masterpieces, but they were somewhat interesting, different, and added tension and emotion. The overall point was good too,there was a good dose of satire, and if you like looking for themes and what things symbolize you should like this movie in many ways (esp. the ending)There was plenty of visual effects and disaster shots if that all your looking for.The only problem i had with this movie is 99 percent of the damage you see happens in the US, esp. NY, and i think they should have tried to see damage done too other parts of the world too (someone else mentioned that NY has been trashed enough) 7/10",7,0,0,30 May 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","One of the best movies ever to appear in the big screen. It tied all the loose ends and answered all the questions you had in Reloaded. The plot was good and solid and everything seemed to have a  meaning in various levels. Visually it had some of the best SFX ever and biggest battle scenes anyone could see in a movie at this point.The fight scenes had all the tension they needed and the twists on this philosophical , exhilarating roller coaster kept you saying 'Whoa!'My rating, 10/10. f*** Lord of the Rings. it overrated. Check out Revolutions, it sooo much better.",7,0,1,6 November 2003
Batman Begins," Wow
","The poetic dialog is back. The Darkness is back. The depth and motives in the villains are back. The character development, strength in themes, the wonderful performances are BACK!! Even a little bit of that charming,humor is back.I felt that spark i did when i first watched Batman and Batman Returns.There is only few problems with it. The dark color schemes may make things harder to see and there is a bit of formula mixed in with it, it didn't have a lot of that whiz-bang action you expect from a summer blockbuster either. Still, everything else makes up for it. Definitely worth seeing in theater, a must see for Batman fans.",9,1,2,15 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Even more 'BRILLIANT' than the first
","Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone was great and so was the book. The book Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets exceeded its first and so did the movie! Seriously, WOW!!!! Even though it was 2hrs and 40min. it felt like 30 min. I was dissappointed in the deathday party being excluded.Then it probably would have been rated PG-13 for sure.",8,0,0,19 November 2002
