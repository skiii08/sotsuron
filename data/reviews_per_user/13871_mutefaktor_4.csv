Vertigo," 2X asgoodas any other Hitchk movie!!
","one of the best lovestories I ever saw. This is not your ordinary thriller but it´s darn good. Makes u think.. Your mood for the day weill definitely affect the way you´ll percieve this movie, almost gets better if u watch it alone. One has to love Stewart playing the role of the fragile and confused hero and NOvak is sooo... uknow what ok some of the scenes have cardboard backdrops (y? i would prefer a little crappy lighting) but the dialogue between S. and N. is so good u might not even notice. 9 (+1 for the comicbook vertigo animations)",9,1,3,10 February 2003
Top Secret!," Val Kilmers best
","Still some of the funniest s*** I ever saw.. and it produced the stupidest comment I ever read on imbd (some israelian a couple of rows down) suggesting this wasnt for the non-US viewer. Well, english is my third language. If youve seen a couple of movies from the last millenia you´ll get it (if u have an iq over 60, able to tie your own shoelaces etc). Val Kilmers best movie.. Wish he´d done more comedies I´ll give it 8/10, but while youre watching it, it feels like ten.once again to the reviewer below: if u were being ironic, it was very subtle. If that is the case then I guess I am the stupid nutcase. I love u anyway fellow human!",Null,0,1,15 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum is the real hero
","Wasn´t really dissapointed w/ the first movie, but this 2nd part was way better. Critics have already claimed that this is the 'action' part of the trilogy, but I found it to also have more depth and psychological (although archaic) undertones. I wish I was ten.. or maybe I am, at least these days you are sort of allowed to admit u feel 10 years old. Peter Jacksons splattermovies r nice but I consider this and heavenly creatures as his best up to this date. Let´s face it, Gollum is the most important character in the Tolkien saga. Come on mr. Jackson U will have no problems getting an even larger budget if u shoot 'Bilbo'. Too bad Jim Henson is dead, but I guess CGI will get better n betta every year.",9,0,0,6 March 2003
Hero," better than raging donkey, hidden elephant
","I found this movie superior to the highly acclaimed crouching..(which I also liked btw) This movie has real acting not the stupid overacting that some people seem to favour. A lovely fairytale that made me feel like a kid again and Moon is just about the prettiest AND scariest lookin heroine I ever saw. Jet Li also look cooler than ever. If u just want a HK stupid action movie this wont do; it´s way too sad and yes, pretentious - but it´s a fairytale, c´mon!8.5/10",9,0,0,23 August 2003
