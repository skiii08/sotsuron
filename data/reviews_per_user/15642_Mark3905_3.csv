The Blair Witch Project," Made me sick
","No, I am not saying that there was anything disgusting that made me sick regarding the movie.  If you have an inner-ear type problem, the skaky-camera style of filming that was used in this movie can make you nauseous.  I myself know of several people who got sick at this movie because it made them dizzy.  Watch out!",1,16,31,25 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Get a life
","Have you read about people cutting down on this movie for being juvenille and crude?  Have you heard people say it is disgusting?  It is all of the above, and more.  And what do I think?  I'll tell you what I don't think. I don't think I ever laughed this much in 1 1/2 hours.  Ever.  The movie was not made to be taken seriously.  Those who don't like it -- get a life. The movie is just a fun attempt at making fun of a bunch of things.  Enjoy it. Don't analyze it.",10,0,0,25 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," I wasn't expecting to like it, but I did.
","I was never expecting to like this movie.  The only reason I rented it was to try and see more of the Oscar nominated films.  I figured I'd have it on the TV in the background while I got some work done on the PC.  No such luck.  The very clever use of modern songs in the years-ago setting caught my attention, and the rest of the movie kept my attention.  It truly deserves every one of the Oscar nominations.",Null,1,2,24 February 2002
