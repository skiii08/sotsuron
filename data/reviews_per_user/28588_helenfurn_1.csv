Marie Antoinette," Left me tepid
","Marie Antoinette has long been portrayed as one of history's most vacuous twits. Sadly, for me, Coppola not only failed to bring any depth to Marie's character, but actually left me viewing her in a worse light than I had before. She came across as every bit the spoiled, delusional airhead that we have come to expect. There was nothing, in what passed for her personality, that endeared me to her at all. In fact when the revolting peasants turned up at the front gates, I found myself shouting 'Thank God for that!' at the TV screen. Quite frankly this film bored me rigid. The cast is actually fantastic and they certainly all did the best with it that they could. But it just had no depth and really very little story line. The whole thing felt like a squandered opportunity.",3,2,2,9 July 2019
