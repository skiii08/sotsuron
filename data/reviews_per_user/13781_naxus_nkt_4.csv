The Monuments Men," Historically Inaccurate
","A historic movie could be boring, could be long , could be unfunny but it cant be historically inaccurate. I would have rank it better but after learning its inaccuracies I felt cheated. U can not do injustice to real peoples who have sacrificed their times and lives for a just cause or bad peoples who have wasted their lives on an unjust cause. Whatever the cause u should be truthful in an historic movie.",2,1,1,10 February 2020
Crash," It will change you for the better
","Some movies just change you. They give you an experience which is so beautiful that it just have an effect on you for a longer period of time or just change you for ever.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Could have been really good
","First it was too long and there will be a time when you will say to your self 'when will this end'. The start of the movie was really good but it got buried under its own weight. Too many characters and too many fight scenes and too tense. Tense can be good but 3 hour tense is too boring and some lighter moments can have been good, DC should learn some tricks from Marvel.",5,0,2,2 September 2018
