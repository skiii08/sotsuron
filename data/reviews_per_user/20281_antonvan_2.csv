United 93," 'If I get out of this I'm quitting tomorrow.'
","When the first previews of 'United 93' hit the theaters earlier this year, the feedback from the audience was pretty mixed. A common phrase used when taking about the upcoming disaster film was 'too soon'.But in order to achieve the dramatical power the film pursues, it was crucial to release the film precisely now: almost five years have passed, but the unfortunate date still remains in our memories and therefore helps the film accomplish it's emotional drive.The film's helmer, Paul Greengrass, has been making a name for himself for some time now, but he didn't exactly pop up until 2002 when his political drama/thriller about the Irish strike-turned-to-massacre, 'Bloody Sunday', was released. In 2004 he directed a great sequel to 'The Bourne Identity', called 'The Bourne Supremacy'. These two films give the viewer a good sense of his style of directing: very realistic, raw and not too dramatized. He really let's the images speak for themselves.And now he has made quite possibly one of this year's most emotionally challenging films. It begins with a scene from a hotel room: a man that you will immediately see as one of the terrorists, praying. This is a key element when thinking about the terrorists and their motives: religion is definitely displayed as the soul motive for their acts.After this we are witnessing the soon-to-be-hijackers arrive to the airport, go through security and finally board the plane. At the same time we see the other passengers getting ready for the flight, talking with each other and on the phone. You really feel like you're just witnessing actual events in a very documentary way instead of the usual Hollywood-style. The biggest factor in achieving this is the fact that all of the actors are relatively unknown especially outside TV. They really come out as just ordinary people on the edge of an enormous tragedy: and they all do a fantastic job.The film goes through all the key moments of that day, from the first hijack speculations to the World Trade Center and Pentagon being hit. It is basically divided into two parts: there's the plane and its own atmosphere that is eventually being disturbed by violence, and there are the air traffic control towers throughout the east coast. The totally closed environment of the plane offers a great contrast to the control towers, where all the information and chaos is almost overwhelming, as opposed to the plane, where no one has any idea what's happening around them. The camera doesn't wander off these two sets for one second, so all the events are being witnessed through these two environments, especially the air-traffic towers. And this is just one more thing that strengthens the documentary style of the film.The story that Paul Greengrass has created is naturally fictional since no one really knows what happened on the 'fourth plane'. However he has managed to gather a story that, created from the bits and pieces that are known about the flight, seems just about right and believable. Greengrass doesn't rush with the story, but let's it slowly evolve to the final climax that literally leaves the audience's mouths wide open. The ending scene is displayed with such beautiful minimalism and realism, that there hasn't been anything quite like it in cinema before. It crushes the viewer with it's total hopelessness, even though the course of the events has been clear to the viewer from the start. The only downside of the story is that some might find the air traffic control Â–sequences (that the film has quite a lot of) a bit dull as opposed to the plane-sequences. However this is highly individual and perhaps depends mainly on simply how strongly you feel about this whole event.Paul Greengrass has truly created a masterpiece: a film that will have it's place in history for it's unbelievably realistic approach on a tragedy, that shocked an entire nation. True, the film owes much of it's emotional power to the fact that the events are still clear in our minds, but I don't see how it couldn't also work as an independent film, separated from the WTC-tragedy.ps. This was originally written for school, and therefore has some pretty obvious stuff mentioned that I wouldn't normally point out.",9,2,4,1 March 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Please let me keep this memory, just this one.'
","It's approximately 4:30AM as I am writing this. I've just watched Charlie Kaufman's (as well as Michel Gondry's, of course) most absolute masterpiece once again, and I'm literally trembling with emotion. It saddens me that because of my lacking vocabulary there is no way I'd be able to express the state of mind that I'm currently in, but oh man, I have to try.For some people it's Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart's irresistible charm and Ingrid Bergman's divine beauty, for some it's Chocolat with the ever so handsome hippie-like Johnny Depp, but for me the greatest love story ever caught on film and the one film that I will be watching over and over again for as long as I shall live is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. With scenes filled with such emotion and such beauty, like the rain sequence with Joel's childhood coming to play, it triggers something so profound in me, that it's simply impossible to describe in words.I have recently gone through a rough patch with my girlfriend, and through my difficulties I find it even more satisfying to watch the main characters' story evolve (or devolve, actually) with such plausible dialogue and with such honesty in details.The heart and soul of this film really are the actors, mainly Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. They share such enviable chemistry and just seem so perfect for each other, even in moments of argument. Opposites attract, and with Carrey as the insecure and mellow Joel Barish and Winslet as the lively, slightly bipolar Clementine Kruczynski, they make the perfect on-screen couple. Carrey and Winslet are also supported by some great performances by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.The film of course wouldn't be anything if it weren't for Michel Gondry and his unique visual style that gives the film the kind of hand-made look it graves. With little computer-effects, most of the work is done by hand, thus keeping the film even more in the ground as opposed to plunging into CGI-scifi. The color themes and the contrasts that Gondry uses are all coherent and brilliantly selected, and cinematographer Ellen Kuras is doing an amazing job with her raw visual style that fits seamlessly into Gondry's vision. The soundtrack is another thing that deserves endless praise, Beck's bittersweet 'Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime' is just one of the high points.But it's the story of these two lovers, struggling through their difficulties only to once again find the joy they once shared, that makes this film the masterpieces that it is. It is only by a collaboration of remarkably talented individuals, that something like this can be achieved.'Love conquers all' might be a worn-out phrase, but after seeing this film it's a little easier to believe that there might be some truth behind it after all.It is now 5AM, and I am already yearning back into the film's world, back into the lives of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. I am in love all over again.",10,2,6,27 February 2007
