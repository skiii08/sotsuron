The Blair Witch Project," A masterpiece. The whole movie is as you would've found it if they truly went missing
","A masterpiece, to put it simply, and one of the most influential and iconic horror movies of all time. It's a disturbing film without any violence or any monsters.The naturalism of the actors is unrivaled. It's impossible to overstate how compelling each performance is. Our main character is a joy to behold in every scene, with the perfect tone and expression to accompany every word of dialog. Every minute she wasn't in frame speaking into the camera was a minute I wished she were. I could not imagine a better performance.The recurring sense of 'dread' as each night falls, and the slow escalation of the threat, followed by the sudden release of tension at dawn, puts the viewer through an ordeal that you share with the characters. The film perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. The panic, the anxiety, and how easy it is to get turned around. On one of the final nights as the sun is setting, you can hear the desperation in Heather's voice as they know what's coming and are powerless to stop it.There couldn't have been a better ending. It's the stuff you don't see that makes this film so scary. Your own imagination is always more terrifying than anything on screen.The movie had perfect timing and excellent marketing. Came out when the internet was still the Wild Wild West. It was pretty difficult to prove or disprove anything quickly and search engines were still pretty primitive. The studio took advantage of this and as a result the movie had a lot of buildup. I dont' think anyone will ever be able to recreate that type of marketing again. If you tried that today you would have blog posts, articles, videos, tweets, tearing every aspect apart.",10,1,3,2 August 2019
City of God," City of God is a clinic of competent, bold film-making satisfaction.
","From beginning to end, City of God is beautiful, pointed, enthusiastic, and adventurous in every category. The cinematography and editing deserve enormous heaps of praise. The writing, acting, and directing come together for a visceral, haunting experience.It is one of the most diverse films I have ever seen. It is an action movie with drugs and guns; it is a romance with a harshly enlightened view on the purest forms of love in a favela; it is a period drama about the heart of Brazil in one of the most eventful periods of human history. Altogether, it is a war film about the chaos of forgotten life. This movie is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,11 July 2019
Call Me by Your Name," A triumph!
","Excellent performances, beautiful photography, great music. The visual storytelling and the visual motifs/metaphors (The fly, the apricots) were all very well done. The characters felt so real to me. But..It just wasn't interesting. I tried engaging with this movie for two hours and it never spoke to me. Which is a shame because everyone seems to have found something truly special speaking to them, and I'm left scratching my head wondering if I missed something or if I'm just broken.",7,2,6,15 July 2019
Paranormal Activity," Fills you with a sense of dread and helplessness
",Regardless of it not being action packed it's extremely good at building tension and a sense of dread throughout. Consistent characters and sublime acting. The demon had a presence that was much stronger than most haunting movies that show you more.,7,1,1,4 August 2019
