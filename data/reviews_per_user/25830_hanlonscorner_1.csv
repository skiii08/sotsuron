It," Understand Your Fears
","IT is amazing!!! Full of suspense and fear. Fear is the main point of what the film is about. When children begin to disappear in the town of Derry, Maine, neighborhood kids band together to square off against the horrible Pennywise, an evil clown whose history of murder and violence dates back for centuries. The kids are a group of bullied kids who come together to form the losers club.I am a huge fan of the original movie IT (1990) and I didn't think the Hollywood industry would be able to pull of a remake of this magnitude but boy was I speechless. This is the one time a remake was able to explain the details of the film such as the famous phrase 'They all float'. I wont give away spoilers but you'll float too once you see this!!There is an important message in the film that I think young people should see, even if it is to give them the life skills to live in today's world. It about fear; what It does to us and how to overcome fear. Its an amazing journey full of adventure; the movie of 2017 without a doubt.",10,11,24,8 September 2017
