The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," the fire that lighted the saga series is lost.
","Watched Twilight breaking dawn. surprisingly i'm not satisfied with the movie.Plot is totally inadequate.There is not enough content for break the movie into 2.so it becomes boring.rated 6. SPOILERS !! SPOILERS !! SPOILERS !! SPOILERS !! SPOILERS !! SPOILERS !! Wedding,beautiful island that they gone for honeymoon.they all dreamy and got my mind.music they use really well and adds a great depth in movie. specially the song Flightless Bird, American Mouth-Iron & Wine when they take vows totally kills it.I was totally carried away by amusement of that great wedding moments but then followed by very poor plot. it has always the indecision that i liked in this movie.not to mention the faith i have in Jacob rather than Edward.Now at last Bella becomes a vampire.I am disappointed about the saga series.I must say director Bill Condon and writers Melissa Rosenberg ruin it for me this this time.I'm not scolding Stephenie Meyer the writer of Twilight novel because novel is far more touching than the movie.she has done a great job.",6,1,5,4 February 2012
