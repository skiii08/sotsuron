Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari v Falling asleep
","I don't what to say - it just wasn't for me. If you're not into racing or cars or the 'american dream' I think this is probably a movie to miss. For me, it was already not my style, but on top of that it felt like a film that had recycled the plot and characters of every other sports movie and re-skinned it.Both Bale and Damon's accents were laid on thicker than 'fur on a frog'. Did I do that right? Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.Another issue is that at least in other sports films there's a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford's bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship? That theme did not seem apart until its final scene - leaving it as a last ditch effort to move and connect the audience to the characters. At the very least we could say it celebrated Ken Miles for his achievements in the racing world - so kudos to that.",5,7,17,9 December 2019
Knives Out," The sharpest murder-mystery of the decade.
","Breaths new life into the classic Who-dunnit we know and love. The audience is taken on a literal twist of a plot where the conventional order we experience mysteries is flipped inside out in a way that is both deeply original and yet still pays homage to the classics that inspire it. A story blended with both comedy and suspense in a well-balanced cocktail of fun. If you'd like you could go deeper and also find some political undertones - but those were happily lost on me and the story was fun enough to be left well alone from the upper-class commentary. Seems to rush its final act and some of the details don't fully make sense to me, but still left satisfied. 8.2 / 10",8,1,4,6 December 2019
The Irishman," Alternate titles include 'The Grandfather' or 'Oldfellas'
","A new addition to the new retirement-age mob film genre - a niche to be sure. While the film is often hard to take seriously we are lucky that it doesn't try to be taken as such. It takes every opportunity to lighten its source material with subtle but gripping comedy. The rotating door of italian mob-men and their continious conniving plots were often lost on me - strange that a hulking 3 and a half hour film can still seem to rush so many elements and yet seem to drag on for others.A very large feat of visual magic was taken on in order to tell the story of younger Sheehan and Bufalino - a feat that in my (WOAH those are startlingly blue) eyes went largely KAPOOT. I couldn't tell how old they were supposed to be because De Niro didn't act the age and it looked like the effects just painted over all their facial wrinkles to leave a weirdly simulated 'young face'. I can recall a scene where De Niro was beating a grocer and it was probably the gentlest, feeblest beating I've seen depicted. The film picks up at the entrance of Hoffa (Pacino), who brings a lightness but also a weight to the film that it lacks in its earlier half. The friendship between Hoffa and Sheeran feel at the films core - which makes the ending that much more devastating. The audience will be left both betrayed and shocked - especially since the film lacks any deep emotional gravity preceding its conclusion. The most original and funny mafia movie to grace the screen - even if it is your laptop screen at 1 am. 7.8/10",8,5,9,6 December 2019
