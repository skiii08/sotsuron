The New World," Dumbs Down
","I love the actors, but I don't like the plot. It was very boring, and very very slowwww............. I mean if your into the whole narrative voice in movies the whole way through, well you'll enjoy it, but if you like some kind of actual movement with the actors like them speaking in the movie than consider another movies. Towards the end of the movie, people started yawning, and the movie wasn't even over and people were walking out of the theater. I wish at least that the characters would be the ones talking most of the time, not the narrator. It's more like a history channel movie... Like I said, love the actors, but not this movie.",1,1,10,28 January 2006
