Requiem for a Dream," Unforgettable!
","This is one of those movies, you can´t watch without being unable to get it out of your mind for weeks, for months, maybe for years. It tells the story of mainly four different characters, who are in touch with drug consumption. Each one of them in a different way. It begins so innocent and harmless but the further the story is told, the more dramatically it gets. You see the manifold ways of getting addicted and the momentous fates, that comes with the addiction. The four main characters are in contact with each other, they love each other, but the drug consumption devides them more and more until total isolation. It´s a movie full of hope and power and with an end that is so sad and disturbing, that you won´t forget soon... Very well done!",9,0,1,30 June 2004
