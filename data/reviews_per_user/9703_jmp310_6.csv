Scarface," It's good but not that good
","There were some scenes that I will never forget from 'Scarface' The ending scene in hindsight is so lame that it's funny. And 'Say hello to my little friend' is now one of my favorite lines. This was a good movie, but there are some things said about this movie that I don't think are true1. Greatest gangster movie ever- Give me a break. This movie paled in comparison to 'godfather' that it's not even funny. The end of godfather is probanly the most well done scene I've ever seen in a movie. I don't think this movie was too long however2. Most violent- Yes, it's violent enough that I wouldn't recommend showing a 10 yr old. However, 17 years after it was made, the violence is a little more than what you would see in your common rated R action flick. I am shocked to hear that this movie was originally an X but i guess things weren't just that violent at the time. The chainsaw scene is a little gross and pretty bloody although they don't show anything else besides the blood spilling out. There are a couple other murders that are a little disgusting3. Great acting- Al Pacino was very good in the role that you don't even recognize him. However, he is such a good actor that I wouldn't rate this among his better films and he rightfully did not get nominated for an academy award. I thought the other acting was mediocre at best. Michelle Pfifer was very unmemorable in her first major role as a super bitch and Robbert Loggia as an Italian, give me a break.Sometime, I would recommend you see this movie because although it is not as powerful in today's times. it still is a little powerful. Plus, there is still probably more cursing than anything i've seen maybe outside 'goodfellas' and 'glengarry glen Ross'. But don't make the mistake of expecting a lot out of 'Scarface' because you will come out dissapointed. **.5 stars",7,0,0,14 August 2000
American Beauty," Brilliant
","American Beauty  **** First-time director Sam Mendez strikes gold with this brillaintly written and phenomenally acted movie about the horrors of everyday suburban families. Kevin Spacey deserves his Oscar in the title role of Lester Burnham, while Annete Benning, Thora Birch, Mena Suarvi, and Chris Cooper add great support. Mendez's direction is flawless, creating a scary, dark, and sometimes hysterically funny movie, which is one of the best of it's decade",Null,0,0,25 March 2002
Black Hawk Down," A near great film for Ridley Scott
","Black Hawk Down   ***1/2 Ridley Scott, who earlier this year made 'Hannibal(which i seemed to be the only person to like,) creates an unapologetic, brutal view of war in 'Black Hawk Down', which profiles the Battle of Mogiashanu. Scott thankfully trades in the usual war cliches for a more journalistic, you are there feel. A little tighter ending and a little more charecterasation would have put this in the 'A list' of war films, but BHD still creates a lot of vibrant, powerful, and unforgettable scenes in it's 150 minute running time",Null,0,0,24 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," A biopoic done right
","A Beautiful Mind **** Ron Howard has finally found his masterpiece in 'A beautiful Mind,' a heartbreaking, inspirational, and sometimes surprising film about John Nash, a Noble Prize mathematician with a severe case o schizophrenia. Russell Crowe gives a brilliant performance in the title role, and Jennifer Connely and the always-great Ed Harris turn in first rate turns as well. But the real star is Howard, who actually takes us inside the mind of Nash and makes sure to keep us involved, something rarely done in these type of films",Null,0,1,24 March 2002
Any Given Sunday," Realistic look at football, Stone's best since JFK
","'Any Given Sunday' is not a real pleasant movie to watch. What you are seeing is a real life adaptation of how athletes changed from players who played for the love of the game into a bunch of greedy spoiled a******s. If you put this point aside, you will really like the movie.The cinematography is unbelievable, maybe the best I've ever seen. It's nowhere near as good on video, but it still captures you into the middle of the action pretty well. The acting is also terrific. If anyone else besides Al Pacino was the coach, it would no doubt be their best role ever. However, this may not even be in Pacino's top 5 but he was still very good. Cameron Diaz is great as the super bitch owner, and Jamie Foxx was suprizingly good as Willie 'Steamin' Beamon. Dennis Quaid, LL Cool J, Lawrence Taylor, and Lauren Holly turned in strong supporting performances just to name a few.The video version is the director's cut. There are 2 scenes added. One is some sex in a party, it's not that graphic, just unnecesary. The other scene is maybe the grossest scene you will ever see in a movie and undoubtedly was cut to get an R. In the original movie during the last game, you see a linebacker on the opposing team screaming on the sideline with blood on his face and then they go back to the game. In the video, you see why he's screaming.Not one of the best movies ever, but it did a great job of what it was trying to do. ***.5 stars",7,0,0,3 September 2000
The Replacements," Suprizingly Funny
","'The Replacemts' turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Although most of it is stuff we've seen a million times before, it still makes you howl and there is alos a little bit of a serious overtone to it. Although it is a good cast, the acting isnt great. Gene Hackman was good in his role as the coach, but they didn't need him or Al Pacino for that role. Same with keanu Reeves as the quarterback. However, there was some good chemistry between the charecters. One other good thing about this movie is it is an example of a true PG-13 rated film, meaning it's not objectional enough to be an R but kids under 13 shouldn't see it unless they are very mature. There are some pretty racy jokes in it. Although a predictible and unoriginal movie, it was still a lot funnier and a lot better than I expected. *** stars(out of 4)",Null,0,1,14 August 2000
