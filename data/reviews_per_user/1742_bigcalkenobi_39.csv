Despicable Me 2," e. There's little substance underneath the generic plot and minion skits, but that doesn't keep it from being a fun and enjoyable family outing to the movies
","Despicable Me was one of the biggest surprises out of Universal in 2010 with its heartfelt story,clever twist on portraying an anti-hero, and army of unpredictably amusing minions. The first film may have lacked depth, but it certainly didn't miss a beat when it came to tugging on the heartstrings. Not only did it bring in over half a billion dollars, but it also managed to be something special enough to audiences to really develop a fan base. Despicable Me 2 is looking to create the same fresh and heartfelt story as the original, but is this really the type of movie that warrants a sequel?Read my full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-sH",6,2,7,3 July 2013
The Avengers," The Avengers proves to be everything the nerd and mainstream audiences wanted, and maybe became a little bit more.
","This is is it. This is the movie fanboys have been hyping ever since we got a glimpse at Nick Fury at the end of Iron Man. The Avenger's is Marvel's very ambitious attempt to bring their A-listers(at least the ones they possess the rights to) all into one movie where they team up to fight evil. To accomplish this momentous task, Marvel brought in Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, Serenity) to both co-write and direct this film of sky high expectations. Whedon, whom has proved himself to be excellent with ensemble casts, has not directed a theatrical film since 2005′s Serinity which may have left fans scratching their heads when he was announced. On top of the wildcard director, the film also has to bring in all of the stars from the past Marvel Cinematic Universe films into one movie without taking away from the other casts members. As cool as the epic team-up sounds on paper, is it really possible to bring all of these elements into one movie together under one vision?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-aG",10,3,8,12 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good entertainment but not a great movie. Still worth a watch
","After a couple of overly complicated and convoluted sequels Pirates of the Caribbean returns to a more straight forward storyline with a new director,Rob Marshall of Chicago and Nine fame, and an almost entirely new cast. Only Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, and Kevin McNally return from past films to reprise their roles. While I have to say that I've enjoyed all of the films so far Dead Man's Chest and At World's End both felt entirely too long, convoluted, and overall full of pointless subplots that didn't go anywhere. On Stranger Tides is a remedy to this as it goes back to some of the principles of the first film as Jack Sparrow rushes to find the fountain of youth before the Spanish and British navies can get to it first. On Stranger Tides also introduces us to an almost entirely new cast made up of Ian McShane, Penelope Cruz, and Sam Clafflin who play Blackbeard 'the pirate all pirates fear', Angelica; Sparrow's new love interest, and Phillip Swift; a missionary who falls in love with a mermaid. While this certainly looks like a new start,the film has actually been down sized in scope and size in comparison to the last 2 films. Is this a bad thing? Are the Pirates worthy to sail for another sequel or has the series finally gone overboard?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/pirates-if-the- caribbean-on-stranger-tides-review/",7,0,1,22 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Men in Black 3 does manage to do some things right, but fails to really do anything special enough to leave an impression that this franchise is worth reviving.
","What would a sequel to Men in Black look like? This is certainly a question we wish we wouldn't have asked when the 2002 sequel was released with a flat story, an unnecessary revisit to characters whose story arcs were wrapped up, and an overall hit or miss version of the great comedy from the first film. It's been ten years since the underwhelming sequel hit theaters and fifteen since the original. The new questions are does this series deserve to be brought back? Is it something that people really want? Most of all; can a third movie to a fifteen year old franchise that was never really that special make the series relevant? Whether we want the answers to these questions or not; Men in Black is back in this third installment that reunites director Barry Sonnenfeld with Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K and Will Smith as Agent J to fight yet another alien threat to earth.Read the Rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-aV",5,2,7,3 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Great Performances, great writing, and a better story make this worth the watch
","In 2009 Sherlock Holmes became a break out hit making over half a billion dollars and successfully brought the brand into the mainstream blockbuster film community making both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson both known to the average film goer and relevant to modern cinema. While the movie's story and concept themselves didn't boast anything new or above average, the movie did boast lightning in a bottle chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the leads as well as the very cool and stylized take on late 19th century England from director Guy Ritchie. Because of the chemistry and the style Sherlock Holmes was able to be successful with audiences as well as critics which now brings us to the inevitable sequel A Game of Shadows. While Shadows doesn't have as much to prove as its predecessor it certainly had a whole new set of problems to deal with; the biggest being just another sequel that tries so hard to recapture the original, but ultimately failing like so many other sequels out there. The movie does return with the entire original cast and the marvelous Jared Harris joins the cast as Holm's greatest foe Prof. Simon Moriarty. Is this sequel worth a look or is doe it join the sea of forgettable sequels that just can't live up to the originals?Read the rest here: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-70",8,1,6,18 December 2011
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 will deliver in every way you would expect it to, but do not hope for any surprises or new ideas that will push the genre forward
","Tony Stark has come a long way since his early days as a B-lister superhero. Ten years ago any comic book fan or film producer would have laughed at the notion of such a lesser known hero developing not one, not two, but three box office hits. That said, and here we are in 2013 with Iron Man's fourth outing and third solo picture where his popularity has never been higher. While Iron Man 2 was no doubt a stumble, the character still bounced back stronger than ever in The Avengers. We all know Robert Downey Jr. still knows how to deliver a crowd pleasing performance, but is there enough momentum left in the character to give us an exceptional third outing or does Iron Man 3 leave us with the same taste of disappointment that is found in most films ending in 3?Read Full Review Here: wp.me/p1tyJd-qk",7,0,1,16 May 2013
Argo," Argo is a rare movie that caters to a more adult audience because of its sophistication, tone, and intense story it's trying to tell
","Ben Affleck may be a bit polarizing when it comes to his acting career, but his directing career up to this point has been excellent with two very outstanding films The Town and Gone Baby Gone both receiving numerous awards and critical acclaim as well as moderate box office success. His latest film Argo attempts to give his directing career more genre diversity as it is a historical thriller that covers the recently declassified events that took place during Iranian Hostage Crisis that begins in 1979. Can Affleck successfully take on this historical event and do it justice or should he stick to more personal character dramas?Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-j3",9,0,1,17 October 2012
Rise of the Guardians," Rise of the Guardians is some great family entertainment that will get everyone pumped for the upcoming holiday season
","It's almost Christmas time and with each new season comes its own slew of Christmas themed movies. Some years we're treated to a retelling of the classics like A Christmas Carol, Elf, or Home Alone while other years we're tortured by painfully awful cash-ins like Fred Claus and Deck the Halls. This year the Christmas movie season is kicked off with the Dreamworks animated Rise of the Guardians, a movie that not only touches on Christmas, but also covers other mythical holiday icons such as the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and Jack Frost. Do we have a modern classic on our hands with Rise of the Guardians, or is this just another holiday flick going through the motions?Read Full Review:wp.me/p1tyJd-kH",Null,2,8,23 November 2012
Underworld Awakening," Underworld Awakening is an aimless sequel filled with flat characters, a very uninspired story, a cool look, and an average at best direction.
","When I was much younger I used to watch quite a bit of the sci-fi channel. I went through a phase where that was what I watched for many hours on weekends during the B-movie movie marathons. Among the movies I used to watch, the first and second Underworld movies were among them. Underworld has been a series that I have been pretty much apathetic of throughout the years, but when I heard a new one was coming out I for some reason became interested. I decided to go back and watch all three of the other movies, and when I was finished I discovered that the movies really did fit right in on the sci-fi channel. They may have been a step or two better than sci-fi original movies, but they certainly didn't lend themselves to anything remotely exceptional even in the arena of entertainment. While I did find them mildly entertaining, I was still did not see anything remotely better than run of the mill about them. They weren't B-movies, but they certainly weren't good either. This directly relates to the expectations I had for the new Underworld in which I was simply hoping for some decent vampire vs. werewolf entertainment. Does the new Underworld break the mold entertain in new and exciting ways, or does it fall in line with its mediocre at best predecessors?Read the Rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-8p",3,6,13,26 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: The First Avenger is a really good old fashioned adventure movie that will certainly entertain audiences and please fanboys
","Sigh. Another superhero movie this summer? This will have been the fourth major superhero movie this summer and by this point most of us are tired of it. The only shot Captain America has this summer is doing something different than its other competition by giving us an experience we haven't seen this summer. Luckily Captain America does just that. The movie is a period film set in the 1940s that also tries to feel like the serials that were popular at the time. The movie has a very old school feel to it which separates it from its competition, but can its retro style really make it one of the better films of the summer?Check out the rest at http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com",8,5,13,27 July 2011
Oblivion," Oblivion is a visual feast for the eyes with a great lead and some truly admirable ambition, but at the end of the day is left feeling hollow and characterless.
","Joseph Kosinski hit it big with Oblivion. Having only directed Tron Legacy(which was only a moderate success) ,he was able to get $120 million to write/direct/produce his pet project. This is a huge privilege that some directors spend decades trying to obtain, but Kosinksi did it in his second outing. And not only that, but he also got some heavy hitting actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman on board to further convince us that this should be a one of a kind movie from the mind of a single person(a rarity in Hollywood). Based on everything we've seen, the movie looks beautiful, but has also played things pretty close to the chest in terms of story. Does Kosinski produce an incredible story that lives up to his creative ambition, or does this sci-fi miss the creativity and land in the realm of obscurity?Read the full review: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/oblivion-review/",6,0,1,19 April 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel delivers an origin story that feels both new and old with it's fresh take on the aging premise.
","Superman has always been evolving decade to decade as he has adapted to whatever society has most needed him to become. Despite the fact that he is easily the most iconic superhero in history, it seems he has fallen out of the public eye in the last decade because he simply hasn't had a movie that nails exactly why we should care about him. By this point the most famous superheroes have made their big screen ventures and sadly 2005′s 'Superman Returns' failed to capture the imagination or leave much of an impact on audiences. Just when things began looking bleak for the boy scout, 'The Dark Knight' director Christopher Nolan was brought on as producer to reinvent the character in ways we've never seen before. Does Man of Steel bring Superman to a new generation with brilliance, or is this just the latest outing in a string of lukewarm attempts to bring back the last son of Krypton?Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-rV",9,4,8,15 June 2013
Hugo," Hugo is a really unique and exceptional film. One of 2011's best
","Martin Scorsese is a legendary filmmaker that has given audiences many terrific films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York and The Departed and has more recently given audiences the mind-bending thriller Shutter Island. The interesting thing about the director is that his films have traditionally been very violent, vulgar, and overall more adult in their nature and content. Needless to say, when I heard that Scorsese was doing a family friendly film(in 3D no less) I was very intrigued to see how he would handle this new territory. Does Scorsese bring his mastery of film making to his unexplored territory in genre, or does Scorsese lack the inner child and imagination to make this story of an orphan boy work?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-99",9,3,8,5 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a terrific mystery-thriller and one of this year's best dramas
","When it was announced that David Fincher would be re-adapting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo there was a split in the fan base of both the book and the 2009 Swedish film directed by Niels Arden Oplev. While it was a fairly controversial move, the fans began to become more and more interested as Daniel Craig was cast as Mikael Blomkvist and the lesser known Rooney Mara was cast as Lisbeth Salander. Ever since the promotion of the film ramped up a few months ago fans have become anxious to see if this film can live up to both the book and the original film. Does Fincher bring an interesting dynamic to the international best seller or is Hollywood just taking advantage of the loyal fan base and cashing a check?Read the full review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-7s",9,3,8,1 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," While treading familiar territory, The Amazing Spiderman manages to bring a fresh and more rounded take on the origin story of Spiderman
",In 2002 Sam Raimi launched the first Spiderman movie which along with 2000′s X-men pioneered the modern superhero genre. It has been 10 years since then and 5 years since the mostly disappointing Spiderman 3 hit theaters in 2007. In the years since 2007 The Dark Knight was released and Marvel launched a fleshed out multi-film universe; both of which have greatly influenced what is do-able in the genre. Sony is now rebooting the franchise by bringing in a new cast and director Marc Webb to put his own spin on the origin story of Peter Parker as Spiderman. Can this new take on Spiderman bring enough new things to the table to leave an impact or is this movie simply going through the motions?Read the full review here: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-cO,8,0,3,5 July 2012
Now You See Me," If you're looking for a nice Sunday afternoon Matinée to relax the mind, you can't go wrong with the fun yet cheap trick of 'Now You See Me'
","It's a rare treat these days that we get a new property to release a movie right in the heat of summer blockbuster season which is usually limited to huge comic book movies, comedies, and other franchise driven films. 'Now You See Me' is making up for its lack of entitlement with an exciting cast made up of some of the best young actors in the business who are thrown into the mix as street magicians with hearts of gold. It's a rich concept of magic meets 'Ocean's Eleven' that certainly raises a brow or two, but does this movie bring the real magic or is it just made up of mirrors and cheap parlor tricks?Read full review here: wp.me/p1tyJd-rC",6,0,8,2 June 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fun return to Middle Earth that is damaged by a drawn out plot and some overused CGI aesthetic choices
","The making of the Hobbit is a story to tell in its own right with film rights being tossed around in legal battles for years before the MGM finally obtained everything it needed to get the production moving. Sadly MGM was in a bit of a financial bind and went bankrupt which held things up for more than a couple of years. During this financial standstill, Peter Jackson was brought into produce and was eventually moved in to direct after Guillermo del Toro had to leave because of the uncertain future of the project. Finally, the first part of the prelude to Lord of The Rings has arrived in the form of An Unexpected Journey. Has the decade long wait been worth it or is the cinematic Middle Earth best left to the history books?Read full Review: wp.me/p1tyJd-lf",8,7,17,17 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," It's the best best action film of the year because of its clean, smooth, and intense action, cast of likable and memorable characters, and excellent direction
","Mission Impossible returns yet again with another intense and action packed adventure for Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) with his new team made up of the returning Benji(Simon Pegg) and newcomers Jane(Paula Patton) and Brandt(Jeremy Renner). With Tom Cruise beginning to show his age and Brad Bird(The Incredibles, Ratatouille) stepping in to direct his first live action film; it is a somewhat relevant question to ask if this series really has any juice left in it with this latest installment.

Drive," This is a movie that film buff and really old school(pre-Die Hard) action fans will enjoy
","The title of Drive may be a bit misleading as to what this film is actually about but this movie is non the less a very interesting take on car chasing in a world with Fast Fives and Transforming vehicles. The movie is essentially an indie action movie brought to us from the director of Bronson starring Ryan Gosling. The premise is centered on the unnamed character who is referred to as Driver who (as his title hints) drives stunt cars by day and drives criminals around by night. The premise sounds fairly interesting, but can it really survive as an indie action movie in a world that loves to see explosions and over the top car chases?Check out the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-5q",Null,0,1,5 October 2011
Brave," Brave is an enjoyable animated movie that still manages to have some touching moments, but in the end never reaches the depths of Pixar's exceptional potential
",Last year Pixar proved that it was not invincible with the release of Cars 2. This year Pixar is making another less risky film that delves into the world of fairy tales that they have generally stayed away from. The movie features Pixar's first lead lady both on the screen and behind with the scenes with the character of Merinda and co-director Brenda Chapman. While the premise of setting a fairy tale in the Scottish kingdoms is certainly an intriguing one; is it different enough the separate this film from Disney's other princess tales(particularly a stylistically similar Tangled)? Did Pixar make a comeback or have they fallen into slump after their excellent 15 year run?Read the Rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-c8,8,7,14,23 June 2012
Elysium," Elysium is smart, creative, and pays very close attention to the details of the reality it has crafted.
","Neill Blomkamp is still a bit of a rookie in the film industry despite delivering 2009's smash hit 'District 9'. Now that it has been a few years and he's parted ways with his big time collaborator Peter Jackson, Blomkamp is carving out his own path in Hollywood by making another piece of original sci-fi in the form of this summer's bookend blockbuster, 'Elysium'.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The movie does nothing to raise the bar over past entries in the series and seems content with its mediocre at very best delivery.
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 starts where the last movie leaves off with Bella(Kristen Stewart) having to adapt to her new vampire abilities as well as become acquainted with her half vampire/human daughter Renessmee(no her name never sounds natural even after 2 movies). It does not take long before Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson) and Bella realize that Jacob(Taylor Lautner) has imprinted their daughter and the issue is immediately(an a little too quickly) dealt with. After a few weeks of living in peace, another vampire, Irina, sees Renessmee and mistakes her for an immortal child( a sort of uncontrollable infant vampire). Irina immediately goes to the Volturi led by Aro(Michael Sheen) and misinforms him of the threat the Cullen child poses to the vampiric race. The Cullens find out that the Volturi are coming and attempt to gather as many allies as they can to stand by Renessmee. The Cullens scour the globe to find as many friends as they can as the Volturi march to destroy everything Bella knows and loves.Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-ki",3,13,35,16 November 2012
Super 8," A great piece of nostalgia that reminds viewers where modern sci-fi came from
","Super 8 takes us back to a style of film making that has been long forgotten. Things like camera flare, charming child characters, camera glare, and certain types of camera tricks have been done away with in the modern film making era. This movie goes back to the fundamental style of film making in the 1970s and 80s that inspired J.J. Abrams to become a film maker. Abrams claimed that this film was heavily inspired by the Spielberg sci-fi movies he grew up on and to ensure that this style is felt Spielberg himself produces the movie. The other thing about this movie that has peaked the interest of film goers is the secrecy and mystery surrounding the film. Abrams has always had a habit of keeping his projects under wraps because he wants the audience to be surprised whenever they see the film. This film has held a lot of promise for a lot of different people due to the talent on the project and the the exciting mystery surrounding Super 8. Can Super 8 meet these expectations or will the film fall flat and deliver an unmemorable; unoriginal experience for audiences?Check out the rest of my review on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/super-8-review/",8,3,8,13 June 2011
Sinister," Sinister has its flaws, but to say that this movie is not terrifying or unnerving at times would be absolute denial
","The horror genre more than probably any genre has been abused by cash-ins, remakes and flat out inexcusably low quality production. It's Halloween season which means that the genre is firing on all cylinders to deliver its biggest cash grabs yet with what are usually considered the year's biggest horror movies. This year is no different as we have our big horror sequel of the year Paranormal Activity 4 and Silent Hill Revelation which is a follow-up to 2006′s video game adaption.Sinister appears to be a movie that hearkens itself more to the idea of the first Saw or Insidious in the sense that it is trying to make something low key and more creative than a studio horror movie. Does Sinister provide any unique scares or is this yet another cash grab for studios trying to cater to the Halloween season?Read Full Review: wp.me/p1tyJd-iD",8,1,4,13 October 2012
Les Misérables," The movie may have a few bumps and scratches here and there, but the beauty of what is being conveyed here is so much greater than any misstep the adaption may have taken.
","Victor Hugo's classic story of Jean Valjean seeking redemption against his pursuer Javert in the midst of a revolution is a powerful one that has already been adapted to film and the stage many times over the last fifty years. Academy Award winning director Tom Hooper is taking his crack at bringing the highly successful musical adaption to the big screen using some innovative and larger than life techniques. Does this movie capture the essence of the emotionally charged literary classic or is this a musical better left for the stage?Les Miserables opens in 1815 France with an epic musical number that introduces prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) as he is released from prison with parole by the prison warden Javert(Russell Crowe). After leaving the prison Valjean finds his way to a convent where a priest offers him food and water. Valjean steals all the valuables he can get his hands on before he runs away, but is captured by the local authorities. The priest plays along with Valjean's story about where he got the gold and silver items which later brings Valjean to an epiphany that will lead to him becoming a new person.

In Time," In Time has a great concept and a strong cast, but the weak and overly compressed script just flat out keeps this movie from being anything better than below average.
","In Time is another tale in producer/writer/director Andrew Niccol's string of high concept but low key sci-fi films(Gattaca, The Truman Show). His films have not failed to do some interesting things in the past, and In Time appears to have a similar feel to it. The movie has a cool concept as well as young star studded cast made up of Justin Timberlake,Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. The concept is essentially a world in which time is the currency and starting at age 20 everybody has one year to spend, sell, invest, gamble etc. With a director who has proved himself, a talented young cast, and a concept that seems intriguing in the least, can In Time make an impact that will last?Read the Rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-9n",4,0,1,15 March 2012
Thor," Thor offers up a good adaption and a good, but not great movie
","Thor is Marvel's next film in their ongoing Marvel film Universe that so far consists of Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Incredible Hulk. What makes Thor different is that more than half of the movie doesn't even take place on earth, but in Asgard or on one of the other planes. Along with that Thor has a young cast(lead by Chris Hemsworth; Tom Hiddleston)and director(Kenneth Branagh) who has made his career out of doing Shakespearean films. Thor also has the task of introducing the audience to Asgard; a world that is a combination of magic and technology. Can Thor overcome all of these shortcomings and make Thor yet another building block to the Marvel Avengers universe or will it fall flat and give audiences another lukewarm movie to start the summer (looking at you Iron Man 2)?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/thor-review/",8,0,2,13 May 2011
Prometheus," Prometheus is certainly the return to a classic form of science-fiction that has nearly been forgotten in an age of high concept, low substance sci-fi.
","Prometheus is Ridley Scott's return to science fiction over thirty years after he created the two very influential classics Alien and Blade Runner. Prometheus is the quasi-non-sequel/prequel/reboot(?) of the Alien Franchise that actually ties very loosely to the actual classic. The film has been highly anticipated by fans of the genre because of Ridley Scott, the high class cast, and the overall feel of classic sci- fi that the film presents. While the film has been highly anticipated; a number of fans have been worried about the always polarizing pick of Damon Lindelof(Lost, Star Trek) as the writer as well as the general feeling that this movie was forced into existence by studios as opposed to organically created. Can Prometheus deliver a new and intelligent take on classic science fiction or is this film just another way to cash in on Alien fan expectations?Read the Rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-bv",9,2,10,11 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Great Characters; Great Actors= Excellent Film
",X-men First Class brings the X-men franchise back into the spotlight after two pretty lackluster X-films. First Class goes back to the very beginning of the story of Professor X and Magneto showing us their journey to friendship and destruction. The movie is technically a prequel but it more or less plays like a reboot so that it is very accessible to new viewers but still has several nods to the previous films that will keep fans interested. The movie brings back Bryan Singer(who directed the great X-men and terrific X2) as a producer and brings in Matthew Vaughn(of Kick-Ass and Stardust fame) as the director. This film looks to be the promising comeback for the series that has had a couple of weak entries in the past. Is this possible? After watching the painful X3 and the mixed bag that was X-men Origins:Wolverine the franchise is getting sort of old. Can X-men First Class re-energize this tired franchise or should we pray that this team never makes a comeback?Want to read more?

The Dark Knight Rises," The movie is a dark, epic, and emotional ending to this exceptional film trilogy.
","The Dark Knight Rises is the end of director Christopher Nolan's grand trilogy that began with Bruce Wayne's journey into darkness as he learned the difference between fighting for vengeance and fighting for justice. He took down the city's biggest crime lord while simultaneously raising the bar for what it takes to commit crime in Gotham. The Dark Knight brought Wayne's character to the next level as he faced off with the Joker, a man who really didn't want anything but Gotham's corruption and destruction. Batman had to look inward and see how far he would have to go to stop monsters like the Joker. The end of The Dark Knight left our hero broken as he had to make some painful compromises that would cost the city and all the characters involved to see that the Joker's reign of terror was not successful. In many ways The Dark Knight Rises presents the end of Bruce Wayne's journey as Batman as he finally comes to understand exactly what it will take to save to dark and corrupt city of Gotham.

Anderson has a very distinct style with his dry(but not British dry) humor, quirky characters, and very stylized settings. Moonrise Kingdom is his latest film which he takes on a childhood romance set in the 1960s on an island somewhere in New England.

Looper," Looper is one of the most creative pieces of storytelling I've seen in a while because of its very smart and clever concept and character driven core
","Looper begins by introducing us to Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a looper, a man who kills people sent back in time from 30 years in the future. In the future the mob has a hard time killing people so they utilize the outlawed method of time travel to cover their tracks by sending their victims back in time before they exist. Loopers get to live life large as they are paid handsomely and don't have to worry about the interference of the law as they are killing people who do not technically exist. The catch is that loopers will eventually 'close their loop' by killing older versions of themselves once the mob of the future decides that they are no longer of use to them. Things start to become to get a lot more real for Joe when his friend and fellow looper Seth(Paul Dano) lets his older self get away. Joe tries to cover for Seth by hiding him, but eventually Joe's boss Abe(Jeff Daniels) is able to talk him down and convinces Joe to turn Seth over. Not long after this Joe's older self(Bruce Willis) appears as one of his targets without a hood on which causes Joe to hesitate. Old Joe gets away, but the two eventually reunite in a diner they are both familiar with. In what is possibly one of the strongest scenes in the entire movie, the two confront each other as old Joe tries to convince young Joe to skip town and leave him to work. Eventually the two both lay their cards on the table and a really cool fight ensues. Once the two separate the movie slows down as the movie begins setting up for some truly tough and thought provoking moral dilemmas that will challenge both versions of Joe.Read the full review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-hu",10,3,19,30 September 2012
50_50," 50/50 is a very interesting mix of ideas that turns out much better than would be expected
","50/50 was a movie I had heard some great buzz about earlier this year, but due to a busy schedule and a still growing list of things to see I was unable to see it while in theaters. Now that the movie has hit home video I was finally able to catch this low key dramedy starring one of my favorite young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Inception, 500 Days of Summer). The premise of the movie certainly sounds dark and depressing as the movie is essentially about a man as he comes to terms that he will die because of spinal cancer. The premise may be sad, but the writers and director Jonathan Levine decide to try and give this very sad story a comedic spin. Does 50/50 take this clash of genre and story and make it something innovative and interesting, or are comedy and impending death better left separate?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-8y",9,0,0,11 February 2012
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas is a movie that is able to pull six story lines together and make them play off each other in a way that actually reveals a greater story about mankind
","The Wachowskis have built a career on highly ambitious films such as The Matrix and V for Vendetta, and Cloud Atlas looks to be their biggest undertaking yet as they partner with director Tom Tykwer to tell a story that cover six story lines taking place over thousands of years and working with an ensemble cast filled with more than twelve cast members. Suddenly the task in front of the three writers seems far bigger in scope than any movie in the last quarter of a century at the least. Can this trio of writers/directors manage to pull off such a feat or is Cloud Atlas just a pretentious train wreck created by film makers who are in over their heads?Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-jA",9,5,13,29 October 2012
Fast Five," Fast Five shows that the series still has some NOS left in the engine
","The Fast and the Furious series returns for its fifth installment and largest cast to date. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to do another job this time on the run from the FBI(led by Dwayne Johnson as DSS agent Hobbs) and the Rio De Janeiro mafia. To pull off the 'one last job' they assemble a team of professionals(all from previous films) including Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto,Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker,Sung Kang as Han Lue, and Matt Schulze as Vince. The movie is supposed to be filled with plenty of action involving cars, explosion, and woman, but can the all-star cast of actors make this an entertaining action movie or should the Fast and Furious series ended 2 sequels ago?Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/fast-five-review/",8,0,2,7 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," In the world of transformer all we ask is that we get a story that makes enough sense to get giant robots to fight each other and to that demand the movie fits the bill.
","The Transformers films have had a long problematic journey ever since the decent and promising original came out in 2007. The original may not have been the greatest or most intelligent movie, but it was fun to watch and looked like a hopeful start to a new series of films. In 2009 Revenge of the Fallen was released to the world and has since become the definition of dumb bad movie as it was filled with mindless action all tied loosely together by an extremely weak plot. As much promise as it held it was not able to deliver what audiences were craving. For many film goers it seems that Dark of the Moon has the huge task of not only being entertaining but also redeeming the terrible second movie. Michael Bay himself apologized for the failures of the Revenge of the Fallen and promised a better third movie. With Dark of the Moon it seems that Bay is aiming for a darker film that will finally wrap up the transformers trilogy which does give audiences hope for an emotionally satisfying ending. So the big question on everyone's mind is can Michael Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger pull off a dark, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying end to this usually dumb but still fun film trilogy?Check out the rest: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com",6,3,8,2 July 2011
The Great Gatsby," Visually energetic sets and an incredible soundtrack bring this rendition of The Great Gatsby and the roaring twenties to life in a whole new way
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has seen many attempts at the big screen throughout the decades including an ambitious attempt in 1974 that was penned by Francis Ford Coppola and starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Sadly no cast, writers, or even most talented of directors have quite been able to crack THE 'American Novel'. Hollywood's latest attempt has brought the reputable Baz Luhrmann onto the scene with his signature visuals and always innovative use of pop music and musical score. Do we have a movie that finally captures Fitzgerald's brilliance and sophistication or is this another movie to chuck into the 'thanks for trying' bin?Read the full review: wp.me/p1tyJd-qq",8,4,9,12 May 2013
Warm Bodies," Once the experience was over I neither loved or despised what I had seen which is ultimately what leads to this movie's greatest failure
","Warm Bodies is Summit Entertainment's latest foray to capture the 'Twi- hard' audience by delivering a new spin on zombies. Much like Twilight, Warm Bodies is throwing out generations worth of mythology in favor of a more melodramatic and romantic take. Is this the beginning of a new era of zombies or does the movie come out cold?Warm Bodies begins in a world that has already been totally overrun by zombies. Months have passed and humanity has walled itself off into pockets of society from the fallen world around it. The movie takes us inside the head of R(Nicholas Hoult), a zombie who misses the days of human connection and life. One day R runs into a group of teenagers who are lead by a girl named Julie(Teresa Palmer). R and several other zombies attack the group and R takes down Julie's boyfriend and begins eating his brains which transfers her boyfriend's memories to R. R begins developing emotions for her and takes her hostage. He takes her back to his living area on old airplane and the two begin to bond as R slowly becomes more and more human as he develops stronger emotions for Julie.Read Full Review here: wp.me/p1tyJd-n6",5,5,32,1 February 2013
