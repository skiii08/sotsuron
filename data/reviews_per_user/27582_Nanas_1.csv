Requiem for a Dream," My life no longer seen through jaded eyes
","I sit hear to type...my heart out.  For I have just seen a movie that breaks all boundaries of...of...reality and yet it is the boundaries of our dreams that have been broken.  I am in tears at this very moment.  This movie has changed my jaded eyes.  It's taken the air I breathe and the floor I stand on.  Please I urge you to see Requiem for a Dream. I can not explain how I feel towards it and the effect it has had, but I know that you will after seeing it.  It's movies like this, with such great cinematography, music, camera work, sets, composition and music that make me know that I want to major in film.",10,1,2,10 July 2001
