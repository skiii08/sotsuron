Black Swan," It's a perfect thrill, and it's about the tragedy of a perfectionist.
","The director of a brilliant film 'Requiem for a Dream', Darren Aronofsky has directed another psycho thriller, 'Black Swan.' The story is about a young woman, Nina (Natalie Portman), who belongs to a New York ballet company, and lives with her mother who is a former ballerina, placing a hope in Nina to become the Swan Queen. When the director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), chooses Nina as the new prima ballerina for their new season, and Swan Lake, Nina starts being driven into a corner by the fear of immeasurable pressure to play a perfect role on the stage and the competition against other ballerinas. As the Swan Queen, Nina is required to play both the White Swan which is innocent and fragile, and the Black Swan which is seductive and has sensual guile. Whilst Thomas likes Nina's talent as the White Swan, he also wants Nina to become a personification challenge while playing the Black Swan, like Lily (Mila Kunis), who is an alternate for the Swan Queen role, and is more of a party girl with a fun attitude. Along with Nina's twisted interactions with her over-parenting mother, Lily as a competitor and considerate friend, Beth who is the former Swan Queen (Winona Ryder) and is being corrupted herself after her replacement in the role of the Swan Queen, and Thomas, Nina suffers between her perfectionism as the Swan Queen and mental obfuscation with a self-destructive face due to the pressure.As the story progresses, the fear and confusion that Nina keeps holding reaches a peak. It seems like she is almost unable to play the Swan role because of her confusion, but at the same time her perfectionism of playing the Swan Queen arouses her emotions and makes her toe loops precise. The fact that no one can help Nina makes her situation worsen. It somehow reminds me of 'Requiem for a Dream', where two young people fall in love and become addicted to drugs, meaning the situation is 'hopeless.''Black Swan' is a great story and a well-depicted sense of pressure and fear. I wonder if this film gives a different impression between men and women, since the emotional feeling towards pressure would be different.",10,1,4,22 June 2012
Requiem for a Dream," Desire make people blindness. And what is all about of feeling of emptiness.
","It was a film with mystic force that made me stared at from the beginning when I started to watch. The story is a quite simple that two stories are running parallel to go for drug and become addicted. Main characters are four actors: Harry (Jared Leto) & his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone earn their living on the drug and theft and Harry is getting to become addicted to drugs with his girlfriend Marion. I like a scene that Harry and Marion are laying down talking their love, which is a very fantastic scene in this film. Although they are talking drugs, there exists something true and pure sense of love between them; he loves his girlfriend the best in the world and make the most of every minutes with their love. This scene would emphasize the last half that drugs break up their relationship.On the other hand, Harry's mother Sara starts dieting since she got an odd call that she can appear on the TV. She tried to diet as much as possible she can. She starts relying on medicine for a diet before long and she often sundown that she appears on the TV or see the fridge shaking due to extreme diet or starving.The ending is in the depth of without the beacon of the hope. It may be easier to guess in this kind of drug story but still suffer from feeling of emptiness and kind of helpless feeling after watched this film. But I'd say this is a great movie at the same time.Ellen Burstyn, being 70-year-old shows an amazing portrayal who make her life change from a common life to become a drug addict and have to be in a drug rehabilitation. Also Jennifer Connelly's play, become a drug addict, quarrel with his boyfriend Harry, have a sex scene for getting drugs, this her devoting work worth seeing.",8,0,0,22 March 2009
Coraline," Fascinating visuals and imaginative film making.
","Coraline is a film released in 2009 and directed by Henry Selick, who is famous for 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993). Coraline uses an animation technique called stop motion (stop frame), where it manipulates photographic subjects such as clay dolls or stuffed animals by moving them one frame at a time, so that it appears as if they move by themselves. The expressions of characters are rich like a human being.The story starts off with an old house where Coraline moves in with her parents. Coraline finds no interest in the house, has no friends, and feels neglected by her parents. While she is looking around the house, she finds a small door blocked by a brick. However, only during her sleep, she goes through the door into another world, where another nice mother and father look after her. The 'other' parents look the same as her real parents and they are way too nice for Caroline, except that they have button eyes. When she realizes what the other mother wants, she tries to escape from other mother's desire in the evil world and fights with the other mother in order to get her back to the reality.Overall, the visuals of the film were imaginative and fascinating, but the story was still one you can predict. And this film is easily compared with 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' which is better. So, I would say, this film is not something you want to watch in a theater.",6,1,1,19 October 2012
Ted," Not bad but Not good.
","Here's my review about a film called, 'Ted.'It was a nice story overall, but it's not as entertaining if you were a parent looking for something to recommend their kids to watch. The story starts off with a boy named John who has no friends and is given a teddy bear on Christmas Eve by his parents. The boy wishes that the stuffed bear could speak like a human, and the next morning, the wish comes true. Over twenty years later, John is 35-year-old and has a girlfriend Lori with whom he has had a four year relationship. The teddy bear is still with him and has grown into a 'guy' who likes parties and smokes weeds. As Ted always causes trouble in John and Lori's relationship, John asks Ted to leave his house and starts his own life.Problem with Ted's new life still drag John in. A bad parent tries to steal Ted to be his child's toy, and the relationship between John and Lori nearly breaks because of Ted, and so on. The story gets a little serious towards the end.As I said, the story itself wasn't so bad. But it's not something I would expect because there was a lot of talk about weed and cocaine at parties, swearing and discrimination. Yet it supports a gay couple, which makes me wonder if the film is trying to gain a wider audience.",5,1,3,11 March 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," So, what was an Imperial Affliction?
","The Fault In Our Stars is a love story about a teenage cancer girl (Hazel Grace) and a survivor of cancer boy with one leg (Augustus Water), and a sequence of drama surrounding their families and friends from a cancer community group. I usually don't read books or watch films in which I could guess the story is going to be a sad ending. I like John Green, a famous author of young adult books, and read a couple of his books including 'Paper Town' and 'An Abundance of Katherines.' I bought this book when I took a few pages at a book store.The story is unexpected in a good way with a sprinkle of the author's jokes and humors through the characters, and it's no just a cancer girl story who has a miserable and painful life with supporting family and friends. One of the things I like about the story is that Hazel and Augustus get to know each other through her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, written by Peter Van Houten. The vague ending of the book has caught her for years to eager to ask questions to the author, and that makes the two teens fly to Amsterdam to meet the author. It's very dramatic and exciting scenes in that a story is created in places from two countries, as well as it makes the handicapped characters overcome the difficulties of traveling for their dream.The whole story about An Imperial Affliction never described, but quotations from the book leave footprint stunningly, seemingly that that casts a meaning of life through conversations between Hazel and Augustus. While the story of An imperial Affliction sounds epic, Van Houten's quirky and socially twisted personality disappoints the two teems. But the trip in Amsterdam builds their bond more tightly, and the story is going to be a moving ending. This is not entirely a sad story, but it involves with sadness and heartbreak towards the characters. After the story ended, I felt it satisfied me as if a missing piece is matched into the story, rather than it left out only sadness.On the same day I finished the book, I watched the film of The Fault In Our Stars. Shailene Woodley portrays Hazel so well, and Peter Van Houten, played by Willem Dafoe, matches the original image.",8,0,0,14 November 2015
The Illusionist," A good film makes you feel better
","When this film was released, I was wondering whether I should watch this film or '21' and after all I chosen this one and watch '21' at a theatre. Therefore, 'The illusionist' kept being left for a while. I think again Edward Norton is a great actor. In the story, Eisenheim, an illusionist, who has to 'play a role' who lost his lover. If you think about it, it sounds strange that an actor plays a role who plays a different role in a story. I can't say too much not to spoil the story...The story is about Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) fell in love in childhood but their love, which they wish to have the everlasting love however, had to be ended due to the differences of realm. Since he saw an illusionist as a child, he was fascinated by the illusion and created various kind of tricks, and acquired as a position of the illusionist. One day, he invited a women from the audience to feel his illusion at his stage. The woman is the lady who he fell in love in childhood. She has a finance at the moment but their love between Sophie and Eisenheim is profound and decide to escape from her state. That night, her fiancé Loepold (Rufus Sewell) killed Sophie due to his anger of Sophie's betrayal when she left the castle. While Eisenheim with his suffer heartache, exhibits an illusion creating visional apparition at his stage...A tricky thing with its features creating an illusion, tricks or magic in a film is kinda cheating in a film, but I think it's not a live performance and everything is acceptable in a film. Any special effect or unrealistic magic could be made in a film. When I saw 'Prestige' (2006) felt the same way; 'That's cheating! cos it's a film'. This time again makes me feel the same way. Other than that, a good movie makes the audience feel great.",7,1,1,24 July 2010
Up," Totally unexpected heart-wrenching story
","Two children met and shared their dream, who inspired by a famous explore Charles Muntz who ended up being accused of fabricating an exotic bird which he claimed he discovered at Paradise Falls. The both of them, Carl and Ellie eventually got married, and their marriage life seemed to be rosy. However, after Ellie died and Carl was left out alone, this elderly widower decided to fulfill his dream that promised with his wife by turning his house into airship using a thousands of helium balloons, and traveled in the air with a young boy, Russell, who followed Carl. The first 10 minutes described how they met, married, and how miserable Carl's life after he lost his wife, which was heart- wrenching.  I didn't expect the story was going to be happened like this because this is meant to be a family movie and it's Pixar's.  Not only have Carl dealt with bereavement of his beloved wife, they have experienced Ellie's infertility.  The boy, Russel, has a complex family background.  Kevin, who they met at Paradise Falls, seemed also be a single mother, assuming Charles Muntz may have killed the father.  Things were going on, which were totally out of expectation, and shocked me.  Is that necessary to have that much traumatic events with the characters?  The rest of the story was more positive impression where the protagonist was struggling with happening he encountered, overcame while he was struggling, and the bad guy should be punished.  The ending wasn't so bad, so overall I was sort of satisfied with the story.",7,0,1,21 September 2016
Inception," Christopher Nolan brought us even more amazing work!!
","Christopher Nolan, a director of Memento (200), The Prestige (2006) and The Dark Knight (2008), keeps surely improving. With hijacking of the 135 street TVs, monitors in electronic retail stores and transportation facilities in 35 prefectural and city governments of Japan, and the collaboration with high-rated hacker drama 'Bloody Monday', Inception is never ran out of the topic before/after the release. This gives us greater-than-expected 'good' confusion in the best way without wilting buzz. It gains unspeakable 9.3 out of 10 rating in IMDb. I wonder with advanced technology and 3D prevalence on the film industry, connoisseur customer is expecting a perfection on every aspect of vision, screenplay, and acting. This film is a great one pursuing 'perfection' in this sense. As for the story, I wouldn't describe more than you know in the preview and the outline that movie sites introduce, 'the most defenseless state - tapping into someone's subconscious and stealing an idea in there - Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a team of sleep expert, steps into the most difficult mission which gets a person into a tricky dream and implant an idea to the person based on Sato's (Ken Watanabe) request.' This is an important outline in helping the story understand. With given this only few information about the story, this could be a great success in a sense that it gives potential audience's expectation to a certain level and still gives them space to chew the story after they watch the film. If you ask me what types of person should watch this film, I would say as well as person who like Christopher Nolan's film such as Memento (2000) and Dark Knight (2008), someone who like a film which describes a spiritual world complexly and realistically such as Matrix (1999), Vanilla Sky (2001), Waking Life (2001), 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Cell (2000). Even though the story depicts a realistic interpretation of the world with seriousness, it is cynical that you would somehow laugh at something in a middle of the story.Christopher Nolan is one of the most attracted directors. Despite the blockbuster and watched film of the 'Dark Knight', he brought us even more amazing work. I expect his future success.",10,2,5,24 July 2010
Monsters University," That's a brilliant old memory about Mike and Sulley
","I love Monsters, Inc. (2001). I think that's a great entertaining film where monsters supply energy from children's scream, and two funny and lovable monsters (Sulley and Mike) meet a two-year-old baby, Boo, and spend invaluable time with her while hiding her from villainous monsters who try to capture her. I liked the story and characters which not only children but adults can enjoy, so when I heard a news about Monster University coming out, I was wondering how the story goes. It's a little bit negative way, because the time will be backward when they are students. I assume that that would be just a university life that can be seen in other universities.I have to say, half of the story would not be far from your imagination; various kinds of monster students, delighted and dedicated students at the majestic monster university and terrifying teachers, study hard, parties, etc. That's kind of an image of university life. Yet, the visual effect is fantastic. You won't get bored seeing those scenes.If you watched Monsters, Inc., you remember that Mike, as an assistant of Sulley at Monsters, Inc., is a hard-working and marketing guy, and Sulley is a big and sport oriented guy. Two guys make a good team, achieving a revolution in the monster's world. You will see where their personality and their teamwork come from.One of the intriguing things in the story is that Sulley suffers setbacks as a monster even though his father is a magnificent monster and holds promise for the future, and Mike doesn't seem to be promised because he is small and not scary. The two opposite monsters happened to work together and struggling to achieve a goal. And Pixar isn't just producing a straightforward story; they trick you to turn out to be a brilliant ending.",8,0,0,14 November 2015
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," This love could be acceptable when you feel a passionate Spanish blow
","I watched a Woody Allen's film 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' following 'Match Point'. Although I've watched only two of his films, he is good at depicting a trivial matter in ordinary days cynically and dramatically, I think. In this film, he portrayed a matter with a sprinkle of pop and fascinatingly that are likely to be happened, that two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain where they both love a Spanish guy. Sexual adventurous Christina (Scarlett Johansson) and her friend Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaging with a safe man. Two girls took a holiday in Barcelona and met a guy Antonio (Javier Bardem) who believes 'Only unfulfilled love is romantic'. Of all things, the two girls, at the almost same time, are fascinated by the man. Vicky seems to be a million miles away while her boyfriend Doug (Chris Messina) who she left in NY was calling her. She knew that it shouldn't be occurred to her, however, she can't help to love with him. In the meantime, Antonio's ex- wife who is emotional disorder and passionate woman Elena (Penélope Cruz) emerge. Emotional movement of Cristina x Elena x Antonio, Antonio x Vicky will attract the audience into the film. Interestingly, a thought of Spain=passionate country could be thought that affair is not taboos, rather better thought of following one's honest feeling. If you are a woman you might think which girl is similar of you in love. This square relationship amongst the three girls surrounding Antonio could be not a nasty, rather beautiful, which might be the reason that the film was shot in Spain as well. Scarlett Johansson cannot be somewhat an adult woman, though, she played a fascinating role in this film because of her satisfactory position for Woody. While Penélope playing a passionate and hated woman may be fascinating, strong and sexy that might be personal fancy for actors. Penélope is in her element in her role even though she is struggling to play roles in Hollywood.",7,1,3,24 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A bridge to the next generation
","First of all, I made the perfect decision to not see any spoilers or reviews before watching Star Wars: the Force Awakes. I watched it without any prejudice nor being bothered by rumors or negative reviews. I only knew Han Solo and Chewbacca would be appeared in this episode, and that the time has passed to thirty years in the story after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Empire. I was a little worried it could be a bad film, since Disney bought the right to the Star Wars production, and George Lucas was not involved with the creation of this film. When I had a first look at the trailer, it looked good although I had somewhat of a bad feeling about the casting in which Disney tired so hard in choosing the characters not to be racist with the story.I'd say while this episode introduced new characters from anew generation, hopefully in order to gather new audiences, it also tried so hard not to ruin the original images of the film and to keep entertaining old fans. The story gets more straightforward and has fewer political scenes; the relation between the dark side being evil and jedi being heros is clearly depicted. It feels like the structure of the characters have been rotated to new generations. Han Solo is being replaced by Finn, Rey will be placed in Luke position, BB-8 is like R2D2, and Poe Dameron can be like Lando Calrissian. And a new Darth Vader is shown. I definitely like and was moved by the first appearance of Han Solo and Chewbacca. Han looks old but his wild-eyed fighting spirit still remains very much alive with his furball assistant. And Princess Leia is still beautiful! The lovely scene of the two meeting speaks their long-term trustworthy relationship with love. Other old characters including Luke, C3PO, and Admiral Ackbar (who is famous for saying 'It's a trap'), are shown to us like old friends. I couldn't be happier to see those old characters who are still acting in the same way that we remember, and new characters are, to me, naturally blended into the Star Wars universe. Especially, Rey as a new hero (or heroine) of the Jedi encounters difficulties and overcomes them by awaking her new skills, which will be the new hope for the Jedi in the next episode. Overall, I enjoyed the new film and want to watch further episodes. I highly recommend you to watch this film without reading any reviews or rumors about the story.",9,3,21,27 December 2015
The Social Network," I like this Geekish elements in the film
","Now that Facebook has grown to have 500 million active users. The movie is about the founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who has a genius idea to create an innovative Facebook, and a human drama from its start-up to current glory. As you can watch several conversations of Mark Zuckerberg on YouTube and somewhere, you may doubt that the portrait of him in this film is a bit exaggerated toward 'nerd'. There is undeniable sense that so-called a genius hacker is top-drawer in mathematics or programming skills but has no skill on communication, and the guy who run the world's biggest social network site has simply less social networking skill.Geekish elements are spreading out such as unix commands, recruit in a hacking competition, or Sendmail book is put up in untidy heaps. For those people who know something, they would like the pieces of scene as well. What Napstar was involved in the start-up was surprising. I just wonder genius gather genius.I personally wish this 'the Social Network' will be created much later, like the time when Facebook is getting to fade and competitors are trying to eat Facebook within the social network industry then the movie about facebook will be released. A theme is about 'glory and fading'.",Null,0,0,2 October 2011
