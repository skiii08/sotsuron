Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," shameful
","This horrible movie is the best evidence of everything thats wrong in film industry these days ... what a shameless exploitation of one of a greatest trilogy if not the greatest in history of cinema .Idiotic and badly acted dialogs , most annoying kid in movies ever ,no atmosphere ,totaly useless appearance by Jar -jar something ..not funny . No plot ,battle between fish people and goofy robots . No carma or personality on Jedi knights ... this movie really has nothing at all to do with first three ,amazing that there was a same person behind them ,but i guess Lucas has shown in so many ways that he has lost compass long time ago...especially when remastering earlier movies with some stupid modern animation ..without all that new tech bs those movies had an amazing atmosphere to it . Truly a pointless and horrible movie but i guess it has served its purpose ..to make money on the glory of old movies ...no traces of art whatsoever . Perhaps fun parts should bring this movie a higher grade ,but exactly cos of what this name brings and cos every second of dialog in this film stinks like hell ,i give it 1 of 10 .. shameful",1,2,6,27 February 2005
