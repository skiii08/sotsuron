The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'And in this moment I swear, we are infinite'
","This move will excel all preexpectations you have of it, whether they be good or bad. It is a film which speaks to people on all different levels, and blends so many different deep and emotional aspects together (drugs, mental illness, sexual abuse...) in perfect fashion. The acting from the entire cast is flawless from start to finish, and like films of this nature and calibre should, you genuinely grow attached too and feel for the main characters. I have watched this picture several times and am still blown away by the superiority of everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack. I would strongly advise everyone to watch this film; it is real, it is poignant, and it is truly heartwarming. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 September 2015
