Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth The Wait????
","OK we've all seen the hype, all of us were hoping for the best film ever and then some. Any film project that is given such a build up is bound to fall down to some level, but how low was the only question.After sitting there with shivers up and down my spine as the Fox fanfare music started and then those classic words appear 'Once upon a time, in a.....' I felt as though I was ten years old. When I left I felt slightly let down.The film as we all know is set before the original. But we all kind of know whats going to happen. The story is quite simple. The characters are a mix of those we know and those we don't. The effects are totally stunning, and the lightsabre scenes, oh they are the bestest ever in the whole world. But theres no real umphh to it all. Its totally watchable but it isn't groundbreaking as its big brother was. You have to see this film to see how we got to where we were at the beginning of episode 4 but I honestly don't think it would of had a great impact had it been the first film made.Watch this film, its very watchable, just don't expect everything you've been led to believe.",8,0,0,14 September 1999
Fight Club," Blood and Guts with a load of Sofistication.
","Brilliant. Entertaining. Funny. Witty. Exciting. Can you see where I'm going with this?? This film is one of the few that I would class as having a bit of everything thrown in, most in large quantities. Maybe Hollywood is beginning to realise that the public wants something different, this year would certainly suggest that with films like South Park, The Blair Witch Project and The Fight Club. Anyway, back to the film.Fight Club is about the life of an everyday man in the good old US of A. He has a fairly typical job, investigating why cars blow up, burn. That sort of thing. But he can't sleep and has very bad insomnia. He goes to counselling groups to realise something inside and get some well deserved nap time. This makes him content and he plods along for a while longer. On a chance meeting on a plane he meets a man who is the exact opposite to him in so many ways, the fun begins.After his apartment blows up they set up a fight club as a way of releasing their inner angers at the corporate world that they have become slaves to. But as with all good things, they snowball and carry on esculating in size an effect. Then from one fight club springs up a mini-malitia group raging war on the ways of the nineties.From this point on you can't say to much without ruining the film for those that havn't seen it. But it has a wicked twist that doesn't annoy you and kind of fits tot he scheme of the film.This is a great original piece of film making. You are forced into trying to out-think the director as you watch, you want to guess what will happen. You think about what you'd do in that situation. The performances of everyone in the film is perfect for their characters. It's a real pleasure to sit there and watch. It obviously won't cater to all tastes. Don't go and see it if you don't like to think about things as you go. You have to pay attention or you won't get it.Definately in the top five films of the year. Go and see this film.",10,0,1,25 November 1999
Seven Years in Tibet," I thought it would be absolute pants, but it wasn't.
","OK, Seven Years in Tibet. It sounds like its going to be a bit of a four hour epic and you get a bit aprehensive before you start, but honestly there is no need to at all.Brad Pitt, our lead for the film, is an Austrian climber and a member of the pre-ww2 nazi party. He is married and has a child due in less than a month, so what does he do he runs off to climb a mountain. Thats obviously what you'd want to do.His character is absolutely arrogant and you don't like him at all. The film then centres upon this and shows us how he develops with time and the factors that influence this change. His son is born without him present and due to the lack of love he expresses to his wife she divorces him. Pitt is then arrested at the start of the war and breaks free from a prison camp and final stumbles into Tibet and the sacred city. Well we don't want to give it all away, so I'll stop all that plot development stuff right there.The big stunts, high adrenalin action is not there in this film at all. But it doesn't suffer at all as a  result. To me this film is all about the script and the characters in them. Pitts performance is brilliant, the best that he has ever given. There is nothing that you don't believe about the way he portrays his character. The way he develops it throughout the film is great to watch. When you couple this with the true story on which it is based you have a great film on your hands.Well worth a watch, who'd of thought it.",7,0,1,10 November 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," What Do You Expect??
","How on earth can you fill a film up with just the one South Park storyline? That was my first thought when we went to see this film. The answer I got was 'quite easily?'It is bigger, it is longer, it is uncut, and low and behold Kenny lowers his hood and speaks, Hurrah!!This is without doubt one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time. It isn't subtle or clever or dark in anyway with its humour. Its crued and in your face, but come on thats why we love South Park in the first place. This film was never meant to be taken overly seriously, when you watch it you relax totally and laugh your back off.I never thought I could sit through a musical, but when you have such classics as 'Cartmans mum is a b**ch' and the excellent 'Uncle F***er' then how can you fail to like this movie.Go and see it, its brilliant in a way you could never imagine.",8,4,4,17 September 1999
Toy Story 2," Brilliant, a must see for all the everyone.
","We are only just creeping towards the end of the years second month and I already believe that I've just watched perhaps the best film for the year. Toy Story 2 is a must see for all people, kids and adults alike.For those of you that are unaware, not that many of you I'd imagine but, Toy Story follows the lives of a group of toys belonging to a child named Andy. Everytime Andy isn't in the room the toys come to life, I always knew that happened when I was a kid and now we have the proof. These toys get up to stunts and thrown into adventures, not all of which turn out to be fun, and this film follows the course of one such adventure.The basic plot inlvolves Woody (Tom Hanks) being sold off to a toy collector by accident. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and a few others set off to get him back.The entire film is produced through computer generated images and they are absolutely stunning, its sometimes difficult to see the difference between these scenes and those in everday life. Obviously this adds to the realism of the picture.The script then backs up this world class animation. It achieves this through its humour, both slapstick and subtle throughout. Also through the characters of each toy, they each have there own personalities, which believe it or not, you will be able to relate to throughout the film.You care about whats going to happen, its sometimes edge of the seat stuff. The classic good guys versus bad guys, no hidden agenda, no political stance, no blood and guts, no swearing or vulgarity. For once I'm proud to say that it's good clean wholesome fun.Go and see this film.",10,0,1,22 February 2000
Scream," The ride of a lifetime.
","This film has it all; action, suspense, adrenalin, a great bunch of actors and one of the most original scripts that the film world has seen in a long time. Scream helped to redefine and re-invent the horror film genre of the nineties and has helped many other great horror films develop since its release. That's what it has and what it's done, but why is it so good??Wes Craven surpassed all that he has done before and brought the element of believeablility to this film, as a result it takes you on a twisting turning ride that makes you feel sick and dizzy but leaves you begging for more.Because of its closeness to reality through its 'it could happen to you tomorrow' mentality the film grips you in a way that few other films could. Because of its horror theme it makes you intensely intrigued by its nature.It may not be the finest film in the filmmakers sense of the word, but for me it has to be the finest film that I have seen at the cinema this decade, and out of the all time list only takes a slight second place to the magnificant Star Wars trilogy. See this film above all others, trust me.",10,0,0,9 March 1999
Scream," This Film Rediscovers A Genre.
","In the 1980s' the horror film genre took off in a big way. Initial films were followed by sequel after sequel after sequel. This ended up making the genre into a laughing stock, the scares weren't scary the acting was at best 'hammy'. To coin a phrase it all went a 'bit pear shaped'. Upon watching Scream for the first time I set my expectations low, this was an error because this is a truly brilliant film, a masterpiece of horror in its own right.Wes Craven uses the tired nature of horror flicks to his advantage throughout this carefully plotted film, with constant jibes and references to inferior slasher flicks of the past.  Both Craven and Williamson have combined to deliver us a well presented and scary movie that is a thrill a minute from the first Hello to the final fright.The plot centres around a teenage girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is being terrorised through phonecalls and attacks of various sorts from a person in a ghost-type costume. As the film carries on many victims succumbe to nasty ends to the killer, who is trying to make a statement until the time comes for his ultimate and essential victim.The location for this film is a quaint little middle-class American town. As usual in Hollywoodland, there only seems to be one type of person in these surroundings and they would be White people. The race card is played again by Hollywoods big bosses which doesn't necessarily let the film down, but does rub me up the wrong way somehow. So for me the film loses some of its high status that I'm building for it.This aside it is a really good film, the best horror for a long while, and streets ahead of the many similar films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty and Urban Legends.This film does put things right for horror films in many ways and sets them back up alongside any other type of film in the world.This film will probably go down as a classic. Leave all other horror films alone  when making your choice, this is the one you will appreciate the most, a thoroughly good, enjoyable, witty, thrilling and scary film. Nuff said.",10,0,0,6 April 2000
