Sucker Punch," Action packed with great CGI and gorgeous girls.
","'Sucker Punch' is a visual treat from start to finish. There is no deep meaning that people on the IMDb review boards keep trying to find. It is simply made up of action packed segments, dominated by excellent special effects and the sort of girls you'd love to have on your arm (unless you are a girl).This is style over substance. The acting is ordinary. The dialogue is average. The operational brain cells required to enjoy the chaotic spectacle going on in front of your eyes are virtually zero. It's loud. It's fun. And at the end, you may feel sucker punched. I was certainly bruised. Funnily enough, the best portrayal comes from Scott Glenn who plays the mysterious guide. He is brilliant. His role is small, but he more than makes up for it with a consummate performance. He captures the mystery of the character to perfection. His cool, assured demeanour is in sharp contrast to the perilous situations that the girls find themselves in. The film got poor reviews but the critics failed to see it for what it really is - brash, almost pornographic, nonsensical chaos that enlivens the senses and blows your mind. When Zack Snyder made 'Sucker Punch', he filled the special effects tank full of gasoline and slammed the pedal to the floor. He wasn't interested in script or characterisation so don't expect any.The poor worldwide box office can be put down to 'Sucker Punch' being too action packed and violent for the girls and because too many men still have a problem with watching gorgeous scantily clad women kick ass. Okay, this isn't as good as '300', but it isn't that far off either. The worldwide total of less than $90 million is a travesty.The girls are undeniably gorgeous and the storyline is undeniably thrown together without any thought whatsoever. However, it is the CGI and the soundtrack that are the stars of the show here. Lots of noise, plenty of anger, a high level of violence and a whole lot of breath-taking action. Oh and I hope I didn't forget to mention the gorgeous half-naked ass kicking girls. If you expect anymore than the above, you will be sorely disappointed.",8,9,17,12 May 2011
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Films And Where To Find Them. Right Here.
","Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a young British wizard who comes to 1920s New York to save numerous endangered magical creatures, who are under threat from other wizards, as well as from normal people. Along with two witches, Tina (Katherine Waterston), her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) and a muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), they race around New York and its hidden world of witchcraft in an effort to save as many magical creatures as possible and to defeat the menacing creature which wreaks havoc on New York's streets.Now, I'm not one of those people who avidly followed the Harry Potter films, although I did enjoy the ones I saw, so I came with a certain sense of expectation to 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. I like Eddie Redmayne and I'm happy to put my faith in J.K.Rowling to enchant me with her imagination, so my confidence was high that I would enjoy the film. And I was right. It's a superb romp through a magical world that the child in all of us really hopes exists and wishes we could be a part of.Right from the off, an auspicious start evokes a sense of wonder and foreboding, where anything is possible. Redmayne's Newt Scamander takes a little getting used to and I'd be interested to know why they decided to play him in a shy, socially awkward way. It certainly makes a change from having an overtly confident hero, but J.K. Rowling obviously has form with creating a geeky hero. Katherine Waterston's Tina is welcome as a love interest for Newt and Dan Fogle's Jacob Kowalski gives the audience a mirror image as to what it would be like to be a muggle in this magical kingdom. Good performances by both, particularly Fogle.Interestingly, they tease a potential love interest for Jacob with Tina's sister Queenie, a witch, which inverts the usual situation of the normal, everyday girl with the otherworldly male. This time it's the everyday guy and a beautiful witch, making a nice change so hopefully it's developed in later films (and perhaps other writers take note for their works).'Fantastic Beasts' moves along at a fair old pace but at no point leaves you feeling left behind. At two hours twelve minutes, it is just the right length, ending on several positive notes and leaving you wanting more. I know a second film has been released and apparently three more are in the pipeline so, hopefully, there's plenty more to come.It would be nice to see more of the Macusa wizards and witches in future films. They play a small, but important, role in this film and I think there's room there to develop a few of them into more prominent characters.Overall, it's hard to find fault with 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them'. You leave the film on a high, re-energized, and with all the magical possibilities flying around your head. Basically, you feel like a child again.",9,0,1,1 June 2020
Unknown," 'Knows' how to deliver an exciting thriller.
","'Unknown' is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is.The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.Liam Neeson gives a very assured performance and is ably supported by Diane Kruger. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen, whilst the involvement of Bruno Ganz as a former Stasi agent brings a tangible element of the Cold War to the proceedings. January Jones and Aidan Quinn adequately perform their roles, although she looks a little to similar to Diane Kruger.Berlin, which is often a popular location for films, is an excellent setting for 'Unknown', with the architecture of the city adding to that Cold War feel. I don't know when it was filmed but the gloomy weather and the fact that many scenes were filmed late evening adds to that 'shrouded in secrecy' effect.Most of the action scenes are excellent, particularly the car plunging into the river early on. However there are a few scenes where you may find yourself saying that this is all a bit too implausible. It spoils the realism of what is otherwise a very entertaining watch.At just under two hours, it is just the right length for an evening's entertainment.",7,0,2,7 May 2011
Thor," Thor-oughly enjoyable.
","'Thor' has all the ingredients you need for a superb comic book adaptation with a panoply of characters that are perfectly portrayed, easy to follow dialogue with occasional humour, effective CGI and all of this handsomely directed by Kenneth Brannagh.The performances of the cast are exceptional with no one letting the side down. The two main newcomers, Hemsworth and Hiddleston, are jewels in the crown, with Anthony Hopkins upping the theatrics and Natalie Portman delivering a seasoned performance.Chris Hemsworth makes Thor his own with a prodigious performance that captures all the emotions of this young, arrogant and powerful warrior on his journey of self discovery. It is hard to dislike him even when he is arrogant, but as the film goes on, you feel overwhelming support for Thor.Tom Hiddleston manages to catch Loki's mischievous nature with pure precision. Even though he is a deceitful character, you can't help feeling for him as the jealous younger sibling of Thor.Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Odin and delivers a consummate performance of the wise and ancient King of this fantastical realm of Asgard.Natalie Portman superbly plays the astrophysicist who is caught up in all the action, with a straight laced performance that contrasts perfectly with all the fantastical events happening around her.Kenneth Brannagh proves the doubters wrong and delivers the goods with clever direction that blends the splendour of Norse mythology with a workable story on present day Earth. Brannagh knows how to pace the action and is happy to give the audience plenty of breathing space with the slower scenes.Credit must go to Idris Elba and Colm Feore although the latter is criminally underused. Elba is imposing and statuesque as the all seeing Heimdall, with Feore successfully capturing the menace and sadness of Laufey, the King of the Frost Giants.The intricately detailed costumes and sets are a big positive and the special effects up the bar for other comic book adaptations to beat.At just under two hours in length, this is a thoroughly enjoyable action packed romp and takes you places you only usually dream of. Just sit back with your coke and popcorn and let it wash all over you.It's so good, I've watched it twice.",8,2,5,5 May 2011
Kong: Skull Island," Does what it says on the tin.
","Set in the early 1970s, a team of scientists, backed up by armed forces, venture to a newly discovered island in the Pacific. All of them, bar one, think they're going for geological or scientific study but it's not long before they come face to face with the island's bigger inhabitants.'Kong : Skull Island' does what it says on the tin. It's about a huge monster, with other huge monsters, on a mysterious island containing spectacular and foreboding landscapes, and how human beings who we don't care about, get eaten, squashed, blown up and human beings we do care about manage to escape to tell the fantastical tale to an unsuspecting world.All of the above is what you go for and all of the above is what you get when you watch this. One criticism is that a little more character development would have been welcome. Some of the cast feel like they're giving lacklustre performances here. The only one who really grabs me is John C. Reilly, playing a Ben Gunn type character who has been marooned away from civilisation for many years. His craziness and openness makes him likable but Reilly also adds the right amount of pathos when his character reveals his thoughts about the wife he left behind and the son that he's never seen.The special effects are good and I did find myself rooting for Kong in some of the fight scenes, with a self satisfied, smug look on my face when he wins the day (that's not a spoiler because it's a given that Kong will survive and win, he's Kong). The fight scenes are good although I don't think they're quite as good as the ones in the most recent Godzilla.Overall, a decent effort but I expect better from the next Kong movie.",7,1,1,1 June 2020
Casino Royale," One of the best Bond films to ever be made.
","'Casino Royale' sees James Bond (Daniel Craig) acquire his 007 status before racing around the world to stop an immoral banker, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), who helps to fund world terrorists, and in particularl, a mysterious new organization. Le Chiffre has lost a huge sum of money on the stock market after Bond foils a plot to blow up an airplane in Miami. Needing to raise funds quickly, he decides to hold a very high stakes Poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. 'M' sends 007, who is accompanied by accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), to participate in the game, to stop Le Chiffre and to find out more about this new menacing, secret organization.I think it's important that we give the making of 'Casino Royale' some context for those who weren't around at the time and for those who've forgotten everything that surrounded the making of the film in 2006. Many people had not been happy with the direction the Bond films had been going in for some years. The last two films in particular, 'The World Is Not Enough' and 'Die Another Day', were seen to be two of the worst. The arrival of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne in 2002, and the follow up in 2004, had also heaped pressure on to the Bond franchise with a fresher, more realistic action orientated superspy, not reliant on CGI, making the latest Bond offerings look banal as well as rivalling him at the box office. Bond had become a parody of himself and Bourne looked like a natural successor.The decision was taken to reboot the series by taking James Bond back to basics with a new actor in the role of the iconic spy. 'Casino Royale' had been the first Bond book published in 1952 and the only one of the series not yet to have a film made about it (the David Niven 1967 spoof doesn't count).So we arrive at the movie itself which was to be Daniel Craig's inaugural film as James Bond. It was quite possibly the most anticipated Bond movie of all time as there had been a mixed reaction to the casting of Craig, a relative unknown, as 007 a year earlier. A war of opposing sentiments had erupted on-line with two websites, CraignotBond and CraigisBond, set up to do battle after his announcement as the urbane British spy. The online war raged right up until 'Casino Royale' was released in cinemas November 2006, with the pro-Craig side emerging victorious as critical acclaim and widespread audience approval of 'Casino Royale' finally quashed all rebellion against Barbara Broccoli's interesting choice for protagonist.Whether any of this affected the making of the movie or not, the fact is that Casino Royale is a terrific film, with an excellent James Bond at the head of a fantastic cast reading from a quality script, with fantastic direction and production, and one of the best Bond themes in Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name'. Here we see Bond in the raw, earning his 007 status, allowing his ego to take control, making mistakes but still saving the day as only James Bond can. Don't worry, this is very much James Bond in a James Bond movie but one with a subtle difference.The film's running time at nearly two and a half hours is just right as the time whizzes by. At no point do you find yourself looking at the clock as you're far too absorbed in this unique Bond story, one that really can stand alone from the rest of the series. The film changes pace on numerous occasions and is happy to flick back and forth between the action scenes, the tension at the poker game and the more tender moments with Vesper Lynd without losing the viewer. It is all blended together perfectly. 'Casino Royale' is also a film that has matured well over the past fourteen years and plays like it could have been made in the last twelve months.A big well done to Daniel Craig as well. The pressure of being James Bond, let alone for the first time and amidst so much online discussion, must have weighed heavily on him and yet he handles the role with aplomb. In 'Casino Royale', Craig shows that he can be both the blunt instrument and the charismatic lover that we expect of James Bond. His final line in the film is so well delivered and sums up his overall performance. It was an auspicious start for Daniel Craig as James Bond and even though 'Quantum of Solace' wasn't the follow up that most hoped for, his exceptional performance in 'Casino Royale' wasn't a one off.",9,1,1,7 June 2020
Fast Five," Fast and a lot more furious.
","For anyone who thinks this ten year old franchise might be running out of fuel, have no fear because on the basis of Fast Five, it could run for another decade. This is the longest of the five films and in my opinion, it is the best.The film contains two of the best action scenes I have seen in the franchise. Fast Five is all that you'd expect and more. However, the cars and the girls aren't quite the major players they are in previous movies but they're there nonetheless, so don't be disappointed.Fast Five sees a buffed up Dom and a loved up Brian and Mia flee to Rio after they become fugitives of US law. There they decide to do one final heist and invite some old friends back to take part. This is no ordinary heist either and involves getting on the wrong side of some extremely dangerous people.The old faces are back with Roman and Tej but it is the comedic banter of the two new faces in the team - Don Omar and Tego Calderon - that I enjoyed the most. And Sung Kang and Gal Gadot aren't just making up the numbers. She has a figure to make your eyes pop out !! For me though, the cream of the movie is the much anticipated arrival of Dwayne Johnson as Federal Agent Hobbs. He is superb and I'd be surprised if he doesn't feature strongly in the next film. His role opposite Diesel works a treat and in my opinion, neither one outdoes the other.There is more effort at plot and character development in Fast Five than previous outings and some people may be surprised at how events unfold. It might not be for the best but we will have to wait and see.Rio is the perfect setting with the sun drenched streets and alleys of the favelas as well as the constant menace of the omnipotent local drugs lords. These guys are ruthless characters and very well armed, with a stranglehold over the local law enforcement agencies too.All in all, a welcome return for everyone concerned. Keep your eyes open during the credits for some extras that you won't want to miss. I'm already looking forward to the next film. I just can't think what title they'll come up with !!",8,1,2,5 May 2011
