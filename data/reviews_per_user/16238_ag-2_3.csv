The Devil's Advocate," file under comedy
","This is a very, very funny movie, if your sense of humor ranges toward the dark and opaque. Al Pacino was definitely born for this part and appears to be having *just* the most fun. Lots of little details and references to everything from Paradise Lost to Rosemary's Baby to Faust to -- well, pretty much every demonology ever. Cheesy, campy, scary, silly, and occasionally beyond cool; deserves a place at your next video night.",Null,3,8,23 September 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," both subtle and astonishing
","Far, far better than anyone had the right to expect, Jackson's interpretation of the books (so far!) is blissfully free of the sludgy, ponderous thinking that seems to gum up most films in the fantasy genre. There's plenty here to entertain everyone; I've loved the books for years and appreciated Jackson's sensitive transmission of the story from text-narrative to film (not easy with a sprawling text like LOTR). OTOH, my best friend, who loves movies but hasn't read the books, enjoyed it immensely without feeling the loss of any of the material Jackson chose not to use. (Naturally the fans hope the DVD will restore some of that stuff, but we'll see.) The movie has humor and bite and no condescension at all. I can't imagine how Peter Jackson got away with it, but he's made a great, great film despite all the naysayers and despite Hollywood's endemic stupidity. Can't wait for the next two!",10,1,1,18 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," go. go quickly. go now.
","A lot of folks appear to be comparing this to Seven (another great movie), but I'll go further back: This is the best horror film I've seen since The Shining. The pacing was terrific, and the child actor at the heart of the piece is the best kid I've seen onscreen since Jodie Foster. (Sure sign of a great horror film: I was more flipped out three hours after seeing it than I was in the theater!)",9,0,0,4 September 1999
