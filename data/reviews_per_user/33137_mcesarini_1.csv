The Devil's Advocate," Atrociously entertaining
","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the vibe and mediocrity of this movie. Keanu Reeves is absolutely awful and as much as I hate to say this, Al Pacino is awful, as well. The epitome of the term 'Over-acting' is examplified by Pacino in this movie. Pacino tries too hard to be a villain with his clich√© forced evil laugh and lets be honest, what relevance does him sticking his finger in the holy water and having it boil even play to the plot or scene? Its completely just tacking on irrelevant and unnecessary bad scenes. Keanu Reeves does a poor job faking his Southern accent and does even worse at showing any emotion as a character. This movie never makes you care about any character other than Theron's. Jeffrey Jones proved why he doesn't belong in dramas because I still only picture him as Rooney from Ferris Bueller. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 and not a 1 is because as bad as it is, it was entertaining. Its almost as if it was so bad that it was somewhat good. I wanted to see what happened in the end even though I was practically laughing at the stupidity of some scenes. Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment and a skid mark on a great career for Al Pacino.",3,3,7,4 January 2016
