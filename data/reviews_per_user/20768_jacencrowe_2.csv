Blade Runner 2049," RevisiÃ³n Blade Runner 2049
","I'm not a professional critic, I do not know much about film about production or direction or the work that the director of cinematography does, but what I'm going to do is like crazy crazy Blade Runner, the movie that thanks to my wonderful parents that I love them, that I was given the economic means to be able to see it at the movie theater, in the evening at 8:50 pm in Morelia, Mexico. now about the movie leaves me with more doubts and confusing things to get analyzed, the movie was wonderfully epic, the fights and the shootings were amazing, this movie felt in a moment that I would remove the tears, the plot of this movie was twisted over Officer K or Joe which was the alleged child, supposedly the son of Rick Deckard and Rachel, something that maybe I did not pay attention or did not understand was because the replicates could be fertile are made of genetic material just like a human DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) but in corporations Tyrell in the first movie I do not think they mention that the replicates can conceive give birth to the sexual act in the first film Deckard makes love with Rachael but did not know which could be fertile, so the plot becomes more complicated in 2049, officer K I believe to be Deckard's son but it was not this plot that the replicates who were stalking K who saved from where they left unconscious when they went to kidnap to Deckard by orders of Wallace through Luv these replicates that saved to K and the lady leader invites him to join us species of group to initiate a war against the corporation of Wallace which leaves stops much to see a third of blade Runner (if they do use Harrison Ford now not too late as they did here and in Star Wars please) assign that he must kill Deckard so that's where Officer K or Joe comes in action and manages to demolish the ships of Luv and to have a brutal fight (more than the one that had with Sapper Morton and Deckard) managing to kill it by means of submersion and saving Deckard so that it takes to know his DAUGHTER and K does not decide to enter to the facilities a time come and I feel like I forgive life as did what Roy Batty did in the original movie save it but in this case decide not to kill him and that best I could meet and meet with his daughter in the end alarming with the subject of Tears in the Rain by Vangelis that's why I felt the same similarity of forgiving his life and not kill Deckard.final statement -Deckard is not a replicate for more than Ridley Scoot wants to confirm that it is for the unicorn, it will never be brutal force of replicate, could not hand to hand with Zhora, Leon, Pris and Roy Batty who as I mention I finish saving it so that to witness their experiences and to understand what Batty had lived.alternative plot: I would have liked Gaff to be the villain of this film without so much of the events of the Black out, I did not like the Black out in the mini films in you tube, would have preferred that they continue a sequel after the original blade runner in 1982 some two years later it will be released in 1984 so that Gaff was the villain that would hunt Deckard and Rachael and would have the most suitable plot for Deckard, and thus would not have waited 30 years for this movie premiered in 2017, but good Hollywood is Hollywood they have the power I am just a simple cine-filo and heart fan of many epic sagas: star wars, Lord of the Rings and the hobbit, Indiana Jones, Blade Runner I love all these sagas like crazy.I love it and I am shocked Blade Runner 2049 so I will repeat it two or three times but it is incredible epic not to say but I love the original and this epic new delivery despite what I have said about revision of way negative even so for me this is a gem a very beautiful but very beautiful diamante that you may see in my life including my sagas already mentioned",10,1,6,7 October 2017
