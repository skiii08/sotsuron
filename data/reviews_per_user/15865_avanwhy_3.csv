E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Classic
",Nothing more to say . . . EXCEPT that this movie not winning the Oscar for Best Picture that year was one of the biggest mistakes the Academy has made. It will endure forever.,10,1,2,23 September 1998
Wedding Crashers," Laced with homophobia
","There is so much wrong with this movie, I could be here a week typing this. But one of the most glaring missteps (for lack of a stronger word) is the homophobic element surrounding the character of Todd. Portrayed as 'crazy,' 'weird' and 'scary' the film takes the gay stereotype of over 30 years ago and resurrects it. It also makes sure to add, to comedic effect, the 'horror' of a gay man trying to seduce a straight man. Then, add in a dash of the 'looney grandmother' who spouts homophobic slurs for laughs. What this film does to fuel ignorance and intolerance towards gays and lesbians is no laughing matter.",1,13,27,25 July 2005
Gladiator," A Colossal Disappointment!
","The 'coming attractions' were more exciting and fun than watching 'Gladiator' after them.  I was all prepared for a movie of action, and romance and adventure.  The kind of film that gets you caught up in the story, and has you rooting, cheering and clapping at the climax of the movie.  This wasn't it.  The story never drew me in, or gave me a reason to care what happened.  I think Russell Crowe is a talented actor, but not in this...  His acting consisted of variations on looking stern or solemn, with maybe three smiles thrown in to show his range.  As for this moviegoer, I'd rather watch an old Steve Reeves movie.",4,0,0,6 May 2000
