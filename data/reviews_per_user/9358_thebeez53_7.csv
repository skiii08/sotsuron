First Man," Yawn
","When I read (I assume) HBO's description stating '...in this masterful film about the enigmatic astronaut...' I thought, did we watch the same movie? It's a great film....to put you to sleep. I watched the moon landing, and I'd rather view that multiple times than see this movie ever again. I loved 'The Right Stuff,' 'Apollo 13' and even 'The Martian' but nothing could have prepared me for this snooze-fest made all the more boring by the depiction of the Armstrongs. Do yourself a favor and watch 'Contact' or even 'Space Cowboys' but don't waste your time on this film.",4,2,2,13 August 2019
A Star Is Born," Expecting so much more
","I had friends, whose opinions matter to me, tell me this version is great, better than the Streisand adaptation and on and on. I found this a great movie to fall asleep to. I have read some of the reviews and, folks, believe the ones who give 6 stars and under. Hugely disappointed and bored.",5,3,6,1 June 2019
Face_Off," What a joke
","I have to seriously wonder about those who rated this movie a 10. I literally yelled at the tv screen when Nicholas Cage, who was near death but kept alive by machines, stands up and with his face off starts to smoke a cigarette. There's suspending belief and then there's insulting one's intelligence. This is the latter.",1,1,5,1 January 2019
Burlesque," The more I watched it...
","...the better I liked it. Saw it in the theatre when released, and I wasn't thrilled. Then it came to premium channels, and I watched again. And again. And yet again. The music grew on me and so did the story. Anyone who doesn't get chills when Aguilera hits that first note when the sound breaks down isn't a fan of music. She and Cher sounded fantastic. Watch it more than once, and you just might agree with me.",8,1,3,1 January 2019
Joker," Stunning
","Just mail the man the Oscar, and while you're at it, do the same for the director.",10,3,5,1 January 2020
Joker," You'll be transfixed
","...as I was watching this film. And to think I almost didn't watch this with my adult son. I haven't been this moved by a movie in a long time. Of course, it's disturbing, but it's brilliant. You watch Arthur Fleck transform into The Joker. A perfect performance by Joaquin Phoenix, a masterful directing job by Todd Phillips, all in a movie which will have you thinking about it long after you viewed it.",10,3,7,14 January 2020
Parasite," As they say, that's two hours I won't get back....
",....and I thought 'The Shape of Water' was a horrible Best Picture winner. 'Joker.' '1917.' 'Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.' They all lose to....this? I just might be done watching the Academy Awards.,1,6,9,20 April 2020
