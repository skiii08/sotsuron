The Benchwarmers," do not watch or you will regret it
","whoever likes this movie is a huge idiot. this movie sucked except the part where John Heder talks. David Spade is also funny, but not as much as i expected. i was expecting to see something funny to the point where i'd have to hold myself from peeing in my pants. however, i was greatly disappointed. it just goes to show that rob Schneider can't act in a role where he's the straight smart one. he's only good acting like an idiot or an 'animal' or 'hot chick' or 'gigalo.' probably because he is an idiot. also, John Lovitz isn't that bad in the movie. he does some pretty funny and crude stuff like show his nipples. other than that....the movie blows a fat one. do not waste money or time on this movie!",1,0,0,12 October 2006
