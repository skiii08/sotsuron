"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Haven't we seen this film before?
","Not in sum, but every part seems familiar. It plays like a montage of previous rom coms.There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either. It's blurb, a schedule filler, one in the bank.Pegg and Moran just sleepwalk through the same parts that they always play, not expanding their range on iota. Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now. Thandie Newton just has to stand in doorways and look pretty. Her character is a prize, not a person. The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot. Azaria is the strongest actor, but isn't given much of a part. His character development goes: good, good, good... evil, with no reason given for the sudden transition.Everything about it, Schwimmer's direction included, is just... adequate. There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track. Film making by box ticking. The whole is instantly forgettable, and dreadfully disappointing given the collection of talent working on it.",3,14,23,16 April 2008
Fury," War is hell, man, war is hell
","Except that it wasn't really, not for the Yanks who rocked up at the last minute and grabbed the credit for finishing off the Krauts that the Brits had been pummelling for over 5 years.By April 1945, while the Septics were gorging on chocolate cake, the Hun was done. Jerry was out of munitions, out of fuel, and out of food - they were down to eating sawdust. Resistance had essentially collapsed, and the remaining pockets were being mopped up by overwhelming artillery and air superiority including the ground attack aircraft which are conspicuous by their absence here.There were no counter-attacks being launched, no Waffen SS units left in reserve to launch them, and if there were, they wouldn't have made such an utterly ham fisted job of things as shown in this revisionist fantasy, trying to Zerg-rush machine guns.There is a strong fantasy feel to this dreadful, heavy handed mess. Never mind tracer, the guns appear to be firing laser bolts. Pew-pew-pew. Ami grenades explode handily on impact, Kraut potato mashers with their 5 second fuse just sit there patiently waiting and waiting for tedious dragged-out scenes to play out. Shermans are apparently whisper quiet, which will come as news to anyone who's been within half a mile of one, and their guns go 'pop' rather than crashing out a deafening cloud of smoke.Long and very tiresome story short, this is a Vietnam flick clumsily transplanted to a fog-machine filled Europe. Appalling in every way.",2,14,26,29 December 2016
Captain Marvel," The absolute state of this movie
","I didn't have high hopes going in, but I thought I'd give it a fair shake. Maybe it was more than a paean to pretty white girl power, right? Maybe they just made a fun popcorn movie, or perhaps it explores some original tropes. Conceivably it might even feature the high quality of acting of which Oscar winner Brie Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) is apparently capable (although I'm informed that her previous movies are Not Made For Me, so I haven't seen any).Nope. A big, flat-assed nope.It's cringe from start to finish. Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) has a blank expression on her face which is intended to convey... what? I have no idea. That she's bored with the whole thing? Well, me too. The few brief scenes where she changes that expression just highlight that she's got her Resting Bored Face on for the entirity of the rest of the movie.She's not interesting, she's not appealling, she's brings no depth or complexity or even personality to the character.And as the movie is entirely about her, what does that leave us?The score and cinematography, which is pedestrian. The CGI which is frankly shoddy, although even CGI-Jackson acts Larson (real name Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers) off the screen. Mind you, so does the cat.The pacing is all over the place, both plodding and rushed. It feels like a much longer movie than it actually is. The last twenty minutes is the most tolerable, but in terms of character development, it's simply super-powered pretty white girl becomes SUPER super-powered pretty white girl. But we're given no reason to care.There are a few clumsy stabs at The Patriarchy, but not enough to condemn it purely on that basis. No, I condemn it because it's a dull, poorly written, badly made and disastrously cast movie.You know what I was thinking of all the way through this disaster? Howard the Duck. How I'd rather be watching Howard the Duck. Weird, but true.",3,3,5,9 March 2019
Stripes," Astonishing waste of a great cast, plus P. J. Soles.
","Apparently this is a comedy, although you'd never guess that from watching it, as they forgot to bring the funny.Murray hits it with zero energy, then dials it down from there, reminding us why he needs someone like Dan Aykroyd to play against.Harold Ramis... well, he's no DAn Aykroyd. John Candy isn't in it enough. Sean Young is period-pretty, but doesn't really have what you'd call a character or a role. P.J. Soles tanks her brief appearance, and her nascent career.I'd talk about the plot, but there really isn't any beyond: losers join the army, 'hiijinks' ensue.Technically, it's a mess. The audio is all over the place, muffled then blaring. The soundtrack is a plodding, plonking dirge, punctuated with military marches that are much more upbeat than the cast or script.The direction appears to be non-existent, and the pacing is glacial, both in each drawn-out scene and throughout the (for want of a better word) movie.Lighting, well, the scenes are lit, but they're largely outdoors.A cringe-worthy failure in nearly every way. It feels like nobody involved in this had any fun, and you won't either.",3,1,2,19 June 2020
Hot Fuzz," Change the bloody record, Pegg
","Yes, Spaced was sublime, but I've seen it already. Sure, Sean of the Dead expanded on those themes a little, but I've watched that to death. I expected something new here, not just Pegg and Wright rehashing the same played-out characters using the same tired cabal of actors spouting the same old jokes yet again.I just can't find anything here that they haven't already done, many times before. Even the 'unexpected' disjoints are by now mandatory rather than surprising. From knowing the premise and the writers, the entire plot can be fairly accurately predicted, right down to the fat one coming a cropper. Don't eat the paintballs, Mike.Cinematically, Wright is going backwards. The trademark jump cuts reach a distracting and aggravating frenzy in the third act; either this is accidental and sloppy, or it's deliberate and obtuse. The budget just isn't there to do the action scenes properly, and the cack-handed attempt to disguise this is painfully obvious. It's neither clever, nor charming.But worst of all, Hot Fuzz is lukewarm at best. It's dull. It drags. It's a parody of Midsomer Murders, not Bad Boys, and not a particularly sharp one at that.Pegg and Wright are out of ideas. I'll be skipping their next effort until the rabid fanbois stop raving over it, and some serious and balanced reviews come in.",4,21,65,23 June 2007
X-Men," The film comic book fans have been waiting years to hate
","Decaf film making.  I'm getting very tired of hearing how risky it is to make a costume hero film, and how they had to play it safe to guarantee box office and sequels.  Question: why would I *want* to see a sequel of this? I'd be as well just playing the game of the film, over and over and over and...Compare with the gorgeously stylish and daring Batman (1989), which spawned a series of increasingly mundane and lack lustre sequels.  When we're all heartily sick of the whole X Men franchise, we won't even be able to look back and lament over how good it used to be.",1,3,8,27 November 2000
Nacho Libre," Blah blah, Jack Black, blah blah Napolean Dynamite
","I'll boil this down for you to make it nice and simple. If you theenk that a fat greengo talkeeng like thees ees funny, then yoo wheel love thees feelm. Personally, I don't care that this movie is racist, even though it clearly is; Mr Black is no more convincing as an hombre than he would be as a brutha. But that's not the flaw. The flaw is that it's both dumb and dull. Either one alone could be rescued, but together they suck the life out of it. Sweet, OK, but if I wanted sweet, I'd be watching 'Annie'. This is supposed to be a comedy. Where are the laughs?There's no overall narrative drive, and each scene drags out just a little too long. Rather than looking forward to the next scene in anticipation, it's more a sense of relief that the current one is finished. The writing is sloppy, and relies far too much on Black carrying the film, a task which is just beyond him. In terms of production values, it reminded me of a Xena episode, but without the joie de vivre. To stick with the Raimi theme, Black is no Bruce Campbell.I would strongly advise against paying to see this movie, unless you really, truly, can't find anything better to do.",2,4,8,9 August 2006
28 Weeks Later," Zombies = 10 rating
","For a start. Then we begin dinging.Ding 1 for the casting. Aren't we sick of RADA brats yet? How does such a pathetic passive wimp get to be a Major? How come most of the 'Yanks' sound like they're doing bad pastiches?Ding another for plagiarism.The helicopter harvest scene isn't a homage to Romero: it's lifted straight from World War Z.Another ding for editing, which is egregiously jumpy. That's pragmatically excusable to save budget, but this film shouldn't have needed it. It could have done with less CGI, and more choreography.And finally we ding 2,562,724 for stupidity, which kicks in as soon as the location moves to London, and never quits. There's too much to list, but the standouts include the tedious guided tour of London landmarks, the 'securing' of people in a bunker with a back door, the curious ineffectiveness of automatic weapons against massed charges (funny, it worked in World War I), the unbelievable deliberate Blue on Blue fire, the 'I can see, so you go first' subway scenes, the infuriatingly clumsy military banter, and in the helicopter rip-off scene, they apparently plain forgot that they weren't making a Romero slow-headshot-zombies film!It's simply sloppy writing, scene after scene after scene, and I find it intolerable in comparison with 28 Days Later, which only required a suspension of disbelief in the premise. 28 Weeks Later seems to cry out 'Yeah, we know this is dumb, but wait until you see the next pyro-CGI-gasm!'So, that's a total score of -2562717, rounded up to the minimum that IMDb will let me vote.",1,1,4,16 December 2007
Pitch Black," Curse you, human vermin
","This is a nature documentary about the fascinating inhabitants of LG-426 (or whatever) who only get to come to the surface once every 23 years when it gets pitch black.Unfortunately for these sympathetic and well realised creatures, they emerge to find the surface crawling with perky human vermin who torment and attack them with bright lights and fire.  Luckily, the humans have almost no common sense and conveniently throw away, break or just wander away from their light sources, allowing the natives to get some well deserved chaw time. Feel free to cheer as each annoyingly idiotic mammal finds an increasingly contrived way to turn itself into breakfast.Some of the walking breakfasts get away (darn!), but no doubt they will send a dinner party of 20-somethings pretending to be high school kids back in the sequels, 'Pitcher Black', 'Pitchest Black' and 'Beyond Pitchest Black'.",Null,0,2,9 December 2000
Divergent," Potato faced wimps are special snowflakes too
","Timid whinging dumpy teenage white girls, stop cutting yourself and believe that you too can win the love of Stud Bulgly, super hot head boy of GryffinGoth House.Being unable to make a decision about anything just shows how deep and special you are.Plus, skanky chest tattoos make you, like, super edgy and interesting. I bet you totally shop at Hot Topic.It doesn't matter how physically inept and clumsy you are, just as long as you let your hair grow long and brush it a hundred times every night as you whisper to yourself that one day your prince will come.The Mary-Sue is strong in this one.",3,1,1,15 October 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Wait for the DVD, it'll be even better!
","I hear that Wright is going to digitally replace Cera with Jar Jar binks in every scene. Early preview have shown a 90% reduction in unfocused feelings of rage and disgust among males in the 15-54 age brackets, and a 15% increase in arousal among females 18-34.If you can though, hold out for the BluRay, which will feature a scene where Cera is fed feet first into a wood chipper, slowly. Reportedly, his expression doesn't alter at all during the whole scene, and all that comes out is... wood chips.So, no, not a fan. Wright does all his usual jump-cut trickery, and finally with a budget to match his vision. Normally that would give a film a score close to fifty out of ten. Unfortunately, compressing the already trite source material down to under 2 hours minutes knocks off a couple of points, and then Michael Cera is a solid 300 point ding.Scott - and there's a slacker hipster emo douche name right off the bat - is a slacker hipster emo douche, let's be clear on that. Note carefully that the Pilgrim fans denying that are all slackers, hipsters, emos and/or douches. So there's your market, right there. Since he's that particular sort of 22 year old just-getting-creepy slacker hipster emo douche who nails hot high school girls, that takes high school slacker hipster emo douches out of the picture. God damn 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches, stealing our girls.And since slacker hipster emo douche over 22 can't nail high school girls without getting 10 to 15 in Federal, that's another slice out of the potential market.So, this is a film for 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches. The kind of 22 year old slacker hipster emo douche who play 25 year old 8 bit games. In short, this is a film that will actually have to 'find' its target audience by growing them in a vat. Should have spent some of the $120 million production and marketing budget on that, Universal.In all seriousness, there are only two things that you need to know about Scott Pilgrim: one, Michael Cera gets punched in the face. But two, he doesn't get punched enough. The end. Of Cera's career, hopefully, but sadly maybe of Wright's too. It really is a bitter-sweet story.",3,45,101,31 August 2010
Children of Men," The art of cinema refuses to lie down and die.
","An astonishing, breathtaking piece of cinematography. Well realised characters played to perfection, a true hero in the pre gun-porn fashion, flawless composition and direction, truly seamless merging of effects, an eclectic score, and a plot that is finely calculated to bring the viewer's involvement to a peak.Of all the great things about this film, it's the pacing that impressed me the most. It sets the dystopian tone firmly from the very start, but then throttles back a little. For a while it seems to be coasting, but this is just the prelude to a very gradual ramping up of the scenarios and intensity until by the time the final sequences roar onto the screen, your investment in the characters and their situation is absolute. This is helped by the often demonstrated fact that absolutely none of the protagonists in this film are untouchable, and that their demise can be instantaneous and unheralded. You cannot afford to look away for a second, and nor would you want to; I can't remember the last time I could say that about a film.The only point that can be criticised is the very occasionally clumsy exposition of the back-story to the dystopian world. However, most of that also serves as character development, so I can forgive this tiny flaw. The almost spooky similarities to the setting and tone of the computer game Half Life 2 are, given the production timing of the two pieces, either co-incidental, or due to them independently drawing on the same source material. And if being compared to Half Life 2 is the worst that you can say about a film, it's a high compliment indeed.",10,3,6,6 April 2007
Kong: Skull Island," Dreadful film about a huge, bloated, inhuman monster
","Its grimy, pockmarked, fat cheeked face infesting far too many scenes with its bestial grimacing and snarling.But enough about Brie Larson (not her real name).The rest of the film is really pretty decent, with a narrative that shuffles along nicely at a spanking pace, well made, and splendidly played by all of the cast.Except for Brie Larson (not her real name).They cast her in it.And so it's. Not. For. Me.",3,1,4,1 May 2019
Fantastic Four," The title is half right
","In that there are Four of them. But Fantastic? More like 'Mediocre', or 'Barely Adequate', or 'Contractually Sufficient'.For once, the reviewers were right. This film is a big, rambling, poorly conceived, sloppily scripted, shoddily acted pile of orange rubble. Avoid it, or suffer the consequences.It's hard to know where to begin, there's so much wrong with it. For a start, the acting 'talent' is AWOL. TV performers don't inevitably get lost on the big screen, but this cadre evited it. Alba turns in the exact same performance that she always does, going through her entire range, from 'pouty and petulant' to 'petulant and pouty'. Evans is either a strutting superannuated fratboy poseur, or for some reason is deliberately playing one so well that it's hard to tell the difference - either way, his character is thoroughly irritating and utterly unsympathetic. Chiklis is adequate, but is let down by the plain fact that he's a round little man in a big rubber muscle suit. This was a role for Ron Perlman, not Wimpy. Gruffudd is a huge disappointment; he has no screen presence, and his slightly out-of-his-depth portrayal of Hornblower is apparently the man, not the character. It would have been better if he had been invisible, as he manages to fade into the background with ease in every scene. McMahon is the only actor who appears to be enjoying himself, but as he's barely in the film, he can't rescue it.The script was apparently in development for ten years. I can't see why, as it's one scene, repeated ten times. If this is the refined version, I shudder to imagine what the raw cut would have been like. I find it hard to believe that the lines were written by, or for, adults. There's no real plot to the film, or even a story beyond 'Nasty self absorbed un-credible astronauts become nasty self absorbed un-credible 'super' heroes, then argue with each other for a while, take their clothes off for no reason, then beat up some poor disfigured guy apparently because he didn't join their little gang, roll credits.' Direction and cinematography was Filmschool #101, the score was instantly forgettable, and the editing was appalling, with the pacing in particular being random and rushed.The effects were only what we've come to expect from a hundred million dollar movie, which brings me to the big question: what on earth did they spend all that money on? It wasn't on the 'talent', either on-screen or off, it certainly wasn't on the rubber suit, and the effects couldn't have cost that much - or if they did, they were seriously over-charged.I have an idea where at least some of the budget went. From IMDb's Trivia section: 'Contains over 25 cameos from real life employees of Fox television affiliates.' And I strongly suspect that the IMDb records for this movie contain about 2,5000 comments and ratings and mutual approvals from about five of those real life employees. Reading the top recommended comments, most of which have 10 ratings, reveals a depressing pattern of almost identically styled raves from the likes of 'top10dude' and 'BigTenPower' with embarrassingly obvious track records of enthusing about, you guessed it, other shoddy Fox movies. When someone rates Elektra a 10, you have to just snort in disbelief at the audacity of it.I guess it's a pretty good investment for Fox, but this kind of astroturfing drastically reduces the usefulness of IMDb as an early review source. With time, this awful, foul mess of a movie will no doubt settle to its rightful place near the bottom of the ratings pile, but it's likely that the shill reviews will stay stubbornly at the top of the recommended pile for a long time to come. Beware; consider the source.[2013 update] To this day, the top 'recommended' comment is an early 10 rating from a member who signed up to IMDb just to rave about this one film using the minimum allowed size of review, and then never contributed again. What dedication!",2,114,196,5 October 2006
