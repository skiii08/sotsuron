Marie Antoinette," Disapppointing.
","Possibly one of the worst films I've seen this year. Unless you have read about Marie Antoinette before seeing this film, there is very little chance you'll know what's going on. All the major events in Marie Antoinette's life were either left out altogether or skimmed over with a slight reference, apart from the revolution obviously. The plot centred mainly on her love for shoes, food and clothes, although the one thing they did get right was the difficulty in consummating the marriage. The actors also made no effort to disguise their American accents, even though the film was set in France and the main characters were all supposed to be French or Austrian, which basically made the film more like a Sunday afternoon mini drama rather than a real cinema-type film. I didn't get a sense of the revolution either, as the main reference to this is Marie Antoinette being seen on a balcony by the 'mob'. It seemed as though one minute she was loved by the people and the next she was hated, with no real explanation as to why. The ending was also very disappointing and I was surprised to see the credits rolling when they did. All in all, I'd give this a miss if you haven't yet seen it.",3,2,3,31 March 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," A bit of a let down
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film as I'm very interested in the Tudor period. I was disappointed though to see that a lot of the dialogue had been lifted practically word for word from the adaption of Henry the 8th played by Ray Winstone and Helena Bonham Carter as Anne. Especially the scene where Catherine of Aragon meets Anne and Mary in the corridor before going into court and the court scene which tries Anne later on in the film. The two girls who play Anne and Mary in this are very good in their roles and manage to portray a convincing sister relationship. Eric Bana as Henry doesn't do it justice though, he just seems to walk around looking menacing. I never got a sense of just how long Anne and Henry had been together. In the film it looks like they've been together hardly two minutes when in reality they were together for 7 years before they got married. I realise that it's a lot to fit into just under 2 hours but the film Anne of the Thousand Days managed it very well. As with loads of these films, the film didn't do the book justice. The book focused more on Mary as the centre of the story while this was just another tale of Anne Boleyn with Mary on the sidelines. A story none of us needs to be told again. I was interested to see what they'd do with Mary as the main character but I felt like she was too much watered down. Even at her peak of Henry's affection, you never feel that shes just more than a wham bam thank you ma'am, instead of the real threat she was to Anne. The mother of Anne and Mary was turned into a caring woman who didn't like to see her daughters as pawns, but it didn't give the sense of Mary not being in control of her life. Mary's mother was just as ambitious as the rest of the family. Also there was absolutely no mention of Mary's husband after Henry got rid of her, or her later marriage. It was a good effort but it was a swing and a miss for me.",5,0,0,4 August 2008
Elizabeth," Well worth watching
","Elizabeth is one of my favourite films. Being an avid Tudor 'fan' I couldn't wait to see this when it first came out. Cate Blanchett gives a fantastic performance as the young Elizabeth who slowly evolves from an innocent girl to the Virgin Queen while also trying to keep Lord Robert happy. Obviously this film has changed some events to fit the story so don't watch it thinking it is historically accurate, as it isn't, but then it doesn't pretend to be. It isn't a documentary, it's a Hollywood film so of course things aren't to the letter. If they were the film would be around 8 hours long! i cant believe people have rated this film so low as I found it piqued my interest even further to learn more about this Queen and it had genuinely great moments provided by the great cast. Really well worth a watch.",10,0,0,21 January 2013
Twilight," Turn and run from the cinema!
","OK, so I've read the books twice and thought they were great, so I went to the cinema with my sister who hadn't read the books yet to see this film which I'd been looking forward to for ages.Biggest movie mistake ever! The actors were, to put it bluntly, crap. There was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between any characters. The acting was so wooden and the lines so cheesy that I literally covered my eyes at some points in embarrassment! Kirsten Stewart is extremely miscast as Bella. Every sentence she uttered was peppered with sighs, um's and halting stuttering speech, which basically made me want to throw something at the screen after a while. The only time this varied was the hospital scene. Edward tells her he'd be better off leaving her, and she does raise her voice an octave, even if it was a laughable delivery in what should have been a serious scene.I wonder if anyone told the actors that they can vary their tone and pitch when speaking, or if they were told to deliver every line in the same boring monotone? The effects were horrendous, the flash back of Carlisle and the werewolves was totally unnecessary and something a child could have come up with. I mean, great costumes guys! Just stick a flat cap on and some breeches and away we go! There we have a genuine flash back! My sister and I were in stitches for all the wrong reasons, mainly the bit where Edward sucks out the venom from Bella and the expression on his face when he's doing it! I mean, does he always go cross eyed when he feeds or what? It must have rubbed off on Bella anyway cos she was also cross eyed in this scene. Maybe it was an outtake they forgot to remove? The other characters don't get enough screen time for me to have an opinion of, but I do hope they use Alice more in the next film. She's the only one who seems to have a bit of promise.I hope Kirsten Stewart gets her finger out for New Moon, seeing as we're supposed to believe she's so in love with Edward she cant live without him. In Twilight it came across to me like he annoyed her a bit and she could take him or leave him really.Bad casting, bad effects and really bad directing made this film for me the years biggest flop. It should have gone straight to DVD.All in all, avoid this film like the plague!",1,10,13,6 December 2008
The Illusionist," You don't want to miss it
","This film is probably one of the best written and acted films I've seen.Edward Norton gives a very convincing and sexy performance to Eisenheim, which had me glued to the screen to see what types of illusions would come next. The guy who plays the Inspector is also brilliantly cast and gives a strong performance as we see him becoming less sure about the Prince until the showdown between them near the end. The woman who plays Sophie has really good chemistry with Eisenheim and were very convincing as a couple in love. This movie will have you glued to your seats in a real who-dunnit mystery and will leave you wanting to see a little bit more. Excellently written and a fab cast.",9,1,2,3 August 2008
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Much better than the other 4
","I have just returned from watching this film and i have to say it exceeded my expectations. The previous films have been a master class in how not to act but this film works. I cant believe im gonna say this but Kristen Stewart wasn't totally awful! The film trots along at a good pace and has a fantastic ending which you just don't see coming. The new vamps we meet are great and Michael Sheen, well, shines as Aro. I honestly thought my sister and I would have a good laugh poking fun at this film as we have the previous ones but i found it gripping. Bella is sooo much more likable as a vamp and Edward seems to have shifted that constipation that seemed to be bothering him in the other 4 films and is much more relaxed and normal. Billy Burke as usual puts in a great performance as Charlie and Taylor Lautner comes into his own as Jacob. The only eye roll moment for me was the obvious and very badly animated CGI baby, although luckily we don't see much of it. This film had me both chuckling and gasping in shock at all the right places. Im so glad they got the last film nailed as it goes some way to redeeming the others before it. Pleasantly surprised.",8,6,13,18 November 2012
