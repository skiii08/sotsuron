Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Return to Story Driven Cinema
","VOLUME 1 of KILL BILL was really all about the action - a pure revenge film dipping into every '70's action genre one could imagine, and director/writer Tarantino can imagine quite a lot of them. There wasn't much character development, nor a great deal of plot. But that left more room for what it was really about - Tarantino proving his walk was as good as his talk. He had talked about action for years, and with VOLUME 1 he delivered; enough for any five action films, I think.So it was the return to an earlier Tarantino type of character developed, story driven film that really threw me in VOLUME 2. Now that's not to say there isn't any action. KILL BILL VOLUME 2 has got that covered. But in this one we study all the background, the motives, and the characters themselves. Mostly these elements are given in an old fashioned storytelling style, told from one character to another, in that kind of conversational realism Tarantino has made popular all over again, but which he and few others have really mastered. We are given many little storytelling scenes, about this or that - I'm not going to give anything away here. But it all adds up, at least to me, the way all those little storytelling scenes worked together for the whole in PULP FICTION.It's this storytelling element that really gives meaning and depth to all the craziness that was unleashed in VOLUME 1. It's clear how much the two films are actually just one story. Without the second, the first is just action fun. Characters doing crazy things to each other without much reason behind it. But with VOLUME 2, we have the scope and the motives and intentions of those actions. We finally get inside these characters, and that, for me, is the best part of the storytelling process. At the end of VOLUME 1, O-Ren Ishii might have been the only character I understood at all. Even The Bride was a bit of a mystery, and we didn't even know her real name. Now, I feel like I know them all. They are distinct, in the way perhaps the Magnificent Seven are, in my mind.Now I don't want to give the impression this is a slow film. It's quite a bit longer than the first, but the time just flew by and I was surprised when it was over. Wonderful editing and pacing are the keys here, not to mention riveting dialogue, and action that comes out of nowhere like a truck driving into your living room on a quiet evening. Tarantino still has the element of surprise in hand. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the talents he's assembled in cast and crew. The film is just as clever to watch as the dialogue is to hear. Buddy Robert Rodriguez even makes an assist on the music soundtrack.Tarantino has once again bravely side stepped the industry trends, turned the formula on it's head, and delivered the more thoughtful, deeper elements in the second half of the story. The audience is then rewarded with a superior, unpredictable second installment that may leave those 'check-your-brain-at-the-door' fans a bit disappointed, but gives the rest of us, as The Bride puts it, 'bloody satisfaction'. Well done.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," No New Ground Broken for SuperHeroes
","In the middle of watching X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, I had this feeling like I'd seen it before. It was the 10:15am showing on opening day, so that wasn't right. But since the first X-MEN installment some 10 years ago, there have been quite a number of films in the superhero genre. Before that first X-MEN, it was pretty difficult to get it right; up until then, I wasn't sure anyone except director Richard Donner (SUPERMAN) had a clue what makes a hero super, or what makes a movie about that hero a good one.These days, I'd say that Hollywood's got it down cold. They can crank these superhero flicks out with quite a bit of money and not a lot of thought. It's a science. Which is kind of how it felt to watch WOLVERINE. Steely cold science. Impressive at times, sure, but not a surprise. Thrill ride? Sort of. Maybe more like building the roller coaster than riding it.Don't get me wrong, everything looked great. The score was another solid one from Harry Gregson-Williams. The sound design was crisp and in-your-face, like it should be with a modern action film. Plus, we actually had some acting from, you know, actors (I'm talking specifically about Liev Schreiber - and now I like him as an action guy too). There were even a couple of (small) surprises along the way. It was by no means unpleasant. It just wasn't SPIDER-MAN 2. Actually it reminded me at times of watching 'Heroes' on TV. But with more money on the screen. Lots more.We're now at a point where the whole superhero movie genre has laid out one big formula for itself. Going beyond that for the screenwriters and directors doing new superhero movies is going to be a tough nut to crack. DARK KNIGHT showed us it was possible (although I'm not admitting it was entirely a break from formula as some have claimed - just that it did a better job at enhancing said formula). WOLVERINE does not, however, move us beyond what's already been done and said about heroes. It's just 'this year's model'.I still had fun. I didn't feel cheated. But another one like this, and maybe I will. Six out of 10 stars.",6,0,3,5 May 2009
The Village," Still a Smart Movie, but We're Smarter Now
","Most of us have seen director / writer M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, and many have seen his other  widely released films. I've even seen his earlier gem, WIDE AWAKE. And I like everything I've seen. Let me re-state that, I love everything I've seen, until now. Everything in THE VILLAGE looked great, the actors were all in good form, and it even gives us something to think about. But I have to admit, this is his weakest effort. The problem, however, is not the movie we're seeing, but when we're seeing it.Mr. Shyamalan has taught his audience well. Ever since SIXTH SENSE, we've learned that when watching one of his films, any minute now (and certainly by the last few minutes), things will be turned on their head and some kind of clever plot twist will be revealed. Sometimes it's more subtle than others, and requires a little more focus, but it's always been there. And it's in THE VILLAGE as well (though I wouldn't give it away if you paid me real money - and shame on those who have).M. Night has affectively created his own problem, by making us smart to his plot trickery over the years. The bar is raised and he raised it. If THE VILLAGE had come out right after - or before - SENSE, I think we'd all be raving about it. But it's not 1999, and we've had quite a few twists and surprises from the director. Now we're prepared, we're looking, expecting it. We've learned his style, maybe some of us know it as well as he does. And that's really the issue.I think M. Night has done a great job of writing suspense stories, and in learning his style many of us have also learned to spot his hints. We go in focused and alert, with our thinking caps on so to speak, because we know it's not Explosion Movie Part 6. I believe it's this reason that left me with fewer surprises and less satisfaction walking out of the theater. The story - and again it's a good one - had me looking constantly for clues, and then just waiting for the confirmation of my suspicions; that's a lot less fun than what we all got at the end of SIXTH SENSE. All my whining aside, there are much, much worse films to see and I was still pleasantly entertained. I hope everyone still has fun seeing it, and it's still a smart film - he hasn't sunken to dumbing things down as yet. But I also hope Mr. Shyamalan clues into his own smart audience and figures out how to write a story that makes us think we're going where he usually goes, then doesn't. That's the one I'd like to see next, but that would be a big challenge for any writer. I do think he's up to that challenge, but time will tell. Until then, THE VILLAGE is still good (maybe great for some other director), but really not up to the M. Night standard. That bar, in my book, sits pretty high.",6,0,0,5 August 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Better After the End Credits...
","First - I want to address everyone who's already seen X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. If you left during the end credits (or even earlier, as did some viewers in the show I attended), you missed something that easily raised my vote half a star or so: the last scene of the movie.If you haven't seen THE LAST STAND, make sure you SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS. I'm not going to give anything away, but I think it's worth the extra few minutes. It's interesting that more and more films do have something during, in the middle of, or after the end credits. Since I sit there until the house lights go up or the film runs off the reel, it feels more like a bonus feature, just for a patient moviegoer. But in this case, it's a crucial scene, left quite literally for the very end.Director Brett Ratner has a strong action film background which includes the RUSH HOUR series, and there's some very solid action sequences here. As a kid reading The X-Men comics, it was really the fight scenes that kept me turning the pages. The film media lends itself perhaps even more to that kind of physical storytelling. THE LAST STAND does not disappoint in this area.Personally I think this franchise needed at least one entry that was firmly planted in the action category and THE LAST STAND is it. What I hope is that it doesn't become the rule, and that more character driven sequels are in its future. There are now a wealth of superheroes (and villains) presented to us in this X-Men series, and we could stand to learn a lot more about each of them.This time, however, story wasn't the point, as much as it was a tool to setting up the action. It's almost a Hong Kong martial arts approach; a bridge just to get you to the next fight scene. But with actors like Ian McKellan, those bridges seem much more rewarding. Honestly, he's such a solid Magneto that much of the film owes him a lot for holding things together when the plot gets flimsy. Kudos also to casting Kelsey Grammar as one of my favorite old-time X-Men, Beast. He was spot-on, in my book, and seeing Beast and Angel finally brought into the film story just made it feel complete in a way the other two movies did not.In making movies out of other media like comic books, there's always going to be some fairly severe story compression. In that process, characters are often quite distorted from their original print versions, and I understand anyone who has objections about how Iceman or any of the other characters have been treated in this series with regard to origins, respective ages, and so on. I admit my own disappointment in the handling of Juggernaut, who could have been a plot point, not to mention a deeper character, all on his own. And I've never liked the way Cyclops has been portrayed in any of the films, though I don't believe the problem is with actor James Marsden, but rather how his character has been written.Rather than debate those details and give anything away, I'll just say that film is not the printed word (or the well-drawn comic), and there are always concessions. This is not the most serious or character rich entry into the series, but it's a lot of fun, especially if you want to play 'spot the superhero or villain'. There are certainly more of them here than the other 2 films combined. And many film goers, who are unfamiliar with the comic stories, won't be bothered by any of the omissions or deviations from the comics.So if you're expecting the kind of serious approach present in the recent BATMAN BEGINS, this isn't really in that league. If, however, you're looking for an amped up action entry and like the Marvel characters, this is probably going to be a good night out. Make sure to get there early enough to see the 20th Century Fox fanfare (with the slightly lingering 'X'), and don't leave during the end credits, or you'll miss the end of the movie!",7,1,2,26 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Best Potter To Date
","HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the fourth film in the franchise, and the better of the four. I believe it's better on almost every level, except perhaps if you think the stories needed to stay light. GOBLET OF FIRE is the one that finally gets serious. Mentioning the serious tone, I must comment upfront that there is good reason for a PG-13 rating. Younger viewers could have some trouble (nightmares?) with some of the villains and creatures we meet here. The subject matter does grow quite dark at times, and there are moments bordering on horror. I rarely agree with the MPAA on their ratings, but this time I think it's justified; you've been warned.The darker, more serious nature of the film makes perfect sense, however. Potter and his school mates are older, and the tone of the film rings with it. More serious issues are brought to the surface, and some more adult themes, as Harry approaches adulthood. More than that, the film is the first to take itself more seriously, and I think it's just the change the series needed. The Harry Potter series overall is really not so original. It borrows from so many fantasy stories and films that I can hardly count the references any longer. It's been one of the more annoying points about the franchise overall (and why I have trouble giving higher marks to this or any of the films). There are some tangents the story takes that linger a bit long, but I've felt that was true for all the POTTER films. It's the old problem of what to leave in from the book, and what to cut. I certainly would have shorted scenes to bring down that 2 1/2 hour run time. But with GOBLET OF FIRE, we do begin to move past most of the clichés and dive deeper into the characters and some of the more creative story arc ideas, and that's certainly progress.That is not to say that the humor and fun is gone. While the laughs are tempered to fit the story, they are frequent enough without seeming forced. The acting by the young stars is better, showing that they've grown into their roles. The older actors are great as always, and new to the series is the wonderful Brendan Gleeson, and another fine actor - who I won't mention for fear of giving away a plot point. The special effects are I think standard for movies of this type - I saw nothing that really wowed me, but then again everything was strongly designed and rendered, with few if any seams showing. The music is new as well: John Williams' themes are still present, but the baton has been passed on to highly capable Patrick Doyle. He sheds new light on old motifs and generally breaths life into the musical storytelling once again. It seemed as if Williams was bored by the last film, and it's nice to hear something new even as director Mike Newell took us in a different, darker, more grown-up direction. He even found a way out of the standard Harry Potter opening scenes - I'm sure you know what I mean.For GOBLET OF FIRE to be the 4th in the series - where sequels usually sag and creak and we run out of the theater wondering what possessed us to go in the first place - it is a milestone from that perspective. I can think of few fourth outings worthy of anything but direct-to-video or late, late night TV. Moreover, it made me actually look forward to - instead of dread - the next in the series.",7,1,2,22 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," What is it about second installments?
","It seems like so many second installments of trilogies fall below the mark of the first and the third. There are, of course, exceptions (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for one). For example, while very entertaining, so much of BACK TO THE FUTURE PART 2 was about getting us to Part 3 that I think it really suffered as a whole. And TEMPLE OF DOOM is infamous for starting the PG-13 rating, if it wasn't enough to just be a letdown. I mean, if Spielberg and Zemeckis struggle with those second parters, heaven help anyone else.So it is, it seems, with the Matrix trilogy. By the time Reloaded was made, it appeared as if all references to what made the first film so entertainingly original were overshadowed by pseudo intellectual psycho-babble and ultra-expensive effects. To be fair, it's been said that something is only new once, and that's certainly an idea working against anything following such an original action piece as THE MATRIX. And again, now that a larger story has been coerced out of the first movie's principle universe, the usual and unfortunate amount of setup must be done to motivate us toward the third installment.My fingers are crossed, that Revolutions somehow makes sense out of Reloaded. That would at least justify it's existence. When I entered the theater, I was really hoping for a 'Two Towers' level followup, something that really moved the story forward and gave us really exciting new characters instead of throw aways. But as I left the theater, all I really felt I got from Reloaded, was a good long car chase.",3,0,0,6 October 2003
Signs," Another M.Night winner
","To say anything about the content of this movie (perhaps even more so than with Sixth Sense), is to spoil it. But if you like M. Night's past work, you won't be disappointed here. Great attention to detail, mostly subtle performances, and of course a 'where is this going' storyline. 'Signs' will remind you why Shyamalan is one of the best writer/directors out there.",9,0,1,3 August 2002
Kagemusha," Brilliant on Scales Large and Small
","KAGEMUSHA is a film I've liked better each time I've watched it. Having just viewed the latest Criterion DVD release, I found myself so captivated that I could not help but give it my highest rating. I'd grown so accustomed to the washed out colours of older prints that I felt like I was watching a different movie altogether - that is until the final unmistakable 45 minutes, which were burned into my memory on the first viewing. As others have commented, the director's use of colour and light is simply stunning.Watching the film again also helped crystallize in my mind another pacing element director Kurosawa seems to have completely made his own: the balance between dialogue heavy scenes that drive the characters and offer exposition for the story, and those scenes that are visually driven. In KAGEMUSHA in particular, I saw how these two scene styles are completely divided. There is almost no dialogue whatsoever in a visually driven scene (I would be tempted to call these 'action' scenes); these are all about light, colour, movement, and (unlike modern convention and certain film executive's fears that all must be verbally explained) use little or no dialogue to communicate what we see so clearly played out. Both types tell the story with delicate pacing and great depth - perhaps too much for many moviegoers used to a faster pace and more shallow characters (that's not a slight - it's just what we're all used to these days, myself included).Ultimately it is this balance of dialogue and vision that gives the film such power. I'm probably in the minority, but I actually enjoy this film more than RAN, although both to me are similar in some ways, and yet unique in film as a whole. I was trying to think of weak points in the film, but I simply couldn't. To me it's 3 hours of near-perfect cinema.Director Kurosawa has made a few of my favorite films, including HIGH AND LOW (more correctly translated Heaven and Hell), RED BEARD, and IKIRU. KAGEMUSHA now joins that list, and should have long ago if not for my mistaking bad film prints for lack of visual quality - shame on me. I will also mention that fans of movies with dream sequences (is that a sub-genre?) should not miss the one here. Highly recommended.",10,2,5,10 April 2005
Fantastic Four," Good - but not up to the New Standard
","If FANTASTIC FOUR had come out a few years ago, my vote might be 7 stars instead of 6 - maybe even 8. It was fun and exciting in the way many summer movies can be. But it came out this summer, after SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2; and right after BATMAN BEGINS. Before these movies, I believed that no one had really done the kind of translation of a comic book to big screen that I believed was possible. Even SUPERMAN, while really great for it's time, had some real flaws. But with the 3 movies stated above, my expectations weren't just met, they were exceeded.Because FANTASTIC FOUR has to follow a couple of benchmarks, and share the summer with the best BATMAN story ever filmed (who knew we needed another one?), it unfortunately doesn't look quite as good as it might have. On the other hand, knowing what preceded it should have better equipped the filmmakers.For example, the first rule of my New Standard in filming comic book stories, is having a terrific script, with a strong ending...which I realize every movie should, but especially with this genre often does not. The second rule is getting the casting perfect. And the third might be balancing the origin plot (if that's what you're doing), which has to be exposition, with engaging storytelling that has enough action to feel like the genre.The cast was good, (and when is Michael Chiklis less than great!), but needed to be just the right fit for these characters. I mean, SPIDER-MAN 2 cast the brilliant Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, and BATMAN BEGINS had so many heavy hitters in the cast I won't take the space to list them. Needless to say, when you follow a movie that has Michael Caine as Alfred (!), you better get your own casting perfect. With FOUR, it never felt quite right. I know Alba was the popular choice for Sue Storm, but I never believed she was Sue. And that's a problem. The same goes for Reed Richards. He was fine, but it didn't seem like the actor really embodied the character. Conversely, I didn't think Tobey Maguire could do Peter Parker before I saw SP1, but he completely owned that character.The other issue for FOUR was the script. It felt incomplete. Sure, origin stories are very difficult, but Sam Raimi showed everyone how to do it right. Of course, he only had one hero, to be fair; here we have 4 times the origin plot.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD *** But the big problem for me was the type of ending we got on this one: It is completely internal in nature. By that I mean the threat does not extend beyond our heroes to the 'real' world. In fact, there's a scene in the middle of the picture that feels much more exciting because the threat extends to 'normal' people, the innocent bystanders, as it were. In this kind of story telling, this early in the character's movie development, the world (or city or loved ones) have to be at great risk for the heroes to really have a victory. After all, the super heroes will surely be OK (at least that's what we feel) so the threat needs to extend beyond them. It never really did, and the ending felt anti-climactic. In line with this, the revealing of the villain in his 'super' form took so long, that the movie was almost over by the time we finally got to see him in costume. That might be a pacing problem, or unfamiliarity by the filmmakers with the genre, I'm not sure. But it peaked in the middle and never got better. Even THE INCREDIBLES understood when to reveal the villain, and what had to be at stake for a proper hero ending.*** END OF SPOILERS *** I could really knit pick and ask why Johnny Storm wasn't blonde (or Sue for that matter, although at least she had some sort of dye job going on). But I think the bigger issue was really choice of cast, and overall story developments (or lack thereof).So did I have fun? Well, sure. If you don't know the Fantastic Four from the books, you'll probably have fun. But I feel we still haven't seen a definitive version of this classic comic story on screen. It just didn't quite seem like the Four I remember.",6,0,1,13 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better with perspective
","I believe films that are really worthwhile are proved out by the test of time. One can really enjoy a movie upon it's first viewing, but over the years it may feel dated, or  not as moving or exciting, when put up against both older and newer films in the same genre. Episode V is 23 years old as of this writing, and it's holding up pretty well in my mind. So as we're closing the LOTR trilogy this season, I was reminded of another trilogy - one that sparked the imaginations of many filmmakers to come, and really made films like RETURN OF THE KING possible. After all, if the second Star Wars movie had bombed, trilogies in big budget filmmaking would probably not have been a popular consideration afterward. And so would we have seen movies like BACK TO THE FUTURE with arcing storylines through three films? Perhaps not.The strengths of the film are the strengths of the filmmakers, and where they were in their lives and careers at the time. A young Harrison Ford, a George Lucas who was willing to truly collaborate, a Lawrence Kasdan at his writing prime - I could go on about the cast and crew, but you get my point. I am not sure if the same people, would it be possible, assembled in 2003, could make as good of a movie as they did then. Timing, as they say, is everything.What we got out of that timing, was the strongest Star Was story told to date, with the best special effects of their time, deeper insight into memorable characters,  the darkest, most brooding (and involving) atmosphere in the trilogy, and a couple of serial-type classic plot twists. In the saga it remains unequaled; in the fantasy / science fiction genre it's a groundbreaker; and for a 23 year old space epic, it's about as timeless as they come.",10,0,1,21 December 2003
