The Ring," You never realized watching a David Lynch short would be so deadly
","Spoilers below.I'm not sure exactly what I expected with 'The Ring' beyond what the preview lays out for you. It's a horror film. It has some twist about a video tape that kills people. It's edgy and uses those nifty effects that horror directors use these days to make things seem creepy.I suppose the thing I expected most out of 'The Ring' was to be scared. Or at least, recognize an attempt to frighten the audience. Sadly, too much of the film relies on BIG LOUD BURSTS OF SOUND to cause the audience to jump. In the theatre I was in, this was the most common way that the audience got 'scared' and that's a real s****y sign in a horror movie. The overall 'scary' plot wasn't bad, but ultimately didn't hit home as being anything special, even though the director desperately wanted it to be.The film stars Naomi Watts as the young, less-perky-than-in-Mullholand-Drive investigative reporter who decides to follow up on a rumor/legend after her niece dies. The film gets a little unclear at this point, partly to keep the audience guessing but also I suspect because the writer didn't have a clear idea of where he wanted to go with the plot. Watts discovers that her niece and three other teens watched a video tape and all died seven days later. While her niece was found in a weird mummified state following a sudden heart stoppage, the other teens had died in a car crash and committed suicide. The ways they die aren't really thought of as important however, because we know that it was really watching the tape that killed them.Watts tracks down the tape and promptly watches it. The tape was supposed to be disturbing, but I found myself wondering how much they paid David Lynch to use part of Eraserhead. Watts gets a phone call telling her that she only has seven days left. She then discovers that her face won't appear right on film. Freaked out, she promptly shows the tape to her son's father, then leaves a copy laying around so her son can see it too. Spooked but determined to use her investigative skills to track down a solution to her mess, she digs deeper into the mystery of the tape and why it kills people. This leads Watts on a merry chase through Pacific Northwest charm until she discovers that a young girl was drowned by her mother in a well and that by diving in and holding her as she crumbles the 'curse' is lifted. Everyone is happy. except this was all just a big bait and switch, and now the dead girl is free to run amuck and kills her boyfriend. Luckily, Watts doesn't have to worry about getting killed because she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else, thus lifting the curse from her.Of course, this makes little sense. Burn marks appear on her arm. She is still having problems with bleeding noses and ears and other strange things. Presumably she should have been free from the 'curse' the second she made a copy of the tape and showed it to someone else. But, whatever. Horror films aren't keen on logic, and this one is no exception. which is a shame since it wanted to be more unique. But ultimately the film relies on the standard horror elements to see it through:* Loud jarring music to spook the audience * Creepy looking kids * Girl in distress and various states of undress * Twist endingWatching the film may give you the impression that you've seen it before. You have. The film is a remake, and the original ('Ringu') is far spookier. This DreamWorks adaptation isn't quite the bomb that 'The Haunting' was, but it is a pale copy of the original. Part of the key of making a good horror film is getting the audience to care about the characters getting axed. In this case, you just don't care and wait for the inevitable gore to take place. When the film (rated PG-13) doesn't bother delivering even that...",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
Unbreakable," A surprisingly strong film
","This part of this review is a non-spoiler for those of you who wish to be surprised by the film. In a few paragraphs you will be warned that spoiler material is about to arrive.Unbreakable is a film done by M. Night Shyamalan, the man who wrote and directed the surprise hit 'The Sixth Sense' and later the very awful 'Signs'. The Sixth Sense was well regarded by many largely because of the surprise ending, and by the realization that Bruce Willis can actually act. However, while the Sixth Sense was well regarded by critics and filmgoers, after you know the surprise it lost much of its luster. The Sixth Sense was also massively flawed in several key areas which made repeat viewings difficult and often painful. The young boy star of the film also became quickly overexposed, and proved to be a fairly dense representative of his craft.Unbreakable is similar in several ways, and many are drawing quick parallels between the two. Both films are by the same director. Both films star Bruce Willis. Both are within the thriller genre. The filming style is near identical between the two. Most importantly, both are advertised as having 'twist' endings.However, while the films are similar on paper, the actual resemblance is like comparing a dinner at McDonalds to a fine steak dinner in a five star restaurant. While the Sixth Sense banked on the twists to ultimately make the film, Unbreakable delivered without the cheap tricks needed to catch the audience. The Sixth Sense was a decent film on the surface... but Unbreakable is a great film in nearly every aspect.Warning: The below material is considered a spoiler.The big surprise with Unbreakable lies with Samuel Jackson. Unbreakable stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson, with both men on opposite ends of the spectrum. This is key to the film, and one of the reasons that Unbreakable is a far better film than the Sixth Sense. Unlike the goofy secret in that film that doesn't hold up if you think about it long enough... this one makes good sense, and the clues left throughout the film actually lead logically to the ending.Unbreakable is a superhero film, but it's not obvious to casual viewers because in the past superhero films are filmed as action flicks and not as thriller/dramas. The closest film to Unbreakable would be Darkman, but even that film had an 'over the top' feel that Unbreakable does not. Unbreakable actually does seem like a 'real' superhero film... and so it works as one of the best ever made, if not *the* best ever made. The film is a very smartly done tip of the hat to the comic book genre.Bruce Willis is unable to be harmed physically, has superhuman strength, and the ability to read evil intent through touch. He also has a good heart... and has made huge sacrifices in his life for others. He doesn't know that he has powers, and his discovery of this fact is the main focus of the film. His family life is a wreck, but like his powers the reasons behind this are revealed over the course of the film. Unbreakable is a story of discovery, and it nicely fits that the various plots of the film are rolled out over time rather than being simply thrust at you. By writing the film this way the audience grows into the movie and thus it is far more effective in selling the emotions and trials of the characters.Samuel Jackson, as mentioned above, is the opposite of Willis. Born with a bone disease, Jackson is accident prone. Over his life he has had more than 60 fractures, and now lives his life with extreme care. Padding lines the walls of his car, his home and shop is equipped with ramps and handlebars. He's live his life with this disease, and because of the lack of physical activity he started reading comic books at a young age. This fact seems trivial, but it effected his thinking. Jackson reasoned that if he was more accident prone, there must be someone who is less accident prone. Thus, Jackson has began searching for great tragedies that had one key element: they had one survivor. One person who miraculously survived without a scratch.Samuel Jackson is the villain in the film. The disease which wrecked his life has also led to an obsession to find his opposite. Not only did he look into great tragedies to find the sole survivor... Samuel Jackson decided to actually cause the tragedies to speed his search. His villainy fits with the comic feel of the film in several ways which are revealed throughout the film.If you have read this far, there aren't really any secrets left. This won't stop you from enjoying what is an amazingly good film. Bruce Willis doesn't have a demanding acting role in this film... but perhaps because of that he seems brilliant in his role. Casting can be key to the success of a film... and this film was cast very, very well.",10,0,0,15 October 2002
The Transporter," Urk.
","Some spoilers included.The Transporter had these brief moments where you thought to yourself, 'Well, it isn't going to be any kind of intelligent movie, but at least it will be passibly entertaining.' Then the movie would wander from averagely dull to amazingly s**tty.The Transporter didn't have any 'big name stars' and that was a plus... as watching Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise 'act' their way through the film would have been torture. With more of an unknown in the lead (Jason Statham who has starred in Snatch, Ghosts of Mars and The One) you wind up hoping for the best: that the actor will tap into some hidden pool of talent and really deliver in the performance. This never really takes place. Statham looks cool enough shooting and kicking people, but this will only take you so far. While the plot at first seems to be trying something interesting, before long it becomes obvious that the writer just watched a bunch of other action films over the last five years and cut and pasted them together to make his movie. Again, this wouldn't be a problem if the film wasn't so bad in places. There is a difference between going to see something very clever and going to see something fun. Your hopes for 'clever movie' vanish within a few minutes, but it takes about twenty for you to realize that you're not even going to get fun.The film begins copying the Saint, with Statham playing the role of disillusioned military guy Frank Martin who has gone to work as a transporter of goods. Any kind of goods. The gimmick is that Statham doesn't ask questions about the cargo, and as long as you (a) pay the fee and (b) give precise instructions you're good to go. Statham has three rules, first 'don't change the deal'. Second, 'no names'. Third, 'never look at/in the cargo'. So of course, the movie follows the plotline of establishing that Statham is great at what he does and that makes him a cold and unemotional person, until he breaks all of his rules and becomes a nice guy concerned with saving the world.Like most good action films, all it takes is a nice ass to get our hero to renounce his evil ways and become a decent guy. The shift is pretty abrupt too, as not less than ten minutes earlier in the film we see Statham happily killing two policemen and stuffing them in the truck. The plotline of 'killer with the heart of gold turned to the good side of the force thanks to a nice ass' has been used several thousand times in the past, and it's no more interesting here. In The Transporter the role of the nice ass is played by Qi Shu, who has been in a ton of international films. She's no better because of it. In her role, she gets to play wary captured victim turned happy housewife turned sex starved slut turned cold missionary for the people to helpless victim to daddy's girl to daddy's murderer. It's as logical a transformation as you can imagine.There are several plot holes in the film... but does anyone really care? In a film like this you are often willing to overlook gaping plot holes in favor of just having a good time. When the good time doesn't deliver, you're left wondering what exactly you did get out of the movie. To help, here's a quick list:1. François Berléand is decent in his role as the slightly suspecting police chief. One has memories of Pink Panther films, and at this stage in the film you're begging for any kind of relief... comedy or otherwise.2. The opening car chase scene is almost fun. Of course, my BMW doesn't drive like that and never, ever will.3. Unintentional comedy spots throughout the movie; the BMW is a super car that drives pel mel through the city and at one point leaps onto a semi-truck carrying other cars... but later in the film it gets a flat tire for no apparent reason. The guy has an amazing house and is very paranoid, but apparently didn't bother to invest in a security system. And on it goes...4. The director tries to make fight scenes innovative, but has no real concept of what is interesting and what is goofy. The height of this comes as Statham beats up eight bad guys in a bus station by pouring oil all over them and the floor, and then putting bicycle foot pedals on his own feet so he alone can stand and fight.The Transporter isn't a good movie. It isn't Blair Witch 2 bad, but it isn't good. When you finally get the full picture of what our hero is fighting against, and it turns out to be a couple hundred people sold into the slave trade who are stored in cargo bins... well, it's just hard to get excited about it. Over in Mission Impossible 2 they are giving you death viruses. In the James Bond films the bad guy is trying to blow up the world. In this one we get a group of people stuffed in the back of a semi-truck with their luggage. It looks more like an Saturday night on the Mexico border than any kind of evil plot.Yeah, the movie has action. But it's often too goofy to really care about. Yeah, the movie has music, but going from classical to techno pop as the car races around the city isn't a charming mix. Yeah, the girl has a nice body... but it's hard to care when the acting is so god-awful. Which really sums up the whole film:Hard to care.",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
