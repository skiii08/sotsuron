The Blair Witch Project," I finally forced myself to watch this, and I'm glad I did.
","Let me first say that I almost always hate the 'found footage' type of horror film because, let's face it, you're fooling no one. It's just a cheap and easy method to add some scare to the audience by attempting to make them believe that what they're watching actually happened and, although unlikely, could potentially happen to them.But TBWP was different, although it's a clearly fictional plot, I got really into it. The acting that's been criticised as 'amateurish' for me, made the movie. You're meant to believe that this trio are making their own documentary, so their acting is going to be that of amateurs and, for me, Donahue Leonard and Williams all did a fantastic job of portraying this to the audience. With the addition of the hand-held camera style of shooting, it all comes together to really make you feel like you're in the woods with them.The storyline is a great idea and very original, but I can see why others hate it. If by watching a horror movie you're looking to jump out of your seat or see something gruesome then no, this isn't for you. But the spikes of suspense created in this film makes you really on edge and even though you know from the start what happens to the three characters, you're more and more anxious as to how it all happens as the film goes on.A definite must-see for any horror movie lover, 8/10.",8,0,5,15 March 2015
