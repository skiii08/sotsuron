Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Watch this Movie
","Borat is a deeply disturbing but extremely funny movie; I guess that's why the only other comment on IMDb so far, has been so very negative.It's a great movie, but if you're racist, nationalist, or not able to laugh at yourself then don't bother because this movie will just make you angry & you'll hate it.The point of this movie, what he was trying to do (apart from trying to make a funny film) was to highlight many facets of the ingrained cultural bullshit / implicit bigotry that we endure constantly, without even thinking about it. Naturally, breaking/bending cultural barriers will always cause a lot of offense.So that means that making this film was a risky business. The film was a lawsuit magnet - i think i remember reading somewhere that there were over 70 suits against the company at the final count. Not least is Pamela Anderson's suit as a result of her attempted kidnapping, live on camera (probably unrehearsed, unwarned, etc) by dropping a sack over her head.Regardless, if you are capable of watching this movie with an open mind, and are prepared for some pretty shocking scenes (including graphic humor in very, very bad taste), then prepare yourself for some non-politically correct laughs. It really is very, very funny! Personally, I thought it was brilliant. I have nothing but respect for Sacha Baron Cohen, having seen him as Ali G previously. I give this movie the 9/10 that it deserves, the man is a genius. From Wikipedia's page on Cohen: 'His work has been recognized with several Emmy nominations, an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, a BAFTA award and a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his work in the feature film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.'This is a seminal work and in future might be considered a pivotal point in cultural evolution; while the humor is mostly of the lowest sort, it only makes sense as humor if you have a balanced, non-bigoted point of view. This attitude has always been Cohen's genius.As a side note, I found it very interesting to look at the age restrictions across various countries -- Scandanavian countries by far the lowest, followed by South America, then the rest of the world.",9,1,6,30 August 2007
