Iron Man 3," They killed the history
","Honestly where can I start. I felt the need to express my anger.I understand how most people say it is good because the movie is a decent action movie if you completely ignore anything about Iron Man, watched and understood previous movies, if you have never read any comics, watched any cartoons or simply went onto the Marvell Wiki and get some background information. Actors great work as usual, they did their best with the garbage the writer and director gave them. I imagine if the story was kept just to the extremis series then it would have been better.How could Disney and Marvel allow this rubbish on screen to destroy the franchise?Sadly I was so looking forward to this movie and I watched Iron Man 1 2 and The Avengers before. To my surprise nothing from the previous movies linked into this one, the director and writer destroyed any history behind the technology and characters. These are the people that didn't have the decency to watch the previous movies, read any comics, watch any cartoons or the easiest thing to at least go on wiki and read up before coming up with some half assed movie. I won't even mention what they did to the fans, comic buffs or anyone that grew up knowing the Marvel heroes. If I could sum it up it would be like someone taking the Holy Bible or another holy book and making a parody out of it, blasphemy. They ruined the Iron Man, the man behind it and the most notorious villain. I wanted to see the Mandarin in all his special effects glory.I don't want to give spoilers but the quality of the suits? I guess it is the new i-man suits low on charge, running out of juice when you need it most and full of bugs. The ending? Seriously (it had the most screwed up issues contradicting previous movies and marvel history)? On the plus I hope Pepper joins The Avengers next:))))))))))They did to Iron Man what was done to Mass Effect 3 (pooping on the fans), so I will chose to ignore this movie stop at Iron Man 2 and not add it to my collection hoping that a remake will come along to salvage it or that Avengers 2 will make up for this pile of garbage.",1,5,12,29 August 2013
Cloverfield," Not impressed at all
","I agree with the many bad comments about this film, I won't repeat what it has been said but I have to be amazed at what people think it's great and entertaining these days, are we that ignorant and accept mediocre stuff for what we get charge plenty?? Every person out there could make a film like this, maybe not the special effects but with a good Mac/Pc and some knowledge in graphics you could.I seriously doubt it's worth paying the cinema price to see this. If you really want to see it wait until it comes on rental. This film encourages piracy... it really does.I couldn't agree more about the 'friend' with the camera... 'what time is the evacuation?' '0600 hours' 'huh what time is that?' '6 o'clock' 'huh I knew that' DOH!!!!! hello... how stupid can you be, any need to even put that in... was that meant to be funny? That is one example, as there are countless ones...I really love films where the characters behave like a normal person would in a situation, seeing some be sooooo stuuuupid makes me have no feelings for them whatsoever, only wish that they got what was coming for them much much sooner... and sorry to say but if my mate fancies a girl and there were 5 of us and he wanted to drag everyone back in a really really dangerous area just to be with her not even knowing if she was alive... well no offence mate but go ahead, why kill 5 people for the sake of 1?? Considering what kind of people they were... they would have been the first ones to run out in all directions trying to survive. People that have no intelligence usually have to rely on instinct and in that situation your instinct would tell you 'get the hell out of here'It's like them films where the military does a rescues mission and send 20 people to rescue 1 person and 18 die... yet that 1 person is safe, makes no sense to me... Also how that monster managed to jump up... right for that helicopter which didn't even fire one shot at it, why was a rescue helicopter being flown so close to the action, no idea...No story line... no background on monster, monster was invincible, took 100's of bombs and bullets and it kept on going yet his little 'terrible things' were hurt by a kick from a person. Pointless film, monster invincible which means it probably destroyed everyone on Earth... and that's it The End... or considering someone found their camera the monster died... how?? no idea, Atomic Bomb?? but then the camera wouldn't work or it would have been destroyed, specially by EMP effect... so their film would have never been seen, OH I am soo stupid, I forgot the camera was also invincible and had it's own nuclear battery (note to self, find out what camera that was and get one). Back to alien/monster/thingamabob the military threw everything they had at it during the whole film then suddenly it died???... I guess it probably tripped, fell and broke his neck, or it rained and it melted... maybe we will see the outcome in Clovershyat Part 2:):) YEY!!!!",1,2,4,7 February 2008
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worst Marvel film so far (worst Spider-Man)
","I am a huge Marvel and DC fan, not crazy about the accuracy of things as long as the overall story is told.I actually loved the original Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire and even though there was no need for a reboot the ones with Andrew Garfield were pretty great too. Both versions had Gwen Stacy (first love) and Mary Jane (2nd love) and both versions had the Spider-Man origin, which more or less stuck to the actual comics.Spider-Man Homecoming takes everything everyone knows about Spider-Man and throws it out the window. As others have commented no idea how Stan Lee accepted this... if he had any choice at all. Bear in mind that the Marvel hero rights is a complicated matter, they belong to different groups and they could have the last say. Spider-Man belongs to SONY Pictures and not to Marvel Studios, obviously this latest film was a collaboration of the studios. Most of the X-Men stuff and fantastic 4 belonging to 20th Century Fox. Seeing an Avengers/X-Men/Fantastic 4 movie crossover is highly unlikely... shame as the comics did it.Going back to this movie, they simply bastardised Spider-Man, everything that made him special is gone, his back-story and origin is gone. If you have no idea who Spider-Man is, if you did not watch any of the earlier movies then you will love it as there is nothing wrong with the film besides Spider-Man's non existent sense of responsibility towards anyone or anything. Destroy that family's house, sure who cares; blow 100 cars up, yeah why not; almost killing 100's of people go ahead Spidey that's what makes a hero. Everyone finding out your secret identity hell why not... As an added bonus and insult, Spider-Man now has an approved Stark suit on, just remember never to enable KILL MODE!!! No idea what would happen if you do, would love to see it though:) OH and of course as many other reviewers have said, throw in the politically correctness, use every race and mix it all up (Red Heads, Blondes and big white jocks... make them all clever, Mixed Race, African-American and Asian-Indian).They could have just simply done a Spider-Man Origins movie... AGAIN and then crossed over with the Avengers. They could have used either Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield without upsetting the fans. Simple, Iron man needed help during the Civil War and Spider-Man was a Pro-Registration or whatever. The Civil War was a lot more complicated than the previous Captain America film with a lot more heroes including Fantastic 4 and the Spider-Man group but hey at least that was more or less on point.P.S. Two of the people I was watching the movie with fell asleep:)))",1,125,207,8 October 2017
Armageddon," Rewatched this film last Saturday
","Well I read the review done by Marcus Eden-Ellis from United Kingdom last week and though it to be quite silly, but since I did not see the film recently I couldn't comment. On Saturday as I was flicking through the channels and my missus was sleeping next to me I saw Armageddon on TV, so I started watching it until 1 AM... and today I am going to comment on some of the points that were criticised.First of all: THIS IS A FICTIONARY FILM!!!! You watch it as fiction, it is pure entertainment. But if you want to be scientifically accurate... there is no proof to say this film is inaccurate... hence the fact that no one on Earth flew a ship onto an asteroid to blow it up... I hardly call that stupid. Remember the world used to be flat until not so long ago, and people got burned at a stake if they said they could fly.I honestly watched this and 11 years on and I still think it is brilliant just as when I saw it in the cinema. It makes you connect with the characters, you actually feel sad and I bet some people cried at the end. It has plenty of action... and will keep you entertained.My Defence for the film: Why didn't NASA send its own astronauts?? well let's see, the job was to drill on a new terrain never drilled on before. The drill team have been at it for over 30 years... so professionals... that was their jobs. Just like the pilots for the ships, I could ask why didn't they teach the drillers how to fly the ship and send them without pilots? Oh and if NASA did decide to send its pilots instead of the drillers the film would become Deep Impact:) how about that eh? I have to agree that they didn't need the Gatling guns... specially since they were trying to save space and weight.'12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes', well lets see the drill head was a lot wider than the pipe... guess that details was missed out by the viewer.Sun glasses in a space helmet? who cares... I can drop down shades in my motorbike helmet with the click of a button... why wouldn't that be possible in a space suit? Animal crackers scene... what was wrong with that? Couple being silly... romantic...'personnel trackers' on astronauts? wow that would be very very hard right? since these days you have personal GPS systems to track your kids, dog, wife:)... etc 'Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion.' and I though the space station blew up because of sparks and faulty fuel lines... but maybe I need to watch it again for the 10th time just to make sure.'800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick' glad people paid attention to the fact that the asteroid was a lot wider than shallow, so yeah flat way size of Texas, deep... no idea they didn't say but 800 feet was enough to cause the fissures and blow it up.A gun smuggled onboard? Well since it was a military/NASA/government with civilians I would say that would be acceptable.I think I covered most of the bad points, but wait the best one: 'Space Dementia': Space dementia is the term NASA uses to describe the hypothetical mental condition a few astronauts experience when they're in space. This can be contributed towards feelings of insignificance, insecurity lack of social contact and the astronauts awareness of total isolation from the human race. The truth is actually stranger than fiction. In NASA's guidelines for space station emergencies and crisis's there is also guidelines on how to handle mental breakdowns What should be done when a fellow astronaut goes bonkers? Astronauts are instructed to bind the stricken flier's wrists and ankles with duct tape, restrain the torso with bungee cords and administer strong tranquilizers.All in all I think I said enough, 11 years on and this film is a classic, has brilliant actors, good action, love story, humour and it allows you to connect with some of the characters.",10,1,3,13 July 2009
Avengers: Infinity War," Amazeballs
","Going to keep this short. Probably the best action movie of the year, if not ever. Has all of the Marvel Superheroes mashed up just like the comics do when massive scale events happen. This last statement takes me to all the negative reviews. Why oh why?? You guys do realise it is Part 1 of 2 right??Before you give it a 1 star because, oh well you have no idea about the actual MU and MCU. I suggest you at least google 'Infinity Gauntlet' which is the original story of Thanos, also the actual Infinity War from the comics.
I am not providing any spoilers here since what I have mentioned can be seen in the trailers and synopsis, what I did mention was based on Marvel Universe knowledge. No idea which route the directors will take but please bear with the 2nd part before you tell people not to 'waste' their time, that this is the last marvel movie or by giving it a score under 5 stars.Here are the main reason why this movie doesn't deserve the under 7 reviews it got:1) It is a 2 part movie so bear with it until you actually watch the second part?
2.a) Huge, massive scale event in the Marvel Universe. Due to Thano's goal every being in the known/unknown Universe WILL come to take him down. Frankly the movie didn't have every Superhero Character in existence, for example the X-Men and Fantastic 4.
2.b) The supreme beings of the Marvel Universe; an all-star lineup including Galactus, Kronos, Epoch, the Living Tribunal, and a bunch of others like the personifications of concepts like Chaos and Order come after him.
3) Many many people and superheroes would have not realised what Thanos did until after he snapped his fingers. So don't go crying that it is the end of the world.
4) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 - End Credits - Hint hint Adam Warlock. Even though he may not make an appearance in the 2nd part.
5) One of the most powerful superheroes in existence and not quite as known should make an appearance in the 2nd part to help out. End credits, Carol Danvers.
6) Following point 3 (for all the whiners), anyone can put the gauntlet on and snap their fingers one more time... and... wait for it, wait for it... undo what has been done.I hope you enjoy this amazing movie.",10,2,5,5 August 2018
I Am Legend," Just rubbish
","It's the kind of film in which the people make very stupid mistakes... which cause events... where more stupid mistakes cause more chaos and crap to happen until eventually someone dies... and all this could have been avoided by any idiot with a brain. Too much CGI used... the kind of CGI you can tell... maybe it's me and I expect decent films but seriously I wouldn't bother wasting my time watching this.Someone said to me, it's a zombie film with Will Smith, complaining about a zombie film is like complaining about bad pizza.So this was my reply: For starters I can't cook, so if I decide to cook a pizza anyone tasting it will complain:):) hence the film is the same. I don't complain about Zombie movies... and these were not zombies, they were... humans with rabies... big difference. I loved all previous zombie films, from the Undead series to the latest Planet Terror one which was brilliant and Resident Evil.These are proper Zombie films... this... well this was a mixture of Descent with Will Smith in a big city. Maybe it's me but like I said, 5 people watched this with me and we all agreed it was pants.It's just another film that brings nothing new, nothing exciting, seems more like a cash in job, using Will Smith as a money making scheme. Maybe I expect too much out of Hollywood these days, sorry to say that this film did nothing to me, made me actually wish I watched something else instead of wasting a few hours. Also... this is a film about Will Smith:):)This info is extra information I got from Wikipedia. So I think the film should have been left as a novel from the '50s and that's it, not bother remaking it for today.I Am Legend is a 1954 science fiction novel by Richard Matheson about the last man alive. Neville is apparently the only survivor of an apocalypse caused by a pandemic of bacteria, the symptoms of which are similar to vampirism. I Am Legend has had a profound effect on the horror and science fiction genres. For instance, it is one of the first stories to try to explain vampirism scientifically.I Am Legend has been adapted to a feature-length film three times:The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man, I Am LegendMy question is how can this film get so many stars?? Why would people settle for such a mediocre film...",1,19,38,25 December 2007
Avengers: Age of Ultron," AMAZING Action Packed Movie... why so many haters?
","Firstly I will not go over the movie summary, plenty of reviews have done that, I will simply try and cover some of the questions, some of the negative aspects on which other reviews have focused so that other people may understand that none of those negative reviews actually apply. I won't give away specific spoilers and name certain actions/fates/characters however I will try and help fill any holes which some may have.I honestly do not understand why this movie have so many bad reviews? It has the same rating as Iron Man 3... almost, a movie which I decided to ignore from the Marvel Series and call it 'Alternate Universe' story since it made no sense... is it supposed to link with Avengers 2? I didn't think it did, I didn't really see any references so I will go with that:) and I urge the rest to do so too, since Tony Stark is Iron Man, period!!Now about the movie, I want my brain to have fun, relax and switch off... well not quite off, I want to gasp in awesomeness, laugh and get an eye orgasm (which for the clever people is still controlled by the brain) and this movie delivers on all of those. So yeah I loved it, can't wait for the BD version so I can watch it AGAIN!!!!Contrary to IM3 at least Avengers 2 tries to stick to the story somewhat. Just a fun fact, the guy that creates and is Ant-Man is the daddy for Ultron:) however let's go with the facts and compare: (1) He (Ultron) hates his creator - In this case Tony. CHECK. (2) He hates all human life and he believes that he is there to replace all humans - in this case it is true he wants to eradicate all human life. CHECK. (3) He took the personality of his creator - in this case we can go with Tony's jokes. CHECK. (4) Ultron has multiple personalities because he was reborn multiple times, he can never truly die - not really related to the movie but FYI. (5) Ultron's main body was made out of adamantium - related to movie. CHECK. (6) Ultron created Vision - pretty accurate 90% so let's go with this too. CHECK.Oh and for whoever is commenting on the Hulkbuster Iron Man Armour: As the name suggests, it was specifically designed for hand-to-hand combat with the rampaging Hulk. The armor was built as a large exoskeletal shell which fits around Iron Man's normal armor and is equipped with rocket-boosted gauntlets, capable of punching the Hulk back several miles. CHECK CHECK CHECK!!!!!Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch twins (Magneto is the father), CHECK, not sure what the Hydra connection was but let's go with it, bear in mind X-Men universe doesn't seem to be connected with Avengers in the movies. Quicksilver does have a similar fate in the comics... FYI!I won't comment on the love interest in the movie since it doesn't kill the story or makes any huge changes, besides if we really want to analyse this, it does make sense how they went with it as they both have dark pasts and are misunderstood. Enough said.Character clashes... sorry but did people see what happens in X-Men, JLA, Fantastic 4 and so on? Of course there are clashes because they are humans and humans sadly don't always play nice. Every team out there has these conflicts and they are well 'documented' in the comics and cartoons. Character development missing? Seriously... these are the Heroes of decades of history, if you want that go read their back story or watch the dedicated movies or watch the cartoons.Too many jokes? You need to realise that this is NOT X-Men, Batman, Superman or other serious super hero movies. Avengers are more on the Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man side with jokes and not taking things too seriously, if you are going to die saving the world you might as well have fun. You don't have the same dread that you do in the other movies because you damn well know... The Avengers are so mighty that nothing can really hurt them. Hulk or Thor on its own could take down... well the Batman, X-Men and even Superman:) For anyone that understand game references (touching on the nerdy side here) Avengers is more the Diablo of games, you get 1000's of monsters yet you know your Character can take them on and it's just pure fun where if you play something like Dark Souls you have that dread. I also love the 'FUSION' powers, if anyone did play the Marvel Ultimate Alliance is when 2+ heroes combine powers, you saw that in Avengers 1 once I believe but is often used in 2 which is great.After all that my question is how are people not liking it? I leave you to be the judge as on all aspects the movie does not falls short, and sure as hell doesn't deserve anything lower than an 8.5. It does a great job sticking to the story-line. Only negative is that they did try to fit too much into the 2 hours, they should have made it 3h and give the whiners that extra development and story, build up Ultron, then again some people complained that they fell asleep during the first hour, there is no pleasing a hater.",10,1,6,27 August 2015
Zombieland," Didn't like it...
","I would say mediocre is the word: 'The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies...' More like based on a virgin teenager trying to pull the only other female left alive:) Grindhouse + American Pie = Zombieland but less funny and less entertaining with adverts for Twinkies and Bill Murray:) Could also be Resident Evil + Road Trip = Zombilenad... but you get the idea.Anyhow, at the end I honestly though WTF? I just wasted a few hours instead of watching something else:) At the start of the film I though it was great... then slowly slowly I saw it go down the hill. Maybe it is me, no idea but I did like the Planet Terroor film a lot better.",5,2,3,16 November 2009
Fifty Shades of Grey," Haters be hating
","I will jump straight to the point. The movie doesn't really deserve 10 starts but I could give it a 7 or 8. I did not read the book nor am I a fan, my other half got bored half way through the book and never finished it. I saw all the negative reviews and though oh boy, not expecting anything.Now for the surprise, the movie is pretty cheesy, some of the conversations and replies boy oh boy however it is pretty darn entertaining. It is sexy and provocative and I seriously suggest that you watch it with your partner/date in the comfort of your home as this movie is will end in 99% guaranteed sex on your side whoever you are male or female. It has great music and the movie is actually Romantic... let me rephrase it, after I watched the movie and knowing that it would pretty much finish on a cliffhanger as it is part of a trilogy I went on wiki and read the plot for all 3 books. Things started to make sense and I can see very clearly the romantic side.The movie is a romantic story, call it a modern beauty and the beast but with a lot of kinkiness and BDSM, will he love her? will he change his ways for her? will he be able to show compassion and romanticism? will he accept her and her ways and be solid relationship? who knows... bring on the other 2 movies:))",10,6,18,9 March 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a bunch of bull
","I have no idea what they thought when made this films... but I sure as hell was not entertained. Mindles action, no story no character backgrounds nothing just a bunch of crazy people driving back and forth on a dirt road doing crazy stuff. The movie was plain crazy... crazier than a bag of cats. To the point that many people that I know who watched it actually fell asleep... why? because too much action without anything else is BORING. I know as my missus fell asleep next to me and when I asked her about the film and her falling asleep she responded 'I don't care, didn't understand anything, what a bunch of rubbish, didn't care about any of the characters' I am old enough to have watched the originals and boy how disappointing I was with this faker, all they did was to make a movie that has nothing to do with Mad Max franchise. Another over the top re-boot where more money than sense was thrown at it. I have started buying or going through my old old collection of pre 2000, 1990 and 1980 movies as 1 in about 10 movies these days is complete and utter rubbish. They sure as hell don't make them like they sued to. With all the money and special effects... such a shame.At times I felt like the movie was some kind of tragic opera attempt, maybe the director wanted over the top artistic photo/emotional moments without any reason why, just for the heck of it.I have no idea how people rated this movie so high... did they watch the same film? Were they intoxicated or under some kind of drugs? Says a lot about our society and acceptance or sub-mediocre entertainment.Don't get me wrong, I am not someone that enjoys over dramatic and clever movies, I actually love to see something that is fun and entertaining, I really don't like 'clever' movies that give me too much to think. For example white house down, pacific rim, any of the marvel movies, fast furious series, fun revenge movies such as taken or taken like movies, but this???? what the hell was this?",1,30,60,28 June 2015
Warcraft," Amazing - Some explanation
","Warcraft 2 was the game that made me buy my first PC back in '96. WOW was the game that made me waste many many days and years getting lost in the lush story and massive world however I had an on and off relation with WOW, did not play it constantly since 2004 when it came out. I was never a massive lore fan but I did look stuff up on WOW Wiki and on Nobbel87 YouTube page which has so many video on the Warcraft Lore.If you enjoyed the movie and want to know more about the Warcraft Lore I encourage you to visit Nobbel87 YouTube channel.The movie is well executed, the CGI alone should get awards, the Warcraft lore is massive, way bigger than anything you have seen before, bigger than the Middle Earth Lore and yet they tried to fit in as much as they could with a few things being left out and some of the lore changed however the end result is exactly the same. There is absolutely nothing I can add besides saying that the movie is well worth a watch and maybe some educating on the lore is needed to fully enjoy it. I had shivers just watching the first few minutes.My only gripe is that they could have added an extra 30 minutes and go over the reason why certain individuals became corrupted with Fell magic and what was the reason and promises. Then again that would probably need 3 prequels.In regards to the movie, many negative reviews mention lack of good acting, no idea where they got that from, the acting was superb as you would expect from a big budget movie. They also mention that the viewer is not able to sympathise with either the Alliance or the Horde, who is the bad guy? Well the simple answer is neither of them are the bad guys, both parties were used and corrupted by the Demons (Sargeras and his Burning Legion). The Orcs were seen as nothing more than cannon fodder by the Legion, promising Gul'dan POWER beyond his dreams only to do his bidding and destroy every world in the Universe. The Orcs were pushed to destroy their own world and every race on it then marched on to another World to do the same. Due to their aggressive warrior culture/nature most did not question this and went in blindly, hence the Fell corruption for greater power, Green orc skin and not Red/Brown original look. This is the reason why you can very well root for them.The common enemy not shown is the Legion and their Leader with Gul'dan coming second as he was their puppet. The Orcs have a tragic past, the Humans unfortunately are in their way and neither can trust each other for various reasons (meddling from higher powers).The Warcraft Universe is tragic, there is no happy ending, no winners, constant war, no one is safe, constant attacks from the Demons and their schemes. I think the movie tries its best to show this torment and you can root and sympathise with all parties (except the Legion).For any newcomer it will be hard to get attached and involved especially when the story in the movie is about 5% overall. However you need to bear in mind that this story is always shifting, expanding becoming richer and richer (after all Warcraft has 26+ years of constant Lore which is still being added to with the new WOW Legion Expansion coming out in August). Can you really get sucked into the ever expanding Warcraft universe and truly enjoy this amazing movie that doesn't scratch the Warcraft lore surface? Probably not, but if 7 movies with 2 3 still planned:)) hint hint come out you might think of Warcraft as one of the greatest fantasy series ever made.",10,1,2,9 July 2016
