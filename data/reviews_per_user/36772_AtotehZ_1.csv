Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Worse than its predecessors
","I wasn't drawn into this as much as the other movies. I hope they won't make more, it will spoil the series. They haven't even been able to bring back key characters of the series, if it's because their part in it was seen as concluded or if the actors thought as I think, I don't know. This is what happens when you use the same repertoire to exhaustion.The humour is of the same type, but not nearly as intense as previous movies.Another matter entirely is that I would wish Johnny Depp would concentrate on other projects.All in all, not impressive at all, but of course a must see if you liked the series.",1,1,3,7 September 2011
