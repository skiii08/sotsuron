The Blair Witch Project," Don't waste your Money!
","I went to see this film during its limited release and was sadly disappointed.  This was touted as 'the scariest movie of the decade' by several reviewers and highly recommended all over the internet.  The last 2 minutes of the movie contained the only moments to actually induce fear and the rest was portrayed as three people who couldn't get along in a crisis situation.  Having known nothing about this movie before viewing it might have made it a better experience, but after watching the special on SciFi which tried to make viewers believe it was a true story made it a tremendous disappointment.",Null,1,3,21 July 1999
