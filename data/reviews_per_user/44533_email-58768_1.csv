The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Best high school movie
","This is one of the greatest movie I have ever seen( and I see a lot of movies). The performance delivered by these young actors is so good. I feel the movie is very underrated. It has a story that a person can relate to. It made me smile, it made me cry.. I just loved it.",10,1,3,10 June 2018
