The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A very well done film
","I thought this was a very good film that was just as good as the previous film. I think the acting was fantastic, I loved the Hanging Tree. I Just LOVED IT! I also Think Jennifer Lawrence did such a great job as Katniss she brought the best out of the character of Katniss. I think everyone else did great Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Natalie Dormer and many more did as great as well. I also loved how faithful the movie Is to the novel it was almost page to page faithful which is a dream come true I LOVED IT! Finally I really like the story but I Love the villain of president snow hes a really good villain and I think he is the best villain in the history of film. 5/5 Stars!",10,2,7,13 April 2016
