The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely Thrilling
",I have watched horror films for 21 years and never been scared of anything I saw. I don't mean jumping when something on the screen pops out at you. That not being scared that your bodies natural reaction to that stimuli. Many films rely on this method to scare people. It's kind of an underhanded method if you ask me because its not true fear. The Blair Witch Project truly scared me for the first time and it was wonderful.,Null,1,1,2 August 1999
