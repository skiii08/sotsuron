Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Great Addition To A Great Saga
","I'll come right out and tell you that I'm a Star Wars Fan. I grew up with episodes IV through VI and when I saw the trailer for Episode I The Phantom Menace, I nearly wet my self... Ah hell I did. Now for the review: Most people including die-hard Star Wars Fans hate Phantom Menace and consider it the worst in the series. They are dead wrong. The acting is good, not great, but the Star Wars Saga isn't all about acting. Liam Neeson fits the character of Qui-Gon Jinn perfectly, Ewan McGregor would make the late Alec Guinness proud for his portrayal of young Obi-Wan Kenobi. And Ray Park plays Darth Maul well even though he has few lines. The only complaint I have is young Anakin Skywalker played by Jake Lloyd his acting is stale and somewhat annoying. Anyway back to the good parts of the movie. The plot is laid out so that you have to watch the first three movie, can't stand it when people say the plot is no good when those people fail to see how well it's plot coincides with the first three films. Now for the special effects. Many Phantom Menace haters say that George Lucas ruined the movie with all the special effects he used, again, they are dead wrong. If 3D animation technology were available in the 70's George would have used them in the original Star Wars Saga he would have. The proof of this is in the newer versions of Episodes IV-VI all digitally enhanced with special effects. The special effects of Episode I only add to the splendor of the movie. Now to the best part: The Action. Who ever directed the action sequences of this movie is a genius. They are so over the top and fluid, but at the same time are believable and easy to follow. The final fight scene is, in my opinion, The best and most well choreographed fight scene of all time. If you haven't seen the movie yet (I highly doubt it) I wont spoil it for you. In conclusion This a great movie the deserves much more credit than it gets. Oh and buy the way, to all you Episode I haters (you know who you are)'I find your lack of faith disturbing' -Darth Vader",10,1,2,7 August 2007
Resident Evil," Oh God My Eyes And Ears Are Bleeding
","Please some one tell me this is isn't a Sci-Fi Channel original movie because it's almost as bad as one... no wait it's worse, hell it's even worse than S.S. Doomtrooper which is about a giant Frankinstein Nazi that... well you can figure it out from there. On to the review: I like the Resident Evil Video game series(especially RE4) And I was pretty excited for the movie and thought it would be a alright movie. God Almighty was I wrong. I can only think what was going through the director's mind when he thought up the idea for the movie. I think it went something like this: Hey I know lets get that red head skank from The Fifth Element (Milla Jovovich) To play our main character and completely screw our fans by changing the story! Good idea Paul.(the director) The plot is more broken than Chevy Chase's Career and you couldn't fix that with super glue. The only cool scene is where those agent losers get cut up by the lasers... or was That Resident Evil: Apocalyspe I don't know, crappy movies tend to blend together over time. There's your review, Oh what still wanna know more about the plot OK here: The Beginning: People become zombies. The Middle: Zombies attack survivors. The End: Alice (Milla Jovovich) survives and it turns out that she is Umbrella's secret weapon or something? I don't know I had already gouged my eyes out so I wouldn't have to watch it anymore. Anyway my point is that this is bad (I'm talking' Dane Cook's comedy routine bad) There the review is over (finally) and I just saved you an hour and forty-five minute journey to the depths of hell.",1,1,4,8 August 2007
The Happening," A Powerful and Moving tale about the End of the World
","This movie has been getting a lot of bad reviews that it doesn't deserve. Myself, I'm a fan of all M.Night's movies and The Happening is no exception. The premise of the movie is a about a sudden ecological event that becomes a threat to all humanity causing people to brutally kill themselves. The movie introduces us to high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his less than faithful wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) trying to escape from Phildelphia before the the event 'happens' there too. Math teacher and friend of Elliot, Julian (John Lequizamo) and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) tag along. The thing I liked most about this movie is how Shyamalan shows how people would really react to the end of the world, not by running around screaming but sitting idly by,confused and filled with quiet fear.In summary the people who didn't like this movie obviously didn't see the how deep it's meaning goes. If your looking for a cheap horror movie,this movie isn't for you, but if you you are looking for a deep, moving, and powerful psychological thriller than you should see this movie. Also if you aren't convinced after my review take a look at Roger Ebert's review, he should be able to convince you otherwise.",9,3,11,27 June 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I didn't hate this movie but, I am fully aware of how bad it is.
","Sequels are hard to make, you have a plot to continue, characters to continue to develop, and expectations from fans to surpass. Michael Bay and company seem to have found a way around that, and that is to not do any of these things.The plot of the first Transformers may not have been the best, but it worked for that movie while this movie manages to disregard the plot of original and goes off in a new direction resembling a retarded version of National Treasure mixed with War of the Worlds. It fails to be interesting or intelligent.Most of the major characters return, one noticeable loss is Jon Voight as the secretary of defense. although the characters seem oblivious to the events of the previous film this is not the main failing of the movie, it is the dialog. While the first movies dialog ranged from decent to good this movie stayed in Pearl Harbor territory almost the whole time with the only tolerable lines delivered by the main autobots and decepticons. Another problem is the inclusion of new autobots and decepticons there are so many thrown into this movie that you do not care or sometimes even notice when they meet their demise. However there are two new autobots Skids and Mudflap who you will notice because the movie forces you to. They both horribly annoying ethnic stereotypes that add nothing to the movie.The action in this movie is intense if not slightly confusing. While the action scenes in this movie are on par with the first movie they couldn't overcome the horrible story. Unlike the first movie in which the action builds up over time to thrilling climax. This one just has action throughout. While the action in it is good it never builds to a true climax.It seems Michael Bay pulled a Ghostbusters 2 on us, sure the movie has the same characters and subject matter but it is severely lacking in the areas where it counts.",4,2,17,29 June 2009
