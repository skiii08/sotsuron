The Monuments Men," An Excellent Movie
","I found it most enjoyable. Good story-telling by an excellent cast. Maybe people's expectations where too high in advance of the movie - that might account for the many bad reviews. To me, this film offers a fine escape back into another time and it has a happy ending. Not profane or salacious or overly violent. A fine film. George Clooney's direction and writing are excellent. Again, I think it's just expectations being too high in advance - people are not viewing the movie as it is but 'as it could have been' which is no way to view anything. This is a nice work of fiction that takes place within the backdrop of WWII. It's not a documentary, it's not a blood & guts action film. It's an intelligent film with a nice story, expertly directed and acted.",9,1,3,26 December 2014
