The Mask," Smmmmokin'!
","Jim Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss a 'romantic at heart' who is having trouble with the ladies until he discovers a ancient relic, a mask that allows the wearer to express his innermost emotions..He meets Cameron Diaz at his work at a bank and immediately falls for her (who wouldn't!) and while the Mask he makes quite the impression. This is one of my favorite movies and I watch it whenever it is on..I wasnt a fan of Carrey's Ace Ventura movies, but this is a great role for him and he does a great job in it..Cameron Diaz is stunning of course in her debut although she doesnt get to do much..The effects are good and the laughs are plenty Definitely a must see!! on a scale of one to ten..8",8,0,0,12 October 2000
Casablanca," What else can be said?
","Arguably the greatest movie that was ever made..now famous for all the problems on set and casting decisions that couldve been made..until the stars all met. Bogie, Bergman, Paris, War, love, romance, adventure, this movie has it all. When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country. The metaphors are present if one looks: Bogie being US Bergman and husband being the allies..and of course the Nazi being the Nazi. Casablanca, translated from french, White House. An absolute masterpiece of a movie. A must see for all. On a scale of one to ten... 10 Best drama i have seen and the second best film (behind only Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam)",10,1,1,19 March 2001
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," technical marvel and a great comedy
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the zaniest and smartest movies to come out in a long time..Directed by Robert Zemeckis who later did Forrest Gump and Castaway among others, it stars Bob Hoskins as a washed up private eye in the 50s who gets dragged into a murder investigation in Toonland to help unravel a mystery and prove the innocence of a toon Roger Rabbit.One of the real treats of the movie is Kathleen Turner who does the voice of Jessica Rabbit..She is a perfect choice with that sexy sultry voice. The movie is great fun for the whole family..there is a little innuendo but like Jessica says..'I'm not bad..I'm just drawn that way'A real treat! Holds the record for most credits at the end of a movie (937!) On a scale of one to ten... 9",9,34,42,10 December 2000
Citizen Kane," What else can be said - the greatest movie ever made
","Orson Wells masterpiece about Charles Foster Kane a man who rises to the top of power and fame and dies alone. The movie is ahead of its time in so many fashions..the cinematography, the editing, the directing, the sound, the acting, the writing, ..everything in this movie is perfect.

Mississippi Burning," Drama that gets a little too over the top
","Set in mississippi during the tumultous civil rights era, 1964, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play FBI agents sent to uncover the whereabouts of some missing civil rights movement supporters. Of course they are not welcomed with open arms. Great acting by Hackman and Dafoe. Although the pairing of an older, wiser, vet and a newbie has been done so many times.. 7 of 10",7,4,8,3 May 2001
Beauty and the Beast," Be Our Guest!
","A landmark Disney movie, nominated for best picture, featuring outstanding animation, wonderful storyboards, splendid characters, exquisite songs and animated choreography, along with a wonderful cast of voices. The story, familiar by now since it has been filmed from the late 1890s, about a beautiful girl who gives up herself to a beast (a prince under an enchanted spell) and sees the beauty inside of the beast.. An instant classic..what else can be said? on a scale of one to ten...10",10,1,1,22 September 2000
Batman Returns," The Bat the Cat and the Penguin in a good show
","the second in the Batman series finds Tim Burton in the directors chair again and while the second isnt as dark as the first, it ain't no walk in the springtime either.. Keaton returns as Batman DeVito plays a disfigured penguin who wants to rule Gotham with the Help of Walken's ruthless tycoon. Pfeiffer plays her role as the love interest who takes more than a little interest in Bruce Wayne. The plots are so many though that they get lost in the shuffle..one could make a whole movie on Pfeiffer as the catwoman itself (Hmmm..not a bad idea?!?)...This is really a big budget f/x movie that while entertaining and lighter than the other one (the penguin's escape on a rubber ducky is almost comical) leaves you at the end with a 'eh' feeling.. On a scale of one to ten ... a 6 .. a good movie and worth seeing but it couldve been better",6,1,2,1 September 2000
The Great Dictator," Chaplin's first all sound movie is a classic
","Chaplin stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, (i.e Hitler) A movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk in a way for Chaplin because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be 'reeducated'A funny satire with the classic scene of Hitler tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. This was the last movie with Chaplin's trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9",9,1,3,2 October 2000
The Natural," A baseball classic..
",Robert Redford stars in this baseball epic about a young ballplayer who has a promising career cut short by a woman..later he begins his career again in a bottom dwelling team. At first the coaching staff and his teammates believe him to be a washed up old timer. But he becomes their savior.The finale is classic and should not be missed as should this film not be missed by sport and non sports fan alike. 9 of 10,9,1,2,8 May 2001
The Jungle Book," A jumpin' jungle good time
","Based on the Kipling novel, this Disney animated classic has a young boy raised by wolves who must choose between his jungle friends and man.

Apocalypse Now," an exhilarating experience
",Francis Ford Coppola's opus about a captain ordered to take out a renegade colonel is a visual experience bar none.. the movie is stunning in its cinematography and the stories of the making of the movie are legendary and spawned a documentary on its own.. Of all the Vietnam movies Apocalypse Now is the best one that delves into the insanity of not only that war but all war..it is also one of the earliest to deal with the war itself.. If possilbe see it on DVD letterbox with a good sound system and maybe a slight buzz.. A brilliant movie.. on a scale of 1 to 10 Apocalypse now rates an 8,8,0,0,26 August 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," Lean's epic bio a stunning masterpiece
","David Lean's bio of T E Lawrence, a British military 'advisor' who helps the bedouins battle the Turks during WW I is a stunning masterpiece of flim that must be seen to be appreciated. And if at all possible on the big screen, or letterbox..so the whole experience of the movie,the outstanding sound, the excellent music score, the breathtaking cinematography can be fully appreciated..while the film is close to 4 hours, it seems timeless..Peter O'Toole makes his debut in this film and was nominated for an oscar. Winner of 7 academy awards including best picture. Is #4 on my best action flims list..On a scale of one to ten..10",10,0,2,12 September 2000
JFK," Historically flawed but compelling nonetheless
","Oliver Stone's version of history from flamboyant New Orleanes DA Jim Garrison's point of view. Kevin Costner plays Garrison who becomes convinced that there is a cover up of a conspiracy that led to the death of the President. Stone then presents basically every conspiracy theory ever produced and presents it as fact. While the movie is compelling and Costner does a great job as Garrison, this movie doesnt really provide any answers to who killed JFK, it just produces more questions. For a good unbiased look at the conspiracy theories, get hold of 'Case Closed' by Gerald Posner. An excellent book that exhaustively looks at the murder of the president. Read it as a companion to this movie.8 of 10",8,1,12,28 April 2001
Schindler's List," A great film..
",What else can be said about this masterpiece by Steven Speilberg about Oskar Schindler who did anything he could - including bribery - to employ jewish workers in his munition plants which resulted in saving over one thousand jews from the nazi slaughter. In a way it is troubling to say this movie is great and is a favorite because of the terrific horror of the subject but Speilberg makes it a poignant memorial for those who lived through the holocaust and a reminder to those who were too young to have remembered that these atrocities did happen and such hatred should never present itself again. 10 of 10,10,9,14,8 September 2001
Ghostbusters," Who ya gonna call?
","Three paranormal investigators (Akroyd, Murray and Ramis) open a business that investigates claims of ghosts creating havoc in NYC.

Patton," George C Scott IS Patton
","George C Scott, in a role made for him it seems, plays old blood and guts general George S Patton who commanded his troops to victory in Europe and Africa. While he had military success, he was less successful playing the political game. He was a general - and he loved war Great movie on all accounts 10 of 10",10,1,6,29 May 2001
Casualties of War," An underrated tour de force
",One of Brian De Palma's better films of late..this late 80s drams stars Michael J Fox as a soldier who turns in his fellow soldiers after they pick up a female prisoner and make some bad choices.. The film is basically a morality tale..how that even in war one must maintain dignity and respect toward non soldiers.. a powerful film with good acting by Fox and Sean Penn as his commanding officer. One of the better but basically unknown films about VietnamOn a scale of one to ten..8,8,1,2,20 March 2001
The Piano," not in perfect tune...
","Holly Hunter plays a mute who expresses her thoughts and moods through her piano which she had brought over with her daughter. Arriving to a predetermined marriage to Stewart (Sam Neill) she engages in a sometimes cruel battle of passion and revenge with a fellow settler, played by Harvey Keitel.. WHile the cinematography and score are outstanding along with the acting, the story itself falls a bit flat as it progresses ever so slowly.Holly Hunter does her own piano playing. 5 of 10",5,5,10,17 June 2001
Annie Hall," Arguably Woody's best
","Annie Hall is Woody Allen' s cinematic masterpiece the one that won him the oscar for best picture screenplay and director along with several other oscars and other film awards.. It is a classic tale of Woody falling for Diane Keaton and how their relationship plays out.  Filled with classic scenes /(the lobster, the spider, the sneeze) and cameos of future stars like Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver.Diane Keaton's wardrobe started a trend so this movies influences are many A must see for smart moviegoers..winner of Best Picture in 1977.. on a scale of one to ten..10",10,0,1,26 September 2000

It's a Wonderful Life," An inspirational, uplifting tale for all seasons
","Jimmy Stewart stars in this classic as a man saved from suicide by his guardian angel. The angel takes him through what life would have been like without George Bailey. A film that runs the gamut of emotions:  happiness, sadness, joy, tragedy, success, failure. The acting is superb, a great script and an outstanding cast make this one of the best movies ever made.

All Quiet on the Western Front," one of the best
","A very realistic and depressing view of war as seen through the eyes of a young man who enlists to go off to fight 'the Great War' for the fatherland. His naiviete formed by the professors of his school he enlists with his buddies and soon discovers the horror of war first hand. As Paul, brilliantly played by Lew Ayres, becomes a war weary vet he realizes that the war has no purpose and no victory or good can come from it. This movie was very controversial in the US and Germany where the author was from and fought for in WWI. All Quiet is one of if not the finest anti war movie ever made and was a foreteller of a greater and more devastating war to come..

The Lion King," Disney's return to Grrreatness!
","The first Disney animated film with no human characters and to be based on an original story is an overwhelming success not only in the box office but as a movie. A lion cub, Simba, is next in line to be Lion King, until his evil uncle Scar, (voiced superbly villanously by Jeremy Irons) plots a coup agains the future king. Along the way we see Simba growing up and discovering the not so perfect world. A great story with a detailed plot that will have you engrossed. The songs are perfectly done, with Elton John singing the themes 'can you feel the love tonight?' and 'Circle of life'.A classic that rivals any of Disney's older masterpieces. Followed by a good but less effective sequel. On a scale of one to ten..8",8,1,1,23 September 2000

The Deer Hunter," award winning story of three friends who go to Vietnam
","DeNiro, Walken, and Savage star as three steelworker friends from Pittsburgh who leave for the war in Vietnam. This powerful film examines their lives just before they leave during the war and how it changes them when they come back. This was one of the first films ever to seriously detail the war in Vietnam and how it forever changed the lives of those who served. The film does it very well.

Speed," Made Sandra Bullock a superstar!
","Speed is a highly exciting action movie starring Keaunu Reeves as a SWAT cop in LA on the hunt against a mad bomber played with his usual maniacness by Dennis Hopper, who battles wits against him. Hopper plants a bomb on a transit bus that will blow up if it drops below a certain speed.. Bullock is thrust into the drivers seat and must keep the bus on the road and keep her eyes on the speedometer while Reeves tries to disarm it without Hopper's knowledge.. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering what's going to happen next..The passengers on the bus are very cardboard though.. A great script good acting (even from Keaunu) and excellent pacing give this movie an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,20 September 2000
Heat," heat doesnt sizzle
","Directed by Michael Mann, Heat is a action chase character drama that tries to be everything and ends up being bits of each..An absolutely outstanding cast though with Al Pacino as the cop on the chase of the big heist, Robert DeNiro as the leader of the bad guys (this is the only movie where both Pacino and DeNiro, arguably the two greatest actors of the past 50 years, appear on screen together) also with Val Kilmer Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, and Natalie Portman. This movie is a good movie with excellent characters who come to life. There are some memorable scenes..DeNiro and Pacino drinking coffee in a diner, Ashley Judd as Pacino's wife and Natalie Portman who does a great job as the step daughter whose life is falling apart.Overall a good movie but it seems to fall short of the lofty expectations.. on a scale of one to ten..a 6",6,0,3,8 September 2000
Aladdin," Another disney classic
","Another superb offering from the giant of animation, Disney. This one tells the story of Aladdin and how he meets and falls for a princess. Along the way he teams up with a genie (marvelously done by Robin Williams) and the adventure takes off from there. Robin Williams is the scene stealer of the movie though, voicing the genie.  Great fun for both the little kids and the big kids too..Some scary parts might be too much for the little little ones on a scale of one to ten..9",9,1,2,22 September 2000
Beetlejuice," Keaton as a 'bio - exorcist' in this dark weird and funny film
","Definitely unlike anything you have seen before, Beetlegeuse stars Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as a recently departed couple who hire Keaton to rid their house of its new occupants an obnoxious couple (O'hara and Jones) To their surprise the couple's daughter Winona Ryder (who does a great job in an early role) can see them and Davis and Baldwin befriend her. Very inventive with excellent effects and costume design. Tim Burton's vision definitely comes out in this one..Thankfully there has been, to this point at least, no sequel. The calypso scene is destined to be a classic! on a scale of one to ten..8",8,1,2,27 September 2000
