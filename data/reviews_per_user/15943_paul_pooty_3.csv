United 93," Not a moveon.org conspiracy theory nor GOP propaganda. But why see it?
","Flight 93 wasn't shot down. It took off too late, allowing passengers time to learn that unlike past hijackings, this one involved no plans to land and demand money or the release of imprisoned comrades. So more of them were inclined to fight back. People on the first flights to be commandeered had no such warning; because of a pattern established over decades, they believed that submission was the only way to survive. The few who tried to resist were either stabbed or hindered by chemical sprays. I'd say those on United 93 were heroes, so what if self interest was among their motives? Nevertheless, it doesn't warrant an America's Most Wanted-style reenactment that probably resembled the actual hijacking about as much as an episode of The View. Just as news footage from the Battle of Mogadishu reveals that Black Hawk Down was just a poorly imitating high school play, or a Discovery Channel special on naval aviation gives us the real thing in comparison to the glaringly inaccurate Top Gun. Many people, however, don't see movies for information or even entertainment. To them film is an accompaniment to a night out with friends and a conversation piece afterward at the ice cream parlor or coffee shop. Anyone who places themselves in this category has a reason to see United 93. All others, save yourselves the ten bucks and watch the network or cable news version.",5,4,16,30 April 2006
Mystic River," The Oscars become less about aesthetics and more about politics every year
","Yet another episode of Law & Order/NYPD Blue/Homicide released in theaters. Coincidentally not long after Sean Penn travels to Iraq to defend Saddam Hussein and Tim Robbins complains to the news media that his opposition to the Bush administration has turned him into a victim of its fascist censorship. So to prove Tim wrong and give Sean a message of congratulations, this strange film is showered with nominations from the Academy and its stars are summarily given Oscars. My question is, why? The film is technically inferior, its story grossly implausible, and the acting marginal at best. With the exception of Laurence Fishburne, who knows his craft (though it doesn't completely show here), all cast members should be recycled through acting school. Tim Robbins was great in Fraternity Vacation (1985) and Sean Penn was at his best as Fast Times at Ridgemont High's Spiccoli, but neither are Laurence Olivier or Charleton Heston reborn. It amazes me that the citizens of Boston didn't have another tea party with the film reels upon seeing it in theaters. If my city were depicted with such disregard for its style of speaking and neighborhood culture, you could certainly count on a more aggressive response. 'I don kwest-shun yer vows' and 'We berry R sins he, Dave' may appear to be reflective of Eastern Massachusetts vernacular in the minds of Mystic River's condescending screenwriters, but is laughable to anyone who has spent at least a day in Samuel Adams' hometown. Clint Eastwood seems to be atoning for his years of Spaghetti Westerns with such cheeseballs as Bridges of Madison County and A Perfect World and now this. Who could blame him? How else will a conservative Republican be granted respect by the AMPAS?",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Goodfellas," For those who thought the Godfather was too intellectually complex
","Puzo's tale described the brilliant Sicilians of early 20th century America who were compelled to form organized crime syndicates because legitimate society would not accept them into its upper echelons. Goodfellas chronicles the underlings who were left over when the Dartmouth educated Michael Corleones of the mafia were gradually accepted into mainstream society--i.e. politics, business, law, science, and art. So it is no surprise that Goodfellas appears aimed primarily at the Daily News reading overweight highschool dropout male 18-47 demographic who listen to Howard Stern in the morning, blow half their weekly paycheck on strip clubs and sports betting, and vacation in Vegas. Some of the IMDb's brightest film commentators love this movie, which is a mystery to me. All I got out of it were some OK recipes. Paul's Points: 4.7---Movies it copied: Godfather, Mean Streets, Raging Bull",Null,0,1,4 June 2004
