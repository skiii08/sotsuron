Airlift," What's wrong with Indians? It's a Stupid overrated Movie!
","Just our national song and just a flag to make Indians sentimental. This is what this movie is using to get these ratings. This is probably the most overrated Indian movie you'll see. If you see the movie then you can easily guess what will happen next and in the trailer it says 'Feel proud to be Indian', but how? by protecting people of the country from a war? GET SOME MIND GUYS. This is just a movie which aims to make money. Nothing special.. Sad to see Indians rating this movie 10/10 just because of some sentimental things. Rated 1/10 just to decrease the ratings, else I would give it 5/10. Please watch this movie if you are not sentimental kind of person to put real review here!",1,22,42,3 February 2016
