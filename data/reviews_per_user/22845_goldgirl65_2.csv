Minority Report," Much better than I thought it would be!
",I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan. But I must say this was an awesome movie. It kept you thinking the whole movie. There was not one dull moment in the movie. I am so glad I went and saw this movie. I will definitely own this when it comes out in dvd!!,10,0,0,1 August 2002
Signs," Excellent!! Excellent!!!
",I loved this movie. I know the reviews said it had a cheesy ending. Well there was no other way to end it without making it a 3hr movie. And I didn't think it was cheesey. The movie has a spiritual side has some great one liners and made you jump out of your seat. I loved it! It was just as good as I hoped it would be. Mel Gibson is a great actor and this was a great role for him!  I can't wait to own it on DVD !,10,3,5,5 August 2002
