Skyfall," A reboot too many?
","I won't go on about all the errors in Skyfall and there are many. And I won't go on about the wooden acting (Moneypenny and Q) and stuntmen showing or the continuity errors and terrible sets.What bugs me is that this Bond isn't an escapism movie anymore and this Bond isn't a spy, a secret agent. Most people have missed this difference and though some say this is Fleming's Bond I think those people cannot have read his little books at all. Skyfall's Bond is totally unrecognisable as Bond. By that I do not mean that he should have an exploding toupee and cloaking device, but he should be a spy and there should be intrigue, suspense and intelligence.This cretinous Bond is boring, the plot is boring even with the M love mummy complexes added, all this stuff is very unBond and very boring. True Bond fans won't like this movie and I have yet to meet anybody who likes the film, at best they have said 'well, it was OK' As a Bond fan and fan of Craig in Casino Royale I despair at yet another reboot when Eon had already successfully rebooted, what are they thinking of?",1,20,40,14 November 2012
