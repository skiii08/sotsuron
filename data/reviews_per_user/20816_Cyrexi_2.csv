It," Good, but not perfect.
","Easily better than the miniseries, so clear, the jumpscares were made so smoothly and it had so much humour that it felt like a comedy at some parts, which was a good thing.The old Pennywise looked so creepy and horrible that it didn't feel like it was a clown, it really did feel like a demon. But the Pennywise in this version looks like a clown that a child would trust, he's fun, laughing and his voice is soft.It (2017) is basically the example of 'How to remake a classic'.",8,0,1,16 April 2019
Silent Hill," Silent Hill has to be my favourite horror movie from the -00's, no doubt.
","I'm making this spoiler free, so this will not be long.Lets just say, this movie was not from 100% the first game, but the moments that were from the game, were so amazing that I almost wanted to play the games again just to live the moments again. And the parts that weren't from the game were so well made as well. The characters were scripted well, and they live on the moment which is wonderful.So, if you love the first game(s) you will love this movie. And if you love some gorish horror in a realm where instead of snowing it's raining ash, you will love this movie for sure.",10,1,3,16 April 2019
