Skyfall," A refreshing Bond movie
","I think this James Bond movie is one of the better movies in the series. It looks like 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Casino Royale', but far less like the older films. This is probably because of Daniel Craig, the new James Bond actor. First of all I'd like to say that the whole movie is exciting, and the director also dares to take some risks according to the events. He actually lets people die of whom you'd never expect it. And a few small plot twists keep things diverse. Daniel Craig is different from the other James Bond actors. For example; I think he's less of a womanizer, but then again more of an action hero, whereas Sean Connery was better with the ladies. Daniel Craig has already let one of his lovers die in a past movie. Something else that makes this movie unique, is that 007 and MI6 are actually being threatened and in danger. Though in most of the other movies Bond only went to his targets, the enemy is now doing the same to him. On the other hand, I also think the film lacks some of the classic James Bond aspects. A lot of classic elements have been revised and recreated, which might make the film fresher and more open to new viewers, but might also disappoint a lot of die-hard fans. The Aston Martin for example, has been totally renewed. A good thing it's in the movie, right? Well, you could say that, but what does having an Aston Martin matter if it doesn't have the famous Aston Martin looks? This is something most people probably don't really mind. But what about the people that love the series for the Aston Martin? They could be disappointed. And then of course, the gadgets; the film contains a lot of new gadgets, but they all play a less important role than they used to (and there's less of them). You can say about that whatever you want, but it sure does make the whole complex more realistic. And last of all, Q is finally back! And no, not as John Cleese or as Desmond Llewelyn. But this time in a whole new jacket. He's finally been replaced by a new, young actor: Ben Whishaw. An actor not very famous, probably even unknown to most of you. However: Skyfall is a great edition in the series. With even better special effects than its predecessors, well performed acting by both the old, and the new actors. And not to forget: some badass ass-kicking.",8,2,6,10 January 2014
