Casablanca," heres looking at you, movie *clink*
","A bittersweet romance film, Casablanca pulls so hard on my heartstrings. Everything about it- the story, the plot, the lighting, the shots- are awe-inspiring. The suspense regarding the letters of transit build until they are used at the very end. I found the end incredibly disappointing; not that I feel it should be changed, its magnificent as is. But the whole movie I wanted and hoped that Alsa would end up staying with Rick instead of leaving with Victor, and even though its what Alsa and Rick want, they realize the larger importance of her leaving with Victor.I've never been to keen on politics, and I found some of the things mentioned were a little tough to keep up with, but that doesn't take away from the movie's excellence. Some of the scenes in Rick's bar I had no idea what was going on and who wanted what because there were so many different uniforms walking around... I wish they were labeled clearly! Lovely in so many ways, Casablanca deserves its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.",Null,0,1,21 October 2009
Citizen Kane," most important film of the 20th century
","the reason this film is so revered is not because it is an outstanding story with awesome special effects and lots of guns n stuff. true, it is to be appreciated for its morals and storytelling, but if you look at how it was filmed and compare it to other movies of and before its time then you can really see just how impressive 'Citizen Kane' is. It uses a lot of deep focus, which required a decent amount of skill and was an out-of-the-box thing to do. one indoor scene stands out particularly for its beauty and play with light. the only light coming into the room is natural sunlight streaming in to a dark, smoky room from small windows high on the wall. other scenes were shot from ground level, also an unusual way of filming. 'Citizen Kane' is really different, really clever, and and excellent film to watch for those who appreciate more than just an interesting story.",Null,4,5,21 October 2009
The Birth of a Nation," review for History of American Cinema- ARTS 272_500
","Birth of a Nation demanded my full attention in order to follow. At first, it was difficult to figure out who people were, differentiate them, and how they each related to each other. After I got used to the characters, I began to really appreciate this movie. The story of how the civil war tore apart friendships and how friends and brothers killed each other was beautifully portrayed. The battle scene where the two friends and opponents died side by side was very touching. This movie was also visually pleasing. When the outdoor fire scenes, which were red, switched to the glowing, yellow indoor scenes, it really added a sense of changing atmosphere. I also really liked the music choice, it's not every day that you see a town burning down to the soothing tune of 'O Tannenbaum'. 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' was a wonderful choice for setting a battle scene; it reminded me of playing the old computer game Return Fire.",Null,1,2,14 September 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," explosive laughter
","i feel bad about how much i enjoyed this film. true, it takes the delicate subject of nuclear warfare and the destruction of the surface world, but i found it completely hilarious. when ripper thinks that the communists are disguised as US soldiers and tells mandrake 'in the name of Her Majesty and the Continental Congress, come here and feed me this belt, boy, the Red Coats are coming' i think i popped a blood vessel trying to stop myself from bursting in laughter in the middle of my class. also when the president urges 'gentlemen! please don't fight! this is the war room!' the movie ended beautifully as well as comically. i could only have loved it more if it actually HAD ended in a pie fight.",10,1,2,16 December 2009
