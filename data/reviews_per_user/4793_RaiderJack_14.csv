Requiem for a Dream," Harrowing to say the Least - Remarkable Film!!!!!!!
","'Requiem for a Dream' offers an absorbing, terrifying, yet fascinating look at the downward spiral associated with drug addiction. While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction. Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar. Her performance is quite simply spellbinding. Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans. Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role. He should invest in more dramatic parts as he proved to match his stellar cast members.This is one of those movies where you immediately need to take a walk and 'shake it off' or merely have a nice long cigarette. This is an intense movie experience following the results of drug addiction on 4 hapless souls. Even more harrowing is that the movie offers not one shred of hope. In that instance alone, it should be applauded because it implies there is no hope as long as you do not possess enough responsibility to recognize dangerous behavior and do something about it.I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,2,4,21 May 2007
Ed Wood," Excellent!!!!
","I have been a big fan of Tim Burton ever since Edward Scissorhands. Moreover, the pairing of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton has proved to be commercially as well as professionally sound.This particular outing is no exception. Depp simply shines as Ed Wood, arguably the tiredest director of all time.While the movie itself is a fun homage to the horrible director, Tim Burton elevates the project by presenting a very touching relationship between the director and actor, Bela Lugosi, brilliantly realized by Martin Landau who more than deserved his supporting actor Oscar for his performance here.The supporting cast of characters are all superb and this will be a movie that ranks right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow as shining examples of the pairing of Depp and Burton.I highly recommend!!!!",8,1,1,21 May 2007
Shutter Island," Captivating DiCaprio - Scorcese Suspense! - Excellent!!
","The latest outing by the incomparable Scorcese is this woooooooooooooooooonderful mind-play, multi-layered film with Leonardi DiCaprio playing the 'rat in a maze' to perfection.The simple plot revolves around a federal investigator who is sent to this insane asylum to investigate the disappearance of one of the patients. As it turns out, this is the ONLY simple thing about the film.This is an intriguing, thought-provoking, visually captivating tapestry that explores the recesses of the mind in an intensely driven psychological torture chamber the likes I haven't seen since 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.Looking at this also brings to mind the awesome acting chops of Leonardi DiCaprio. Here he is off the chain as the federal investigator whose life is crumbling all around him and his performance here evokes memories of the positively flawless performance he gave in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?.' I simply forgot how good an actor DiCaprio is! Top-notch film exquisitely directed and containing beautiful dream sequences that reveal the source of DiCaprio's angst. Scorcese's expert direction creates an anxious mood that propels the viewer throughout the film while Leonardo DiCaprio brilliantly realizes the troubled investigator.I highly recommend!!!",10,1,3,10 June 2010
Van Helsing," Not All That!!!
","I just viewed Van Helsing for about the 3rd time before I reluctantly had to admit - this was not all that AT ALL! The plot (if one can call it that) was so contrived one immediately wonders 'why am I watching this again?' Oh yeah...for ol' luscious Hugh!!!! To be sure the special effects are dazzling. But this was the real problem with The Mummy Returns. After salivating over the Rock and hoping that Brandon would reveal a little flesh, the movie descended into one big special effect. This rather trite and boring strategy, an obvious (and unsuccessful) attempt to cover up plot holes, was alas, prevalent here as well.Be that as it may, this would have been infinitely more bearable if Hugh had shown a little more flesh. After all these special effects slash changes, you'd think they'd have given the wardrobe mistress a free hand to work out a lil' sump'n sump'n a tad more titillating to show off Hugh so we can forget that this picture was just not the one.

Dreamgirls," Lives Up to the Hype - Indeed an Excellent Movie
","I deliberately waited until all the hype was done, all the awards were won, and until I was no longer tired of Beyonce to purchase and view Dreamgirls.It is indeed an excellent presentation.Directed by the director of Chicago, another fantastic musical (and that's saying a LOT as I am generally NOT into musicals) Dreamgirls brings to the screen the excellent Broadway production of the 80s that put Jennifer Holiday on the map.Apart from top-notch production standards, wonderful costumes, fantastic music, and excellent performances all around, Dreamgirls is indeed another wonderful presentation of a slice of African-American life/culture that is worthy of any movie collection.All performances were equally riveting. Of course we all recognize this as a thinly veiled retelling of the Motown/Supremes story. (Its a shame Florence did not have the happy ending Effie did, but such is life.) Jennifer Hudson's Oscar was indeed well-deserved. She was simply powerful though not necessarily a sympathetic character for the most part. To Beyonce's credit, she did not AT ALL try to be the focus and her performance was rightfully understated. Eddie Murphy was indeed wonderful as a composite of Little Richard, James Brown, Wilson Pickett, etc. Jamie Foxx was most competent and I am so glad he got a chance to sing a few songs - though not a sympathetic character at all, he is still a consummate actor and a major contributor to making this work on film.I can certainly understand the standing ovations it got in some theaters and friends of mine who went to see it in a theaters attested to that.It really should have been at least nominated for Best Picture but, alas, again, the nature of the beast!! (Remember 'The Color Purple'?!!) Nothwithstanding, this is wonderful entertainment and I highly recommend it.",8,0,0,9 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," Simply Chilling
","The latest outing by the Coen Brothers is a chilling mix of horror, film noir, thriller, western, and yes even comedy, (Tommy Lee is always a stitch) but still remaining true to the twisted vision of the very entertaining work of these rather unorthodox artists.No Country For Old Men is somewhat reminiscent of Blood Simple, their first outing, but infinitely more bloody. When I first viewed it in the theater, quite frankly I was NOT well for the ending. Absolutely no loose ends were tied up. A subsequent viewing helped me realize it was for the best. Each viewer will have to decide exactly how it ended and from what I understand the movie ending was not like the novel ending.When the interpretation of a work is totally up to the viewer, that, of course, always makes for a more compelling artistic presentation simply because the art does not do your thinking for you: this one is no different.Hands down, the most chilling aspect of this was the performance of Javier Bardem and his Oscar was indeed well-deserved. He was so calm he was very, very frightening. You did not (or more aptly, COULD not) invest anything into him emotionally. This was indeed deliberate. There was no need to, actually to adequately present the story. Even Llewellen (Josh Brolin's character) you felt something for, and Tommy Lee Jones, who, regardless of the character, ALWAYS manages to make you care about him, was probably the most fleshed-out character.Actually the movie was not as slow as one is led to believe...it is most deliberate and since the Brothers get right to the point at the very beginning, you are indeed intensely involved with how this will play itself out.If you are a Coen Brothers fan, you will certainly appreciate it. If not, it is quite a decent movie.",8,3,5,13 March 2008
District 9," VERY Disturbing - Thought Provoking - Science Fiction at its BEST!
","5.0 out of 5 stars Very Disturbing - Thought-Provoking - Some of the BEST Science Fiction I Have Ever Seen!!, June 9, 2010 District 9, science-fiction at its absolute BEST, revolves around the attempts to relocate aliens, currently living in slum conditions in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a more suitable place - living alongside humans has obviously deteriorated. A bureaucrat,Wikus, appointed by his father-in-law, is tapped to lead the relocation efforts. Unfortunately, in the process, he becomes infected with the DNA of the aliens. (oh you KNOW the South African government has been performing 'tests' to study the aliens!) Of course, Wikus will eventually turn into one of the aliens and the government wants/needs to 'harvest' his body parts all, of course, for the sake of science.The movie is intense, gritty, and disgusting. It pretty much evokes the same emotions in the viewer which is where the power of the movie lies. It takes the viewer on a VERY uncomfortable review of one's own biases/prejudices/apprehensions. In the beginning I was horrified watching the amount of firepower humans enlisted to implement the relocation policy thus making me dislike Wikus almost immediately - especially since he benefited (for lack of a better word) solely because of nepotism. I was immediately moved to support the aliens but, GEEZ, they're so ugly!!! Then Wikus becomes infected, becoming of intense interest to the South African scientific community, and becomes the hunted rather than the hunter. Now Wikus is as sympathetic as the aliens and thank god, not NEARLY so ugly.It was INDEED startling to be reduced to making assumptions about someone SOLELY on the basis of how they looked. The aliens here are quite intelligent. Moreover, they only want to get back to their own planet and have no ill-will toward humans, unless, of course, provoked. So in most cases they do NOT deserve the inhuman (no pun intended) treatment they are often subjected to.Their just god-awful ugly!! And it is disconcerting to have to admit AND deal with this. Compound this with a language barrier and we find ourselves looking at some very similar situations we find ourselves in in our everyday lives.The special effects are mind-boggling and the interactions between aliens and humans recalls social conditions we are all entirely too familiar with. Yes, it uncomfortably evokes the reasonings behind immigration, integration, segregation, minorities, cultures/situations we are unfamiliar with, and forces us to take an historical perspective of just how well (or how badly) we have dealt with similar situations.The movie is fast-paced, action-packed, gross, poignant, revolting, and THOROUGHLY entertaining. It is reminiscent of the best that the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits had to offer and quite frankly, trying to categorize the movie not only is difficult but ultimately unfair.Hands down - one of the BEST movies of ANY genre I have ever seen.Oooooooh yeah.....I INDEED recommend!",10,0,8,10 June 2010
Gran Torino," Simply Excellent!! - Yet Another Eastwood Classic!!!
","Man, its just hard not to like Eastwood films!! Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging. It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today. Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs. For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes. He is also in a vulnerable place. He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood. He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, that he eventually 'modifies' his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski - this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying. Clint was just wonderful as Kowalski and the actors portraying Sue and Thao were equally impressive.This one, I'm sure I'll watch over and over again. I hiiiiiiighly recommend.",10,3,9,22 June 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Another Quality Product from George Clooney!!!
","While I thoroughly enjoy George Clooney as an actor, I submit that his real talent (and love) is directing. After seeing his directorial debut 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' which followed the exploits of Chuck Barry, there is no denying that George has a way around the camera.Here he shoots in crisp black and white and the superimposition of the real Senator Joe McCarthy is most effective and certainly complements the mood and feel he so successfully captured.Another wooooooooooooooonderful bonus is the incomparable Dianne Reeves who provided sparkling vocals to the movie soundtrack.This is a very good look at a shameful period in American history and without hammering you over the head with it, gives a candid view of what countless reporters during the time had to deal with as well as the many, many lives destroyed because of this ludicrous excuse for a Senator.Excellent movie.",8,0,1,17 May 2007
Big Fish," Simply Wonderful!!!
","Every once in a good while, the impact of a particular entertainment format is wholly contingent upon the emotional tapestry the viewer/listener brings to it.This is a classic example.In one of the most un-Burtoneque projects to come from Tim Burton, 'Big Fish' is a mesmerizing fairy tale wonderfully reminiscent of the underrated 'Edward Scissorhands' more than a decade ago. Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought-provoking one that, chances are, will leave an indelible impression.This time around Tim Burton abandons his usually dark fare for the southern tall tale. He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenon with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form. As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age-old southern tradition that shows us the consequences of not being able to see the forest for the trees.In a nutshell, the story follows a son's last attempts to discover who his father really is as the son insists that during his upbringing, his father has hidden his true self behind his tall tales. The son and the father have their final confrontation on the father's deathbed and it is here the son finally realizes the time he has wasted because of his 'inability to see for looking.' Albert Finney is simply captivating. I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast. While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents. Ewan McGregor personifies charm as the young Edward Bloom.This is a wonderful dissertation on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father-son relationship. It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.Visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was. While the end of the movie was somewhat melancholy, it was right on target and did not descend into maudlin sentimentality - it proved to be the natural order of events.I highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again. I have never been more pleased with a DVD purchase than I have with this one and suspect already as I write this review that it is steadily becoming one of my all time favorites, not only for its entertainment value but more so because of the valuable insight it provided into my own situation.",9,0,1,21 May 2007
American Gangster," Indeed A Decent Film
","The Ridley Scott mark is evident here simply because of the sprawling landscapes he is known far and wide for in telling the story of real-life crime lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) juxtaposed with the investigation and eventual capture by fictitious investigator Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe).The movie is fast-paced with a sweeping panorama of the period spotted with memorable performances. That being said, a glaring disappointment was Scott/s inability (refusal?) to adequately utilize the support of such stalwart actors as Ruby Dee & Chiwetel Ejiofor, both of whom provided substantial support that appeared to have fallen victim to the cutting room floor.An interesting parallel was indeed Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts as they both had enormous similarities, the biggest of which was their devotion to their work which seemed infinitely more important to them than their families. It is this poor prioritizing that provides the impetus for their actions. Crowe's character was somewhat more redeemable than Washingtons' whose character indeed had anger management issues which were all supposedly explained away because of societal pressures - blah, blah, blah...It is also interesting that many of Washington's characterizations don't necessarily warrant much attention unless they are somewhat less than socially redeeming.Notwithstanding, it is indeed a good film with flaws like any other (hardly a masterpiece) but well worth becoming a part of your film collection. I do recommend.",8,0,2,18 March 2008
Sherlock Holmes," Quite Entertaining!!!!
","I finally got a chance to see this much-hyped version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character and after all is said and done, this was most entertaining.Robert Downey Jr was an inspired choice especially when considering Guy Ritchie is at the helm. Downey perfectly fits Ritchie's frenetic vision of the legendary detective and the casting of Jude Law as a much more energized Dr. Watson is just wonderful. Law's Dr. Watson is infinitely more his own man than any Watson I've witnessed before. The chemistry between Downey and Law served the project quite well.The set design is amazing making this a visual delight. The costumes and sets combined with Ritchie's energetic and rather imaginative editing all combine to create the perfect mood to accompany this action-packed, fun-filled ride.To be sure, the plot was rather muddled, rather busy, and rather ambitious which is also rather deftly camouflaged by the almost non-stop action. Sherlock still remains the highly analytical, precise, and logical detective we all know and love but is refreshingly and delightfully encased in the always interesting Downey who is more than complemented by Law's more deliberate Watson.Some may feel this version makes a travesty of Doyle's original vision of Holmes. To each his own. Seeing this in no way at all diminished (or elevated for that matter) my perception of Holmes. Hey, guys, get over it!! - its only a character for godsakes!!! Fun movie. Excellent production standards. I definitely recommend!",7,5,8,14 April 2010
The Queen," Ahhhhhhh Helen!!!!!.....Work It!!!!!
","Let me say at the outset that I know nothing of and have no technical observations about Blue-Ray vs HD/DVD blah, blah, blah..(hey, I didn't even see this at the movies...I saw it on TV!!) I do, however, know that Helen Mirren ranks right up there with the best of'em i.e., Bette, Maggie, Judi, Vanessa, etc. I have been a die-hard fan of Ms Mirren since the creation of Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennyson in 'Prime Suspect.' The range of this actress is quite simply incredible. She can do no wrong and here she is simply superb.As 'The Queen' Helen indeed fleshes out a royal most of the world knows very little about and therefore has made all sorts of unfounded assumptions about as well. This also takes place during a very taxing time in anyone's life, much less a family so public as this. Helen manages to make Queen Elizabeth quite human, trying in the midst of the turmoil surrounding the death of Princess Diana to deal with the situation as best as she knows how. She reacts like a woman who has pledged her life to her country first, then as a mother, and then as a grandmother. Her impatience with Princess Diana recounts any mother-in-law's impatience with her ex-daughter-in-law; the added variable of this being the royal family of England makes it all the more complicated. Before seeing this, I, like I imagine a lot of us, also thought the Queen was entirely too disconnected. But things are not always as they seem. Of course some of the Queen's actions are questionable and maybe some of her behavior may not be excused, but at least this presentation endeavors to at least submit motives behind those actions.The film moves quickly, is actually quite witty, the writing is top-notch with Helen's performance, of course, being the driving force. A most poignant scene is her reaction to seeing the elk?, deer', (whatever) in the woods before it is eventually hunted down for sport. It is a classic example of stopping to smell the roses in the midst of a most intense human drama.To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatement. Excellent movie!",9,1,2,25 February 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of the Coen's Brothers Very Best!!
","I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects. This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.This is a re-telling of the 'Odyssey' by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the 'Odyssey' was about. In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey. The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack. It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompanied the mood and tone. A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody. The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.This one you will enjoy over and over and over again!!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent!",9,1,1,21 May 2007
