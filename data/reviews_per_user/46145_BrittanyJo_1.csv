Walk the Line," Amazing. PErfect!
","This movie was so amazing, It depicted Johnny and June Carter very well. ANd the fact Joaquin and Reese actually sang and played the instruments made it better, Joaquin was born to play this role. They had everything down to an Art. Even Johnny's Proposal to June on Stage mid-song during JAckson. That was dead on. Even the Words Were Exactly what were Said. CMT had an interview with them and June told the story and the Movie hit it dead on. The Death of John's Brother at such a young age was very well depicted too. If ever an Actor was Born to be Johnny Cash it was Joaquin Pheonix. No one else could have done it. Even the drug usage of John Cash was dead on. It was Perfect. It was well done.",10,0,3,20 November 2005
