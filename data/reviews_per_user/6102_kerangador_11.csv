Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Marcia Lucas You are our only hope!
","I first watched Star Wars (the New Hope) back in 1977 and I thought it was the best movie made of all time. I thought that Phantom Menace would equal the brilliance of that first film. After all Star Wars had a great story, great pacing, and the acting was pretty good for a sci-fic film. Compared to that film - the Phantom Menace pales in comparison - its filled with stupid characters like Jar Jar Binks which gets a negative 5 rating from me. And worse of all, the child actor casted to play Anakin Skywalker was hopelessly out of his depth - he gets a negative 6. But to be fair to the little kid - he's just a child actor who was given an abysmal script. Why didn't they use the Haley Joel-Osman 'I SEE DEAD PEOPLE' ?Furthermore, we are to expect that 'Annie' will one day marry Padme? There's a serious height difference going on there.However you do get to see moments of G.Lucas' brilliance - a bit like seeing that glint of diamond under the tons of rubble. Darth Maul was very well cast/written +5 and Natalie Portman played a brilliant Queen Amidale +5. But the best parts of the movie is still stuck under that ton of ugly rubble. Its a pity that Marcia Lucas the real craftsperson of the Star Wars series - she won the Academy Award for editing the first original Star Wars movie - was not around to mold this into a real work of art. She would probably have convinced George to have got rid of Jar Jar Blinks and have devised a better script and plot - not to mention getting a more suitable actor to play Anakin.But of course the special effects of the film was fantastic. So +5. However, Lucas' awful plot idea of the midichlorians gives it another -5.The pacing is horrid. A lot of the plot doesn't make sense. A really horrible effort by George Lucas. All that money went to his head - its just a big showcase for his CGI. What a waste.Anyway - you should watch the original 1977 Star Wars and compare it to the 1997 re-release - this time with all the crap that Lucas' wife deleted. Then you realize why she won the Academy Award. Pity that Lucas didn't get it.",1,4,9,13 October 2010
The Hunger Games," It grows on you - ignore WIlly Wonka and the Ompa-Lumpas
","The problem is that I've seen films like '1984', 'Battle Royale', 'Gattaca' etc.. so this film seems to be a clich√© driven movie right from the start. We start off with very little empathy for the characters - esp. the well dressed heroine who does not look emancipated. There's no sense of dread when they get called because I'm wondering WTF is Tim Burton's Willy Wonka doing in this apocalyptic film. And then when we reach the 'city' - its filled with a whole bunch of Willy Wonka type of characters - and munchkins as news commentators.At this point I'm really struggling to imagine a modern world where all the citizens of the greatest city in the world are dressed as Willy Wonkas. Sorry, I can't get that image out of my mind.By the middle half of the film - however - I'm warming up to the characters. Partly because we see very little of the Willy Wonkas. And it goes up hill from there on.I was pleasantly surprised that the dashing boyfriend does not make a surprise appearance. And that it did not end with a V for Vendetta style ending.",8,2,8,14 April 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I hated it
","I don't get this movie at all. I love spy actions films like the Qantum of Solace, Bourne Supremacy, and of course, Spy kids.Where are the sex scenes? Where are the car chase sequences?? And OMG where are the epic fight scenes and gun shoot outs???? The hero chews a chewing gum - pulls out a gun and thats it???? I mean there was NOTHING at all in this show.And worse whats with all the weird accents??? They all talk funny. Why have they outsourced all the acting roles to Russian and Irish actors??? I was really hoping to see the acting class of George Clooney and Kevin Costner. I don't know any of these actors. Well, maybe one of them. I think I saw him in Dark Knight, another fav spy movie of mine.By this time you should have realized this was written with sarcasm mode on. If you don't like it - find a sniper rifle and shove it where the light don't shine, in this case your brain.",10,3,5,20 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Colon
","I give it two stars because of Natalie Portman. It might seem ironic that the only thing I remembered in this heavily 'dense' CGI film was the only thing that was real - ie. Natalie Portman's bosom.But yeah.I hated the movie because it was stupid, silly and filled with more plot holes than an asteroid belt has rocks.1. Didn't the Jedi Council - yes, those same wise masters - ever get suspicious about that convenient Clone Army that was created for them - in advance? 2. They still haven't explained why the Jedi and the Sith hate each other.3. The Jedi are forbidden to marry or fall in love - yet the Council, yes those same wise, all-seeing Knights of the Realm - place Annie and Padme in close proximity to each other. Why? Oh wait, the script calls them to fall in love.4. Why are the Jedi forbidden to fall in love? 5. The love affair between Padme and Annie was the most contrived and poorly written.Harrison Ford wrote that Lucas was abysmal in writing speech dialogue - and so Ford changed the script - Lucas, due to his busy schedule, only found out much later and couldn't change it.Now that Lucas has all the power, he can do whatever he wants. And this is it - Attack of the Colon because I felt like retching at the terrible dialogue.",2,2,5,19 December 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best of the Trilogy
","I thought that out of the Three, The Fellowship of the Rings was the best.We have the joy of seeing Tolkien's world of Elves, men, monstrous Orcs, hobbits come to life here.I particularly liked Galdriel's quote of how the world had changed- said in Elvish. In the original text, it was actually the Ent which said it. But having Cate Blanchett say the words was simply spellbinding. I remember her speech word for word to this day.The choice of actors was also spot on. Sir Ian McKellen was a fantastic choice as Gandalf.Some people have complained about the pacing and length of the film and to a certain extent I agree with them.The inclusion of the story of Arwen was probably partly to blame for this. But in context of the film story telling, I think they erred on the right side of balance.Overall, high praise I give to Weta design teams, and the writers, directors, actors, Elvish speech coaches, and the people of New Zealand to bringing to real flesh and life the Epic, Lord of the Rings.",10,0,0,4 August 2011
Wreck-It Ralph," Loved it
","I liked it! I liked it so much I'm going to buy it on DVD, heck even the extended DVD.I thought it was really well written.The pacing was good.The characters were well drawn out.And the overall story was pretty amusing - in fact, it was so amusing I hoping it will come out on xbox or a computer game to play with.The only thing I wished for was perhaps more jokes about retro games that I loved - like Space Invaders, Galaxian etc.. it would have been great if they had made a come back at the finale to help defeat the enemy.This together with Toy Story 3 - are one of my fav animated movies.",10,3,3,24 January 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I liked it
","I'm not too sure why there is so much hate for the Hobbit. Its clearly an adaptation of the book, not the actual book itself. And it also incorporates detail from the other stories written by Tolkien, ie. the growing sense that Saruman was going to be more of a hindrance than a help. Some people see it as a problem but I don't. B I have some problems with the film 1. the initial meeting with Gandalf seemed too weird. There didn't seem to be any reason why Bilbo should go running off with this tall messy looking stranger.However on the 2nd screening (I watched it a 2nd time) this scene didn't seem so bad and I caught some of the casual explanations given.2. Galadriel meeting with Gandalf. Was Gandalf so in awe of the Lady in the books? She seems to have taken on a ghostly Mother Mary sort of persona here.3. Bilbo's capture which resulted in the surrender of the entire group. I don't exactly see why Thorin would lay down his sword and get eaten just to save Bilbo's life temporarily.4. Some of the decapitation scenes of the goblins did not amuse me.But overall it was an excellent film. There were some marvelous bits of drama for me.1. Bilbo's explanation of why he didn't belong to the group, and later why he chose to stay with the group.2. The appearance of the Eagles. Weta did an amazing work in this. Simply stunning to behold.Some posters complained about Azog being 'resurrected' to be the main antagonist. Gosh if that bothers you I think you are a book-wraith.",10,7,16,5 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Marcia Lucas You are our only hope!
","It has been said that George Lucas can't do dialogue or write a logical rational script. This movie proves it.Appalling dialogue. An illogical absurd plot twist. And Jar Jar Binks. Three reasons to hate this dreadful movie.I hated the way Lucas contrived to make Anakin turn over to the Dark Side.It doesn't make sense. He might as well have got mini-Sith Lords crawling out of Anny's behind.How is it that the best Jedi Knight Anakin who has been fighting tooth and nail against the Separatist led by the Sith Lord suddenly turn against his order and go about killing even little Jedi kids? Did Lucas even bother to think this through? I think even a pre-school kid could have done better.As it stands, this garbage of a film only makes Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back shine even brighter.I can only hope that one day after George Lucas has disappeared up in his behind - that Marcia Lucas - the real crafts person behind Star Wars will get back in his chair and redo the whole first 3 episodes.",1,3,6,13 October 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Overkill
","I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times.Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill.The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much.I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason.The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable.I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead.",6,4,6,24 January 2013
Looper," I enjoyed it
","I liked it. OK, there were plot holes. But the acting and execution of the film did the magic trick and I didn't really notice them.There is an art to film making and it speaks of a world where Superman can fly, Luke Skywalker can wave a 'light sabre' and deflect laser bullets etc.. We don't question that at the time because we accept the craft and skill of the film maker.He pulls that rabbit out of the hat - and he does it in such a way that we want to believe that he really did do something magical as opposed to discussing the impossibility of the physics behind the act.That is what separates a good film from a bad one. Its so well crafted that we ignore the inconsistencies and withhold our skepticism.",10,1,4,27 March 2013
The Thin Red Line," Poignant Crap
","I fell asleep in the first 10 minutes of this film. It was so boring that I stopped watching it after the next 15minutes.Its basically an Anti-war 'I hate war' 'war is meaningless' sort of film written apparently by Sean Penn.This sort of theme may perhaps be used for other conflicts - insert your 'I hate Bush' diatribe here. Or lets see, WW1 trench warfare.But the Pacific War was quite different. The Japanese military really were horrible. They slaughtered millions of innocent civilians. The Battle for Guadalcanal was vitally important as it served as a staging post for Japanese bombers to sink Allied ships heading to Australia etc..There were numerous historical inaccuracies in this movie. The battle scenes were not factually correct.In short, this film and the story of WW2 only serves to act as a canvas for an anti-war message, and for the director to insert platitudes about the 'horrors of war' and about how the Japanese soldiers - the same people who raped an entire city population at Nanking before killing them - were really really nice people.In short, its a boring, preachy film filled with hippie 3am free form poetry. Watch this if you want to watch an anti-war film. The director might as well have substituted the Japanese soldiers for smurfs.",1,6,11,7 May 2010
