Casablanca," A classic ... But I don't understand why.
","I've just watched Casablanca because I know it's considered as a classic. I was so excited about finally watching it. But honestly, I didn't like it. I don't say this is a bad movie because I'm not in position to but I was so bored throughout it. It didn't captured me. And believe me I really wanted to love it. I was like 'oh so much people say great things about it I'm sure I'm going to love it' but unfortunately I didn't. I'm a girl who LOVES romances believe me. But I don't know, I didn't get it, I didn't feel the magic... Anyway I guess the acting was good for a 1940s movie. But I think I'm the kind of girl who definitely prefers recent movies like The Notebook. This is the only movie I'll never get tired of watching, again and again. I could watch it all day long it wouldn't bother me, on contrary. So if you like the same kind of movies that I do, maybe you won't like it either. I think it's good to watch 'a classic' though.",Null,1,3,25 June 2012
The Notebook," The best romance ever, my FAVORITE one ... Hoped it never ended
","What can I say ?'That's what we do ! We fight ! You tell me when I am being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you are a pain in the ass. '' So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard, we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want YOU. I want ALL OF YOU, FOREVER, EVERYDAY. YOU AND ME, EVERYDAY.'I just absolutely LOVE this movie, I'm crazy about it, it's the only one I watch all the time... Why do you think Ryan and Rachel dated in real life ? There's no such chemistry between two actors anywhere else as in The Notebook. I wasn't expecting that when I looked at some pictures of the movie before watching it. But I completely fell in love with it !!! (and with Ryan for sure). I'm always waiting for another movie to be better than The Notebook, but never happened yet and I think it will never happened. Unless Ryan and Rachel redo a movie together.I'm gonna stop here because I'll have so much to say about it ...Just watch it if you haven't yet, don't hesitate, just watch it and you'll understand what I'm talking about.I LOVE THE NOTEBOOK, IT'S THE BEEEEEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME !!!!",10,0,2,26 June 2012
