The Blair Witch Project," People have no imagination...
","I am so frustrated as I read many of the negative comments about this excellent film.  These directors took a chance... they made a project that appealed to them, and at best they probably hoped that their friends would like it, and never thought that it would get release nationwide.People say, the acting was bad... yes, it was acting.  But it was meant to be REAL.  How do you think YOU would have reacted in their situation? Probably not like Arnold and Sly would in some 200 million dollar flick. And that's how it was!  3 normal kids, showing what THEY went through in THAT situation.  I would have acted the same way, for God's sake!People say that the film looked bad, like home movies.  Give me a break! Yes, they were film students... but that doesn't mean that every shot was going to be Titanic.  THEY NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO EDIT IT.I could go on... but I don't really care.  The people with imaginations... they're the ones who will enjoy this movie.  Everyone else has gotten too used to Scream and Elm Steet.  Open your minds!",Null,1,3,6 August 1999
