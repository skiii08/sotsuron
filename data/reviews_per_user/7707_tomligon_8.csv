Ali," Poetry! Rewrites the book on filmic storytelling
","A certain kind of critical response kept me away from this film when it was in theatrical release, and I should have known better!  Michael Mann is one of the most original storytellers working in film today, and his sensibility is absolutely in sync with his subject here.  Muhammad Ali always did it his way, and from the brilliant opening sequence (which breaks all kinds of rules of time and space) to the last scene, that's what Mann does, and with great style, as ever.  Of course if an audience demands a literal drama, they might not catch the poetry Mann and his team create with sound and picture.   Will Smith is outstanding as Ali, vocally and visually, Jon Voight is a unbelievably convincing Howard Cosell, and Mario Van Peebles is subtle and moving as Malcom X.",10,32,49,14 May 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Storytelling at its best, sharp, imaginative, authentic film
","What a pleasure it is to witness Leonardo DiCaprio's tour-de-force performance in this perfect gem of a film. Spielberg and his top-flight team have created a delightful reconstruction of the era and Abagnale's bizarre cruise through it, making use of a stylized humor while maintaining a faithfulness to the period's look, feel, manner of speech and most especially, the music.  Tremendous fun.",Null,0,1,10 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp deserves an Academy Award
","The walk, the talk, the eyelashes! Johnny Depp, as a haughty, sashaying, daredevil Cockney pirate, leads a first-rate cast (including a gorgeous parrot and a wild monkey) in a hugely entertaining film. Stay through the end of the credits!",Null,0,0,12 August 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Straight from the heart
","A love story of uncommon beauty, written with daring simplicity, acted with unflinching honesty by each and every player in it, directed by a master storyteller. No question about its being a tough experience to watch, but this film has many pleasures, not the least of which is the depth of love and joy expressed by the main characters, despite the heartbreaking challenges they must face. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman are tuned to the same devastating emotional string--that Eastwood delivers such a performance while also directing the picture is nothing short of an artistic miracle.The film is aptly named, its title reminds us of an old song which plays in our hearts and minds long after the movie is done.",Null,3,5,10 March 2005
Black Hawk Down," Masterful film, brilliant editing and sound and accents!
","A very compelling story told in a dynamic way, with richly deserved Academy Awards for editing and sound.  Strong ensemble acting, and convincing accents from the non-American actors.  Eric Bana creates a particularly vivid character, and Josh Hartnett's final tribute to a fallen comrade is moving.  The film could not have been made without Ridley Scott's genius for staging these events.  All the production details are impressive, and the use of an old familiar air with a modern take for the endtitle music, is inspired.  If you see the DVD, catch the On the Set featurette, quite revealing of process, and the actors' original accents.",10,0,0,12 June 2002
Inside Man," A great New York film, a thriller with NYC ironic humor!
","Reading the mixed reviews posted here I wonder if you have to possess that special brand of irony with which New Yorkers are imbued, a sense of humor in the face of disaster or the threat of it anyway, if you're going to 'get' this movie. Spike Lee and his phenomenal cast (besides the incomparable Denzel, Clive, Jodie and Chris, there's a rich gathering of NY character actors and 'real people') deliver the tragi-comic nuances of an adventure where perception is continually being altered by circumstances that look one way while the full dimensions of the actual reality hide in plain sight until the very end. The dialogue is as savvy and witty as I've heard in a long time. I think a really big clue to appreciating this film is the understanding that everyone, no matter what their pay grade (Foster refers to Washington's as a means of putting him in his place--she changes her view completely by film's end), takes actions according to their perceptions and everyone therefore can fail to see what is directly in front of them. Everyone makes what in movie plot terms are stupid mistakes, but what in real life terms are manifestations of a tragic flaw in consciousness. And people can wise up sometimes, as some do in this film.I recently watched the film again, and what fun it was to see the set-ups realizing exactly what they meant. Or at least I had a better idea! Great film, don't miss it.Followup on this comment:I should also have mentioned Chiwetel Ejiofor and Willem Dafoe, also outstanding.",10,3,6,15 July 2007
Gangs of New York," See it for the sublime acting of Daniel Day Lewis
","Much about this often visually stunning picture is a muddle, but Lewis' performance is a knockout in every way, and provides a blueprint for what it means to have an acting experience on film.  He deserves an award just for that unforgettable move with the knife and his glass eye. Every moment he is on screen is pure magic.",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," High style musical odyssey, a feast for the eye and ear
","Without question, this film is a garden of endless delights. I saw it twice in theatres in first run, then again on DVD, and many more times as it plays on cable.  The dialogue sparkles with eccentric turns of phrase ('the acme of foolishness' for instance), and the sound and music are glorious.  The DVD commentary provides insight about color processes and other enhancements to create this visually ravishing film.  The classic story receives a fresh review, with more than a passing reference to Preston Sturges' great film 'Sullivan's Travels'.  If you've never seen that one, it's a must, especially after viewing 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'",10,1,2,14 June 2002
