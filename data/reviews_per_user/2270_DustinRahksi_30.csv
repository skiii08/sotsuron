Insidious: Chapter 2," Cash grab? probably.
","The Wan hype train is rolling through this film, there for it will make a lot of money just because of The Conjuring. I don't hate James Wan, I just hate the people that d**k ride his films, probably because horror is complete trash now-a-days, and this is the closest thing people see as good horror. But in reality, it's mediocre and nothing special. The Conjuring was a well made film, but it was downright horrible in every other category, including the most important thing, atmosphere/scares. Luckily this film was more of a thriller than it was a horror film, they recycled the exact some scares from the first film. I'll explain.The plot is alright in the sense that it actually has a thought out story line, even if it is down right stupid at times. All the characters return, even those annoying comic relief paranormal specialists. You can pretty much guess the plot just by watching the trailer, every thing is obvious, except for when they stretch out the BS. There is some time travel nonsense that is just plain ridiculous. Is there infinite realities, is this Bioshock or a ghost movie. It really tries to have this mind bending plot line, but it just had me rolling my eyes. It's about as clever as the swing away twist in Signs, that's pretty bad. The ending should be left as it is, if not, we are looking at the next paranormal activity, the BS will just go on and on, but people will see it. In fact, James Wan could be described as paranormal activity, over hyped, appeals to the masses, even if it completely ruins his films. He makes his films dirt cheap, and wrings in the cash from the general audiences.The music is still loud as hell, or quiet to the point you can't even hear it. The acting is fine, they get a pass. There is no tension, no good scares or atmosphere. You never feel a sense of urgency, or fear. It is all around horrible as a horror film. But it was pretty entertaining, and just all around fine. You'll roll your eyes more than you'll jump in terror. The story was wrapped up, but that old Hollywood money machine will still be sniffing around this franchise.",4,34,51,14 September 2013
The Avengers," Looking back.
","As far as me liking superhero movies, it's either spider-man or batman, why? Because everything else usually sucks, this film is no exception. I would like to know why they would bring back Loki as the main villain, he is boring, he ain't menacing and overall doesn't offer any thing intriguing. Well, let's think what kind of army Loki will lead, I got it! Generic alien invasion. Where will it take place? why New york of course, oh my. Not to mention the aliens were weak and never poss-ed any threat, besides they are all coming out of a hole in the sky, very easy to concentrate fire for the military, but instead they send four super heroes. And the fact that the government was willing to destroy New york with a tactical nuke within 30 minutes of the invasion, and killing millions of people is absolutely ridiculous. But of course iron-man has got to save the day. You would think all of these superheroes together would be entertaining, and for the most part they are. If you are looking for something refreshing or even remotely smart, you will have to go somewhere else.The film is genius in the sense of bringing all these heroes together, the more times I watch it, the more I like it. I do have some gripes with it, but overall I hate to admit it has less faults then the dark knight rises, and is better then it to a certain extent. Really, I just like it for Tony Stark, the rest is alright.",7,2,10,8 December 2012
Alien 3," What is this ?
","What were they thinking? As I child I loved this movie, as with all alien films. Now that I'm older I see this films flaws, and there's a lot of them. Out of all the places this film could have taken place, it had to be at prison colony. Wow. And they killed off Hicks and Newt, okay. The characters suck and you don't care for them, the atmosphere is gone and now it's a splatter house. Too bad they didn't get someone who knew what they were doing. This film should have been great but instead becomes a complete mess and disgrace to the franchise, and unfortunately it only gets worse from here.Overall if you want to watch it, go for the special edition.",6,1,2,11 November 2012
Requiem for a Dream," Work of art my a**.
","I can't believe people can call this a masterpiece, it's mediocre at best. It feels less like an actual movie and more like something they would show in schools, minus the nudity. This film could have been better if it actually had a consistent plot, or even the basic elements to a story. It's an anti-drug movie that focuses on one dimensional characters, wow good job.The characters were very uninspired, except Ellen Burstyn, she was the only one that was remotely sympathetic. I didn't care for any of the other characters. To sum them up, they do bad things and suffer for it. To bad you couldn't get an emotional response out of me, that would have helped. If you want to shock people with drugs, show them a picture of Meth mouth, that would work. But instead we get a film that doesn't even feel like I'am watching a movie.This film is severely over-rated, it lacks any form of development or imagination. Could have been good if they came up with a better plot and more intriguing characters.",4,4,7,8 January 2013
Iron Man 3," May be the worst Iron man film.
","Don't bother reading this if you get butt hurt over negative comments on a film. It's 2:00am and I am p-ssed off. The movie was great for the first hour, I was loving it, aside from the BS writing. That twist, that stupid twist that ruined the whole movie. Lets give you a back drop. You've seen the trailer, it looked dark, it reminded me of the Drak Knight Rises. The Mandarian, he was the equivalent of Bane, more Badass and powerful than Stark. I mean the Mandarian was a big part of why I went to see this instead of waiting for the Blu-ray to come out. He could have been one of the best villains in the last decade, but they threw that idea straight out the window, just for a little comedy. This film should be in the comedy genre instead. Cheap humour, to be honest, I didn't find it that funny, but the general audience sure did. They tricked the audience, and how does the audience react, oh it's just a joke, lets laugh. I bet the writers thought they were real clever when they wrote that twist in. It's sad, up until that twist, the Mandarian was dare I say scary, just like Bane. Those news broadcast worked. Ben Kingsley was perfect, until he just turned out to be a drug addicted actor. Instead we get some generic douche bag villain, with little to no motivation for his cause, he comes equipped with atrocious dialogue as well. I'm sorry Guy Pierce, but your character was bargain bin quality. What else is there to complain about besides the worst twist in cinema history, lame as lame can be villain, and kiddie humour. Well apparently the iron man suits are made of paper mache, they fall apart like roast beef. But in the avengers, it can withstand any abuse you could imagine putting it through. This movie is just bad all around, even though I don't like the avengers, I at least have to say that it was miles better than this film. Here is what you have to do, watch the trailer before you go see the film, go see the film, and make up your mind on whether you were tricked, mislead, disheartened or just insulted as a viewer. I was all of those. This is this the same old 9 year old friendly marvel we all know. I would love to know what the fans of the comic thought of the Mandarian twist.",6,5,10,5 May 2013
Resident Evil: Afterlife," It's a brain numbing mess.
","I wasn't a big fan of the first film, and the second film was pretty entertaining with Nemesis, and the third film is my favourite. But man oh man is this film a slap in the face. This film can only be described as dribble for the brain-dead viewer, or painful for fans of Resident evil in general. The new characters were just plain bad, but I did like the inclusion of the Redfields. But they end up vanishing in Retribution, so thats a slap in the face for me. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was the executioner, he was cool as s**t. You know what would be cool, him versus Pyramid head, I'd pay to see that. Well time to get into the flaws. The biggest being the slow-motion. There was so much of it I was laughing in frustration. It completely ruined the action scenes. The Wesker fight scene was disappointing, he is clearly more powerful than Alice. But he loses because he very slowly walks toward her with his mouth open, which allows her to shoot him, it was just stupid. And where did the Los plagues come from, like seriously. And in RE-extinction didn't they say the world dried up, along with the water, but here there is plenty of water. Don't quote me on that I'm still not 100 percent sure on it. This film ended up making nearly 300 million at the box office, which in the directors mind means let's put as little time and effort into making Retribution. If you are looking for a dumb movie, with nothing intriguing, watch it, if not you have been warned.",3,5,9,5 January 2013
Iron Man 2," Just your average film.
","I'm not the biggest fan of marvel film adaptations, but I did like Sam Raimi's spider man trilogy. I didn't have to high expectations coming into this film, so I wasn't disappointed with the results. I'm just going to say it, this film was average at best and I always forget I've even watched this film.Let's start with the characters. Tony stark still has his over confident personality, which is still better than all these other wooden characters from marvel films lately. I thought whip-lash( if thats even his name) was going to be a bad-ass after seeing the trailers. He had his moments, but in the end he was never a threat, his fight scenes were short and he was easily beaten. Black widow served no purpose in my opinion, just a woman in tight clothing, big whoop. Hammer was just another annoying and useless villain.The action scenes were poorly done, I can only seem to remember the short one at the race track and the one at the stark expo thing. The end fight scene was horrible, left on a bad note. It was mildly amusing to see war machine and iron man destroy stark's house. At least this film wasn't completely mindless like most movies targeted at the general audience.To summarize, this film is not as good as the first one, and didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I was left unsatisfied, but thats just me.",6,0,3,12 December 2012
Hostel," Modern exploitation trash.
","This film actually could have been good if taken for a more serious route or even, you know been re-cut. I'd like to point out the first have half of the movie is naked woman, scene after scene, way to much. I even wonder is this movie going to pick up an hour in, it did a little. A first they didn't show to much gore, than they showed a bunch of it. I can't help but feel this movie didn't even try to be serious or shocking. I thought it would have but it's done in a in your face and over the top manor. I liked the story, but it was executed poorly and seemed more for teenagers with all the elements of drugs and prolonged nudity. Eli Roth could have done better but it just turned out the same as Cabin fever, maybe even lower. The characters were forgettable at best.I don't recommend it if your looking for a good time, but if you want a explicit and hardcore film go for it.",4,0,0,14 November 2012
Orphan," Good for one watch.
","Now I don't have much to say about this film so it's going to be a quick review. I would have liked it to be a little shorter, it went on for to long but luckily I didn't lose interest. The plot was decent and the twist wasn't entirely unpredictable. You grow to dislike some of the characters, mainly the husband and the kids. Why you may ask? Because they are stupid, the girl witnesses a murder and they boy is threatened with castration, so what do they do, nothing, you got to be kidding me. The husband was completely oblivious. I don't think anyone cared that he died. It was frustrating to watch as everyone would think Kate is crazy. At some points it got uncomfortable, mainly the sexual situations with the 'real life children'. When Esther was acting sexual to the dad, I felt disgusted. Sure they show boys looking at porn in this film, but I mean come on, this film has balls to say the least. There was some suspense throughout, but nothing major. This film is good for one viewing, I don't think I could sit through it again, nothing memorable just average. I recommend renting it.",5,2,4,6 January 2013
Silent Hill," Beautiful.
","This is definitely the best horror film to come out between 2000-2013. It's damn fine for a video game adaption, the best for that matter. As a huge fan of silent hill and horror in film, this film deserved a bigger fan base.I'm not going to get into the plot, I'll leave that for anyone who wants to view it. The atmosphere and camera work are spot on, some great stuff for a horror film. The soundtrack is some of the best music I have ever heard in my life. They took a bunch of music from separate games, and put it into one amazing soundtrack. Too bad they never released a soundtrack for purchase, they makes me sad, I could listen to this stuff for hours. I sit through the credits every time I watch this film, how many films does any one actually look forward to the end credits, just this one. Songs include: 1. Tears of 2. Laura's theme 3.You're not here 4. wounded warsong 5. Promise(reprise). I highly recommend you-tubing these songs. These songs have so much emotion to them, they are sad, depressing, but enjoyable to listen to. They really make me think.The film is 2 hours long, probably the only horror film that actually deserves that kind of runtime. I will admit, the scenes with Sean Beans character slow the pace down quite a bit, I'd like to see a cut with that just stayed in Silent hill the whole time. The visuals and sets look great, it's the real deal. The acting is a little iffy at times, Jodelle Ferland really didn't sit well with me at certain points. I don't know, she did a good job in Case 39 though. Pyramid head didn't get much screen time, I wish they would have unleashed him at the end climax. The Colin monster was pretty sick the first time I watched this, you would not want to get caught by that.The sequel was very poorly made compared to this, even just frustrating at how they squandered it. Here's high hopes to a worthy third film.",8,2,4,13 August 2013
Alien," Best sci-fi horror movie ever.
","Alien is a masterpiece, same with aliens but I'll get to that another time. I would like to start with the Xenomorph, that beast is likely to send chills down your spine, the design is great thanks to Giger. The atmosphere and the music mix together so well It's unbelievable. I always liked how dark and mysterious the whole planet was, I wanted to see more of it. The cast is believable for once in a horror movie. The Nostromo itself is another great part about the film, it's huge and dark.You get the feeling of isolation, and the fact the alien could be anywhere puts you at constant suspense. This film is my all time favourite horror movie.This film should be viewed at least once in a lifetime, in my opinion a lot more than once.",10,1,3,14 November 2012
Predator," One the best action films ever.
","I will admit i've seen this film between 70 and 80 times, and it has never got old, not once. I'd like to begin with the Predator itself, the creature is phenomenal and probably the best alien on film. Nothing is more (bada**) than a predator. I should probably tell you I'am a huge fan, and collect what ever I can of the predators. The cast is filled with a bunch of macho tough guys, who get obliterated by the predator. The characters were likable enough and got the job done. The music is faced paced and thrilling, and fits the film well. The predator suit is incredible and only gets better in Predator 2. I enjoy replaying the rebel camp scene because it is entertaining as all he**. The end fight scene is classic, especially when the predator first takes his mask off and lets out that awesome roar.Predator is one of my favourite films of all time, it is the ultimate sci-Fi/action film.",9,0,1,14 November 2012
Man of Steel," Iron Man 3 sucks.
","So I liked this film when I saw it in theatres, but now I think it is absolutely awe-full, and Iron man 3 is better, go figure. It's funny how I hated superman all of my life, up until I saw this film. Sure there are a few complaints I have with the film, but it's still worthy of an 8 out of 10. I'll just make a quick statement about the 3D. I barley noticed it, maybe I was immersed, but there wasn't much utilization of it. The pacific rim trailer for instance, had some good rains effects, that looked cool. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying it wasn't stand out quality. There are no important spoilers, I just put it up as a precaution.The pacing of this film was pretty bad. Kent became superman instantly, it felt rushed. His character development only shows in the flashback scenes, it felt really wonky. Maybe I was just expecting it to be similar to Batman begins or Iron Man. Trying to explain it is pointless. So Zod comes into play. He was kind of under minded in the beginning when Jor-el beat him up. Michael Shannon was a good villain, he got better as the film progressed. Henry Cavill was perfect as Clark Kent. The supporting cast was good, much better characters than any Marvel film, not trying to hate Marvel. Faora-Ul was...cool, yeah.The atmosphere is very good, it was serious and not goofy like some other super hero films. The visual effects really didn't stand out, they looked the same as any other big budget films offerings. As I mentioned, the pacing was poorly done, it only got on track towards the end. The whole fight scene in that town was just pointless, maybe it was just showing that Zod's soldiers were stronger than Clark. The terraforming machine was a pretty scary thing, maybe it's the fact that it destroyed metropolis. How many people died during that scene, how many sky scrappers were levelled, it seemed a bit excessive way to open a franchise. Never the less, it made for a intense plot point. What else is there, the music was great, every thing just felt right.I am looking forward to the next man of steel film, probably to see Lex Luthor, and more character development. I doubt it will be as profitable has The dark knights films or iron man.",4,2,5,22 June 2013
The Hills Have Eyes," Great remake, very enjoyable.
","The first time I saw this trailer I was actually scarred to look at the screen, I steered clear of it for awhile. I finally gave it a watch 3 or so years ago and I have to say I wasn't scarred at all, but boy was I entertained. This goes on the list of the best remakes. The characters weren't your average stupid people, just an unlucky family. I did find it strange that all these people go missing, including scientists and no one looks for them. This film builds enough suspense , not letting you fully see the mutants. Then they show them in full, they weren't scary but they definitely were sadistic. The last half becomes a revenge action movie. There is a great and bloody fight scene, and large amounts of blood and body parts, more than enough for any horror fan. The acting was good enough, they did a good job. I was entertained from start to finish with the last half pulling all the right punches.Recommended to any horror fan, beware average movie go'Er's, this film doesn't mess around.",7,1,4,14 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Unnessacery, but not bad.
","I loved Sam Raimi's first trilogy and was very Skeptical about this film, and thought it wasn't going to be good. Well it was okay, not as good as the first three films, but better than all the other stuff Marvel has been spewing out.It starts out as a generic high school movie, an outcast gets bullied and has a crush on a girl, blah blah. At first the movie was pretty boring but it picked up about 40 minutes in, to the point where I didn't notice the time going by. The origins of Spider-man are told again, only in a different way. This film felt like it had more emotion in it than the first Spider-man. Martin Sheen was good as uncle Ben, Curt Conners was nothing new. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did a better job than Tobey and Kirsten in the previous entries. I still prefer Tobey Maguire as Spider-man thoughOver all this film was good popcorn entertainment, but nothing too special. It's not the best Spider-man movie but it is a good start for the next series of films.",6,0,1,26 December 2012
Django Unchained," More Tarantino goodness.
","Quentin Tarantino is my favourite writer/director of all time. The dialogue in his films is pure gold and it keeps you entertained more than most other movies. The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long, but it sure didn't feel like it, aside from some pain in my leg.The characters were great, my favourite being Dr. Schultz. The leads are well developed, and all have their moments. Just to summarize, the acting was good and you believed who the characters were. The violence in this film is something only Tarantino would do, when people get shot, they turn into blood fountains. It is on par with Kill Bill in terms of gore. The cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack was really good, it fit well with the film. The plantation shootout towards the end was incredible and extremely bloody, I felt that should have been the end because it was such a big and memorable scene, and the film slowed down after that adrenaline rush.I've been seeing a lot of reviews giving this film a 1 star rating, why? Because they don't understand Tarantino or the type of movie he was trying to make, this film is presented like a mix of Inglorious Basterds and exploitation films from the 60s and 70s. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, but people just don't understand,the people complaining or over sensitive or only enjoy Uber serious movies. And people complaining about the over use of the N word is ridiculous, have they even scene Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, plenty of N words in those but no one complains. There are a lot more offensive movies out there that don't get as much hate. Anyone who has seen his prior work will understand why the movie is like it is.This film was a really good time, and very funny, the audience liked it a lot. It was good to finally see a Tarantino film on the big screen and an overall memorable experience. Not his best film, but definitely one of the best films of the year.Jan 18: I just saw an article that states the following, collectible line is discontinued. That hurts and it hurts hard. I am a big fan of action figures and collectibles, and was looking forward to buying a Dr.Shultz hot toys figure, well I guess I'll just go buy a Hanz Landa one instead, what a joke. I can buy a Nazi, but I can't buy a German Dr., that is ridiculous, just think about that for awhile.",8,3,14,28 December 2012
Insidious," It was okay.
","These are my brief thoughts. With all the love people give this movie, it attracted my attention, luckily I found it on sale and bought it. Surprisingly there wasn't to many scares, but there was a lot of suspense and creepy moments. Nothing I lost sleep over.The plot was just fine, nothing mind blowing. The characters were not very interesting, but they served their purpose. The music was few and far between. You either get loud screeching or upbeat songs that the ghosts listen to. Why do they listen to music, who knows. Now we get into the demons. First we got this Darth maul/devil which looks like a generic picture of a devil, you can tell they weren't too creative. Then we got smiling ghosts/demons that a can't help but smile right back, I mean they look so stupid, you can't stop yourself from laughing. And the scene where the lead actress get's licked by the ghost just looks ridiculous. They pretty much failed to scare me with the supernatural beings.The film wasn't great, but it is worth at least one watch. When it comes to smiling demons I think I'll stick with The Evil Dead.",5,0,0,8 January 2013
Evil Dead," Same old bland stuff.
","When I heard that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were backing this I had hope. But when it comes to remakes, you shouldn't get excited over them. I'm going to begin my ranting and raving now.Brief trailer thoughts: Before I get into the movie, I want to talk about the future of horror, or should I say lack of a future. There were three horror trailers, two about home invasions, and the other was that garbage Carrie remake. Why can't we ever get good horror movies any more, you either get a gore fest or generic ghost story. I am currently creating horror stories that are miles better than anything I have seen in years, it's just sad how low horror has stooped.The film: I am a fan of Raimi's three films, evil dead 2 being my favourite. I must admit this is my third favourite out of the bunch, mainly because I really didn't care for Army of Darkness. The opening scene was rather dull, you don't learn anything, it was a horrible opening. Then we meet the characters, I didn't care for any of them, Eric may have unleashed the demon, but he was the only one I liked. The movie was pretty boring until stuff started going south, once that occurred I never lost interest. The atmosphere is high at some points, but fails to remain constant. The woods are the highlight, they look great, I loved the grey tones and the rain. The only notable gore effects were when that girl cuts her arm off, that was awesome, the rest of the effects have been done before. These are the only good parts of the film. Every thing else was garbage, it seems explicit violence was all this film had to offer, to bad I don't care about that kind of stuff anymore. It's a shame this one didn't stand out much, but it is still better than most horror films. I gave this a six, I also gave Texas Chainsaw a six, I have to say I liked Texas Chainsaw better. Oh, and I should mention this film isn't even remotely scary or suspenseful, because you can already predict how the film is going to play out.It's the second best horror film of the year so far, I sincerely doubt there will be anything that could knock this film or Texas Chainsaw off of their perch, so for that I say give it a watch.I find it amusing how bad all of these reviews are getting trolled, it's hilarious how may thumbs down these got, mine went from a 4 out of 5 people agree, to a 4 out of 26 people people agree in the matter of a few hours, I love it, it's hilarious, keep crying.",6,13,62,5 April 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," Crime and horror, hell yes.
","From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house.The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well.The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects.I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.",7,0,2,12 December 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Disappointed to say the least.
","I have never heard anyone say anything bad about this, having never seen it or even looked into what it was about I picked up the limited edition steel book, being excited to see it. Well the movie was very unexciting, it left me wondering about many things, mainly what the ending meant. This movie isn't bad, but it is very strange. It has long drawn out scenes where nothing is happening, and you are just looking at space ships floating around. The effects were incredible, even knowing how they did some of the stuff, it still was great to see. There are some great moments of suspense, and the atmosphere is great at some points, like when the scientist's are approaching the monolith, but the scene ends right when it gets good, and never shows you what happened. I liked the scenes with HAL, but you probably already know about that. This film has a lot of good ideas but they are over shadowed by how boring and pointless the film is at times. I would probably enjoy this film more if it were re-cut, but that won't happen. It's an interesting film, but I don't consider to be one of the best films ever made, like many others do.",7,1,4,29 December 2012
Mama," Good start, but fell flat.
","I just got back from seeing it and these are my impressions. I prefer going to the theatres for horror movies, mainly because some of the scare tactics work on the big screen, I can't say the same for watching it at home. The movie had a Strong momentum through out, but at the end it loses it's drive. Once you see mama in full view, it is no longer scary, hell Lily was scarier than mama most of the time. Now I do not like cgi monsters, I was fine with the cgi up until they have her standing in front of the camera for long sections. If you were scarred throughout, don't worry, after the ending I guarantee you won't lose any sleep, I know I won't. The plot with the doctor was good, but it ended up serving little purpose. The kids did a good job, and they look especially creepy when they are crawling around like animals. There was some good suspense and plenty of jump scares to keep you tense. I wonder if the film would have benefited from having a real actress playing mama instead of the computer, I would have liked to have seen that. This is one of those films were the trailer was better than the film, I'm not saying the movie was bad, it's just that the trailer made it look like so much more. The only part I didn't enjoy about this experience was the two obnoxious bimbos' beside me, they were in their late twenties and were acting like 16 year old kids, that's why I like going to the theatre at 11:00am on a Saturday morning, no one to annoy me. Overall the film is a good waste of an hour and forty minutes, check it out if you are interested.",5,4,12,19 January 2013
Sinister," It was alright.
","I was bored and wanted something to do, so I went to see Sinister. I would like to start off by saying if I saw this movie seven years ago it would have gave me nightmares. There is a large amount of suspense throughout the film, mostly during the night time. There is also a lot 'LOUD' noises they use to startle you, even one after another, they worked by the way. I found the Super 8 footage very disturbing, especially the lawn work scene, I thought that was disgusting. The image of that scene was burned into my mind for awhile. The original score is surprisingly good, with some creepy tracks to go along with the snuff films. Buguul was a different change of pass for a haunted house or should I say haunted family film. Much better than all the other paranormal garbage we've been getting. The acting was alright, the story was neat, and the twist was sickening.If you want a good scare I recommend it, just don't let children watch it because even I was scared, not many movies do that for me.",6,0,1,13 November 2012
Pulp Fiction," The best of the best.
","This film is phenomenal, easily top 5 or even the best film of all time. It is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film, but when I watch this movie I feel happy, I listen to every word, and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening. It is shocking that this film only won one Oscar, very frustrating to even think about it, but most people seem to agree this is much better than Forrest Gump, I feel myself hating that movie for these reasons. Samuel l. Jackson should have won an Oscar, his performance is incredible, I hang on every word he says, he also has a lot of memorable lines. The characters in this film act so well together, that it doesn't even seem like their acting, but are instead meaning it. The soundtrack couldn't have been any better, it is perfect. Tarantino's talent is displayed in full view here, at the top of his abilities. This film is not serious, it is more relaxed and entertaining, but done so well you take it seriously, if that makes sense. I rarely have strong feelings for most films, but this film is different than most films, different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines. This film is tied with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for the best film of all time. No film will ever be like Pulp Fiction ever again, unless they copy it, that says a lot. I'd recommend this film to anyone, everybody needs to see this film, it is the best of Tarantino's masterpieces. I can't believe people cry about this films success, 1 star ratings by people that can't handle this film.",10,1,3,28 December 2012
The Conjuring," Are you kidding me, seriously people.
","What is with the critics, 86 percent fresh on rotten tomatoes. A 7.8 rating here. Have the reviewers ever watched a horror movie before, because this is ridiculous.The film is well shot and well made, duh! lets give it a 8 out of 10. That's the logic I see it as, nostalgia. But back here in reality, we have seen this same freaking movie a hundred times, at least I have, I don't know about the rest of you who saw this. I'm just going to throw the 'TRUE STORY' aspect out the window, come on, is there any proof that those advents happened scene for scene, word for word. How about a 'TRUE STORY' that ended horrifically, not the same BS happy ending complete with generic play by play demons. It is just a cliché film, evil dead was better then this, and that was a piece of crap. I am really bumping this film down for all of it's unoriginality. But that means nothing in Hollywood, especially considering it's a horror film. If this film got such high ratings, what about a film like Silent Hill, it's well shot and made. It's more original then most horror films. But no, it gets ripped apart by critics.It wasn't scary, that stupid loud music cue when something pops up is all this film has to offer. The demons are just forgettable. Now compare that to the grudge, the demons are insanely scary, and it lacks music cues. It scarred you miles ahead of this film. All I know is, I am going to sleep well tonight, and probably forget I ever saw this movie. The high ratings are a lie.",5,4,8,11 August 2013
Prometheus," A good start, but I need more.
","This film is in no way, shape or form a bad movie, it's high above average, but only for a few reason's. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a long time, I even went on opening day, that was a bad idea because our seats were in the second row from the front, so I didn't get to enjoy the 3D. Noomi Rapace and Micheal Fassbender were good, Charlize Theron was just there and the rest of the crew is garbage. I found the Charlie character to be annoying. It baffles me how all these characters, especially when they find the pyramid thing with the alien artifacts, you would think they would be excited as hell, but they even get mad about their findings. There are a lot of plot holes and some of the actions they do are ridiculous, at one point they even have an baby alien on board the ship and they don't care or do anything about it. And how a woman can give birth to a squid(face-hugger) is beyond me. But i'm just complaining now so i'll get on with the good things. The visuals are incredible, same with the original score. The sets look great, the ship is fantastic. The atmosphere is great at some points, although not many. The Fifield creature scene was great, very well done. The space jockeys or engineers, whatever, were disappointing at first, but you will get the reasoning behind, so it is acceptable. This film would feel much more complete with a sequel, after all it is going in a different way then the alien franchise, and i'm glad they chose to do so. This film should be experienced with a good sound system, maybe even 3D, but I can't say anything about that.Recommend to any fan of science-fiction, I have watched this film a few times and I enjoy it more with each watch.",7,4,5,22 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The biggest superhero movie ever.
","Christopher Nolan has completed the definitive super-hero trilogy, the Dark Knight films are the mark of quality others superhero directors( I'm looking at you Joss Whedon) should follow. This film is no kiddie flick like the recent marvel films were, the more mature and dark feeling gives it a great feel.Okay let's start with the pacing. The film was two hours and forty minutes long, if were three hours long I still would have enjoyed it. The first hour pretty much sets up the story, so I didn't mind the slow pace. They definitely put a lot into this film, there were quite a few scenes that were unnecessary, such as the Miranda sub-plot. The action scenes were thrilling without being mindless. The score only gives these scenes a much grander feel. The fight between Bane and Batman was incredible, I couldn't look away. The set piece scenes were great without being over the top. The large lack of cgi in some of these scenes is much appreciated.The main cast of returning characters were good as usual, Micheal Caine gives a more emotional performance this time around. Tom Hardy was awe inspiring as Bane, I found him much more menacing than previous villains. Some points in the film the suspense,fear when Bane is on screen or going to show up was undeniably genuine. I did enjoy the cameo from Scarecrow, a nice touch. Anne Hathaway was good as cat woman, at first I didn't have to high of hopes for that character, but it all worked out.This film is a must see, it is far better than any recent superhero movie I could think of. I own the limited edition Blu-ray, which by now is very pricey, only recommended to big fans. Get the Blu-ray if you want the full experience, the sound wasn't even on high and the walls were rattling. 7/10",7,3,8,10 December 2012
The Purge," Thee worst film I have ever seen.
","Oh my god, this is the most frustrating piece of sh-t I have ever had to sit through. There was at least four different times I just wanted to shut it off, and break something. I'll come right out and say never ever buy this film, even if you could get it for 99 cents, it is not worth that. I'm going to use the R word, even if people get sensitive over it. If you have seen this movie, than you'll understand why.The actions/characters: The school girl daughter put's her family in danger because she wants to get laid. The son puts his family in danger because he has a 12 IQ. The mother puts the family in danger because she is the most useless piece of sh-t this side of the San Andreas. The father is the only rational one, but even he succumbs to his family's p-ssy face nature. Seriously, they live in a ultra violent world, and all they worry about is green peace. I have never screamed so loud and so viciously at a film in my entire life, but these characters had me pulling out my hair. The whole film centers on them having to hand over a bum to the strangers wannabes, even when they tie the bum up, they cry like babies about it. They would rather die to psychopaths, than hand over some bum they have never seen before. This is a world of Psychopaths, people cut for survival, or wimpy losers. And that whole family were a bunch of babies. They even got involved with a death plot by their neighbours who try to kill them. But the bum comes back and saves them and turns the tide. What do they do, let them walk. Yeah, your destroyed house and dead husband must be thrilled about that choice. That wife needed a good smacking from Ethan Hawke, same with the boy, and the daughter, even that stupid little robot needed some too.This was the dumbest, most idiotic, piece of trash I have ever seen, and I have watched a lot of Asylum films, wow. And you want to know the worst part about it, there's going to be a sequel. Hands down thee worst main stream horror film of 2013, congratulations. I give it a 0 out of 10 stars.",1,2,4,8 October 2013
Godzilla," A crowd pleaser, but not what we were hoping for.
","10 years, I've waited ten years for this, there was no way it could live up to the hype. This is all I have been doing the last 2 months, scouring the internet for Godzilla this and Godzilla that. I see why people are complaining about this film, and nitpicking ever inch. This was supposed to be the standard for any monster film to come. But the little snots who cry because this was supposed to be a masterpiece of cinema, it's Godzilla, what did you expect. I have viewed this film three times already, so let's get into it.Audience reactions: The Thursday crowd didn't show much excitement. But the Friday group was going bananas, they cheered and clapped three times, it was a sold out theatre doing this, that is the first time I had ever seen that happen.The story: It's a very well laid out structure, all be it a little rushed. The first hour sets everything up, it's slow. But once the Muto breaks free, the film is lightning fast, forget time relevance or pacing. The monster madness happens so fast that you don't get time to savour it. The last 30 minutes was rushed beyond belief, the entire city is destroyed in like 30 minutes real time. The pacing really is the biggest down fall of this film. You get nothing, then they tease you, then nothing, then they tease you, they you get everything, but you missed it. This is why you need to see it a second time, it actually improves when viewed again.Characters/monsters: I forgot about Bryan Cranston just about as fast as the film did. Aaron Johnson was alright, Olsen was good. Ken didn't have much to do besides his( nature, Godzilla) love speech. Sally Hawkins is virtually unnoticeable. And David, he's alright. This film should have been called Muto, they have the most screen time and character development in the film. Who am I forgetting.... I know there is something missing. Oh yeah Godzilla's in this, with all of his 15 minutes of screen time, but it is a glorious 15 minutes.Effects: The effects are top tier, everything looks great. The most impressive effect goes to the Muto's, they look real good. Like real life good. The cinematography really makes these monsters look larger than life. Godzilla looks good for the most part, but I'm not used to seeing him move so fast. The sound design is really good. Godzilla's roar rocks the whole theatre.Best scenes: Anything with the Muto's in it, the bridge scene, the climax. But the best scene is hands down one of the most well crafted pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The Honolulu scene, my Godzilla it was so well paced and shot, this scene alone is worth the price of admission.Notes: It's worth checking out for the casual viewer, I don't see why people wouldn't enjoy it. The action is great, the set pieces are great. And yes, this film is the best monster film since King Kong(2005), hey why not Jurassic Park, yes it is the best monster film since Jurassic park. After viewing this film for a third time, I have come to the conclusion that Gareth dropped the ball. Watch the teaser trailer, that is what I wanted, that is what the people needed. If he had just done that, and then done this film as a sequel, it would have been perfect. We really needed a film to set Godzilla up first.",7,7,13,15 May 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Over rated, could have been better.
","I've heard nothing but good reviews for this film, so I thought I'd check it out. Where to begin? The story of this film was alright, but the whole cabin thing was horrible. The characters would you believe it or not are exactly the same as in every other horror film, boring to watch. I actually felt like I was going to fall asleep watching this film, that was until they went to the underground facility. The movie sky rocketed with entertainment, there were so many monsters and people getting torn apart, I couldn't believe all the crazy stuff was actually happening, the last twenty minutes were a horror fans dream. If only the movie would have taken place in the brightly lite facility, instead of the dark forest. I guess the fact that the facility workers were all celebrating while the woman was getting beaten by the creature was somewhat unsettling. I didn't find the movie to be clever in anyway.Over all the film wasn't as great as everyone said it was in my opinion, if you want to watch a movie that takes place in a cabin your best bet is The Evil Dead or it's remake that is coming out.",5,1,3,13 November 2012
Evil Dead II," One of the best 80's horror films.
","This film is the most crazy and over the top film I have ever seen, and I love it even more with each viewing. The setting and atmosphere are incredible, that cabin is one of the most memorable buildings in horror, in my opinion. The effects are great, the amount of blood is so ridiculous it makes me laugh. Ash is still one of the best characters in any horror franchise. My favourite line in the film is 'groovy', who doesn't love that part. His hand becoming possessed, and him having to cut it off is probably my favourite scene. The actors and actress's do their job just fine. I remember seeing this film when I was young, and always looking forward to the next time I could see it again. It's more comedic and not as gory as the first film.This is a truly classic horror film, to bad more can't be as enjoyable as this.",8,0,1,18 November 2012
