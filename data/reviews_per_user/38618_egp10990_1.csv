It," Not as Good as the Original
","I am a gigantic fan of the original 'It' miniseries, and this latest version pales in comparison. First and foremost there is a complete over abundance of CGI. This made the film so much less scary than the practical effects of the original because so many things just looked fake. Secondly the clown is overshadowed by the brilliance of Tim Curry in the original. The appeal of his Pennywise was that he wasn't overly creepy looking. You could see his clown showing up at a birthday party and not be too hesitant to get a balloon from him. 2017 Pennywise is just your typical creepy clown. No child I know would want to want to go near him. I also found it odd that this version took place in the late 80's. I understand why they did that but it just didn't ring true to the book. I also appreciated the kids in the original more. They were more fleshed out and likable. All these critiques being said, I will say that the film kept me entertained the whole time. The kids were pretty endearing and funny. Ritchie was particularly entertaining. There were some scary parts that weren't done by computer, and there's a nice little homage to Tim Curry's Pennywise in the film. It's worth a watch.",7,2,10,9 September 2017
