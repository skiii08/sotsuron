Marie Antoinette," This movie seems to drag on forever!
","I would have left early but I was with an elite movie crowd and didn't want to be disrespectful. Apparently, Sofia didn't inherit the talent gene from daddy - which is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to seeing this! There were a lot of scene's that could have been completely left out and many that should have been developed more. If directed differently, this could have been a great movie, but this version leaves much to be desired. There was really no plot so to speak and the music was random 1980's music! As a book, this may have been a decent read, but as a movie it's a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even suggest renting it!",1,28,58,29 September 2006
