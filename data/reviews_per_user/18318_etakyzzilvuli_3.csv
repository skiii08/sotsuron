Men in Black 3," My first and favorite MIB movie
","This was the first movie in the franchise I watched. It was at a drive-in and even though I didn't understand much, the film was incredibly entertaining and tear-jerking. I've now watched the other MIB films, but for some reason, I'm a sucker for time travel!",7,1,1,5 July 2019
Toy Story 4," Good Overall
","'Toy Story 4' wasn't the best, but it wasn't terrible. It was mediocre. There were a couple plot points that surprised me, which I liked: That girl denying Gabby in the store, the tearful scene where a little girl at the carnival was lost, and of course, Woody's decision to stay with Bo. Besides these points, the whole movie was pretty predictable. It had a lot of the same concepts that 'Toy Story 3' had, including the 'one kid vs many' issue, the new location that takes up most of the movie, the mean character who is mean because they've gone through a lot, etc. It almost seems they were unsatisfied with the outcome of the third movie that they had to make a fourth just to alter the decision Woody makes at the end of the film.",7,1,2,19 July 2019
The Martian," Surprisingly good
",This movie is as good as the book but in different way. I enjoyed the creative liberty they took to tell the story of Mark Watney,9,1,3,6 September 2019
