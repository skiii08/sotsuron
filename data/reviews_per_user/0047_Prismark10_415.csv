Ford v Ferrari," Le Mans '66
","Ford v Ferrari sees Christian Bale channeling his inner Nigel Mansell. He plays the racer Ken Mills, a war hero from Sutton Coldfield who became a maverick race driver for the fledgeling Ford racing team.Mills is recruited by former racer turned car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) who has been hired by the Ford Motor Company to turn around the company's fortunes by making their cars look hip. To do this they are going to knock Ferrari off their perch and win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Of course it is odd to see Ford, a corporate Goliath to be cast as the underdog here. The racing division is championed by Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) but the fly in the ointment is Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) a square peg in a round hole.In their sights is Ferrari, who themselves are struggling financially and have the temerity to object to being bought out by Ford. In retaliation Ford develop a racing car at a super speed with Miles testing it.Ford v Ferrari is an enjoyable if overlong melodrama, the Le Mans race scenes are done very well. I did find the portrayal of Beebe as the token villain to be facile. He was there to give the film unnecessary tension.The best performance is from Bale who leaves Damon behind.",6,10,21,22 January 2020
The King's Speech," Words don't come easy
","The King's Speech was a low budget British film that became a box office behemoth and won the Best Picture Oscar.It is a tale of Bertie, the younger son of the monarch who tries to overcome his stammer which might be rooted on his upbringing in a severe household. When his older brother abdicated from the throne, Bertie is elevated as King George VI and needs to speak to his subjects as war with Germany is approaching.The King's Speech is almost a theatrical tale opened up for the cinema. Despite director Tom Hooper using green screen for some exterior shots, making creative use of art & set direction, this is a small scale film with big stars who give big performances ranging from Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce.Ultimately the film concentrates on the developing friendship between two men, Bertie and his unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue, who looks at the psychological basis as to why Bertie had the stammer in the first place.However I did find the film a little too sedate, stuffy and not all that interesting. The comedy sometimes felt forced as Logue uses foul language to make Bertie lose his stammer.",6,2,2,7 September 2018
Insidious: Chapter 2," Short on scares
","Insidious: Chapter 2 has Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) possessed by the spirit of a demonic woman in black.The Lambert's might have moved homes but as the dead medium Elise (Lin Shaye) warned Renai (Rose Byrne) that their son Dalton is haunted not the house.Dalton can project into some dark world of tortured spirits. Something he has inherited from his father. Josh was also haunted as a child, now he may be a danger to his own family.The sequel is certainly well made and has good production values for a horror film by director James Wan.It is still an uneven, unnecessary and a generic horror film which never garnered my interest.",3,1,2,10 April 2019
The Lobster," Dancing on my own
","The Lobster is an absurdist black comedy with a deadpan narration. It is set in a Dystopian world where being single can turn you into an animal.Yorgos Lanthimos examines both politics and sexual politics. It is an interesting take on the pressure society puts on people to have a companion and the pitfalls of political factions. In some ways this is George Orwell mixed with Monty Python. A kind of modern day Brazil, the movie directed by Terry Gilliam.David (Colin Farrell) arrives in a hotel after his wife has left him. The newly arrived guests have 45 days to find a partner or be turned into an animal. David chooses to be a lobster if he fails to find a suitable relationship.The hotel has strange rules such as forbidding masturbation which can lead to harsh punishment. Guests are encouraged to partner up by attending dances and finding partners who they share something in common with.When David escapes the hotel and heads for the woods. He enters a commune for committed singles who want to be independent but they also have strange and eccentric rules. This includes dancing on their own to electric music and digging your own grave.In the forest David finds romance with a short sighted woman (Rachel Weisz) which is forbidden.The Lobster cannot maintain its offbeat premise. It runs out of gas and just wants to be eccentric for the sake of it. The (deliberate) flat performances and narration soon becomes tiring and its originality fades once David escapes from the hotel.",6,1,2,28 September 2019
The Avengers," Avengers Assemble at once
","It takes effort and skill to pull off a project like this.Twenty years ago Marvel had comic characters that translated into poor films while DC had Batman and Superman movies.Now Marvel Films have a juggernaut. They released their second tier superheroes (Thor, Captain America) to great acclaim and it all lead up to The Avengers film where the characters of the Marvel cinema universe converged.Iron Man as portrayed by Robert Downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up Captain America. There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office.",7,2,7,1 October 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Back to the blade
","The original Blade Runner was a futuristic noir thriller. It did not need a sequel but maybe like another film released in 1982, Tron, the producers thought a belated sequel was required.Denis Villeneuve directs with Ridley Scott taking a hands off Executive Producer role. The visuals are still great but not as breathtaking as the original film. We see a dark multi ethnic rain soaked LA with giant billboards.Ryan Gosling plays Agent K, a replicant whose job is to retire the older replicants produced in the era of the original film. The newer replicants are OK still being used as slave workers.Agent K comes across some buried bones which again leads to an investigation into identity, false memories and the whereabouts of an impossible child, now grown up.Jared Leto plays the mad messianic Wallace, the man who has taken over the Tyrell corporation and produces replicants but wants to creates life. He thinks Agent K will find the answers and sends one of his replicants out to assist and hinder his mission.Harrison Ford returns as Deckard who hangs around in a desolate Las Vegas hotel with holographic images of Elvis and Frank Sinatra who might hold the clues to what happened to the child.Blade Runner 2049 is really an overlong art film, it actually lacks the thriller element of the original film even some of the weird humour. I rewatched the original Blade Runner before I saw the sequel, despite the po-faced narration his Deckard provides some humour.Blade Runner 2049 has a few cameos from the original film including an iconic recreation of a replicant which excellent use of CGI.However the pacing and length is a negative, the story is not strong enough to sustain it although I have to credit the writers to lead you up one way and them wrong foot the viewer.",7,9,17,11 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Not the right throw
","I guess Hollywood has run out of film ideas concerning the prejudice black people suffered in various sports so now they have turned to the inspiring true story of people from cricket loving India trying to break into professional baseball.Jon Hamm plays the struggling sports agent who hits upon an idea of launching a talent contest to find baseball talent in India and then bringing them over to the USA and train them for the major league.The film has location shooting in India as Hamm tagged along with a snoozing Alan Arkin looks for pitchers with the right throwing arm. We have scenes of Mumbai, Agra with the obligatory Taj Mahal.When he finds two pitchers we have the cultural clash as they try to adapt to life in the States as well as impressing the big league scouts as Hamm and his partner stave off money troubles.The film has a side plot of Hamm trying to sign a major league player which echoes Jerry Maguire right to the bit where the player signs with a bigger agency as Hamm is diverted to look after his other charges.There is nothing original in the story. In fact it's downright predictable with only the idea of getting players from India being novel. It also felt too long which led me to believe the film was padded.Jon Hamm and Aasif Mandvi give a lot of conviction as the struggling sports agents. Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal have the right balance of sweet eyed innocence, young people leaving a village life in search to hit the jackpot in the lottery of life.",5,2,3,2 May 2015
Angels & Demons," The pope must diet
","I wonder if Dan Brown does walking tours of various cities and then armed with a guidebook constructs his novels.Angels & Demons is a race against time to find four captured cardinals somewhere in Rome soon after the pope has died. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is hired by the Catholic Church to find them. He is assisted by scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) who worked on the CERN project in Geneva, where the anti matter device from the supercollider is stolen. The secret society, Illuminati are thought to be responsible of the threats to kill the cardinal for the church's historical anti science stance. Langdon runs, goes to famous landmarks such as the Pantheon which is curiously absent of many tourists, evades an assassin and explains the clues to the audience.The film is bafflingly entertaining for all the wrong reasons, the plot is just plain daft. It makes little sense. A helicopter suddenly appearing just in time for an important plot point, it shows how vacuous this movie is. Then again Oscar winning hack Akiva Goldsman is one of the writers so expectations are automatically lowered.",3,1,3,24 August 2018
First Man," No lift off
","If The Right Stuff was about the first American men in space. First Man is a kind of quasi sequel about the first man on the moon.Damien Chazelle follows up La La Land with a breathtaking opening sequence of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) as test pilot. So far it looks like another stab at the Best Picture Oscar.There are some other amazing sequences including the actual mission to the moon and the scenes on the moon. The scenes where Armstrong looks at the surface of the moon to me felt rather realistic.As a drama it is listless, even po faced. Chazelle's film never blasts off, maybe the script was at fault for focussing too much on Armstrong who looks impassive when he should be impassioned.Claire Foy comes across better as his wife with the limited material she is given. The actor playing Buzz Aldrin looks all wrong.It is such an uneven film with bouts of boredom along with jolts of some wonderful visuals.",4,2,5,15 December 2018
Vertigo," Heightened tension
","Vertigo is a film whose plot elements have been borrowed many times and has been a huge influence on Brian De Palma.James Stewart is a San Francisco detective Scottie Ferguson who develops a fear of heights during a rooftop chase in the opening scenes of the film.An old college friend Gavin Elster hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) because she might be possessed by some ancestral spirit. Scottie becomes enchanted, even obsessed by Madeleine who he saves from suicide and falls in love. However later throws herself from a church and he is unable to save her because of his fear of heights, Scottie falls into a deep depression.After he has got better he finds a girl (Judy Barton) who reminds him of Madeleine and he also becomes obsessed with wanting her to look and dress like Madeleine which leads the film to another diversion.The restored version of this film looks gorgeous although it also highlights the backdrop in Stewart's apartment. Novak in dual roles simply shines and the film is intriguing. Barbara Bel Geddes who has a thing for Scottie disappears half way through the film as her role becomes redundant and James Stewart does well as he again looks to become unhinged once he becomes transfixed with Judy Barton.However the film's denouement two thirds way of the film feels unsatisfactory and I can see why Hitchcock was not happy about it. The mystery would had been better resolved at the end of the film.",7,1,3,22 March 2014
Gremlins," Gremlins
","Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg bring a Christmas horror comedy with some cute and not so cute critters.Dante toned down the horror and paid homage to old movies such as The Wizard of Oz and the Looney Tunes cartoons.Randall Peltzer an inept inventor and salesman who gets a cute creature called mogwai in Chinatown as a present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan.)There are just three simple rules to owning a mogwai. No bright lights, no water and no feeding after midnight.However there is chaos over Christmas in the small town of Kingston Falls as Billy fails to abide by the rules. Evil Gremlins are spawned who terrorize the people of Kingston Falls.It is an inventive madcap adventure. Despite the frights and shocks, it has a jokey tone that will delight kids and adults alike.The movie reflects Spielberg's interest in small town America in the 1980s which was also featured in films such as Back to the Future, ET and Poltergeist. Dante also makes a critique of the consumerism of the 1980s and its petty minded xenophobia.",9,3,4,24 December 2019
The Monuments Men," Treasures ahoy
","The Monuments Men wants to be a jaunty all star caper in the style of Ocean's 11 but with the serious undertones of this being based on true events.There was a group of Monuments Men who had the task of finding historical and cultural treasures and snatch it away from the Nazis.George Clooney as star, co-writer and director wants to inject a comedic tone as some of his all star cast bicker as they go about their search and adventure. The film is too scattered, some of the characters are vaguely sketched out but just enough to imbue them with some kind of personality.Of course the film comes together as the men discover where the loot is hidden and need to recover it before the Russians but you felt it is too late then for it to all hand together.It might had been Clooney needed to deliver a leaner film.",5,5,6,7 February 2016
Requiem for a Dream," The Hit
","Requiem for a Dream is a grim, intense, choppy, trippy film about drug abuse. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a frumpy retiree who watches television all day, she wants to fit into her red dress as she believes she will appear in her favourite show and is on diet pills to lose weight. The pills are actually amphetamines and they make her hallucinate.Her son Harry (Jared Leto) is a drug addict, he steals from her, he is gaunt from the drugs, his arm ruined by the injections. His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is on a downward spiral, to score, to survive she will have to take part in sex parties, humiliating herself. Their best pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) realise that the their drug addiction has overtaken their lives and they are heading for the bottom of the barrel.Director Darren Aronofsky is fascinated by the use of the camera and sound. He uses split screens, fast cuts, speeded up editing, flashbacks to show the characters wanting their drugs, then the effect of the hit and later the withdrawal.It is an assault on the senses, it is also a provocative film but I felt that the visual tricks were disguising a thin story.",6,1,2,6 November 2016
Captain Phillips," All aboard but no pirates allowed
","Paul Greengrass is a political writer and director with his roots in journalism.This film is based on true facts of the hijacking in 2009 of the MV Maersk Alabama and the book written by Captain Richard Phillips himself which makes the film itself slanted.Captain Phillips himself has commented that the film makes himself out as more of a hero than he really was.Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips who is a company man. His job is to get cargo from one part of the world to another as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is how modern shipping works.He discovers probably because he got too near Somalia that he has attracted the attention of fast boat pirates.Captain Phillips first tries to evade the pirates but when they board his ship he plots to get them off as fast as possible without his crew being harmed.Barkhad Abdi is the leader of the pirates who soon finds when the US navy intervenes that he might have bitten off more than he could chew.The film is intense when the pirates board but it never totally engaged me, especially when it is let down by some silliness such as Phillips when told to sit still by a trigger happy pirate lunges for some pen and paper instead.It is as the screenplay had to be boosted to make it more exciting, which makes you think the real life tale, although terrifying for the crew was not thrilling enough to be made into a film in the first place.An efficient thriller that lacked heart and soul.",6,0,0,9 February 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Hidden agenda
","Cloverfield was a found footage movie of a monster loose in New York city.10 Cloverfield Lane is a sideways sequel. The ending ties up with the events of Cloverfield in a sense that this is the same universe and what is happening elsewhere in the USA might have an impact in the character's motives.However this film has more in common with Room or Misery or The disappearance of Alice Creed.Howard (John Goodman) lives in a bunker and also inside is young handyman Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a young woman who we see hurriedly packing up some things and then driving off in her car that collided with a vehicle driven by Howard.Michelle wakes up on a mattress and chained to a wall. She is confused and frightened. Howard tells her that he saved her life and everyone in the outside world is dead after some kind of attack and the air outside is toxic.However can Howard be trusted? He has arbitrary rules, he appears volatile, he lacks empathy about Michelle's predicament and sometimes acts more like an abuser.The film is really a claustrophobic thriller as Michelle and Emmett detect inconsistencies in Howard's story and look to escape, but what sort of world is out there?An interesting variation of a franchise where they could had just plodded along the found footage alien invasion plot but it will leave sci fi fans unsatisfied, it is not a horror film in the vein of Hostel or Saw and we saw something similar in Room.",5,1,2,10 January 2017
The Finest Hours," Storming ahead
","After films like A Perfect Storm there is an element of seen it all before in The Finest Hours. It is based on a true story in 1952 when just off the coast of New England a severe storm cracked an oil tanker the SS Pendleton into two and the US coast guard headed for a risky rescue mission.The film splits the scenes with the crew of the stricken ship, the rescue mission and the wholesome 1950s setting on the shore with the families at home waiting for better news.Casey Affleck leads the beleaguered engine room crew trying to hold the ship together to improve their chances of rescue after the vessel's officers, radar and radio equipment has been lost when it breaks apart.Coast Guard Chris Pine, just engaged to be married has been ordered to go out to sea with a small craft and a crew of four to rescue the survivors. His fiancée Holliday Grainger nervously waits for him at headquarters and makes the commander irate by wanting the crew to turn around.The CGI enhanced rescue scenes are effective but the film is at times hammy and for large parts dull dripping with sentimentality as seen in the film's opening scenes and the cast mainly give underwhelming and in some ways caricatured performances.",3,3,5,19 November 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Getting to the train on time
","3:10 to Yuma remake wants to be a rip roaring anti western but with a dubious morality.Dan Evans (Christian Bale) a dirt poor farmer being hounded by his wealthy neighbour helps to transport murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to court by putting him on the via the 3:10 train to Yuma. He really can do with the money.Getting Wade to the station is far from easy as his gang now led by Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) are in hot pursuit and will stop at nothing to get Wade back. Meanwhile Wade is working on his captors by playing mind games with a mixture of easy charm and roguish humour. However he and his gang have brutally gunned down people in order to rob them, something that is difficult to forget.The film has a strange way of moralising. The honest to goodness farmer Evans has nothing to show for living a righteous and honourable life. Even his children seem embarrassed by him. Its Wade who comes off as more heroic yet he is a killer.The standout performance is by Ben Foster as Wade's sidekick who really kicks as Prince, hell bent in getting Wade back. Its disappointing to note that Foster's career never took off.There is a nice cameo from Peter Fonda as a grizzled Pinkerton agent. I presume his casting is also a nod to the counterculture elements of this western.The film is well acted and largely enjoyable despite huge plot holes. Fonda's character quickly recovers after being shot in the gut. Wade decides to fall for Evans sob story and go against his loyal gang for some reason. Its this kind of flaws in the screenplay that lets the film down making the film kind of half baked.",5,0,0,25 March 2015
The Equalizer," Even the odds
","The Equalizer television series was an unlikely hit. It featured an old British actor playing a tough guy retired CIA operative who rights wrongs and not afraid to use violence.The film has little relation to the television show apart from the title and the character name who is also an ex CIA operative. Denzel Washington is actually several years older than Edward Woodward when he first played the title role.Antoine Fuqua who directed Denzel to a Best Actor Oscar teams up with him again. The film starts slowly, we see McCall working for a Home Depot type warehouse, helping his fellow workers and spending his evening in a diner reading a book. However the fate of a Russian call girl makes him angry and hell bent on equalizing the score with her gangster pimps. However their overlord sends a dangerous Russian hit-man over to find out who is responsible and when he crosses McCall's path he knows he was the culprit and sets out to get him.The film starts off slowly, maybe too slowly. People forget Denzel is not an action star, he has made several action films in the past and rather a few have disappointed. For every Man on Fire there is a Virtuosity.However when Denzel gets into action its brutal and blood-soaked as he uses the tools he has at hand, rather handy when he works at a hardware warehouse. Martin Csokas plays a fine gangster, lean, smart, suited and brutal. You look forward to his showdown with Denzel which also has shades of Home Alone.It is ultimately an OK film, nothing outstanding, maybe slightly overlong and within a few days easily forgotten.",5,1,4,16 December 2014
Ali," Duck and weave
","In the USA, Mohammed Ali is still a divisive figure, even to people who probably were not even alive when his boxing career was in its decline.To others outside the USA. Ali is universally acknowledged as a hero, someone who transcended his sport to become a well known personality.Michael Mann takes up the challenge to try to tweak out the various facets of Ali and show someone who is not an easy subject to capture but his boxing of course makes the narrative easier.The film ends with the Rumble in the Jungle when Ali beat Foreman.We go through the period when he could not box because of his stance against Vietnam and of course his earlier rise to become champion of world heavyweight boxing. Then his alliance with the Nation of Islam.Mann as expected does not go through a straight biopic. He elicits from Will Smith a great performance that was Oscar nominated. Jamie Foxx as Bundini Brown should had also got recognition and Jon Voight under heavy make up is unrecognisable and he got a best supporting Oscar nomination.Mann took an auteur approach to his subject. Its narrative style was not too popular at the time of its release, mainly because everyone have their own ideas of what a Muhammad Ali should be like.Mann provides enough flourish to let the audience have an insight of this legendary boxer.",8,0,3,8 November 2013
Source Code," Deja Vu
","Director Duncan Jones follows up his film Moon with a time reassigned action thriller Source Code.Taking inspiration from the television series Quantum Leap as well as films such as Narrow Margin, Groundhog Day and 12 Monkeys.The movie opens with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a decorated soldier, Captain Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot whose last mission was in Afghanistan who comes to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He feels disorientated and confused as a pretty passenger opposite called Christina (Michelle Monaghan) acts like she is his girlfriend and refers to him as Sean. When he goes to the bathroom and looks in the mirror he sees another man's face.Colter has no idea of what is going on around him and suddenly after the train takes off after brief stop a bomb goes off killing everyone.Colter finds himself back in some kind of capsule and learns the is taking part in some kind of experimental computer simulation called the source code where he can go back to the last few minutes in that train as he linked to the brainwaves of one of the victims. His mission is to identify the bomber who was on that train as he plans to set off a second larger bomb.The simulation repeats itself and each time he gets to know more about the people on the train and possible suspects.There is something Hitchcock like about this film as Colter finds himself in a position he does not largely understand and something more dangerous elsewhere is going on and people are relying on him to come through. His controllers back at command reluctantly give him small nuggets of information as Colter tries to figure what is happening.The film might not be entirely original but it has enough sci-fi and thriller elements to be entertaining because Gyllenhaal sells it well helped by Monagahan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright.",8,0,0,14 June 2016
Skyfall," Billion dollar Bond
","Having watched every James Bond film on the big silver screen since The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977.It was almost surreal to see Skyfall being made by an Oscar winning director, go on to win Oscars and become one of the top grossing films of all time. The billion dollar Bond.To think back in 1989, Licence to Kill could not compete with the likes of Batman, Indiana Jones or Lethal Weapon 2 in the US box office.Bond is presumed dead after a mission goes wrong in Istanbul as he tries to retrieve a hard drive containing a list of top agents. M is under pressure especially as it seems she is being targeted by an anonymous cyber terrorist who turns out to be a rogue agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who was once M's most effective spy.Skyfall celebrated 50 years of the Bond films in the cinemas. It also takes liberties with the messy timeline of the film series. Daniel Craig's novice spy from Casino Royale is now a disillusioned veteran, at one point told to call it a day.The film re-introduces some familiar characters after being away for a few films, a younger more hi-tech Q and a new Miss Moneypenny. There is also a new M hovering in the background. The film also references earlier Bond movies as part of its golden anniversary celebrations.Although the film contains international locations, breathtaking action, some sumptuous cinematography from Roger Deakins, it flags a bit in the middle when it needed an additional action sequence.What director Sam Mendes does bring is some character moments and making effective use of Judi Dench as she recites some Tennyson.Unusually for a Bond film, this must be the only occasion where the villain actually achieved all of his objectives!",9,2,6,3 February 2017
50 First Dates," Too many dates, too few laughs
","Sandler plays a Marine Biologist who spends his time having brief affairs with women while they on in vacation or so we are told in the opening segment of the film.The film is set in Hawaii, although I am not sure with all the reggae music played throughout the film.We only see Sandler once trying to woo a woman holidaying in the island.The rest of the time, he has been smitten by Drew Barrymore, a lady he has met in a breakfast cafÃ© and has fallen for her.The problem is, she suffers from short term memory loss and each new day she forgets who he is and what happened yesterday.Your heart goes out to her father and steroid enhanced brother who have to repeat information each new day.What looks like an interesting take on a romantic comedy genre just runs out of gas and gets rather dull.Sandler is trying to hit all the sweet spots that his audience now expects. Rob Schneider, check. Some 80s music with a reggae twist this time, check. Some gross out humour, check.However Sandler is not a strong enough actor to carry the more depth required when dealing with the brain trauma issues raised by this film and cannot match Drew Barrymore in the acting stakes.It is not all Sandler's fault, the script is not edgy enough, although it wants to subvert the rom-com genre, it gets too repetitive leaving this viewer slightly bored.Kudos to the film-makers for having an ending that does not go for the easy option.",4,3,6,23 October 2013
Iron Man 3," Lethal Weapons
","Shane Black enters the The Iron Man franchise as co-writer and director and re-teams with Robert Downey Jr after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.Black brings a little hard steel to the sometimes silly Iron Man films as well as bringing a more focused mix of action and humour.Once again as it did in the first film we have a plot involving the military-industrial complex and terrorism which fuels it. We have a sinister, almost Osama Bin Laden type bad guy called The Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley whose later reveal as a druggie, out of work actor is rather inspired allowing Kingsley to put on a different more playful performance.Anyone who has seen previous Marvel films and the other Iron Man films could probably work out from the initial scenes who the ultimate baddie will be and along the way you have mayhem, destruction and Stark doing his own 'McGuyver' thing in the middle.This time Stark narrates the ongoing story and you have to wait for the post credits sequence as to who he is narrating the story to and once again Downey is the anchor who drives the film and has made the Iron Man films a success despite its flaws, although this is better than the last one which is a credit to Black.",6,1,3,30 April 2014
Marie Antoinette," Dunst checks in as the Queen
","I think Sofia Coppola aimed to make a brash fun historical drama such as Amadeus. She lacks the skills of writer Peter Shaffer who wrote Amadeus first as a stage play. She also lacks the audacity of Baz Luhrmann who bought a different visual spin to his modern interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young woman from the powerful Austrian Hapsburg dynasty who through marriage formed alliances with its European neighbours. She married the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and they live in the extravagant Palace of Versailles.Marie is first inexperienced with the ways of the world and the marriage is not consummated for a long time. The reasons because her husband does not engage in having sex with her. Marie is under pressure to produce a heir.Over time, her husband becomes King of France, she does have children and becomes known for grand parties and lavish spending on clothes.When revolutionary fever hits France, the royal family are at risk.The film is gorgeously photographed, has wonderful costumes and exquisite art direction. You can see the money spent on the screen.It has a modern take, such as contemporary music and it does feel like those high school rom coms transplanted to historical France. It is self indulgent with a thin frothy story that goes on for too long because Coppola wants to film sunrises and parties.Dunst is fine but she is not well served by the script but as Marie matures she dolls up her hair, wears lavish clothes and has a collection of shoes. She even takes in a lover. Coppola follows in her father's footsteps with a little bit of nepotism in the casting. Jason Schwartzman is her cousin and he is weak here, maybe because the script has given him little to do.",5,1,1,5 September 2019
Child 44," There is a murder mystery somewhere in here
","There was an interesting story here about a hunt for a grotesque child killer. Too often the main plot goes off the rails and is more to do with an unhinged subordinate with a grudge.Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is orphan turned war hero. Now in the early 1950s he is a high flying secret service officer in Stalin's Soviet Union. A state where murder does not exist in paradise. Murder is a capitalist disease. When they come across a murder it tends to be reclassified as an unfortunate accident.Leo comes across the death of a child near a train line. His father is a fellow friend and comrade. The father believes it was murder but Leo persuades him to forget about it.However deranged underling Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) has nefarious plans for Leo because Leo challenged him when he killed two people for harbouring a fugitive. He also has desires for Leo's wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) who is accused of unpatriotic activities and Leo fails to denounce her.Leo is demoted and exiled to the remote town of Volsk. Leo works under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman) who is at first suspicious of Leo, especially when a child's body is discovered along the rail line. However both reluctantly team up when they discover there have been a spate of similar killings over the years.There are several plot strands that compete for attention and the film never properly gels. In fact it is a dour stodgy mess that neglects the important part of the movie so it can have a go at the nightmare of Stalinism.",3,1,2,22 July 2019
The Ring," Who is on the phone?

To her horror she catches Aidan watching the tape.Rachel tries to make sense of some of the images and decides to investigate further a woman who was a horse breeder that leads to her husband.The Ring is a creepy film with washed out visuals and plot holes that may not always makes sense.

Deepwater Horizon," Spilled venture
","Deepwater Horizon charts the story of one of the worst environmental disasters in history. BP cut corners, did not do proper safety tests that led to death and destruction.Set in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon is an exploration oil rig hired by BP for deepwater drilling.We get to meet the crew. Grizzled veteran Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor, safety conscious and suspicious of the men in suits who he thinks are bean counters and not concerned about safety.Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the electronics technician. The villain of the piece, representing BP management is Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich.)The build up to disaster takes half the movie and frankly the first half is not very gripping. The second part of the movie deals with the disaster. When things go wrong, there is chaos. The oil gushes out, there are explosions, fires are started, water and mud is coming in and people are in jeopardy.Only Malkovich makes an impression with a laconic performance. Wahlberg might well had been invisible. The characters are paper thin and uninteresting.Director Peter Berg comes across as a substandard Michael Bay. This is a technically well made film but it lacks heart. Worse the environmental devastation of the oil spill is glossed over.",5,2,3,3 November 2018
It," The killer klown
","Director Andy Muschietti takes inspiration from another Stephen King adaptation, Stand by Me. He has also added a touch of The Goonies. Set in a small town back in the summer of 1989 where some of the kids run away from bigger bullies but the real malevolent force in Pennywise the sinister clown.The kids discover that disaster strikes every 27 years where children disappear and it is for them to take a stand and stop the clown.The story is built up slowly, we first see a child playing with a paper boat which goes into the drainage system where he encounters Pennywise and disappears. His brother is traumatised. Most of the early scenes are kids at school, being teenagers, getting bullied. A girl has an abusive father, one child is ill or is he? However the tension soon mounts as Pennywise taunts them, his appearance being increasingly horrific.We see a lot of the movie titles that came out in 1989 such as one of the Freddy Krueger sequels. Another is Batman, Pennywise as a hint of Jack Nicholson's psychotic Joker.It has certainly garnered a younger audience with the approach it has taken. My teenage son is not fond of clowns but he was reeled in because we follow these young teenagers and their adventures and trauma.The film does run for too long, it could had easily knocked 20 minutes off the running time and this affects the pacing of the movie. Some of the CGI looks a bit cheap as well.",6,1,1,9 June 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Kick ass Lincoln
","This is what a comedy-action-horror should be like. A preposterous idea mixed with some drama, wit, scares and decent enough CGI. Because of events he saw as a child Lincoln trains to become a vampire hunter with the assistance of Dominic Cooper.He wants to hunt down Rufus Sewell who is the leader of the pack and before long Sewell plans to lead the South against Lincoln who is now President but not before inflicting another personal tragedy on the Lincoln family.At least Benjamin Walker did not have to go through some faux type Daniel Day Lewis authenticity for his version of Lincoln. It was wielding axes, swords and other instruments of vampire death.The action mixes historical fact and fiction with cartoon like action. Its fun although the movie makers might have taken things a tad too seriously in light of the fact that a Spielberg epic on Lincoln was around the corner.",6,1,2,3 April 2014
Finding Neverland," A leap to Neverland
","Finding Neverland is a slight but charming film about the wonders of imagination in the stuffy Edwardian era England.Johnny Depp plays the softly spoken in a Scots accent, J M Barrie who has just come off a failed play.Barrie has a strained marriage but a chance meeting with a recent widow (Kate Winslet) and her four young boys inspires his imaginations and whimsy as he becomes involved in their lives causing further stress in his own marriage.The children inspires the story of Peter Pan as we go to and from reality and fantasy. However adults are always the sore point. Barrie's producer and financier (Dustin Hoffman) thinks little of this strange play with red Indians, fairy lights, an overgrown dog, a ticking crocodile and just thinks he will lose more money. Julie Christie as Winslet's frosty mother is wary of Barrie and think he is a disruptive influence.Marc Forster directs with aplomb and makes good use of visual trickery and gets enchanting and solid performances from his young actors such as Freddie Highmore.However it is a slight story, semi fictionalised and also wastes some of its actors. Dustin Hoffman who appeared in Steven Spielberg's Hook is wasted and just disappears from the film. Once Winslet falls ill you can guess where this is heading and gets a little too sentimental.The film is heightened by a restrained and gentle performance by Depp.",6,0,0,3 January 2016
Lifeboat," Survival
","Lifeboat is another Alfred Hitchcock film made during the war and serves as a propaganda piece to stir up the allies.After their ship is sunk by a German U boat, six people with different backgrounds are stranded together in a lifeboat.Tallulah Bankhead is a photo-journalist who is tough as nails with some airs and graces. Some of the people in the lifeboat are crew members and others are passengers except for one person. Walter Slezak is a German sailor who ends up in the lifeboat who they take in but can he be trusted?The film takes place entirely in the lifeboat and Hitchcock still manages to make his trademark cameo. The story turns as the other survivors rely on the German for navigation and even rowing the lifeboat whilst they bicker or play cards unsure where they are heading.Bankhead is the anchor for this film, she is really terrific. Hume Cronyn as the kind hearted sailor provides good support and Slezak keeps you guessing as to whether he is an aid or a hindrance for quiet a while.",8,1,1,7 April 2014
John Wick," Hit-man and his dog
","John Wick is an action film with video game type shooting scenes but a somewhat barmy plotting. Keanu Reeves makes it watchable despite the script.John Wick is newly widowed and his late wife gifted him a puppy which has been killed by the wayward son of a Russian mobster who has also stolen his car. However it is soon revealed that Wick is an ace hit-man and now he is back to get revenge and get his car back.This means various shooting and fight scenes. Wick is the man who the mob would call to kill the boogeyman. Yet we have scenes where minnows are easily dispensed with but the alpha male somehow survives.There is a female hit-woman out to get Wick and somehow he leaves her alone to cause further mischief. The Russian Mobster whose son Wick wants to kill is also let go by him when you would have thought it would had been better to shoot him fast.It is entertaining schlock, the plot is full of holes. Reeves acting is not stretched, he is required to be mean and moody, say a few words and do a lot of shooting.",5,2,7,18 April 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Striking
","Kung Fu Panda is Po (Jack Black), a bear who does not have the right girth for the martial arts. He works in his father's noodle restaurant but dreams of joining the Furious Five, China's famous kung fu fighters which also represent a style of martial arts. Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper and Crane.A prophecy reveals that Po is to be the new Dragon Master to the surprise of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However Po does not take to the tough training regime well which is designed to make him fail, the Furious Five mock him and Shifu realises that food motivates Po.When a vengeful Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes prison and goes after Shifu, it is left to the Kung Fu Panda to save the day.The film is enjoyable family fun, the overweight panda provides comedy as he struggles to learn kung fu, there are plenty of wise Chinese proverbs, colourful animation, frenetic action scenes and a reworked version of Everybody is Kung Fu fighting.",7,1,1,5 April 2017
Rocketman," The circle of life
","Following hot on the heels of Bohemian Rhapsody. Comparisons are inevitable especially as Dexter Fletcher, the director of Rocketman was brought in to finish Bo Rap. Both films also feature the character of John Reid as business manager for both Queen and Elton John.The film is framed with a rock bottom Elton John (Taron Egerton) wearing a heavy costume going into rehab for his various addictions and talking about all the issues in his life.Reg Dwight was a child prodigy on the piano. His life changed when he met Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and Elton put music to Bernie's lyrics.In the 1970s came big success and battle with his demons. From 1975 Elton admits to being a twonk to his friends and family as he got addicted to booze and drugs. A year later his homosexuality became public.The framing device works well. Elton felt a lack of love from his parents especially from his distant father. When Elton found success, he found his business manager and lover John Reid more interested in Elton's career than providing him with love and affection.The songs weave around the film and sung by the cast. It seems the writer Lee Hall took the songs and built the structure of the film around the lyrics, you could easily guess what the final song was going to be.Like Bo Rhap it is not chronologically accurate. Elton John married Renate in 1984 when the film reaches its natural end in 1983.I did feel Rocketman was lightweight even when it goes into Elton's darkest aspects of his life, it just seemed too tinged with sweetness. A surprise because Elton John has never shied away from talking about his dark days so it could never had been a contractual thing.Egerton does well as Elton but it is a performance that never blew me away. Bryce Dallas Howard surprised me with her English accent as Elton's mother.Like a lot of other recent films based on true events. The film wants to blow its own trumpet by showing how much detailed they have gone to recreate the sets and costumes. Then you realise what was the point? Part of the story has been fictionalized for narrative purposes. I liked it much more with some nice humorous bits such as when John Reid strokes Elton's receding hair and some of it falls off on his hands.I saw Elton John in concert some years ago. His core band have been with him for decades, half are from Britain and the other half are from the USA. I would liked to have seen how they reacted to Elton John when he was loaded on drugs, did they try to wean him off or just joined him. The film does not tell you.",6,2,4,9 August 2019
A Star Is Born," Another star is born
","This is the fourth version of A Star is Born. It is an adult orientated blue collar musical drama.Lady Gaga plays Ally, a waitress who sings part time in a drag bar. She writes her own songs but realises she will never get that big break because of her looks, especially a prominent nose.One night country rocker Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) walks in looking for a drink after a concert. Maine is still famous touring with his past hits.Maine is enchanted by Ally. He invites her to see him in concert where he asks her to sing one of her songs with him onstage that goes viral. They have a whirlwind romance which perks up Maine's life.For Ally, the future is bright as she is pursued by record executives. For Maine, it is a life of booze, drugs and tinnitus.As Ally achieves success, Maine's life spirals downwards. It is a question of whether Maine is hindering Ally's success with the drugs and booze.Cooper stars, directs, produces, sings and co-wrote the screenplay. For him it is a labour of love. What caught my attention was that it was a working class drama. The film does not show the glamorous side of LA. It is a blue collar look of Ally's life and family.Even Maine lives a humdrum life. Probably why he need drugs and booze to keep him going.The romance might had been a bit too quick but it needed to be make the film tick. It is overlong and some of the songs are not that memorable. Lady Gaga gives a good performance but she is not stretched by playing a singer. Although it is interesting to see her face without her normal heavy makeup. It is also brave for her to show some nudity even a glimpse of going full frontal.The film is muddled regarding Maine's backstory, his relationship with his much older brother and some of the dialogue was muffled. However I found the first half better when the focus is on Maine rather than the more pop oriented second half when it shifts to Ally.",6,12,31,1 October 2018
Gravity," Free Falling
","Visually, Gravity is a breathtaking film. Watching it in 3D on the big screen in the cinema, it is stunning.Alfonso Cuaron and his cinematographer have to be commended for the visuals along with the special effects team. You actually think how this would be replicated on the small screen, where the visuals would not be done justice and you are then left with the story.The story is of course two astronauts floating in space after an accident and they need to make it to the next space station.Without any jet pack fuel they literally are falling towards earth. You just cannot beat gravity!The actors do well in recreating the space environment. However they are pretty much dodging debris, trying to get from A to B and at one point pushing random buttons.To flesh out Bullock's character who is a space novice the writers relied on old tropes to get the audience on her side for her emotional and physical journey.Some people have questioned the physics behind the music heard and real astronauts have claimed that some of it is unrealistic.This will not matter much to the general audience. However for one point of the film, even people without much insight of space travel would know there is an acclimatisation period if a ship lands back on Earth.",7,0,2,8 January 2014
Lone Survivor," Afghan Attack
","Peter Berg seems to be trying to hard to imitate Michael Bay. Whereas Battleship was effectively a Bay version of a film based on a toy, here we see the same type of bombastic and patriotic tones that Bay likes to indulge in.Based on true events, Lone Survivor follows Marks Wahlberg and his Navy SEAL team try to hunt down a Taliban Leader. However they encounter some goat herders and decide whether to kill them or not. However these scene itself causes discomfort as the herders are civilians and therefore killing them is in breach of the Geneva convention, yet the film wants to enter a debate on war ethics. These are professional soldiers, surely this was mentioned in their training? Hold on it was mentioned in the mission briefing a few minutes earlier!As they have to abort the mission the SEALs encounter the Taliban forces and get involved in a brutal and visceral gunfight in the wild Afghan terrain which suspiciously looks like somewhere in America.Mark Walhberg, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch give strong performances but the film although starts off slowly then becomes scenes of constant blood-soaked fighting and running or more accurately falling down the mountain from the Taliban.There is an element of war porn in this film with the prolonged battle scenes as the SEALs are repeatedly getting shot. It starts as soldiers goofing around but once the action begins there is an emphasis of a band of brothers but there is something hollow about this film even with the latter storyline of getting help from Pushtun villagers does not overcome.",5,7,16,4 May 2014
Wind River," Wind River
",Wind River is a cold thriller set in and around a Native Indian reservation. The snowy and the cold temperatures is essentially the protagonist in this movie.Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter in the mountains of Wyoming who has discovered a dead body of a teenage tribal girl.Rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate the case. However the medical examiner cannot label the case as a homicide. It was the subzero temperatures that killed her.Lambert helps out Banner's investigations. He knows the landscape and the people. The dead girl was a friend of his own daughter who also died in suspicious circumstances several years earlier.There is an underlying gloom to this movie. Everyone feels lost or displaced even Banner who arrives without the right clothes for the environment she is in. The reservation police chief (Graham Greene) adds some droll humour. The film has a message about Native Indian women who end up missing each year. However it ends as a moody visceral violent revenge film.,6,0,0,7 March 2020
The Death of Stalin," A communist plot
","You might think The Death of Stalin was a parody or a black comedy or a farce. We know that the actors are playing actual people some of whom lived until the late 1980s. The weird thing is the actual events depicted in the movie happened in some form.In real life, when Stalin was lying on the floor in his soiled pajamas after he suffered a stroke. They needed to call a meeting to decide whether to call a doctor. Stalin's personal physician was unavailable as he was being tortured at the time for suggesting Stalin needed more bed rest.Armando Iannucci mines comedy gold in an absurd, surreal, darkly violent tale of who wants to be the next leader of the Soviet Union. It is not a historical tale, it is a story of what can happen in any society where dogma and the bullet become the main currencies.",8,0,1,25 February 2018
Star Trek," To boldly go
","JJ Abrams and his creative team with added lens flare have rebooted the Star Trek films and gone off to another timeline.This preserves the stories of the earlier Star Trek adventures and its sequel shows but allows Abrams to concentrate on new stories a younger crew of the Enterprise. That was the plan with Star Trek. Unfortunately it all went awry immediately with the sequels.However here we see the adventures of the younger James T Kirk, a rather wayward young man encountering Spock, Sulu, Scott and Bones as well as other crew members.The writers have created conflict between Kirk and Spock as the Vulcan is unhappy with Kirk's breach of ethics and later after Spock's planet his destroyed, Kirk's inability to follow orders as Spock kicks him off the Enterprise which leads Kirk to meet the older, alternative Spock.The plot is a renegade Romulan attacking Federation ships, who might be from another time and his anger is focussed on Spock. It is an action oriented film, with fun and humour.The best acting performance is from Karl Urban who just oozes the spirit of Doctor McCoy, very few thought that Urban had it in him to deliver such a marvellous performance.",8,2,5,30 March 2018
Fury," Tanked up
","Fury is certainly an infuriating film. I think the makers had high hopes that this would be a serious Oscar contender but clichéd characters, ethically suspect scenes and laughable battle sequences very much kibosh it.Brad Pitt plays a battle hardened tank commander. Logan Lerman is the newbie innocent. However Lerman soon learns to kill as the rest of the weary crew are willing to kill injured German soldiers or soldiers that have surrendered because you know war is hell and all that.When the soldiers arrive at a village, you fear for the local women from the American soldiers as rape is very much on the agenda. Now I am aware that atrocities were committed by Allied troops as well in World War 2, but 70 years later does the director seriously think I will be cheering for this motley crew!Director David Ayer as in his previous film, End of Watch wants to bring a video game style in his battle sequences. Tracer fire is made to look like laser fire giving it a Star Wars style sheen. However when the battle tank is disabled and the crew is at the mercy of the SS battalion, they hold out heroically as the Germans walk right in front of the fire and dies instead of thinking it would be better to spread to the sides and attack the tank from behind.The film comes across as an exploitative cartoon type action film that Sylvester Stallone would had made in his heyday.",3,3,7,18 February 2015
Train to Busan," Train to Busan
","Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies.",7,0,2,28 April 2019
Darkest Hour," Winston the legend than the more layered man
","Growing up in the 1980s with a right wing Thatcher government in Britain who seemed to eulogize Winston Churchill at every occasion even if she had barely known the man. I ended up not being over enthused by the man even if he was the right person to be a war leader in world war 2, no doubt helped by copious amounts of alcohol.Churchill was a man with a dim view of people darker than him. He was happy to use chemical weapons against Iraqis and was desperate to use them against Indians. In 1943 almost 3 million Indians, subjects of the British empire died in the Bengal famine, because food was diverted from the starving Indians and gone to the west. Despite taking their food he blamed the deaths on the Indians themselves for breeding like rabbits.Darkest Hour does mention the ill fated Gallipoli campaign where blame was laid on Churchill's door. However the film recreates the legend than a more complex portrait.The film covers the first few weeks from May 1940 as the Nazis are invading Europe with Britain standing on the brink of invasion. Chamberlain was forced to resign, Churchill becomes Prime Minister but the Tory Party grandees are at odds with him and even the monarch is reluctant to back him. Some Tories want Churchill to have peace talks with Hitler, cut a deal but he is having none of it.Gary Oldman gives a fruity performance but really he is a long line of actors who have played Churchill. There is nothing here that Albert Finney or Robert Hardy has done better.The film really could had been dynamic but just becomes bland and plodding as it becomes a battle between the politicians plotting against him. There is that underground scene where Churchill consults with the people, it must have been the longest ride on the Westminster tube line.",5,0,5,20 January 2018
The Rookie," The rookie throw of the ball
","A rather likable and old fashioned tale. It is a film in two halves where you first see Dennis Quaid as a High school baseball coach who is persuaded to try out as a professional pitcher late in life.The second half of the film is his search to be the oldest Rookie in the major league. Armed with a demon pitch, he can thrown the ball at over 90 miles per hour, he is taken seriously from the off.The film defies expectations, there are no villains, not much of the old timer jokes, very little in the way of chicanery.A rare film where everybody is nice to each other and a genuine lack of cynicism, especially as it is based on a true story.",6,1,1,1 August 2013
Underworld," The doors
",A comic book Gothic horror adventure film with a sort of a female version of Blade clad in leather. Plenty to enjoy apart from a derivative and wafer thin story.Vampires and Lycans (Werewolves) have been at war for centuries. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a vampire death dealer hunts Lycans and is attracted to a human called Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who the other Lycans are looking for. It seems he is a descendant of the head of the werewolf family and the Lycans want to use Micheal to create a vampire- werewolf hybrid.This is a shallow stylish film but entertaining with enough action and at least a backstory which gives it some interest. Some hammy acting from the vampires who do not have a decent script to get their teeth into.,6,2,6,19 June 2017
Kickboxer," Kick action
","Kickboxer is a bigger budget action vehicle for JCVD which features location shooting in Thailand with popular tourist sites of Bangkok visible.The tale is a mixture of Rocky and The Karate Kid. Van Damme plays Belgian born Kurt Sloane whose US raised brother Eric gets brutally beaten and crippled after fighting the undefeated Thai kick-boxing champion Tong Po.Kurt Sloane wants revenge and fight Po and is introduced to Xian who agrees to train Kurt so that he can be good enough to fight Po. Over time his tough training regimes leads to improvements but Po's backers are not going to take things lying down.The better budget is there on screen, there is a lot of sly humour in the training scenes which reflect a lot of The Karate Kid movies and as the film progresses the Muscles from Brussels shows his trademark moves.The film takes time to get going after the initial kick-boxing fight, there is an obligatory love plot and although not as thrilling as some of Van Damme's films of the early part of the 1990's this is a good showcase of his talents.",5,1,1,5 June 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Leading to the Jedi
","Rogue One takes place prior to Star Wars: A New Hope and it finishes with events leading up to the first film. It is a stand alone film that focuses on the rebel alliance before Luke Skywalker joins them.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) the man who has been forced to complete the Empire's Death Star, the planet destroyer but he has also designed a weakness, an Achilles heel.The Rebel Alliance sends Jyn and a team led by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) to steal the designs for the Death Star so they can exploit its weakness and destroy it.After 2015's The Force Awakens it was a risk to go back to a time before The New Hope given how underwhelming the prequels are regarded.At an entertaining level the film works, it is well paced, lots of action, plenty of humour especially from a robotic character, a personal journey for Jyn and plenty of appearances to keep Star Wars fans happy including some stirring bits of John Williams original themes. However it is cynically placed there to keep fans happy and bask in some nostalgia, a blink and you miss them CP30 and R2D2. The biggest surprise is a Grand Moff being digitally resurrected and Darth Vader definitely showing his dark side when he goes all out with his lightsaber.On a production level there are some good grimy bits, the rebel alliance have that industrial rust that such a scavenging group would have, clothes being old and ripped for a start.There is some interesting use of location photography, desert photography in Jordan, shooting in Iceland and also some shooting in the Maldives which certainly is different as it is so seldomly used for movies.Yet the movie is no more than disposable entertainment, maybe that is how it should be. The film has too many characters, some paper thin characterisation and plenty of plot conveniences straight out of the Steven Spielberg book of action movies.",6,7,12,20 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Not quiet Marvellous
","I have said it before and I will say it again. The Marvel Cinematic Universe are on a higher plane compared to other superhero franchises. They can knock it out of the park, shot after shot.I went to this movie knowing almost nothing about Captain Marvel apart from there was originally another DC character with the same name who became Shazam.The film takes a little while to get going as it wants to set up the character of Vers/Carol Danvers (Brie Larson.) Vers is a warrior recruited by the Kree. They are fighting the evil Skrulls who take over planets by infiltrating them. They are shapeshifters led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn.)After trying to get away from the Skrulls, Vers ends up in LA of 1995 where she meets a young two eyed Shield operative Nick Fury accompanied with Agent Coulson who is new to Shield.Vers though has some memories of being on earth but her memories are filled with fuzzy. Vers thinks she might had been an ace test pilot on Earth. The key is Dr Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who might provide more information.However it is a race against time as Skrulls are also looking for Dr Lawson and something she created.Once a de-aged Nick Fury turns up, the film hits gear. It also has a few twists in the story and the humour emerges. Marvel films always do well when they add some fun.It does stick too close to the Marvel formula, the directors Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck never put their own stamp in Captain Marvel. The hand of producer Kevin Feige is all over it.",6,14,24,13 March 2019
The Fan," Not the Natural
","I sometimes wonder if Tony Scott did not have actors such as Denzel Washington to elevate his films how quickly his filmography would be forgotten. No doubt that this director who honed his skills in the Ad World brought over a style of filmmaking that has been copied by others. The fast cuts with many shots lasting just a few seconds, the particular style of lighting, use of music which has all influenced directors like Michael Bay.However his greatest skill is to make a watchable film with something that does not even resemble a finished script. Here is a tale of a highly prized baseball player who hits a slump and a baseball fan whose life is in turmoil as he loses his job and contact with his son.De Niro plays the fan who increasingly becomes unhinged and decides to take it out on Snipe's baseball player when he admits he plays for himself and not the team.The film is slow to get going, the script is half baked and we know that De Niro has anger management issues and its only a matter of time that he will snap and Snipes will become a victim.But for the acting from De Niro, Snipes, Barkin and Leguizamo this film would be dud rather than just average.",5,1,2,3 February 2015
Shakespeare in Love," The muse
","William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is suffering from writer's block and needs a muse to inspire him.Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a young woman from a wealthy family who loves the theatre and disguises as a man and gets a part but runs away.Will meets Viola and gets inspired by her and pursues her but Viola is arranged to marry Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) a man of nobility who is very jealous.Will despite being married wins Viola's heart and writes Romeo and Juliet but as the play is performed, it might lead to a tragedy especially as Viola is earlier exposed as a female who at the time were banned from performing.The film is uplifted by its cast who are uniformly good even Ben Affleck. Its surprising to think that the film was for some years had been stuck in development hell. Some years earlier it was marked out to be a Kenneth Branagh/Juliet Roberts project. The film was obviously reworked successfully and Paltrow's performance elevates it.The film moves along with elan and enthusiasm and never feels stodgy for an Elizabethan period piece.",7,0,0,8 August 2014
This Is the End," Party at Franco's
","Well this is off beat. It looks like the boys were inspired by the film Zombieland when Bill Murray turned up in his mansion as Bill Murray.Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Emily Watson and even Rihanna appear as themselves.They attend a party at Franco's new house where Michael Cera makes a fool of himself and before you know it there is an apocalyptic catastrophe as the earth opens up and swallows up most of the guests.The surviving celebrities try to make do with the available rations of food and water, deal with the erratic and selfish Danny McBride. They then have to turn exorcist on Jonah Hill and figure out that if they are better people. Then there might be redemption.It is very easy to watch this film and sneer as a few of them have made patchy films in the past.I did find myself chuckling a few times. It's light and breezy, some of it is rather clever.It was a good move to see the film initially from Baruchel's viewpoint as he is the one who is less famous of the lot.",6,3,8,10 January 2014
Two for the Money," Sports by the book
","Al Pacino continues his run of starring alongside a younger rising star. In Two for the Money he plays Walter Abrams, domineering, highly strung sports book adviser and former gambling addict with a dodgy heart.Matthew McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, a former American Footballer whose out of the game permanently due to a knee injury but has an instinctive ability to call the game and game-plays.Abrams takes Lang under his wing as his protégé, grooming him, shaping him, changing his clothes, style and even his name as Lang picks winners and attracts big time gamblers who bet more on more each week.The film itself is standard text of a sports drama film with first you see the coaching of the young star, then his swift rise to the top and then the catalyst that leads to a decline before the film heads for a finish.In this case Abrams refuses to share the wealth with Lang who is now attracting high rollers and Lang hits self destruct and starts to pick losers affecting the company and his clients who are losing big time. Of course from very early on from Pacino's full on performance as larger than life Abrams, this is a person you can never keep up with and he is in fact warned early on by Abrams's wife played by Rene Russo.Of course the biggest problem from the outset is that we see Pacino play these characters before and you see a trail already as where this film is going. Also we have to swallow just because a person has played the game, understands the game he can call the game. In that case, surely other footballers could do the same? Sports is based on many factors such as mistakes, slips, bad calls and incidents rather than pure skill from the other side, it what makes the game exciting and difficult to predict.So what starts as mildly interesting is as predictable as a tame roller coaster ride. Nothing too exciting but both leads have charm enough to keep you watching.",4,2,2,27 April 2014
World War Z," Rampage of the undead
","A zombie film that entered production hell, very much like a zombie. The film had to be revived with re shoots and a different ending.The result is a modest success even though the film is not without flaws.Pitt with his long ironed hair which must surely be contender for best supporting actor Oscar (the hair that is, not Pitt) plays a former UN troubleshooter who left to raise his kids in New York city.Suddenly an outbreak occurs where people bite each other and soon become zombified with blood-lust.In order to protect his family Pitt with a virologist goes to Korea to locate the outbreak of the source and a possible answer. Well the virologist takes a nasty fall and Pitt ends up in Israel and later Wales where he might have discovered a chink in this worldwide pandemic.World War Z is an adaptation of a popular book but liberties were taken with the adaptation, especially the ending as the original cut of the film was deemed to be too grim.The film has great scenes of panic with zombies on the loose, zombies attacking as a team as in Israel but some of the lines and scenes make you wince with its cheesiness and lapses in logic.This does not mean its terrifically entertaining. The film starts off the blocks with a bang, there are some visceral scenes depending which cut of the film you have seen and it does rack up the tension.It is rather refreshing to see a film being so successful when it had such public post production issues.",6,0,2,3 November 2013

","Passengers has great special effects, production design but the interesting and intriguing premise of the plot is squandered.Set in the future, an intergalactic spacecraft is taking a 120 year voyage to another planet to be colonised by five thousand volunteers who are in hibernation.Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) a mechanical engineer is woken up and thinks the ship has got near the planet. What he finds instead that he is alone and no one else is awake. He cannot get back to his pod and go back to hibernation. He has the ship at his disposal but as he was not a premium passenger he cannot get the premium services such as a better breakfast. His only companion is the android bartender on duty.After a year, his biological needs gets the better of him and when he sees a beautiful woman in a pod he deliberately wakes her up. She is Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) a journalist and Preston tells her that like him she has woken up due to a malfunction.Of course he has committed an immoral act by waking her up and she will not be able to get back to hibernation. Aurora will die in this ship before the journey ends.Pretty soon both of them fall in love, well there is no one else in the ship besides the android bartender and the robo-vacuum cleaners. The film takes a turn when Aurora finds out the truth and it simply becomes a domestic drama of two people with irreconcilable differences.The last act of the film concerns the pair investigating the increased glitches in the ship, what is causing it and how to fix it. The film is a mash up of different genres and it loses its way a bit.It also has a strange vision of corporate space colonisation. While Preston is an economy class passenger Aurora is a premium class one. She has a better breakfast when she is awoken but there is no reason for it when the passengers are going to be in long term hibernation apart from the last few months of the journey. When Preston tries to send a distress message back to earth, the message will take years to get back to earth and he is charged a fortune for it. Who will collect the money and how?",5,3,6,2 March 2017
The Hunger Games," One for the arrow
","An adaptation of a book that is popular with teenagers and my daughter pestering me to take her to the cinema to watch the movie. Its Twilight all over again I thought.However The Hunger Games features youngsters in a dystopian future where in the name of peace an annual event is held where selected kids between the ages of 12 to 18 years of age have to fight to the death until the last one standing is declared the victor.Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss who takes the place of her younger sister. Woody Harrelson is the former winner from her sector who teaches her and the male participant from the same sector, Peeta. Harrelson seems not to care and is a drunk but as the film goes on shows perceptive insights as he lobbies on behalf of both the participants as well as training them on how to survive.The film is a mish mash of various themed films such as Battle Royale, Rollerball, The Running Man, Westworld, The Truman Show.Its entertaining but in a daft way. The young actors give it their all, Lawrence shows why she is one of the best young actors out there. However what kind of society which televises this tribute called The Hunger Games thinks its fair that a 12 year old can go up against a 18 year old? Never mind that the viewing public has such a blood lust to watch televised murder on screen when its clear during the selection process that the public are not happy that their children could be selected to participate in the games.The film is also overlong, it is sanitized enough to keep its teen audience happy without the violence being too visceral. Its surprisingly enjoyable but adults are likely to be more discerning than a younger audience.",6,0,2,21 June 2014
Zootopia," Pride and diversity
","Zootopia or Zootropolis is a thoughtful film about discrimination. A society where animals are divided between predators and prey with suspicion running rampant that certain animals might turn against them.In Zootopia a vast metropolis the animals live and work side by side whether prey or predator and this is the world where country bunny Judy Hopps is determined to make it in the police force as the first rabbit recruit and bustle with larger animals on the force like bulls and elephants.When she stakes her career in a missing persons case she needs the help of wily fox and hustler Nick Wilde.The trouble is rabbits have an uneasy relationship with the predatory foxes. Hopps was given fox repellent spray by her parents before she left for Zootopia.This is a bright, enjoyable colourful film with a message that you cannot judge a book by its cover. The mystery works rather well and some really nice humour undercutting the film with memorable characters such as Flash the sloth and Mr Big the underworld crime boss.The kids will lap up the detailed but breezy animation and humour, the adults will get the message even if that message might be a bit hazy if you start to think about it.",8,0,3,3 August 2016
The Impossible," The savage force
","I was in the Far East a few months after the 2004 Tsunami. I stayed in an island that was relatively only mildly touched by the disaster. The locals would not go to the beach and it was largely deserted.The Impossible is based on true events. The family concerned were actually Spanish.Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three young children are holidaying in Khao Lak, Thailand for Christmas. Suddenly the hotel is hit by a Tsunami. The family are seperated. Maria and eldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) are on their own. Maria is badly injured but they need to get to safety and they do not know what happened to the rest of the family.The film spends no time in scene setting. The disaster happens straight away and it is well staged. The movie is split into two. You really do wonder what happened to Henry and the other two children as the focus is on Maria and Henry.Only later do we see Henry and the other children survive as he tries to search for Maria and Lucas. By this time she is desperately ill in hospital.The film has a harrowing performance from Watts. Holland rises to the challenge as a boy who tries to make himself useful in reuniting other families. His performance reminded me of the young Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun.If there is a criticism. It actually pulls back on the chaotic destruction and panic that existed in the region at the time. Villages and local families were destroyed. Many people were split up. The feel good factor just felt a little jarring and also appropriate.",6,0,1,26 January 2019
42," Home Run
","Jackie Robinson is the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball player who became the first black man to play in the then all white major league.Robinson who was regarded as a hot-head is played by Chadwick Boseman, who over time has to control his emotions as he encounters deliberate provocation and casual racism from those around him.This is not a bio-pic of Robinson but his rise to the big leagues from the black leagues and the struggle he went through.Of course this film follows a line of sports film that goes back the last 15 years that deals with the struggles of black or mixed sports team whether its football, basketball or baseball.It might look odd now, almost 60 years later that a black baseball player being booed by his own supporters and disliked by many of his team mates solely because of his colour and not his abilities.I heard about this project some years ago when Robert Redford was lined up to play Branch Rickey, a part now played by Harrison Ford in this film.At least Ford is less grouchy in this film than some of his other recent roles and we get some understanding why he went out on a limb to have a black player in his team.There is able support from other actors although only Lucas Black, Alan Tudyk and Nicole Beharie stand out.The film is a nice, well made drama. It keeps you entertained but looks and feels rather old fashioned. You feel even with the racism shown, it is pulling its punches.",7,0,1,29 January 2014
Stripes," Carry on Seargeant
","Stripes is that naughty, irreverent slob comedy which laid down the template for movies like Police Academy.Set in the early 1980s, John (Bill Murray) is a slobbish, slacker cab driver who gets fired for taking an old lady on a hair raising spin to the airport. He also gets dumped by his girlfriend. Russell (Harold Ramis) is unmotivated as an English teacher to new immigrants.Somehow John persuades Russell that life would be better if they joined the army although Murray with his receding hairline looks too old to be a new recruit.During basic training they meet the larger than life Ox (John Candy) dim Cruiser (John Diehl) and trying to get them into shape is stern Sgt Hulka (Warren Oates.)The platoon leader is incompetent Capt Stillman (John Larroquette) who spends more time as a Peeping Tom.John riles Sgt Hulka very early on and his recruits look very unlikely to pass basic training especially when Hulka is involved in an incident when Stillman ends up injuring him.Despite their incompetence John and Russell manage to charge two female Military Police officers Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young).Murray and Ramis underplay their characters and you see underneath the genesis of characters that they would go on to play in Ghostbusters.The big problem with the film is the script is too scattered and despite the abundance of t & a it is not funny enough. Animal House had some amusing set pieces and an underlying satire about Frat Houses and its linked with social status.Stripes see Murray making not very clever or funny quips which sets him at odds with Sgt Hulka and gets his squad into bother. If I had to do a 10 miles run instead of a 5 miles one on my first day in the army, I would had given Murray a good kicking and the rest of the troops will had joined me.The third act where they squad goes to Europe to test a new vehicle which John and Russell borrow to go off with their girlfriends is even more silly but just tagged on so they can be accidental heroes and Stillman can get his comeuppance.Of course looking back at it this was just an updated version of the first ever Carry On film made in Britain in the 1950s.",4,1,3,1 February 2016
Green Room," Oregon comfort
","Nothing is going right for The Ain't Rights. Down on their luck, short of cash they get an unexpected booking in the backwoods of Portland.The money is good but the audience are a bunch of neo-nazis. However after the gig, one of them goes to retrieve a phone and comes across a dead body.Now the band is locked into a room and the club's owner wants to make sure no witnesses will escape to talk to the cops.It is a Star Trek cast. Pat (Anton Yelchin) is one of the members of the band who needs to be resourceful. Darcy (Patrick Stewart) is the vile club owner who wants to make the deaths of the band to look plausible.The band members face killer dogs who take orders in German, knives, guns and quickly learn to fight back. Show the fascists that these snowflakes do not easily melt.It is a ludicrous, low budget violent film. Shades of cabin horror as the band fight for survival. Some of the skinheads are none too bright.Violent, bloody and entertaining when it kicks in gear.",5,2,3,6 February 2019
The Notebook," Then and now
","The Notebook is set in two time frames. There is the present day setting in a nursing home where James Garner is telling a romance story to Gena Rowlands who is a dementia patient.The story he tells from a notebook is about a young country boy (Ryan Gosling) having a romance with a socialite played by Rachel McAdams. The social divide keeps them apart before World War 2 intervenes.The past and present then mesh as we realise the fate of the characters. It is well acted, well have you ever seen James Garner give a duff performance?For Ryan Gosling who may be one of the most edgiest actors in Hollywood at the moment, he plays probably his most normal character yet.The initial flashbacks are a bit corny but once it gets going it has a charm of its own.",6,1,2,27 September 2013
The Other Boleyn Girl," The Tudor thing
","The Other Boleyn Girl is an adaptation of a historical fiction novel by Philippa Gregory. It was previously made as a BBC mini series and several years later BBC films co-produced the condensed film version.Looking at it now its an all star cast with Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne is small but important roles, Andrew Garfield credited although its blink and you miss him and Oscar winner Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson plays her younger sister Mary Boleyn.The film is not meant to be historically accurate given that the source material is a fictional historical. In that sense it ties Henry VIII need to father a male heir with the Boleyn Family trying to engineer their rise in social status, riches and political power by using the Boleyn girls hooked up with Henry.The film also deals with rivalry as Mary first becomes Henry's mistress and gives birth to an illegitimate son and then Anne pledges herself to Henry but only if he first divorces his wife and also send Mary and her child away.Of course as Anne could not give birth to a son causes friction and for her Henry's wrath which results in the two sisters bonding again as the Boleyn family are put to peril.They say life in olden times was short, nasty and brutish. It seems to be no different even if you are in the inner circle of the Royal family particularly the Tudor court. This is a quick romp through a period in Henry VIII's life with enough intrigue, plotting that is doomed to failure.The film is carried by its actresses both Porter and Johansson are very good and Kristin Scott Thomas as the mother is excellent as the one who realises that her daughters are at risk from this foolhardy plan.",7,0,0,25 January 2015
Bloody Sunday," The Troubles
","Paul Greengrass has made a provocative drama documentary of the events in Derry in January 1972 which is to this day still an open wound.The film with its numerous quick edits covers events over 24 hours from Saturday evening with its main character Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt), a Protestant MP for the Social Democratic Labour Party and leading a peaceful anti-internment march which developed into the Bloody Sunday massacre on 30 January 1972.Most of the 10,000 marchers that day would be Catholics, some with IRA links. Cooper wanted to develop a pan religion civil rights movement to counteract the violent nationalist and loyalist groups.Intercut with Cooper organising the march are the British troops setting up roadblocks and barricades to prevent the march going much further due to newly introduced restrictions on marches.When some rebellious youth start to to throw bricks at the troops they are met with a disproportionate response as the army shoot at some of the protesters which lead to thirteen people being left for dead.The events ended up being a prime propaganda tool for the IRA. It turned many of the Irish against the presence of the mainland troops and set back the civil rights movement and any hope of a peaceful resolution to the Troubles.Greengrass's documentary approach does not leave much for characterisation. Apart from Cooper, many of the people are painted in broad strokes with Tim Piggott-Smith's Major Ford being the main hissable villain.Greengrass also does well to recreate the early 1970s setting and look. The editing might be jarring but the art direction, costumes and make up are well realised.",6,2,2,21 June 2017
Us," Funny Games
","Us is a puzzling film that slowly reveals its layers but then becomes more illogical and confusing.It is better to not think about too deeply and just enjoy the ride. It means you lose any subtext the filmmaker had about a society of us and the others.The film opens at the funfair in the boardwalk of Santa Cruz in 1986. A small girl, Adelaide is on holiday and wanders off while her father is playing whack-a-mole. As she enters a funhouse she sees a doppelgänger of herself in the hall of mirrors. This encounter left her unable to communicate for some time and still affects her in the present day.We then cut to the present day when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason.One evening the Wilsons see another family that looks exactly like them standing outside the house decked out in red overalls. They look like they mean to harm them and they are somehow tethered to the soul of the individual Wilson family members.The doppelgängers all grunt except for Red, Adelaide's double who speaks with a raspy voice. Red tells Adelaide that both of them are tethered together and share a soul. These doubles live in a subterranean underground world.As an home invasion horror it is very effective and chilling, we find out that other families are being slaughtered by their doubles. It leads to a problem. Why are the Wilsons being toyed with when other families are being brutally killed and the violence is spreading as the doubles attempt to enact their own Hands across America.The moment the film broadens its premise it starts losing it logic. Even when the family try to get away from Santa Cruz and head down to Mexico, after driving all night they are somehow still in Santa Cruz. I've been to Santa Cruz it is not that big!Jordan Peele tries to underpin his film with some kind of explanation and symbolism but it is half baked. He also wants to tie the film together by making it all about Adelaide. Unlike Get Out there is little humour in this film although Gabe is meant to be a dorky dad.",6,0,2,12 August 2019
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," More salty balls
","Well as I am not a big fan of South Park the television series then a lot of the movie was going to be lost on me.The film is rude, crude and with its cheap looking animation but with lots of musical numbers including the Oscar nominated Blame Canada.The film's main focus is censorship with a side trip to Kenny finding himself in hell and finding out that Satan and Saddam Hussein are gay lovers.Third graders Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle bribe a drunken vagrant to get them into a R rated movie featuring hip Canadian comedians Terrance and Philip who curse and fart a lot. Next day at school they horrify their teachers with their new found vocabulary and once the parents become aware of this crude film, they are so outraged that they want to declare war with Canada.The film would go down a treat with South Park fans but despite a few laughs it was not for me and the it felt stretched with the longer running time.",3,1,6,21 September 2016
The Danish Girl," Against the grain
","The Danish Girl is directed by Tom Hooper who got a Best Director Oscar for The King's Speech.The film is adapted from a book which itself fictionalised events relating to the real Einer Wegener and Gerda, two artists living in Copenhagen in the 1920s who were also married to each other.When Gerda is let down by a female model she persuades Einer to wear female attire and pose for some paintings. This sets off a chain of events in Einer who begins to feel more feminine and creates a daring persona of Lili whose portraits sell very well.Gerda seems at first to be titillated by Einer's daring in wearing women's clothing but she then also is fearful as Lili attracts male attention. Over time Einer wants to become more female and Gerda attracts the attention of other suitors, especially Hans who also knew Einer as a child.The film is beautiful to look at with exquisite art direction, costumes and sets. There is a lot of location shooting as the film was shot in France, Denmark and Germany.Alicia Vikander who plays Gerda is the heart of the film but her motive oscillates too much from being encouraging, to be repulsed and then standing by her man despite the attentions of Hans wonderfully played by (Matthias Schoenaerts.)Eddie Redmayne is young and thin enough to pass off well in those scenes where he plays Lili and I am sure he practised posing and use of his hand and body gestures a lot to appear fragile as Lili.The film does feel like a mis-fire though, it feels rather starchy and well intentioned, even too conservative. Something never really hangs together in the film. I never got the feeling that Einar felt like someone who always felt he was in the wrong body which seems to be the common theme for people who take part in sex-change operations.I do not think it helps that is based very loosely in true events and more inspired by the fictional novel. It wants to be a period love story of a woman stoically supportive of her husband even if he takes for the time a novel and drastic steps for transformation surgery which leads to tragedy.",4,2,2,11 February 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Is this a dagger before me
","Video games being adapted to films have a short and ignoble history. The Lara Croft films managed to have some degree of box office success and mild critical acclaim.Prince of Persia underperformed at the US box office and got mixed reviews. In a sense the film is rather mixed. Mike Newell who directed one of the Harry Potter films and has previously specialised in some small scale films is a steady hand but even a skilled director such as him can do little with a dodgy script.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a street urchin Dastan adopted by the King Of Persia. He is treated like one of the family and another brother to two of the King's sons. Ben Kingsley plays Nizam the King's brother and family adviser.However before you can say the Lion King the sons of Persia invades a holy city in the pretext that they supply arms to their enemies but before long the King is murdered, Dastan gets the blame and it seems the war was just an excuse to get hold of a magical dagger that could turn back time.The film has plenty of acrobatics and action which ties in nicely with the video game character, some good CGI but Gyllenhaal is not dynamic enough nor has the lightness of touch to make his Prince of Persia appealing. I also felt that there was little chemistry between him and Gemma Arterton or maybe that is the fault of the script as they are always in conflict.Its a mildly entertaining romp and yet quickly forgettable.",5,0,1,6 April 2015
Ted," Teddy in a flash
","Although regarded as a high concept bad taste comedy featuring a Teddy Bear.Ted is a really a twisted romantic comedy from Seth MacFarlane.Mark Wahlberg plays John who when he was 8 years old received a Teddy Bear for Christmas that came to life.For a brief moment Ted became a celebrity but 27 years later he and John live together in an apartment with a low rent job, smoking dope, getting drunk and making risqué jokes.However John has Mila Kunis as a girlfriend who feels unappreciated. She also attracts the attention of her sleazy employer.Ted is also attracting the attention of a creepy guy played by Giovanni Ribisi.While the film has some bad taste jokes and scenes of Ted humping a woman which some might shocki some people. It is not that heavy going to many British viewers who have been used to grotesque alternative comedy for over three decades.At the heart of the story is a predictable rom com. Ted is fun, tasteless and enjoyable. It was also nice to see Flash Gordon again after all these years.",6,0,2,26 October 2013
Knives Out," Knives Out
","Knives Out is a star studded whodunit where all the suspects are gathered in the mansion.It is a knowing variation of the board game Cluedo which itself was turned into a movie in the mid 1980s. The victim is best selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer.)A private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired to find out if the writer's death really was murder or as the police suspect, a suicide. A recently changed will might lead to a motive.This comedy mystery is reliant on Harlan's personal nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) a woman who physically throws up if she tells a lie.Following the conventions of many Agatha Christie mysteries, Knives Out turns a lot of the essential ingredients of the genre in his head by adding several layers to the story.However it is not original as there have been several movies that have twisted the crime mystery genre. It also feel slightly laboured and in the end it is superficial as Craig's accent which at times becomes grating, Chris Evans playboy character is underwritten and he struggles among other cast members such as Don Johnson, Michael Shannon and Jamie Leigh Curtis.responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.",6,4,7,28 December 2019
Oldboy," A family thing
","Oddly having seen the Spike Lee Americanized remake first, I preferred the critically lambasted Oldboy slightly more than the Korean original. Talk about going out on a limb.Oh Dea-Su goes out drinking on his daughter's birthday and finds himself imprisoned in a room for 15 years. He is also suspected of killing his wife. He has no idea who has captured him and for what reason.15 years on he is released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. Oh Dae-Su sees this as a chance of getting revenge, he has kept himself in shape while he was locked up and goes out looking for answers, he also falls in love with a young woman along the way.The film is a Gothic revenge tale with graphic violence and a nod to The Count of Monte Cristo and Oedipus Rex.It seems that Oh Dea-Su's nemesis has set up a complex and contrived form of revenge that spans years. Like Oh Dea-Su you yearn for the answers and you root for him as he beats up all-comers some literally to a pulp.However I found the ending to be messy and unnecessarily graphic and gruesome. The remake had an elegant ending which was more palatable. Also I found the lead actor hard to take as a bad ass.Josh Brolin in the remake I could buy as the rowdy student in his youth or the drunken boor as a young man. When he is released I can see him being grungy and violent as he hunts down the people who locked him up.Still Oldboy was critically lauded and regarded as a masterpiece of modern South Korean cinema and is worth a watch.",6,1,3,23 December 2015
The Irishman," The Irishman
","The Irishman is a companion piece to Martin Scorsese's other gangster films, Goodfellas and Casino.It is also a teaming up of his old pals for one last ride. Robert De Niro has not appeared in a Scorsese film since Casino. Neither has Joe Pesci who basically retired from the movies in 1998. Harvey Keitel last worked with Scorsese in The Last Temptation of Christ. Al Pacino is the new boy, his first time working with Scorsese.The Irishman is less violent than Goodfellas and Casino. It still packs a punch although Scorsese has been more careful not to make these gangsters look as glamorous as in his previous films.Spanning 40 years, Frank Sheeran (De Niro) recalls his story. A World War 2 veteran who fought in Italy, a truck driver who delivered meat who went on to become a man who painted houses (a hitman.) Sheeran got involved with Russell Bufalino (Pesci) a Pennsylvania gangster who kept a low profile. It brings him into contact with Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) the leader of the powerful Teamster union who loaned money from its pension fund to organized crime. Sheeran went on to become close with Hoffa and a union organiser.Scorsese has called The Irishman a chamber piece. It is mainly about its three main characters and only De Niro, Pesci and Pacino go through the digital de-aging process. They are made to look in their late 30s/40s for the early part of the film.The film has the best cinema performances that De Niro and Pacino have given in years, mainly because the quality of some scripts they have been offered have been far from the best. Pacino plays Hoffa differently from Jack Nicholson in the movie Hoffa. Pacino's interpretation is of a man who likes ice cream sundaes, hates tardiness and unwilling to see reason because he thought the Teamsters owed him the leadership as a right. Pesci in contrast with his volatile Goodfellas character is a more thoughtful wiseguy here.The film clocks in at three and half hours. It is too long and one hour could had easily been excised from it. The de-aging has been done sympathetically. It works mainly because we are never told how old they were when we see them at their younger age. However, you can make an actor in his 70s look thirty years younger, you cannot digitally make them move like younger men. You can spot De Niro gingerly climbing some rocks in one scene.The treatment of females in this movie is superficial. Sheeran's and Bufalino's wives are just there to chain smoke. Only Sheeran's daughter Peggy shows unhappiness as to her father's chosen profession. Even then the old Peggy is wasted. At one point I did wonder why the film had a de-aged Holly Hunter playing Peggy. Only to realise she was played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for playing Hunter's daughter in The Piano.Despite the reservations, Scorsese has crafted a wonderful film, getting together the actors he relied on from his own early days as a director. There is an air of elegiac nostalgia to a style of cinema that might be passing away which Scorsese reflected on with his comments about Marvel superhero films. Ironic that The Irishman only got a limited cinema release as its main platform is Netflix.",8,10,20,29 November 2019
Point Break," No dead presidents
","Point Break was rebooted in 2001, it was called The Fast and the Furious where the surfing was replaced by street car racing.This remake sees extreme sports athlete Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) who after losing a friend when a motocross stunt goes wrong goes on to become a FBI agent some years later. His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) sends him to investigate a series of elaborate heists from a gang who behave like Robin Hood robbers.Utah believes that the group are taking part in the Ozaki 8, eight spiritually extreme sport challenges that coincide with the daring robberies. Utah infiltrates the gang which is led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez.)In its own right the film starts brightly enough with plenty of CGI enhanced action but later on the film actually comes to a stop in the non action sequences when the characters just talk. The film then becomes boring and after a while even the action scenes just get duller. The colour grading is awful making the film look cheap despite the international locations.The original Point Break directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who would go on to become the first female Oscar winning director found a zeitgeist of Generation X sports action thriller with well staged action sequences. Although not the greatest actors around, Bigelow got charismatic turns from Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and sturdy support from Gary Busey as Reeves FBI boss.The remake lacks all of this even though it tried to go on a new direction. I tried to give it a break and approached it with an open mind but alas it is a poor film.",2,10,12,2 December 2016

Creed," Gonna fly now
","The film Airplane II foresaw the cycle of Rocky films by having a poster of an aged Rocky in Rocky 38. Stallone himself ran out of ideas as to what to do with Rocky by 1990 with the decidedly average Rocky V and ramp up the nostalgia for Rocky Balboa which owed more to boxers like George Foreman coming out of retirement.It took co-writer and director Ryan Coogler to come up with an angle to continue the franchise, pushing Rocky to a supporting player and concentrating on Adonis Johnson (Michael B Johnson) the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed rescued from a succession of care homes by Apollo's widow.Despite an affluent lifestyle, Adonis is an angry young man, someone who feels like an outsider and needs to prove himself. Adonis takes up in the underground boxing scene in Mexico however unable to fight in the west coast he makes his way to Philadelphia to persuade Rocky to train him.The plot is basically a mixture of Rocky & Rocky II. A British world light heavyweight champion who is due to be stripped of his titles and serve time inside sees an opportunity to set up a lucrative fight with an unknown boxer who also happens to be trained by Rocky Balboa and is the son of Apollo Creed. This mirrors the situation when Apollo plucked an unknown opponent to fight for the world title in the original Rocky.In Philadelphia Rocky and Adonis bond, they get closer as Rocky is struck down by illness and Adonis helps him thought it although Rocky is initially weary of his help.Coogler goes for a modern urban Philadelphia setting of dinghy gyms, dirt bikes and a multi racial city reflected in the music throughout the film. What Coogler gets right is the beat of the film which rang true in the original. Rocky is again lonely, visiting the grave of his wife and also his brother in law. The restaurant is all he has and Adonis drags him back to the boxing world albeit reluctantly. In essence he is now playing the Mickey role, the grouchy but wise old trainer.The main fight bizarrely takes place at Goodison Park, home of the soccer club Everton. Will we hear the Rocky theme? Will Gonna Fly Now soar? You bet.What Ryan Coogler has done is refresh the ingredients, Rocky Balboa is a character that will live on outside of Sylvester Stallone as in future generations Rocky will be re-booted and re-invigorated.Stallone playing Rocky for the seventh time but for the first time as written by someone else imbues Rocky with inner calm. Here is a character that has become tired of life and sees a chance to become alive again by training Adonis until fate intervenes with a cruel twist.Michael Jordan bounces back from the Fantastic 4 flop by giving a spirited performance that is also tender and heartfelt.",7,0,2,5 February 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Should be sharper
","With the X Men trilogy done. 20th Century Fox did not want to let their franchise sit on its laurels and took an opportunity with their most popular character, Wolverine to have its own spin off film.Now all they needed was a story.They go for the Wolverine/Sabretooth rivalry but from the beginning it seems to be all too predictable with a big red hand pointing to any twists in the plot.Even the music gives you a nod as to what will happen next. I love a dumb action film, but this was just too dumb.Jackman is comfortable in the role of Wolverine, helped by a big pay cheque. Schreiber is animalistic enough as the vengeful Sabretooth and you have enough star cameos here there to keep things moving.Danny Huston, plays the younger version of Stryker and he is suitably chilling.Keep a look out for Wade Wilson, I think he will be back.",6,1,1,3 August 2013
Constantine," Angels and demons
","Constantine is a comic book adaptation. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a supernatural exorcist who has been to hell and back when he attempted suicide and battles demons in order that this may be his only way to win a place in heaven. By committing suicide he committed a sin.When a detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister has killed herself asks for Constantine's help he realises there is more to her death and pretty soon demons are unleashed and his own friends are dying in a gory way.Its a supernatural thriller with some gory deaths, good special effects and even a cameo by Satan as played by Peter Stormare. There is some odd pacing which makes the story drag, some nifty moves taking the film out of the biblical text. When Constantine goes to a room in Djimon Hounsou's club the setting becomes all Arabic and he even faces east when he enters his vision.Reeves plays the title character as a person who is bored with life, Tilda Swinton plays the angel Gabriel as more vengeful in an effective cameo.",5,0,1,17 July 2014
The Natural," Wonderboy
","After winning a Best Director Oscar in 1981. Robert Redford semi retired from acting. Setting up The Sundance Institute and raising funds for his personal directing projects left him with little appetite for acting work.The Natural is an almost Arthurian story based on Bernard Malamud's book was Redford's return to acting for the first time in four years.Set in the 1920s Redford plays Roy Hobbs a naturally gifted baseball player who fashioned his bat from a tree that was struck by lightning on the night his father died. The bat is his Excalibur.On his way to Chicago for tryouts he is gunned down by a black widow like maniac who is killing the best in every sport. Sixteen years later Hobbs emerges as a rookie for the New York Knights a team that is going nowhere and whose shady owner wants the team to fail.Once Hobbs get the chance to play he becomes a natural hitter leading his team on a winning streak. His success brings hazards and again there is another woman out to derail him, bring him down and therefore the team.The Natural is a period drama beautifully photographed by Caleb Deschanel. It moves at a languid place accompanied by a memorable score from Randy Newman. The music and some of the baseball imagery has been much imitated since.It is a lyrical film about second chances, love and redemption. It is also about good and evil. The women represented by Barbara Hershey and Kim Basinger are evil city women wanting Hobbs downfall.Glenn Close who plays his old flame back at the farm is draped in white and is almost angelic giving Hobbs a lift whenever she turn up at the stadium.The film bristles with a great supporting cast. Joe Don Baker as The Whammer who is humiliated by the younger Hobbs. Robert Duvall who has never played ball but is on the lookout for a great story and believes he can make or break a player to protect the sport such is his cynicism.Darren McGavin is a shadowy gambler who is in league with Robert Prosky's Judge who wants the team to fail so he can get sole ownership from the coach played Wilfred Brimley. These are arrogant and corrupted men.Brimley and Richard Farnsworth are the pure heart of the sport, uncorrupted men who love the game.I first watched this film over 30 years ago and found it enchanting, a thoughtful film for all the family.This was director's Barry Levinson's introduction to the major league. A chance to work with a big star and bigger budget. I think Levinson feels a bit lost away from his personal Baltimore set films and this could be the reason why some find the film cheesy and the portrayal of women shallow.I think the decision to shoot Redford and Close as teenagers in dim light is a risky move that they just about get away with. However when we see the older Hobbs we see Redford in his element. Like Hobbs in the intervening sixteen years, Redford keeps him mysterious, somehow distant which is typical of the actor who eschewed the method acting of displaying histrionics on screen. You leave that to others and just bounce of them.",9,1,2,18 June 2016
Just Go with It," Pretending all the way to Hawaii
","Just go with it is a remake of the far superior 1969 film, Cactus Flower which won Goldie Hawn a Best supporting actress Oscar.Adam Sandler plays Danny a renowned plastic surgeon who improved his own looks and pretends to be in an unhappy marriage to sleep with hot women. He wears a wedding band to carry out the deception.When he hooks up with an attractive younger woman Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) who does not fall for the scam as he does not wear a wedding ring. When she later sees him with a wedding band, Danny has to convince his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his soon to be divorced wife and her two kids to be their own kids and they go off to holiday in Hawaii where Danny plans to propose to Palmer.While in Hawaii Aniston meets up with an old college rival played by Nicole Kidman where they have petty feuds.It all leads up to Danny discovering the Aniston is actually very attractive, has a sexy body and they have a romantic spark with each other.The film has the usual Sandler hallmarks. He is rich, successful, women fall for him, he has goofy acquaintances. The new thing being that Sandler makes sure he can mix work and pleasure by filming in a popular holiday destination such as Hawaii in this case.As always there is the normal Sandler quota of 1980s music, here there are some effective mash ups with some recent songs.The film did not start off well but gets to be more fun and enjoyable as it carries on. To be fair Aniston and Sandler make it better than what it deserves to be but apart from a few minor laughs it is another long line of underwhelming rom-coms. Not funny or romantic enough.As a remake it is disappointing. The 1969 film balanced Walter Matthau falling for a cute Goldie Hawn and his assistant was played by Ingrid Bergman. The balance is brought out Bergman being middle aged and also the greater age disparity between Hawn and Matthau.Here it is all beautiful people from Hollywood. Aniston, Kidman, Decker all look great in a bikini. Sandler does not have that rough and ready look of Matthau and the remake has no soul.",3,5,6,28 November 2015
About Time," The Dad, the Wardrobe and Dom.
","About Time sells itself as a time travel romantic comedy. It's more about relationships.A relationship between father and son, brother and sister and two people who meet and get married. There is also some time travel involved.Richard Curtis, writer and director has some form when it comes to time travel.
He wrote a critically acclaimed episode of Doctor Who in 2010.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is a shy and awkward teenager especially when it comes to the ladies. On his 21st birthday, his father (Bill Nighy) unveils a family secret. The men in the family can travel back in time in their life stream.Soon Tim embarks to London to become a lawyer. He resides with a rude playwright and when a date in the dark goes awry. Tim decides to use time travel.Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and they establish a relationship.The film is not a laugh out comedy. It is a mixture of romance, drama, melancholy with a few laughs.There are the usual ingredients that you find in a Curtis film. The upper middle class with an eccentric family. A large house (by the seaside this time), musical interludes, a spiky and kookie young female character and romance with a transatlantic star.The time travel element is new. To be fair to Curtis he has thought about cause and effect.The best scenes are with Tim and his father. It is a genuine, warm relationship so you can guess that his father is going to bite the dust.I never got any chemistry between Gleeson and MacAdams. Dom was very good in the early scenes when he is young and vulnerable but he could not sell it when his character got older and had children.A good time waster but it had very little substance.",6,8,15,13 January 2014
Spotlight," Defrocking the priest
","I have a friend who is a devout Catholic who likes to tell people how historically the Catholic priesthood had always traditionally attracted homosexuals. All these men, allegedly celibate who all lived together.Spotlight based on true events is how the Boston Globe newspaper stumbled on a story of abusive priests in Boston and how they were protected by the top Cardinal in Boston. Cardinal Law would had the victims paid off and then moved them around so they would live to abuse another day.The Spotlight team of the Globe are requested by their new editor to investigate and their diligence pays off. They uncover a horde of abusive priests who damaged generations of children.Director Tom McCarthy aimed to make a modern version of All the President's Men. They even have a Ben Bradley but it is junior the son of the great editor of The Washington Post. McCarthy treats the film as a procedural. It starts off as a weak story, most of the journalists are not interested in investigating the Catholic church that still has a big foothold in Boston.However as the team probes they uncover more layers, more victims, more deviant priests and the newspapers own failings. Several people tell the journalists that information and documents was sent to them in the past and they did nothing.The film benefits from the acting of its ensemble cast ranging from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo to Billy Crudup. Liev Schreiber is very restrained here, unusually for a newspaper editor bought in to shake things up. Ruffalo has the more showy role. It is not a greatly photographed film, there are several nice shots but it really comes across as a lower budget film.",7,0,1,10 September 2018
Insomnia," Murder and sunlight
","Insomnia is a remake of a Norwegian thriller which features the trio of Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.However this is Pacino's film. He plays seasoned LA Detective Will Dormer arriving at rural Alaska somewhere north of the Arctic Circle in the height of summer when it does not get dark to solve the murder of a teenage girl. Back in LA he is under investigation by Internal Affairs and his partner, who arrives with him to Alaska (Martin Donovan) is looking like that he will buckle under pressure.While in pursuit of the possible killer in heavy fog, Dormer ends up shooting dead his partner. Was it deliberate or an accident?Dormer now has to cover up his tracks to show that the suspect shot his partner but Robin Williams who plays crime writer Walter Finch claims to have seen what Pacino did to his partner and there begins a game of cat and mouse. Finch played in a sinister but restrained manner by Williams is cold and calculating exploiting the vulnerable Dormer who is confused, tired and sleep deprived because of the lack of darkness. Finch offers Dormer a deal to frame the teenage girl's boyfriend in exchange for his silence as to what happened to his partner.Swank plays a young police investigator at first excited to be working with Dormer and then has to investigate his partner's killing.This was Christopher Nolan's first major Hollywood film and he was entrusted with three academy winning actors. Williams gives an understated performance, Swank provides warmth and steely determination but it is Pacino who is the centre as he looks to wrest control while staying up for days without sleep and sparring with Williams.However the film with its rural Alaskan vibe does not really fire on all cylinders. I expected Nolan to gives us a film that is slightly offbeat and maybe a touch surreal.Swank looks wasted, its a role any competent actress can perform. It actually lacks chills and thrills.",5,0,2,24 August 2014
Aquaman," King Arthur
","DC have learned to make their films bold, brash and colourful. Audiences do not want dark, moody superheroes. It might work on the Dark Knight but we want Superman to be well super.Aquaman is enjoyable enough nonsense. It has similarities with Black Panther as well as elements of Thor and King Arthur. It injects fun as long as you do not take it all seriously.The movie begins with a lighthouse keeper, Tom Curry rescuing Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater realm of Atlantis.Two worlds collide, they fall in love and have a baby boy. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father in a small fishing coast. His mother was snatched back to Atlantis when he was a child.Vulko (Willem Dafoe) came from the watery world to mentor and teach Arthur about his heritage and combat skills. Aquaman uses his powers to save people in the land world.Mera (Amber Heard) tells that Arthur that he must fulfil his right to be the heir to one of the underwater kingdoms of Atlantis, even though he is a half breed. His half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is dangerous and plans to destroy the land world.Orm is in cahoots with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who launches a submarine attack on Atlantis, giving Orm an excuse to go to war. Black Manta also has his own reasons to kill Aquaman.However Aquaman in order to be the rightful king, must find a legendary trident once forged by Poseidon. His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film. It is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave.",6,4,6,25 January 2019

Thor: Ragnarok," Hippy Hippy Thor
","Thor was always a tricky comic book character to bring to big screen. Kenneth Branagh managed to do it by making the first film as a mock Shakespearean action film fuelled by dysfunctional family dynamics. He was instrumental in casting Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Unfortunately Thor:The Dark World was rather dreary. Marvel has taken a left turn for Thor: Ragnarok by getting inspiration from The Guardians of the Galaxy film by underpinning the film with comedy.King Odin has been sent to a nursing home on Earth by Loki who has pretended to be Odin at Asgard. Thankfully Doctor Strange felt Odin would be more at home in Norway.When Thor returns to Asgard he sees through Loki's disguise. When they go to meet a dying Odin, he tells both of an evil older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett) who will return and cause chaos.Thor:Ragnarok is a rather trippy neon lit 1980s infused adventure film. In some ways it nods a hat to movies like Big Trouble in Little China.Thor is both aided and thwarted by evil brother Loki who sees Thor getting a painful bashing that he endured in the hands of the Hulk who is the main star in a planet where beings take part in a gladiatorial contest.It is Asgard and some of the regulars from there who get short shrift, characters such as Heimdall. Karl Urban who plays Hela's henchman called Skurge is rather wasted of his talents as we know he is capable of giving much more. Even Blanchett is rather bland as the villainess, Hela. In some ways the film is rather dark and brutal but it is always undercut by the comedy.",6,2,8,2 November 2017
Yes Man," More a negative attitude
","Liar, Liar was a big hit, a film where Carrey has to suddenly tell the truth.This is an adaptation of a book by a British humorist.

He adopts a negative outlook in life since his divorce.After attending a 'Yes' seminar an event run by an inspirational guru played by Terence Stamp, Carrey is persuaded to change his outlook with the result that he says yes to everything with some awkward consequences.Yes Man is not very funny.

Midnight in Paris," Woody like Paris
","At school, children are made to read Shakespeare and told that it is good for them.As you get older, critics tell you to watch Woody Allen films because it's good for you. While you think my word that was a chore and that is watching one of his more acclaimed film from the late 1970s and early 1980s.In the last decade Allen has spent more time making films in Europe with mixed results although I liked Match Point and Scoop.Midnight in Paris allows him to give us a picture postcard portrait of Paris.It is funny, whimsical, has time travel and concludes that it is better to live in the now than hark back to a distant, mythical golden age in the past.Owen Wilson plays an aspiring liberal novelist having a break in Paris with his fiancée and her wealthy Tea Party supporting parents.Whilst having a stroll on his own one evening and getting lost, he gets into a vintage car and is transported to the 1920s where he parties with Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway and the like.The events stir up his creative juices and realises that he needs to confront issues in his present life.Owen Wilson takes a break from his normal comedy films to do his turn for Woody Allen and acquits himself well. He is outshone by the cameos from Adrien Brody, Tom Hiddleston, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates who play famous artists and writers and muses from the past.Once the film gets going, it is enthralling, maybe too much of a tourist advert for Paris but it is nice to see Woody having casual fun.",8,0,0,6 September 2013
Youth," I'm too old for this
","There is a lot of naked flesh in Youth and I do not mean the fat actor playing Diego Maradona.The most memorable part of the movie are shots of gorgeous naked women. Rather sad given this film features legends such as Jane Fonda, Micheal Caine and Harvey Keitel along with Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz.Caine plays retired British composer Fred Ballinger staying is a luxury Swiss spa hotel. He reminiscences all day with over the hill film director Mick (Harvey Keitel) who is his best friend.Fred and Mick also have one other thing in common, Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) is married to Mick's son and their marriage has fallen apart. Mick's son has found love with pop star Paloma Faith played by Paloma Faith.This is a surreal arthouse movie and it is not about much. Well the film is called Youth so the two old men talk about the old days, bicker, complain and leer at the women in the hotel which includes a Miss Universe.A waste of the acting talent involved in a poorly thought out script. The biggest waste are the female actresses, they really are short changed.",3,2,2,30 April 2019
Zodiac," Mystery of the Zodiac killer
","David Fincher manages to assemble some of the cast of The Avengers before Marvel Studios. Fincher again revisits the serial killer genre but this time based on true events of the Zodiac killer. The killings take place in the early part of the picture and although not graphic is still disturbing and eerie. The rest of the film deals with the police and press investigation in trying to unmask killer conveying the frustrating nature of the investigation that is still unsolved.The film gives us a narrative from the point of view of San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith who spent over 20 years obsessively trying to identify the killer and whose book the film takes inspiration from.The three leads Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo show zeal and frustration in equal measures as the exhaustive investigation over time places a burden on them all as they go round in circles with the evidence and suspects. The film believes that Robert Leigh Allen is the main suspect although the DNA case against him is unclear.The film is dense, thoughtful and at times seem slow. There is good photography and set design, showing San the Francisco of the late 1960s/early 1970s is not a simple task.",7,0,1,21 July 2014
Hotel Rwanda," Genocide tales
","Making a film of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 is not an easy thing to do as you need to find a hook to grab the viewers and keep them interested. I have already seen Shooting Dogs which was released at a similar time and also dealt with the events of the Rwandan conflict.Hotel Rwanda sees Don Cheadle playing a luxury hotel manager Paul, a Hutu who spends his time charming people of influence. His wife is Tutsi and the he is respected by the corporate owners of the hotel based in Belgium.As the conflict escalates and using bribes in terms of money and booze to some sympathetic Hutu bigwigs to tune a blind eye he brings over some Tutsi neighbours and his family to the hotel.Once the UN decide that the country is too dangerous and decide to leave and leave the Tutsis to their deaths, Paul opens up the hotel to the Tutsis and then figure out how to get everyone to safety as the Hutu militia are sensing blood.The film is based on true events and has a docu-drama feel to it by director Terry George. The film has strong performances from Cheadle, Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo.Maybe because I saw Shtting Dogs first there was an element of seen it all before. The film could had done with more spikiness as to why UN forces left people to such a fate when they were supposed to be protecting them.",6,0,0,23 November 2014
Once," Hear my song
","Once is a nice twee film that by and large avoids the 'Oirish' stereotypes and tries to be true to its feelings even though it is bittersweet.The main characters are nameless. He is a busker trying to make a living when someone is not stealing his takings and also repairs vacuum cleaners in his father's repair shop. She is a Czech immigrant who asks him to repair her vacuum cleaner and she also plays piano.Together they meet and decide to produce and record music together, he writes a song to win his ex-girlfriend back who is in London. She has a toddler living with her and her mother as well as a husband back in the Czech republic.The film has been compared to 'Brief Encounter', I see it as an urban, streetwise romantic drama which certainly dangles a sweet love story but also hints that they have other factors that threaten to keep them apart. It is also a small scale film filled with some good songs which elevates the film more than it deserves to as the story is too basic.",5,0,0,19 February 2017
Ready Player One," Game on
","Steven Spielberg has been inspired by James Cameron's use of 3D in Avatar as this is a film worth watching on 3D, with set pieces that are ready made for 3D viewing.Spielberg has also gone for a popcorn film full of cultural references to the 1970s and 80s. If you are a vintage arcade geek, a gamer or love 1980s film, this is the film for you.You can glimpse Batman, Robocop, the Tardis, Chucky the doll, King Kong. There are references to Back to the Future, Star Trek and Spielberg sends a affectionate note to one of his idols, Stanley Kubrick.Set in 2045, the world has gone to pot and the population immerse themselves in the virtual world of the Oasis. In Columbus, Ohio; Wade Watts is living in a hell hole called the Stacks with his aunt. He finds a key to an adventure left by the late designer of the Oasis. Wade with his virtual friends have to race to against a ruthless corporation to gain further keys which gives the winner the ownership of the virtual kingdom.The characters are thinly sketched, Wade does come across as naive, displaying a person who has spent more time in a virtual world than real one. The plot is straightforward, nothing very much deep here.Spielberg has infused the film with lots of fun and action. However at times it is too simplistic. When the police show up at the end of the movie, you do wonder where they were for the rest of the time as the bad guys seem to have the real world all to themselves. The villain must have a really bad memory if he needs to write THAT password down on a piece of paper.",7,21,51,29 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Smiley's catch
","Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a best selling novel, turned to an award winning BBC television serial and now a condensed version has been turned to a film with a masterful performance by Gary Oldman at the centre.The film is effectively a 1970s British noir, a 'whodunit' as veteran spy George Smiley is brought back into the secret service to flush out a Soviet mole. Oldman has to bring a different take on Smiley from Alec Guinness and manages to bring a stillness where you try to figure out what he is thinking inside his head.Swedish Director Tomas Alfredson brings a stylistic retro view of the past and relies on actors such as Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch to bring out nuggets of their characters as Smiley gets closer to unearth the mole.The film has its detractors, those who have read the book or viewed the TV series felt short changed as the film had to cut out lot of the material. Karla is unseen and some may view Mrs Smiley being virtually invisible when her behaviour is fundamental to the plot.However the film has to be seen in its own merits and its a slow, thoughtful and a deceptively good version, finely acted.",8,2,4,25 August 2014
The Hateful Eight," What lies beneath
","Quentin Tarantino's eight film is The Hateful Eight. By this time we know what to expect, lots of talking, some of its fast and loose.Even though the publicity blurb mentions John Carpenter's The Thing as an inspiration (Kurt Russell even riffs a line from that film about going without sleep,) it really is an Agatha Christie style mystery done Tarantino style.We visit the snowbound wild west post civil war where the wounds of war are still raw.Kurt Russell is bounty hunter John Ruth better known as the Hangman. Where other bounty hunters kill and take the bodies for the reward. He brings them back alive so they can hang. He is taking back Daisy Domergue, a female captive with a big reward for her head. On the road he meets Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) another bounty hunter and they ride together until they meet the designated new sheriff also on his way to his new post at the town they are heading to.A blizzard means they have to hole up in an inn where there are other people staying. Bruce Dern is the bitter, racist confederate General Smithers trying to find the fate of his son. Tim Roth is Mobray on his way to the same town as the sheriff to be the new hangman. There are several other people, we believe that some of them are bluffing. Ruth thinks that one of them is not what he claims to be and lies have been told.As I said there is a lot of chatter, maybe too much, lots of suspicion, lots of rubbing people up the wrong way. We do wonder what this is all leading to, as maybe events are unravelling too slowly and then bang, the bodies start to fall and Tarantino does his reveal.The film has dark twisted humour, mean characters bristling with menace, bloody cruel violence. In his heart it is a visceral mystery thriller told in a slow simmering style.",7,2,13,8 January 2016

","This fact based drama stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore. He has gathered a force of 400 troopers and with aerial support they land in the Ia Drang Valley of north Vietnam in November 1965. It is the first major battle of the Vietnam War.The US 7th Air Cavalry are surrounded by over 2000 enemy soldiers and they engage in a bloody battle to break through the North Vietnamese lines.Back home the loved ones of the soldiers get news of what has been taking place. Moore needs to live up to the promise to his soldiers. 'I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.'Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart reunited with Mel Gibson for We Were Soldiers. This time Wallace also directs and the war scenes are directly influenced by Saving Private Ryan. It is bloody and graphic.However the story is pedestrian. When the action shifts to the family back home it becomes saccharine and even frankly silly as Moore's wife delivers letters to soldiers wives telling them that their husbands have died.The big explosions are done well. The story even if it is true does not compare with Platoon or Apocalypse Now. The characters are two dimensional, they are stock characters that could had arrived from any multitude of war films.Ironically, Gibson directed a better war film with Hacksaw Ridge.",5,0,2,13 May 2019
Molly's Game," Coming up trumps
","Aaron Sorkin delivers another film with sharp dialogue but this time he also takes on directorial duties in Molly's Game based on true eventsMolly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) comes from a family whose father demands excellence. A freak accident prevented Molly from making it to the US Olympic skiing team. On her way to law school, Molly ended up working in a bar in LA and then became a PA to a man who ran underground poker games for the rich and famous. Over time Molly learned the ins and outs of this side gambling operation and took over it by providing a better and more glamourous experience.As always Molly falls foul of the FBI and needs the help of a lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) who wants her to give the FBI some names of her high stake gamblers. Some of them were A list celebrities, others were mobsters.Sorkin adds depth to Molly by making her more than a smart driven woman constantly living of her wits. We see flashbacks of young Molly and her therapist father (Kevin Costner) who she was constantly flippant with.The film moves breezily, Sorkin adds some visual trickery to make poker look exciting but it does have a bloated running time and some of the gambling lingo just goes over your head. The biggest problem is people involved in high stake gambling are never going to be nice people and Molly herself is descending into drink and drug addiction. I also thought the parallels with the book The Crucible which the lawyer's daughter is reading just came across as rather ham fisted. Still Sorkin always try to write a film that has a bit of street smartness about it.",6,1,4,18 January 2018

She needs to persuade vain Maui to return the heart.Maybe if I sat with an audience of younger kids I might had enjoyed this film more. As it is I found the film dull, the songs duller. I did not find it that amusing or entertaining.I noted the amount of people involved in writing the story for this film, I think any old hack in Hollywood could had knocked this out on autopilot.I did like the animation style, some of it was very creative but the Polynesian setting bought little to the table.",3,3,6,17 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Joining the organisation
","BlacKkKlansman is a Spike Lee joint that is based on the true story of Ron Stallworth (John David Washington.) He was the first black recruit of the Colorado Springs police force in the 1970s. Stuck in a dead end job at the police records department, Ron gets an opportunity to do undercover work. One day after seeing a newspaper advert, he rings the local branch of the KKK and applies to join.Obviously as Ron is black he cannot meet the local members. So fellow undercover officer Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) goes to the meetings but Zimmerman is Jewish. Both end up investigating radical members of the Klan who plan to wage war against the local black college student union who bought in an ex Black Panther member to speak at an event.There is a powerful cameo from Harry Belafonte telling a story of a mentally handicapped black man who was found guilty of rape on trumped up charges and was then brutally lynched. The white crowd had been whipped up by D W Griffith's movie, Birth of a Nation.Lee's film takes liberties with the actual true events. It starts off as a satirical drama. Lee however in unable to resist being heavy handed with his message and makes a few digs at President Trump and his America First policies, which Lee regards as code for supporting racism.The film benefits greatly from the performances by John David Washington and Adam Driver. However it is a little too long and uneven. The last act with the bomb did not work for me and looked contrived. It is still an interesting and enthralling film.",7,2,4,7 November 2018

Stark gives him an all tech Spidey suit as well as the services of Happy Hogan.The bad guy is The Vulture/Adrian Toomes played by Michael Keaton, a salvage contractor that cleans up alien artifacts that has been put out of business by Stark's companies. Now he uses alien technology for nefarious means such as heists and that puts him on a collision course with Spiderman. However Parker does not realise how close to home Toomes really is.The film never really soared for me, I think I was put off by the bored looking Jon Favreau playing Happy Hogan and maybe they should had toned down the appearances of Tony Stark who is in it a bit too much.There were some nice set pieces such as Spiderman saving his schoolmates from the Washington Monument. It was fun seeing Keaton as the Vulture after the actor hit the limelight again by playing Birdman but I did not think much of the villain apart from an honest man who became a leader of a bunch of thugs.",5,1,5,5 April 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
","'Gentlemen. You can't fight here this is the war room.'Stanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.In the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.Finally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.It is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.It is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.George C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.The film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane.",9,6,6,8 November 2019
The Expendables," Action men
","To say The Expendables is one of the best action films in this decade is not saying much as there really have not been many good action films in the last few years with many straight to video fodder.Sylvester Stallone decides to go back to his 1980s glory days by rounding up a group of a current and past action stars including cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.Stallone who looks in good physical shape thanks to the steroids but his face looks awful courtesy of bad plastic surgery leads the teams of big hearted mercenaries. Jason Statham, is the cockney knife thrower, Jet Li is the short ass Kung Fu one, Dolph Lundgren is the mean drug addicted one, Mickey Rourke is the philosopher/tattooist. Terry Crews and Randy Couture round up the team.The CIA hires The Expendables to eliminate a Latin American dictator and a renegade CIA agent (Eric Roberts). Stallone gets close to the rebellious daughter of the dictator and Roberts has a few nasty henchman of his own such as Steve Austin.There is a lot of good action sequences but it has a slight storyline. Some very good explosions but the climactic scenes shot in the dark makes it difficult to see what is actually happening unless you have those night vision goggles.Its a fun, no brainer action film. More enjoyable first time round but really does not stand up to repeated viewing. Its the best of the The Expendables franchise as it offers something fresh and the sequels got stale rather quickly.",6,0,0,30 November 2014
Knocked Up," She is having a baby
","Seth Rogen and Judd Apatow make a film about relationships and pregnancy as slacker Rogen knocks up Entertainment reporter Heigl. The film makes observations about relationships and flawed people getting along with each other which is rare. I think at no point are people intentionally mean to one another which is rare in a Hollywood film.The film has the usual gross out humour dealing dope and sex. The men act liked doped up adolescents with an interest in building a website that points out when the actors get naked in movies yet in the film Heigl always has sex with her bra on.However as a comedy the film is less successful, it failed to even make me chuckle slightly, its also overlong when it should had been snappier and I never really bought the relationship between Heigl and Rogen as a couple who would ever get together for a one night stand, never mind be with each other whilst she is expecting.",4,1,3,15 April 2014
The Book Thief," Too slow moving
","The Book Thief is narrated by the Grim Reaper himself but it needs more than this gimmick to stand apart from other films that tread a similar path about people growing up in Nazi Germany during the war.Liesel (Sophie Nélisse) is fostered by a childless older couple, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson) as her communist mother cannot look after her. Living in a small village, kindly Hans teaches her to read and Liesel acquires a love of books. While others in village are burning books, she steals them to read.The household also hides a young Jewish lad called Max and in among a village that consists of Nazi sympathisers and bullies she develops a friendship with Rudy, both develop a hate for Nazis in a world that has become increasingly dangerous.The film has a sad and touching finale. I do not think I am giving much away given who narrates this film. However I found the film flat and trite. It was also too long which means kids watching it would get restless.The movie does have one great line which is delivered by the Grim Reaper. He recounts that some of the people that Liesel encountered, he met them in passing!",5,0,0,18 April 2017
Blades of Glory," Two to dance
","Blades of Glory stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as two rival figure skaters, Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy who brawl after an ice skating tournament and end up getting banned for life.However they exploit a loophole that allows them to return in the doubles category, dancing as a same sex couple amongst other mixed couples. However as they hate each other they have to put aside their differences and work together as a team. They also have to beat the reigning champions who are a brother and sister combination and plan to use the deadly Iron Lotus move.The film is a parody of The Cutting Edge which had teaming up of a mismatched and tempestuous pair for ice dancing. It also takes a dig at the campiness of ice skating. Chazz is a macho, a sex addict with a tough style of dancing. You can guess he is based on the 90s Canadian ice skater Elvis Stojko. Jimmy is more fey and artistic.The films make good use of CGI as we actually believe that the actors are skating. It takes a dig at the hairstyles, costumes and the win at all cost mentality of some of the participants. Its corny and amusing enough, it will keep you laughing mildly without many big guffaws.",6,0,1,14 June 2015
Horrible Bosses," Employees of the month
","Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis are three friends who end up with horrible bosses.To be fair Sudeikis had a nice boss with Donald Sutherland until he dies and his son (Colin Farrell) takes over, who is a coked up douchebag.Bateman works all hours for promotion but is actually getting used by Kevin Spacey an egoist. While Day is a dental assistant whose boss Jennifer Aniston is a sex maniac.One drunken night they have an idea to bump off their bosses in the style of Hitchcock's Strangers on a train.It is here the film mixes dark humour and slapstick. They go looking for a hit-man and bump into MF Jones (Jamie Foxx) who gives them tips.Our intrepid trio tend to add two part incompetence with every bad idea they have.Spacey seems to be having a good time playing the smarmy, nasty boss, Aniston looks delectable as the man-eater and Farrell is unrecognisable as the doped up jerk.The trio can get irate, but it's a story well told. Some good laughs are provided and the director keeps a good balance to make sure things do not get too dark and mean.",6,0,1,8 November 2013
The Polar Express," The bell that jingles
","The Polar Express starts out about a boy who does not believe in Santa Clause now he has become older. The magic of Christmas is receding. However a train The Polar Express arrives at night and the train conductor (Tom Hanks) invites the boy to hop in where he sees other kids on the way to the North Pole. The final stop sees a reluctant boy boarding the train who sits alone in a carriage. The kids on the train are a diverse bunch such as a know it all, a loner etc.Every now and then the conductor arrives asking to see the tickets and fretting about getting to the destination on time. On the way there are a series of adventures and sequences such as a ticket getting lost, waiters arriving to serve hot drinks and a hobo on top of the train.When the train arrives at the North Pole we see elves getting the presents ready for Christmas and then Santa makes an entrance where the boy receives a bell from Santa.The film directed by Robert Zemeckis is the first full length performance capture movie however the technology did not look as advanced in places. The characters look a little unreal especially with the dead eyes.However there are some breathtaking CGI scenes on the train along the journey such as the dancing waiters and when the ticket floats away. However subsequent scenes filed to hold sway as I felt it was there to show off the CGI than serve the story.That is the trouble, it looks very padded as if a short story was being adapted for a full length film. I watched this with my son who was disinterested mainly because he had seen the film before. It had no re-watch value for him.",5,0,2,13 December 2015

Brother Ignacio also hopes to impress the new nun who he finds rather appealing. However as the monastery frowns on wrestling, he fights as a masked wrestlerAfter a while tired of losing and wanting to make money as a winner he challenges top wrestler Ramses and hope he can soar like an eagle.This is a quirky underdog story with a right blend of humour and action when the action is consigned to the ring but does not always flow altogether when the story is away from the ring when it can easily become dull despite some gross out humour.",6,0,0,11 June 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," The return of the soldiers
","The Best Years of Our Lives is an overlong melodrama focusing on the servicemen who return home after the war.The film was released in 1946, soon after the war ended and was brave to show a world that was not going to be all bread and roses for these returning heroes.Three different servicemen fly home to their Midwest town get back into civilian life but encounter difficulties.Harold Russell lost his hands in battle and with his replacement metallic hands he has difficulty adjusting and feels his girlfriend is only hanging about because she feels sorry for him.Fredric March plays the veteran soldier with older kids who returns to his job at the bank but gets chastised for giving loans to ex servicemen trying to make something of their lives.Dana Andrews returns as a war hero only to wind up as a soda jerk behind the counter and earning far less than he used to. His wife wants a better, glamorous life, probably cheats on him and he finds solace with March's daughter who seems to understand him more. Here was an interesting triangle that gets lost.The film is uneven and too long where the soap like drama just loses its bubble. I cannot fathom how Frederic March won the Best Actor Oscar, although non actor Harold Russell gives a genuine naturalistic performance of someone trying to make it through with his injuries and who only feels comfortable with his old soldier buddies.",4,4,13,24 October 2016
Underworld Awakening," Lycan rising
","On the plus side Underworld: Awakening is a generic horror action film with that bleached out look and plenty of fake CGI blood.Kate Beckinsale puts on a skin tight leather suit again as the murderous vampire Selene. The humans have discovered the subspecies of Vampires and Lycans and have been destroying them.Selene and her Lycan lover Michael were captured and put in a deep freeze in a private laboratory. Now some twelve years later Selene has emerged from her cryogenic sleep in mysterious circumstances and enters a world with supposedly no werewolves and vampires.Pretty soon she discovers the last remnants of a coven and teams up with a vampire named David (Theo James), a police detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) and she finds out about her hybrid daughter Eve (India Eisley). Just as there are some vampires still remaining, there are also Lycans who have survived and rebuilt their numbers and Eve and Selene are crucial to their future plans.The absence of Michael (Scott Speedman) who appears as CGI in some scenes dos not help the story much which is paper thin, the dialogue is bad. The film just relies on video game action scenes with plenty of CGI and a cheap look to it.",3,1,4,14 November 2016
Suicide Squad," The dirty crew
","I think I saw this film many years ago. It was called The Dirty Dozen and it had a more coherent plot.Suicide Squad is a combination of bad asses from the world of DC comics as intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of meta-humans, that is humans with some superpowers to defend the world the next time the world encounters a villain with the powers that Superman has. I think Waller describes a situation of who would save the world if someone took the roof of the White House and entered the Oval Office, which is exactly what happened in Superman II.The Suicide Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in check is Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who is also seeking to rescue his lover Dr June Moone who is possessed by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne.)Everyone has a back story but the film concentrates mainly on Deadshot and Harley Quinn with the Joker (Jared Leto) popping in as a strategic and unfunny guest villain.The story is a bit of a mess with a weak plot and most of the action located on a sound stage shot at night time. You know this group of bad people will defy authority, plan to escape and eventually bond to take on the villains which seems to be some kind of CGI monsters who conveniently get shot, slashed, banged or knocked out by a baseball bat. Some of the anti heroes do not have super powers at all but people like Diablo or Killer Croc do.Although I admire Leto's take on the Joker, he was messily written and I expected silly humour from him which was non existent here.Still Warner Brother's have learned from Marvel and included an eclectic soundtrack, they have at least made the film entertaining. I just think their world of heroes lacked the cohesiveness that Marvel have achieved and this is mainly down to a sub par screenplay.",5,0,0,19 May 2017
Battleship Potemkin," The Rising
","I only became aware of Battleship Potemkin when Brian De Palma's The Untouchable's was released for the cinema and critics mentioned the pram down the steps sequence and how the director borrowed it from this film.This Russian silent celebrates the Potemkin uprising of 1905 which Lenin regarded as an event that sowed the seeds of the The Russian Revolution. This is a fictionalised retelling by Sergei Eisenstein.The crew of the battleship are mutinous because of poor rations, meat infested with maggots but the officers pass it as fit for consumption. The crew will not back down so the officers throw tarpaulin over some of the rebellious crew, give them the last rites and are ordered to be shot.One of the crew members Vakulinchuk pleads to the firing squad not to fire and the firing squad does not and it leads to mutiny as the officers are overcome.The uprising in the ship travels far and wide and in the town of Odessa, Vakulinchuk who was killed in the mutiny, his body is displayed to the public. In the Odessa steps a gathering crowd are fired on by Tsarist troops where women and children are killed leading to a pram with a baby plummeting down the steps. The massacre never happened, it was made up for the film.The film is propaganda to symbolize the spirit of the Russian revolution. Sergei Eisenstein made an epic film with vast crowd sequences, montage editing techniques and is a technical accomplishment for the early days of cinema.",7,0,0,24 September 2016
Elf," Elf and safety
",Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kind of film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in the North Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much taller than the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his real father once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynical James Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks he is an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department store while trying to connect with his father. He also helps the real Santa by getting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults may find it a little bit over the top.Ferrell has enough charm to pull off the role. James Caan on the other hand has found a new generation of fans who know him as Walter and not Sonny Corleone.,6,2,2,4 January 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Who watches the protectors?
","Thor: The Dark World underwhelmed me. A run of the mill nonsense plot, epic action and Loki getting some funny lines.Captain America: The Winter Soldier steps up to the plate and throws a curve ball. In fact it takes a wrecking ball to the Agents of Shield and strips it bare as a malevolent, infected bug that is not fit for purpose.Captain America has to go off the grid when Nick Fury tells him to trust no one. Agents are going rogue, Fury is left impotent and the ultimate question we ask ourselves, is Robert Redford's character Alexander Pierce a turncoat?The writers and directors of this film hark back to the 1970s conspiracy thrillers when filmmakers focused their attention in wrongdoing at the heart of government in an era of the Watergate scandal. They wanted to imitate with a Marvel twist films such as Three days of the Condor and All the President's Men, films that starred Robert Redford.With the revelations that various governments in recent years in the name of national security have monitored vast amounts of computer databases to track our internet or phone usage, this film has touched a nerve.We still get Marvel action heroics, we get set piece action and fights. Captain America is more questioning but Chris Evans still cannot bring much life to what is a sturdy but dull comic book character. He still gets a better deal than The Winter Soldier who seems to be in deep freeze. Scarlett Johannson and Anthony Mackie provide able support and the veterans Redford and Jackson ask us to think about the here and now.",7,0,3,26 March 2014
Lost in Translation," Big in Japan
","Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, this is a bittersweet tale of two Americans who come across each other in Tokyo. They seem to connect like lost souls but maybe that was because they felt stranded in a foreign country.Bob (Bill Murray) is faded movie star filming a lucrative whiskey commercial in Japan. Away from his family, he feels lost in Japan.Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) has arrived in Tokyo with her photographer husband. While he is busy working on a photo shoot, she is at a loose end. When both Bob and Charlotte meet at a bar they explore the Tokyo night life and have fun together.I first watched this movie on a place soon after it was released. I gave up after 10 minutes because nothing much was happening.It does take a while to get going and it works mainly because of the two stars. The combination of the jaded Bob whose career is in decline and maybe his home life is troubled. He is rather self centred as he has no issues picking up women. Charlotte is younger, only been married for a few years and is still trying to figure out life.I once heard someone say that Tokyo is a place where you know you are in a foreign country and it is easy to feel disconnected if you are a westerner. That is what has occurred to Bob and Charlotte. If they bumped to each other in New York for example, they would just then passed each other by.The film is not much of a comedy and I think Murray who was Oscar nominated for his role is not exactly stretching himself here.Director Sofia Coppola adds a few flourishes such as two women giggling behind Bob as a Japanese man talks to him in a hospital waiting room.",5,1,2,6 March 2019
Doctor Strange," Not so deranged
","Marvel takes another risk with making a movie with one of their relatively lesser known characters. Benedict Cumberbatch uses his Sherlock skills to make the egoist Dr Stephen Strange to be likable.He plays a cocky, brilliant neurosurgeon whose hands are shattered after a car crash. He travels to Nepal and to a secretive temple called Kamar-Taj headed by the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) where he learns mystical skills and magic when he broadens his mind and accepts his part in the multiverse.Marvel Studios gets all trippy with multicoloured Salvador Dali inspired sequences that also owes a lot to Christopher Nolan's Inception of folding cityscapes.The plot is perfunctory though. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen made up to look like a glam rock star) is a former student of the Ancient One, who believes there can be eternal life and the Celtic Ancient One has been holding out as to her real source of her powers. He makes a pact with an entity from the dark dimension that wants to destroy the planet.There is something Harry Potter like about this film, especially as some of the scenes were filmed in London. There is a nifty sequence with the Cloak of Levitation that has chosen to be with Dr Strange.Solid support from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo who teaches Dr Strange to fight and Benedict Wong as the protector of the ancient books. Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer, a fellow medic and love interest of Dr Strange. McAdams incidentally appeared in the Robert Downey series of Sherlock Holmes films.",6,2,5,1 November 2016
Barry Lyndon," A malignant fate
","The narrator Michael Hordern informs us of the rise and fall of the Irish adventurer Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) in eighteenth century Europe. It is adapted from William Thackeray's 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon.It is not a swashbuckling romance of a heroic soldier. The film is book-ended by two farcical duels, the first of which is a set up.Our anti-hero gets involved in an adolescent love affair with a cousin in Ireland and has to leave suddenly after a duel with a rival who can offer better prospects to her. He gets robbed by an highwayman when fleeing, enlists almost accidentally into the British army, fights in Europe, deserts once, then gets caught and made to fight with the Prussian army where he also later deserts from. Lyndon falls in with unscrupulous companions and gets involved in cheating at card games all over Europe before he marries into wealth. However even that is not enough for him as in his quest to social climb he destroys himself.It is in some ways one of Kubrick's warmest films helped by cinematography all shot by natural light and candlepower that makes it look like a composition from a painting by Constable, Gainsborough or Reynolds. There is sumptuous art direction the only let down is the almost diffident acting from O'Neal, almost placid to each fortune good or bad the befalls him.Ryan O'Neal was a big Hollywood name back in the 1970s but his career soon fizzled out. A competent actor but never really a big enduring star. Just observe him in 'A Bridge too Far' and his scenes with Robert Redford who has a much shorter cameo and you wonder why the roles were not reversed.Maybe Kubrick wanted O'Neal to be aloof and let the supporting characters such as Hardy Kruger, Patrick Magee, Arthur O'Sullivan and Leonard Rossiter to shine. Yet there are elements of comedy in some of the escapades which O'Neal could had taken advantage off and stamped his acting.Despite the beauty of the visuals this film is overlong at 3 hours. It unfolds at a stately pace and Lyndon slowly reveals himself to be venal who only truly cares about his son. He fritters away his wife's fortune in his quest for acceptance by society until his grown up stepson wreaks revenge and for a moment he shows some humanity in the final duel but it is too late for him.Kubrick took a little known Victorian novel and made it exquisite in its sharpness and less of a chocolate box costume drama. Acidic but still heartfelt.",7,2,3,7 July 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Not quite the full picture
","Stanley Kubrick, the eccentric director is lionised by Hollywood. A man who spent the latter part of his life living in London and shooting his films in England despite them being set elsewhere whether it was outer space, some hotel in the mountains of America or in this case a Vietnam war film.Full Metal Jacket arrived with plaudits from the critics. It is a film of two halves, the more interesting part being the first half set at boot camp with a sadistic drill instructor.The second half which is more action orientated, set in Vietnam is less interesting. Why? Because a year earlier we all watched 'Platoon' which swept the big prizes at the Oscars and directed by someone who served in Vietnam.Platoon fully conveyed the anti war message and politics of it all now that some years have passed by since the war ended.The Vietnam films were done better in Platoon and Apocalypse Now. Also these films were at least filmed in a far east location whether it would be the Philippines or Thailand.Full Metal Jacket was filmed in various parts of London dressed up as Vietnam. It shows, the sets do not look authentic, you do not get the feeling you are in the far east and it shows up the limitations of the second half of the story.",6,2,7,31 July 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Vengeance is mine
","Martin McDonagh has directed a clever crime drama with black humour which tips a wink to the Coen brothers, although as a writer McDonagh's screenplay also has some holes which are difficult to gloss over.The Coen brothers link is maintained by a powerful bitter performance from Frances McDormand who plays Mildred whose teenage daughter was murdered almost a year earlier an the police have got nowhere with their investigations.Mildred takes matters into her own hands and creates a spark of incendiary dynamite, by hiring three billboards to shame the Ebbing chief of police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to action. Her action shocks and shames the small town, the local police do not take well to Mildred's action especially as Willoughby is dying of cancer.Hot headed police officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who got away with beating up a black suspect thinks he can bully Mildred, he certainly intimidates the man who rented out the billboards. However he finds that this grieving mother is too hard boiled for him.There is almost a freewheeling style to this film although if you are familiar with McDonagh's previous film, that a lot of it comes together at the end. Despite the bleak subject, there is a lot of humour here as well as tenderness.It is terrifically acted from the main leads, McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson all vying for Oscar nominations.You also get good performances from other actors in smaller roles such as Caleb Landry Jones as Red the advertising agent who rents the billboards out and gets thrown out of the window for his troubles. Also John Hawkes as Mildred's ex husband who left her for a teenage girl.However you also have outward display of brutality from a serving police officer, a man in a bar who beats up an officer and Mildred who shows signs of violence and no one gets arrested.",7,2,5,9 January 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," No home, no job, no peace, no rest
","Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath added a visual imagery and a more upbeat ending to the more grim and downbeat novel.When Bruce Springsteen released the album The Ghost of Tom Joad the inspiration was the cinematic view of the movie and not the book.Henry Fonda is Tom Joad released from prison and discovers that his family have lost their farm along with all the others. The farmers have been hit by the dust bowl and the Joad family pack their old jalopy and head from Oklahoma for California for a better life thinking their is plentiful work as crop pickers. In an arduous journey they see the America of the Depression era 1930s, whole families displaced and getting exploited by landowners exploiting cheap labour and the police protecting them and violently breaking up any dissent by the labourers.The subject matter is certainly forbidding for the time and raw. The references to socialism were toned down by director John Ford but he certainly tackled the exploitation of migrant workers. This is a story of a family trying to stay together against the odds.Henry Fonda gives a sterling performance as Tom Joad a man who realises that he is destined to fight for social justice after his experiences on the road. He is supported by Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, the glue which keeps the family together in the dark days and John Carradine the fallen preacher Jim Casy, a man who lost his faith but as he headed out along Route 66 with the Joads he discovered socialism.",7,0,1,23 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker
","I thought the The Rise of Skywalker made a fitting end of Disney's Star Wars trilogy. It marks the end of the original characters, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo.It also deals with Rey's story and that of Kylo Ren. Destiny and redemption.The evil empire is not quite finished nor are the Sith. Kylo Ren aims to mimic his grandfather and discovers that Palpatine was always in control.Rey and the rebels search for the planet where Palpatine is hiding. It will bring Rey into conflict with Kylo Ren and she will find her true heritage.Although 20 minutes too long, this one is aimed at fans. Well fans who do not use terms like 'Mary Sue' or 'Woke.' Just imagine if there were internet forums back in 1980 when The Empire Strikes Back was released. Hold on what's a black man doing there?There are nods to the past, Lando Calrissian returns, Wedge Antilles flies by. You can even spot Ewoks.There were also poignant moments, Chewbacca's reaction to the death of Leia was rather emotional. Knowing this is likely to be the last time we shall see Hamill and Ford in a Star Wars movie. I am sure there would be more Star Wars movies in the future but this is an end of an era.",7,4,14,16 March 2020
Pacific Rim," Monsters get ready
","Guillermo Del Toro goes 'Mecha-Anime' harking back to the Japanese Kaiju films. It's Godzilla monsters causing mayhem in an updated way.Less cheesy than the Transformers films, in fact maybe a little bit too po-faced here and there. Del Toro delivers enough action, mayhem and destruction in Pacific Rim.The plot is generic. The film is set in the 2020s, when Earth is at war with the Kaijus, colossal monsters from a dimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.To combat the monsters, humanity created the Jaegers; gigantic humanoid mecha's each controlled by at least two pilots who have initial success but the monster keep on returning stronger than ever.Piloting the Jaegers we have standard characters such as a cocky operator, a plucky rookie and a burnt out maverick with bad memories of the past. They put the their differences behind them and learn to work together as the threat the planet face intensifies. Idris Elba is the one who is in charge of them all.There is comic relief from two bickering scientists and more zaniness when Ron Perlman turns up as a gangster.Del Toro provides some added cheese to go with the action and a little depth as well. A few plot holes but the film is still enjoyable fun.",6,0,1,13 February 2014
Lion," The lost child
","Lion is a film of two halves. It starts with the story of 5 year old Saroo in India who with his older brother Guddu tries to make ends meet for his mother by stealing coal from train trucks.One day Saroo pesters his brother to take him to work some distance from their home but Saroo gets tired and falls asleep on a train and ends up in Calcutta, hundreds of miles away from his village. Unable to speak Bengali, unsure of where he is from, his mother's name, he survives with other street children and fend of sexual predators. Saroo is then placed in an orphanage before he is adopted by a well to do Australian couple.In Australia the now grown up Saroo (Dev Patel) haunted by visions of his brother and mother searching for him starts to search for his family, home and identity. The search becomes an obsession, he gives up his job, becomes distant from his adopted parents as he goes through Google Earth looking for clues based on vague childhood memories.Director Garth Davis made the underwhelming television series Top of the Lake in 2013. Here he has a surer touch, maybe because he has a better and more coherent screenplay.The second half of the film is not as strong or powerful as the first half, even clunky in places. Saroo's other adopted brother has emotional problems, it his hinted in the film that some of the kids in the orphanage might had been sexually abused but we never find out why Saroo's adopted brother is the way he is.However the film is well paced and we see the contrast from the tumultuous scenes in India to the more tranquil scenes in Tasmania.",7,1,2,28 January 2017
Ant-Man," That shrinking feeling
","I guess a lot of people thought (me included) that this could be the one Marvel Film that could flop at the box office. Not helped by the late change in director as Edgar Wright walked out after developing the project for years. The marketing of the film also seemed unfocused.The opening part of the film did not hold out much hope. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a down on his luck ex-con. He has recently got out of jail, cannot hold a decent job because of his criminal record. His ex-wife is about to marry a cop and he has trouble getting access to his daughter because he cannot pay child support.His friends persuade to him to take part in a heist and this is when we find out that Lang is just a little more than a cat burglar but someone rather smart, resourceful and cunning. However his efforts in trying to break into an impregnable safe rewards him with just a funny kind of costume. A costume which he discovers has special powers that shrinks him. Lang is arrested when he tries to give the costume back.Lang is contacted in jail by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas.) In an opening flashback we see that he worked for Shield. Now he has been forced out of his company by his own protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) and estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly.) Pym has mastered the technology in developing a suit that shrinks but also has a device that controls ants. He did not want the project to fall into wrong hands. Cross has been developing his own similar project unsuccessfully. His Yellowjacket so far fails to shrink and we soon find out that he will stop at nothing.Pym thinks it is only a matter of time before Cross will succeed and Lang is persuaded to develop his skills with Pym as mentor. Hope who has realised that Cross has gone too far is his trainer. Together with an army of intelligent ants, Lang learns how to shrink and de-shrink in an instance as well as learn how to do combat.Lang teams up with his band of ex-cons to break into Cross's firm and destroy the suit assisted by Hope still in the inside.There is nothing original about Ant Man in the Marvel film universe, well apart from that he shrinks in size and never gets stepped on. It is the usual case of an ordinary guy, who has got the wrong end of the stick in life, develops superpowers via a suit, learns how to use it and goes after the bad guys. This is the initial part of the set up and the film takes it time getting there. It only really finds the right gear in the second half of the film.There is very little else in the plot that will shake you. Hank's protégé is bald so just think Jeff Bridges in Iron Man. Cross immediately is shown to be evil so no surprises there.This leaves with Rudd giving enough of a quirky performance which is mainly the reason why he was cast. He is just right being the every man loser, wanting to do the right thing. He is charming, funny in an understated way and likable, less of a grunt compared to other Marvel Film characters. Of course he needs to be quirky and off beat when the concept is a man that shrinks to an ant.When you see some of the action sequences, especially at the climax, I think it is clear that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish's script elements have been maintained with a big influence from, dare I say Wallace & Gromit. Just look at that scene involving Thomas the Tank Engine.Paul Rudd is ably assisted by Michael Pena and his gang of misfit ex-cons. Douglas is solid as Hank, suspicious of Shield, Cross and ghosts from the past.Although it does not at times feel like a Marvel film their are enough references to Shield and Avengers as well as an Avengers sidekick flying in.It looks like Marvel were right to have faith in Ant-Man as he was punched above his size at the box office.",6,1,4,6 November 2015
21 Jump Street," Hit the heights
","21 Jump Street was a late 1980s/early 90s action based cop show featuring Johnny Depp. A department of youthful looking cops who can mingle amongst young people.The film version goes for laughs with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing mismatched buddies who get recruited by the newly constituted Jump Street because of their youthful looks and go undercover in High School to break a synthetic drugs gang.On paper the film does not sound much, an old forgotten TV series being revived, starring two actors who outside of the USA would not cause much of a stir, Tatum being widely regarded as Mr Wooden.However the synthetic drug must have been put in these guys coffee as both Hill and Tatum give terrific performances.Tatum shows a talent for light comedy and has signs of a personality which have up to now remained hidden.The script is consistently funny and makes you laugh, the direction is very much spot on. The film does not outstay its welcome and even better, they bag star cameos from an original 21 Jump Street member or two.",7,2,3,19 September 2013
American Hustle," Going for the big one
","American Hustle is one of the best acted films in a long time. Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner and Bradley Cooper are all excellent. Also Robert De Niro makes an uncredited cameo as a mobster in flashbacks that makes you think the scenes were lifted out from Goodfellas.The film is a black comedy-drama set in the late 1970's period revolving around the the true life Abscam scandal, where FBI agents and con artists joined up to frame politicians for taking money 'to help grease palms.'It focuses on Bale as an out of shape hustler with bad hair and Amy Adams his soul mate who passes off as an English Aristocrat. They both have been making big money in a scam where they dupe arrangement fees for loans that never materialise.Cooper is the FBI agent with big ambitions and a big ego who wants to go after a bigger catch and more by accident has the mafia in his sights.In the mix is Bale's wayward wife (Lawrence) and stepson. A Mayor of New Jersey (Renner) with a big heart and charisma who has been caught up in the sting operation which Bale feels very guilty about.Directed by David O Russell who has worked with many of the cast before, this is an interesting take on con men and law men.However the film feels flabby, it has plenty of narration which is essentially exposition. The film needed to be leaner, more playful and sharper, the humour is sporadic.You quickly get a good idea that given some of the crooks are shown to be very nice that it is Cooper that might be the one who ends up being the mark. He is arrogant and can be boorish. (Cooper at one point beats up his superior officer who constantly tells him to be careful.)The movie has sassiness from its female leads, quirkiness from Bale and Renner. With De Niro's steely gaze it should had been better than the final product.",6,4,7,6 January 2014
Top Secret!," Skeet shooting
","I wonder if Val Kilmer looks at this film and wonders 'Did I really have hips like that?'The Zucker Abrahams Zucker team spoof the spy film genre but the results are too hit and miss because of the scatter-gun approach by the writers.Set in East Germany which also seems to double for Nazi Germany. Kilmer plays Nick Rivers an Elvis like rock star on a goodwill visit to Eastern Europe taking the place of Leonard Bernstein.Rivers gets caught up in a spy caper to rescue an imprisoned scientist when he meets beautiful Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) a member of the resistance and the daughter of the scientist.The ZAZ team parody films such as The Blue Lagoon and The Man Who Knew Too Much. They also parody the songs of The Beach Boys with an added pro gun motif.The film is sporadically amusing, some nice cameos from Omar Sharif who gets crushed inside a car and Peter Cushing a Swedish book shop owner with a wonky eye.However it is not up to the trio's high standards set in the Airplane films and later in The Naked Gun series.",4,0,4,3 September 2018
Rush," Racing on
","I remember as a kid watching the final race of the 1976 F1 season live on television and the tussle between Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the porung rain.It was only when I was older I realised what Lauda had gone through in the earlier part of the season when he suffered a horrendous crash and burns to his body.Rush is a film about two committed, driven, at times equally infuriating and detestable racers.Lauda the calculating, loner from a business minded family who was a well known strategist. He knew how to set up his racing car.Daniel Brühl captures the spirit of this almost cold, aloof character who will then have to recover from an almost fatal accident and make him appear human, even likable.Chris Hemsworth has the showy role as the wild, erratic, playboy James Hunt.The guy always looking to have a good time partying. He is reckless on the track, Hunt the shunt is his nickname.However Hunt as his own demons and in the 1976 Formula 1 season, he spends most of his time chasing Lauda who had a dominant points tally.Unlike other race films, director Ron Howard did not have to try too hard in getting a thrilling storyline. Real life provided it.Lauda was well ahead in the championship until his accident which allowed Hunt to claw back. Lauda miraculously recovered enough despite his burns and returned to racing and the title went to the final race decider.Both actors capture the spirit of the people they portray. Hunt became well known to racing fans after his retirement as a F1 commentator and Hemsworth does well in getting his vocal mannerisms with maybe just a lapse or two to his Aussie accent.I reckon the film would have little interest to those who despise racing but for others there is plenty of thrills here.",7,1,2,15 February 2014
Predator," An alien in the jungle
","John McTiernan made a good fist of Predator but it was Die Hard where he hit pay dirt with a cracking action film combined with wit, humour, a devious plot and an action man better known for comedy roles.Predator actually starts off in space as a pod heads for earth. Meanwhile Arnie and his crack team of special forces personnel are hired by CIA agent (Carl Weathers) to rescue some hostages which includes an important politician in the Central American jungle.However the CIA have ulterior motives in sending the team. After a firefight with the rebels the team get picked off one by one. It seems something is watching them, something invisible and maybe alien.After the success of Commando and The Running Man, the budgets and production values increased for Arnie action films. Predator shows it on screen with a better and more diverse cast as well including an early acting role for future action film scribe Shane Black.This is a popcorn film with humour, action and teamwork. The latter part of the story pits Arnie against the Predator. Rather prophetically we see even in these early films Arnie having tender scenes with a latino lady.The film is still a little formulaic, a little by the numbers. Apart from Carl Weathers we get little insight to the rest of Arnie's squadron who are shorthand stereotypes. However Arnie did realise after this film that if he was going to conquer the action genre, he needed to show more than his muscles but films with a good script, very good effects and a visionary but also zany action director. His next big action film, Total Recall would certainly deliver the goods.",6,0,3,28 November 2014
Nightcrawler," On the news
","Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) stars in this startling and satirical look at freelance video journalists stalking the streets of Los Angeles searching for disaster footage that he can sell to news stations.Bloom may not have educational qualifications but he is a quick learner, a sociopath with his own code of business and moral ethics. When he observes veteran cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is first on the scene to shoot footage of a car wreck he decides to become a nightcrawler himself.Buying a police scanner and a camcorder, Bloom learns fast and soon hires Rick (Riz Ahmed) a homeless man in need of money to be his driver.Bloom and Rick quickly find footage of accidents and murders, Bloom even cynically manipulates crime scenes and television news producer Nina Romina (Rene Russo) laps the footage up with no questions asked.Gyllenhaal gives an intense performance as Bloom, a plausible personality but really a cynical liar to enrich himself. Ahmed matches him as the nervous Rick, the more humane one knowing he is being manipulated by Bloom.There is some wonderful night photography, the director Dan Gilroy delivers a cynical take on the news media but it really is a character piece than a movie. The storyline leading to the climax was hard to take and felt tagged on to give the film a conclusion.All that speeding about the streets of LA and no police are present are a big much to take as well as disturbing the crime scene and the police take no action.",7,0,0,9 July 2017
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Beauty and a Beat
","This is Spinal Tap is still a landmark mockumentary since its release in 1982. I reckon Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is going to be barely remembered in 10 years time.Adam Samberg's and his Lonely Island team's mockumentary about a white rap boy band, The Style Boyz who split up, then lead singer Conner4real becomes a smash hit celebrity with his debut hit album. However with the follow up album and concert tour, his career nose dives with plunging record sales and publicity mishaps including being naked on stage with a missing todger.The film has real rap/pop star cameos such as Snoop Doddy Dog, Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey, Ringo Starr and others telling the audience how Connor's or The Style Boyz music has changed their lives but the one note joke of this film rapidly wears thin.",5,2,4,14 July 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," These are the days of our lives
","My youngest son who was born years after Freddie Mercury died. He started to sing some Queen songs when he was still a toddler. I knew then that their music was going to live forever. They have joined The Beatles and Abba whose songs transcends generations.A lot about Freddie Mercury is well known. Bohemian Rhapsody brings very little that is new to the table.Credit has to go to Bryan Singer for framing the story from the band's beginnings to their triumphant performance at Live Aid in 1985.I was worried that some white actor would play Freddie Mercury, real name Farouk Bulsara who was of Indian origin. Rami Malek is at least of Egyptian origin.We see young Freddie working at an airport. When a student band loses its lead singer, Freddie offers his services, he could reach some high notes and he dresses extravagantly. When the band has some initial success, he becomes legally Freddie Mercury.The band members have a tumultuous relationship. John Deakins is more normal, Roger Taylor could be temperamental, Brian May had big curly hair and a homemade electric guitar. All of them could write songs and fight to get it on the albums. Together they created a string of hit songs. Some of them catchy: We Will Rock You, others were more extravagant such as Bohemian Rhapsody.Freddie though although he has a girlfriend from the early days of the band is soon struggling with his sexuality. As the band gets bigger, his appetite for a hedonistic lifestyle increases. This includes casual relationships with men and self destructive behaviour that causes further conflicts within the band.Singer knows how to lift the film with Queen songs. He does well to recreate the events of Live Aid which is the point where the band best known songs get pump out.Queen aficionados would know when liberties have been taken with the truth and the timeline of the band.Malek delivers as Freddie, especially with the accent. I thought Joseph Mazzello was good as Deakins. I enjoyed the unrecognisable cameo from Mike Myers as the record head.After Bohemian Rhapsody finished, my wife turned around and said she was really entertained by the movie.",7,3,4,18 January 2019
Bird Box," The Happening
","Netflix produced movies always seem to have a touch of not quiet being the final product about them. A star vehicle of a slightly over the hill star with a third rate script, an expensive bomb sold to Netflix or something low key that might had done well in the independent film circuit.Bird Box has provided them with hype and an Oscar winning star in Sandra Bullock.Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a pregnant woman in a society that has fallen apart as people inexplicably commit suicide.It seems something the victims see causes them to harm themselves.Malorie hooks up with other survivors and shut themselves off from the world.The film goes forward and back in time. In the future, Malorie and two young children, all blindfolded try to find a safe haven. They have a bird box as birds chirp when an alien danger is nearby.You get a sense that in this society that the blind man is king. Like the film A Quiet Place, you sense there is an alien presence. Instead of not making a noise, you need to avoid seeing them.The initial scenes are shocking, horrifying and mesmerising. Then it has all the tropes of a zombie movie as the survivors are holed up and one of the character's is played by John Malkovich and he dislikes everyone.The bits with Malorie and the blindfolded kids did not work for me, it takes a serious leap of logic as to how they got to the river and go whitewater rafting while blindfolded. It is hairraising to do the rapids while you have your eyes open.'If you look, you will die' Mallory sternly tells the two children. It reminded me of David Tennant's tenth Doctor telling people not to blink.Elements of the film is clunky, silly, it does not always add up. Why do some people see the monsters and not top themselves? Instead force others to open their eyes. Surely not all of them can be insane. Madness in people have different layers, here they become the alien entity fan club.Susanne Bier showed she is an interesting and effective director in the BBC television series, The Night Manager. Here she does well with a script that is rather cumbrous and derivative of similar themed films.",6,0,5,6 January 2019
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Here's Robin
","Robin Williams found fame on television with Mork & Mindy but his early foray into movies was hit and miss.Williams had yet to have a vehicle where his brand of humour can go at full flow. Good Morning Vietnam was it. The story is loosely based on the experiences of Armed Forces Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.By playing the DJ, Williams could free-wheel it on the mic, provide laughs and annoy the authorities in this case Bruno Kirby who certainly does not get his humour. He and JT Walsh conspire to get him off the air. These two certainly did not want soldiers to be happy.As the story progresses you get some drama, but it's not quite the horrors of the Vietnam war in the way films such as Platoon would show it.After all this is still a comedy and the drama is secondary.This was Williams movie where he could be anarchic. It started a run of performances in comedy and drama that rewarded him with an Oscar a decade later.",6,1,1,1 August 2013
Hot Rod," Jump over
","Hot Rod is a daft but enjoyable film. Keep your expectations low, have a good time with the stupid stunts and the middle of the road soft rock soundtrack.Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) wants to be like his late father a stuntman who worked with Evel Knievel. However his stepfather Frank (Ian McShane) thinks he is a loser and not really a man. They usually spar where Rod gets the hell beaten out of him, but it is all in good fun. Rod just wants his stepfather's approval.When Frank needs life saving heart surgery, Rod and his friends decide to raise the money by performing a dangerous stunt.Hot Rod is a goofy movie, not too funny but its heart is in the right place.",6,5,8,6 June 2018
Baby Driver," The driver
","Edgar Wright has made a hipper, funkier version of Ryan Gosling's Drive from 2011.Young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) suffers from tinnitus. He uses a pounding beat to drive and he is an ace driver who is working off a debt to crime boss, Doc (Kevin Spacey.) However the audience knows that Doc will never let him go, he is too good and valuable.However you just know things are not going to go well for the cool, laconic baby especially once he falls in love with a waitress in a diner. Doc is using some unstable people in his crew, such as Bats (Jamie Foxx) and hoodlums like him are suspicious of Baby who is just too nice and weird.The film is energetic but it goes off the road in its final act as the story gets more ludicrous.",5,1,3,4 March 2018
Justice League," Falling with style
","You would expect a film with six superheroes would be more exhilarating. With Superman dead, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) senses a brooding darkness on the horizon and wants to assemble a team of people with special powers.Batman already has Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) but he and Alfred seek out the quick as lightning Flash (Ezra Miller) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Cyborg, Victor Stone (Ray Fisher) who after some bickering become part of the Justice League. They do battle with the alien Steppenwolf who is looking to reclaim three hidden mother boxes that will give him untold powers.One of the boxes is in the human world and Cyborg calculates that the power in the box could re-awaken Superman.The film just lacks the fun factor. Steppenwolf joins a long line of dull CGI villains. Victor Stone and Aquaman were flat with only Flash having a spark.When it came to the fight scenes everyone is flying around although as I heard one critic remark, they were really falling with style as in the original Toy Story.At least the film brings back a snatch of the John Williams Superman theme as well as the Michael Keaton Batman theme.",6,0,3,22 November 2017
Man of Steel," Should had soared higher
","I always felt that Superman: The Movie was the first proper superhero film and here was a movie that married the comic strip action with sufficient amount of humour. It helped that Christopher Reeves was perfectly cast.It was a shame that Warner Bros has treated the franchise so haphazardly over the years, although they were not helped by the Salkinds.Here is the rebooted Man of Steel, aided and abetted by the people who bought you the rebooted Batman films.Well Man of Steel has done well at the box office, whether it has kids running around believing they can fly is another matter.It starts of so seriously, portentously even. We begin in Krypton, we have Clark Kent having flashbacks coming to terms with his powers and then when he finally displays them to the world at large, General Zod turns up.The first half of the film takes time to get going. The second half is action upon action as the Man of Steel takes on his nemesis.The action scene were over long as I soon got bored with the Transformers type of destruction as Superman takes on his enemies. I would say it was done with more verve and style in Superman 2.It was a good movie but it should had been better. It needed the swirling Superman theme from John Williams. A bit more comic book humour and you really are left wondering what room is there for Clark Kent in the rest of the film series as so much is known about the Man of Steel to the world at large.",6,1,3,11 August 2013
The Caine Mutiny," In the navy
","The Caine Mutiny is regarded as a classic thriller of a mutiny aboard a naval ship in World War II that turns into a court room saga. In fact 'A Few Good Men' is really an updated remake.The destroyer Caine is a small creaky old ship whose rather relaxed captain is replaced by Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) a disciplinarian. As time goes on he upsets both his officers and crew and shows signs of paranoia, stress and even cowardice.Lieutenant Thomas Keefer (Fred MacMurray) who was a writer before being called up notices the signs of mental illness and tries to convince Executive Officer Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) to do something about it. Maryk refuses at first but finally takes over command when in a storm Queeg nearly capsizes the ship.Maryk and some of the other officers stand trial for mutiny and they are reluctantly defended by Lieutenant Barney Greenwald (Jose Ferrer) only after other military lawyers have turned them down.Of course it is not going to take much for Greenwald to expose Queeg's instability, under intense pressure Queeg takes out his stress balls. However Greenwald reserves his ire after the trial on Keefer for engineering the mutiny so one day he can publish a book about it and Maryk as well as others for not helping Queeg when he asked for help and it was clear he had seen too much of war.The film loses focus often when it concentrates on an irrelevant love story between an Ensign and his girlfriend. The film also has an uneven tone, not helped by the musical score.However Bogart delivers another 'against type' performance. His Queeg starts out confidently before spiralling downwards. There is solid support from Van Johnson and Fred McMurray whose character really is cynical and slippery, therefore rightly exposed at the end of the movie.",6,3,5,10 May 2017
Radio," Radio Flyer
","In Tropic Thunder, Robert Downey tells Ben Stiller that he went full retard for a film role and you must never go full retard.Maybe advice Cuba Gooding Jr should have heeded as he plays a young mentally challenged black man in a South Carolina small town in the mid 1970s, who spends his days pushing a shopping trolley, being fascinated by radios and comes on the radar of High School Sports Coach Jones who spends time with him and gets him to help out at the school and not be an outsider being ignored. He gets adopted as the school's mascot and gains acceptance after some initial resistance from a few of the students.Radio is based on the true story of Robert 'Radio' Kennedy. Its a formulaic film but has winning performances from Ed Harris, Alfre Woodard and Debra Winger. Cuba's performance divided opinions, although he is an Oscar winning actor, he seemed to be too immersed in the role without giving any other light or shade. Gooding has been criticised for some of his broad comedy films in the past and maybe this was an attempt to address this criticism and re-establish his serious acting credentials.The film is sentimental and maybe too saccharine and does lack depth as well but you cannot deny it is heartwarming.",5,1,2,25 August 2014
The Thing," Who is who
","John Carpenter remade Howard Hawks 1951 sci-fi film, The Thing From Another World.The film starts in the icy plains of Antarctica as a man in a helicopter is try to shoot dead a runaway dog. The dog survives as it reaches a base where some American scientists reside, the Norwegians in the helicopter do not.The dog is in fact The Thing, a being from outer space that arrived in a space ship some 100,000 years ago and remained buried in the ice in Antarctica. It looks like the Norwegian base camp uncovered it to their cost. The Thing can ingest and then assume the form of any living being whether human or animal.In some ways John Carpenter's film is similar to Alien as the members of the base camp will be knocked off one by one, not helped that they seemed to be left alone or go out on their own too many times so they can be taken over by the shape shifting creature.The film actually starts out slowly and the characters are painted in broad strokes, in short thin characterizations. There are no female characters in this film but there are two black actors in the cast, one rather stereotypical who seemed to have walked in straight from the hood listening to Stevie Wonder. Rather a few of the characters including star Kurt Russell did not convince me that they were research scientists.What the film did have was gross out special effects that would had scared the hell out of people in 1982, it certainly scared me in that era. Stretchy body parts churned inside out, gore galore, hands being severed, a head sprouting legs and walking off like a spider.What you get in grotesque special effects you lose in a coherent narrative. The film failed at the box office when the film was released but later acquired a cult following.",6,1,4,16 September 2016
The Revenant," Pain and Glory
","The Revenant is based on true incidents. It is a rough hewn and visceral film of survival and revenge.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass a member of a fur trapping expedition escaping native Indians and who is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear. Gravely injured, a small party is left behind to care for him which includes his half Indian son and callous John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy who dislikes Glass and especially his son.After some time Fitzgerald leaves Glass for dead and kills his son and goes off to rejoin the main party. Glass does not die and wants vengeance.The film was shot in natural light and has wonderful cinematography, the CGI bear attack was very well done. Director Alejandro Iñárritu is on a high after his best Director Oscar win for Birdman last year.However looking at this, I just felt it was a well made, sturdy but overwrought and lengthy revenge flick. In fact with a heavily male cast I regarded this film as a box office risk, one of the only major female characters that it does have is seen to be getting raped.This is a gruelling picture of survival in harsh conditions but strangely empty despite the pained performances from DiCaprio and Hardy.I actually found when Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) set out to apprehend Fitzgerald at the end rather laughable as it was so incompetently done. Not only was Fitzgerald allowed to escape from the fort as he was not guarded, nor was the money which was also stolen by him but he does not take a garrison with him when searching for Fitzgerald. It was a rather blunt attempt by the script to have a final fact to face showdown by the two protagonists.",6,3,5,19 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with the film
","A supposed novelty, Clint Eastwood is directed by Robert Lorenz who makes his directorial debut but he his a longtime Malpaso associate of Eastwood having served as a Producer in several films.However it's likely as in other Eastwood films where there has been a nominal director, that Eastwood calls the actual shots.Since Escape from Alcatraz in 1979, it is only been acclaimed director Wolfgang Petersen who has properly directed Eastwood in a movie, 'In the line of fire.'In City Heat from 1985, Eastwood had a cool and troubled relationship with its director, Richard Benjamin who seems to have control of the film.The Trouble with the Curve is about an ageing baseball scout, struggling in a world where others use computer software to track prospects. Because of his failing eyesight he reluctantly teams up with his rather distant daughter who unveils some deep issues with her father as the movie progresses.They travel together looking at new talent from the college leagues and tagging along is Justin Timberlake playing a generic love interest who disappears at the latter part of the film and the suddenly reappears at the end.It is all amiable, Eastwood with even more of a gravelly voice now he is in his 80s plays the curmudgeonly scout who is going out of fashion to be replaced the likes of Matthew Lillard and their shaggy dog computer projections.Amy Adams, Eastwood's daughter is a hot shot lawyer who works all hours including Saturdays for the last 7 years so she can make partner for her law firm.The firm admits early on that they have never had a female partner in the firm ever. It is details like this which highlights serious flaws in the film.So in a USA that has a black President, had three female Secretary of States, one of which was also black. Amy Adams hot shot lawyer cannot recognise a sex discrimination case punching her in the face, repeatedly by this misogynistic firm.She also later reveals to her father that she has been seeing a shrink for years because her father used to abandon her as a child. This all depends on a plot point where she has totally forgotten a traumatic childhood incident.We have a hot shot hitter who never seems to have ever faced a curve ball in his life.A Hispanic peanut guy who can throw a mean pack of peanuts to the hot shot hitter. I wonder if this will be relevant later on?Especially as the hot shot hitter is such a jerk. Why has no one ever thrown him a curve ball just to make sure he does not have trouble with it?It is sort of a film with a weak script that has not properly been thought through.The personality of the actors carry it through despite its flaws. Being from the UK, I know little about baseball or else I would probably have seen more plot holes.Eastwood does not stretch himself too much, Adams does her best with her character and she is the one who provides heart to this flawed film.",5,0,1,15 September 2013
Bridge of Spies," Getting across the wall
","Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.",6,0,1,21 January 2017
Split," Multiplicity
","M Night Shyamalan's Split starts with three teenage girls being kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) who traps them in a dungeon of some kind. The girls do plot to escape but get caught, they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable, where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs.",5,3,12,8 April 2017
Little Miss Sunshine," On the road to the sun
","When American films want to examine itself, it tends to do better as Independent films. This is a film about a dysfunctional family with an all star cast but Abigail Breslin as Olive is the centre holding this film together.Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is an overworked mother of two kids in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Her brother Frank (Steve Carell) is a scholar who is depressive over a failed loved affair with a male student and has tried to commit suicide. He is temporarily living with the family.Sheryl's husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) wants to be a motivational speaker although he seems to have had no business success on his own accord to be such a speaker.Her 17 year old son Dwayne (Paul Dano) has been on a vow of silence for some months and will remain so until he becomes an air force pilot.Richard's father, Edwin (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed drug user who is also staying with them after being kicked out of a retirement home. He is close with Olive his 7 year old granddaughter.The film is essentially a slapstick comedy road drama as they head for California so Olive can enter the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest.Along the way they encounter mishaps, tragedy but also bond as a family especially when the camper van breaks down and needs to be pushed started each time.The screenplay won an Oscar and after nominations stretching back several decades, Alan Arkin won the best supporting actor Oscar.The ensemble cast really bring the characters to life and bounce off each other. Although they are dysfunctional and there may be occasional conflicts, they are there for each other and work together to pull through.This is highlighted in the beauty contest when Olive's performance turns out to be a little too daring and the others join in.These themes about families have been touched on other films but Little Miss Sunshine is more successful.",7,0,0,11 March 2014
Doctor Zhivago," The scale is epic but it does not have the reach
","Omar Sharif had a terrific run of films in the 1960s. An Arab Prince, A Russian Poet, A Nazi investigator, Genghis Khan, A Spanish priest, An American Jew, An Argentine revolutionary. He deserves to be known more than just as a Bridge player and a playboy. Sharif was a Muslim Arab actor who knew no bounds.Doctor Zhivago based on Boris Pasternak's epic novel is set before and during World War 1, then during and after the Russian Revolution.The focus is on the illicit love story between two people who are already married. Doctor Yury Zhivago (Omar Sharif) a poet and doctor. A supporter of revolution and critical of the course it has taken. Pretty Lara (Julie Christie) sweet, young and innocent but involved with wealthy despicable patron Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger.)Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is a hot headed revolutionary who marries Lara but falls in love with the iron fist of post revolution Russia.Yury a married man is drawn to Lara. He connects with her in various points of their lives. The story is told by Yury's half brother who is searching for the daughter both them had.There is an epic grandeur and scale by David Lean. The story is episodic and some of the story is clunky, even flawed and confusing.Christie is beautiful, Sharif is great, Steiger is magnetic and Courtenay shines. Guiness though is a bit stiff. Lean aimed high and missed but it is an honorable failure.",6,1,3,4 January 2019
U-571," It is an enigma
","I guess somewhere in the pitch for this movie. There was an attempt to replicate the tense atmosphere of Das Boot with a true life story.The film takes place in 1942, a US submarine is in the Atlantic looking for a stricken German U-boat.Posing as a German supply crew, they plan to board the U-571 and steal the Enigma machine, the device the Nazis used to send coded messages.The film ends with the director putting on a title card dedicating the film to the memory of the real sailors who captured Enigma machines who were British sailors to be more exact, something this film glosses over.Historical accuracy and this film are total strangers.However this is not to say the film is entertaining, it is well made, McConaughey does his bland best but is out-blanded by Jon Bon Jovi.Stern support is provided by Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel.",5,2,4,4 August 2013
American Beauty," An American Tale
","This debut film from Sam Mendes won the Best Picture Oscar.A quasi comedy-drama about middle America, Kevin Spacey stars plays Lester Burnham, who has a mid-life crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari).Annette Bening is his materialistic wife, who has fallen out of love with him and is having an affair. Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter who at first plays second fiddle with the more beautiful and forward Angela, but later finds solace with their new neighbour played by Wes Bentley.At first she finds Wes strange as he keeps trying to photograph her. Chris Cooper is his militaristic father who is a stern disciplinarian but seems to have deep personal issues of his own.When I saw American Beauty upon its release I did not think much of it and I note its reputation seems to have declined over the years.Like a lot of Best Oscar picture winners in recent years, some people think it was undeserving of the top prize.Strangely, after re-watching this film after a number of years I have revised my rating upwards. Maybe it is because I am now older along with now older children. I viewed this film differently and interpreted the story with differing nuances.Spacey is probably in a rare role where he is likable. He realises that his life is in a mess, besotted by a nubile college girl, trapped in a loveless marriage and lost his job.However he is trying to improve himself, working out and staying optimistic but fate has a different story for him.The themes in this film will vary at different points in your life. If you are middle aged with teenage children it might even be unnerving.",7,1,3,21 November 2013
The Alamo," Under Siege
","Texan John Lee Hancock certainly has the name to direct this revisionist epic but it lacks the bluster, hysterics of the liberties with the truth John Wayne production. Instead it is a prosaic and po faced film that feels too long and when the action finally comes you are reminded of Zulu and at one point you even sense Michael Caine will enter the Alamo shouting at the Mexicans not to fire any more cannons.Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) is a man living up to his legend but offered a monetary incentive of land and political power to fight for an independent Texas which at the time was held by Mexico. General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) is a boorish drunk politician organising a land grab, Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) is ill with TB but swaggers with an out-sized knife. Lt Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson) the earnest military leader who needs to earn respect from his troops.The film by wanting to flesh out its main characters ends up making the narrative choppy. As we wait for the epic battle, it just feels like an interminable hiatus but the film never misses a trick to show up Crockett as epic. If I had spotted him playing the fiddle I would had taken a pot shot at him.The Mexican leader is portrayed as an arrogant cartoon villain but the film's big mistake is not to include the history of Texas and give the audience who are not versed with American history some kind of potted history lesson of the lone star state that was not part of the USA and under Mexican control who as far as they were concerned were well within their rights to keep control of it.The film has tremendous sets and art direction, it tries to address the issue of slavery, the irony that Mexico abolished slavery and the whites wanted independence so they could maintain it. You see Bowie's slave thinking for a moment that he might had been set free and the film ignores the fact that other heroes in this movie were also slave owners.",3,1,4,31 January 2016
Judgment at Nuremberg," The legacy of war
","With a star studded cast and a very long running time, this is a philosophical but fictionalised account of the Nuremberg trials inspired by true events.Once the more infamous Nazis have been tried and prosecuted, it is the turn for the more lesser known suspects. Spencer Tracy as lead Judge Dan Haywood presides over the trial of four judges who have been charged with war crimes as they implemented the laws of the Nazi regime. These include enforcing laws of racial purity and sterilising undesirables such as the feeble minded.Burt Lancaster plays a renowned jurist Ernst Janning whose activities baffle Dan Haywood as his work on the law is so well respected.In the background of rising tensions between the Americans and the Russians with the developing Cold War, there is a ferocious courtroom battle between prosecuting attorney, Colonel Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) who relentlessly badger the witnesses.Lawson who liberated one of the concentration camps holds the entire nation responsible for the atrocities, yet his own actions at the courtroom are cynical. Rolfe is more pragmatic about any other nation trying to claim a moral high ground. As he tells Janning, the Americans dropped a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima that killed countless women and children.Judge Haywood tries to understand himself about the German people during the war, he mingles with locals and gets to know a widow, Frau Bertholt played by Marlene Dietrich. Her own husband was executed by the Nuremberg trials but she insists that many Germans had no idea about the holocaust. However Haywood is troubled about the Nazi atrocities, those who were enablers and other who turned a blind eye to it.Director Stanley Kramer keeps this long film enthralling, some of the court cases are vignettes allowing actors such as Montgomery Cliff and Judy Garland to give short memorable performances.Maximilian Schell gets the more emotional role as the defence lawyer and at times he gets to chew the scenery but he also won a best actor Oscar. Burt Lancaster is more restrained as Janning, he hardly speaks for most of the film but his face is solemn and stern. A man who has realised he did wrong by condemning some of his own people to death and now has to pay the price for just following orders.",7,1,5,9 June 2017
Dangal," Going for gold
","Dangal is the name of a wrestling competition in India. Former wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) discovers that his two daughters have a natural skill in grappling as they beat up two boys who were teasing them.So he decides to train them as wrestlers and enter them into wrestling competitions where they have to fight others boys as competition for girls did not exist. In the face of ridicule his daughters impress the onlookers with their strength and skill.Dangal inspired by films such as Rocky and The Karate Kid have training montages set to music, a stern father who coaches them to a strict rigorous schedule. The father then loses his daughters to a national coach who trains the daughters for international competitions but gets the girls to unlearn what their father has taught them which causes a crisis of confidence.The film has good performances from actresses Fatima Sana Shaikh (Geeta Phogat) and Sanya Malhotra (Babita) who looks to have done a lot of intense training for their roles. Aamir Khan's character is too one-note with very little shade to his performance and I think the film suffers as a result along with the long running time which is par for the course with Hindi films.This is an inspiring film of the rise of female wrestling in a patriarchal society as the now young women enter the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and go for gold with their father helping them from the sidelines much to the irritation of the Indian team coach. The film is based on true events.",6,0,0,2 May 2018
Heartbreak Ridge," Marine Issue
","Heartbreak Ridge stars Clint Eastwood who also produced and directed.Although now a two time Oscar winning Director. The difference in production values is obvious from this and the more recent Flags of our Fathers.Heartbreak Ridge would had got the nod from Warner Brothers because it would be relatively low budget with Eastwood the highest paid star doubling as director and it shows in the production values.The film was an oddity for its time. War films were the rage in the mid 1980s but they were introspective as they looked back at Vietnam more critically.Eastwood plays Gunny Highway the tough, no nonsense marine sergeant who has to get his unit back in shape. He also hopes to rekindle romance with his ex wife.Mario Van Peebles plays the cocky black guy who is irritating because that is the way he is written but was designed to attract the urban hip crowd for the time who dug Eddie Murphy films.The film was known for its swearing at the time of its release, this would now be considered to be mild. It's rather hokey, predictable and overlong.The marines come of age when they have to invade Grenada to rescue some hostages. The action sequences cannot come quick enough. This is a typical Eastwood film for its time where he makes an action picture for the masses but also trying to say something else but the message is still rather gung ho.However Eastwood had plans to direct Birdy and White Hunter, Black Heart over the next few years, they were films aimed for critical acclaim.",4,2,2,2 October 2013
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The sweet (non) smell of success
","Walk Hard is a parody of musical biopics such as Ray and Walk the Line. Dewey Cox is mostly based on Johnny Cash.Dewey Cox (John C Reilly) is a poor farm boy growing up in Alabama. In 1946 as a child, Dewey accidentally chops his brother Nate in half with a machete while they were playing. You knew this would happen as his brother took part in dangerous activities while proclaiming he would live to a ripe old age.This incident causes a rift with his father who keeps telling Dewey that the wrong son died and Dewey loses his sense of smell.As a teenager, Dewey gains notoriety for playing the devil's music and he leaves town to make his own way at the age of 14 with his 12 year old girlfriend Edith (Kristen Wiig.)Dewey gets his big break in a black nightclub where they play music to have sex to, as Dewey replaces the main singer at the last minute. The Hasidic Jewish record executives at the show get him an audition with a record producer where Dewey suddenly pulls out a hit song.As the years go by Dewey tries to deal with his childhood trauma by taking a wide variety of drugs even though his drummer pleads with him not to try them. He also never pays for the drugs.Dewey has an affair with his backing singer Darlene (Jenna Fischer) who he marries while still being married to Edith. Dewey later finds out he had lots of children.As tastes change Dewey tries different musical genres to stay relevant, there is even a trippy, hippy animated pert in India with the Beatles.Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan, this is one of the better spoofs as it tries to be fresh and avoid lazy retreads which a lot of post Zucker Abrahams Zucker parodies has done.Reilly is very convincing as Dewey Cox because he plays it straight, you would actually think Dewey is a real country music star which is actually alluded to in the post credit sequence.The Beatles sequence with the bad scouse accents was the most fun. It certainly is an entertainingly silly spoof and there are a lot of star cameos.",6,0,0,13 October 2017
We're the Millers," We are drug smugglers
","National Lampoon's Drug Mule Vacation could be an alternative title as it has the vacation vibe.A small time, nice guy drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) is forced to smuggle drugs by his boss and lookalike (Ed Helms).Sudeikis has the idea that posing as a happy family might not invite suspicion at the border crossing and persuades his neighbour who is a stripper (Jennifer Aniston.) A homeless teenager as his daughter and a nerdy boy (Will Poulter) to be his son and off they go in a RV.The film is sporadically funny thanks more to Poulter although there does not seem to be much road comedy.The plot comes to life after the drugs have been picked up with the predictable double cross. Then it becomes a chase film with the added bonding issues with the 'family'. After an abrasive start they seem to act like an actual family.Sudeikis does comedy with his sarcasm. His character is supposedly a rebel but just looks like a nerdy slacker who never became a bank manager and has no business living in a low rent, rough neighbourhood.Aniston does a few sexy scenes and there seems to be a budding romance between them.British actor Poulter is the revelation who takes this film by the scruff of the neck and it is funny enough to make you laugh along the way.",6,0,1,14 January 2014
Disturbia," On the lookout
","Disturbia is an updated teen remake of Rear Window. With an eye on the slacker humour market, director D J Caruso fails to make it tense or exciting or thrilling. It is not the first movie where a horny teenager thinks he has a suspicious neighbour but this is a poor one.Kale (Shia LaBeouf) has not got over the car accident that killed his father. A year later, Kale lashes out at his Spanish teacher and is sentenced to 3 months under house arrest with an electronic tag on his leg.Out of boredom Kale starts to spy on his neighbours. The sexy teen Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who is soon attracted to him. However Kale notices that creepy neighbour Mr Turner (David Morse) is acting suspicious at a time when there are news reports of a serial killer at large. Kale thinks he has seen Mr Turner kill a young woman at the house and he is now showing an interest in dating Kale's mother.Kale, Ashley and school friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) investigate him but Robert soon becomes suspicious that he is being watched.This is a limp hackneyed thriller that is slow to get going and then goes off the rails at the climax. The director thinks we would be more interested in teenagers hooking up or even worse Kale doing stupid things such as chasing after some kid pranksters so he keeps breaching the conditions of his house arrest.",3,5,5,28 July 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Zonked Right Out On Life
","Silver Linings Playbook is a touching, moving love story about two damaged people who find love and try to get over their past trauma.The big plus is that the film is a well acted ensemble piece. The negative is that it is never going to be a true portrayal of mental illness.We meet Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) when his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) takes him away from a mental health hospital after eight months. The doctors do not think he is ready to be released and initially you think they are correct. Despite Pat's positive outlook he is still affected by the memories of his disintegrating marriage. He found his wife in the shower with her lover who he then beat up. Pat was hospitalised as part of his plea bargain. A certain Stevie Wonder song still sets him off.His father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) himself has some OCD, he is gambling in order to buy a restaurant. Despite hitting rock bottom, a friend introduces Pat to a widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence.) Tiffany married young and her husband who was a cop died young. She is volatile, depressed and is dealing with her pain by having frequent casual sex. It starts off well with a discussion on various medications they have been prescribed.Both begin an acerbic relationship, which becomes tender as they practice for a dance contest. Pat still needs to come to terms with his relationship with his ex wife. Pressure mounts as Patrizio has laid a big bet based on the outcome of the dance contest.Writer/director David O Russell probably knows what it is like to be manic. Actor George Clooney made it known how appalled he was with O Russell's on set behaviour in the film Three Kings. This was not an isolated incident. The film is a funny, touching, gritty drama. It has comedy and feels heartfelt of people pulling together to help each other out.",7,3,5,2 October 2018
Divergent," Testing times
","Twilight found a teen female audience. The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less.",3,3,5,25 July 2014
Ender's Game," Ender of the road
","Starship Troopers was a right wing book subverted by a left wing film-maker. The Ender's Game books are similarly conservative themed books which should had a radicalized left leaning interpretation. What we get is Harry Potter meets The Hunger Games via Starship Troopers (PG rated.)Harrison Ford sleepwalks through this film, then again he has been sleepwalking in his films since Air Force One. Ben Kingsley turns up as a tattooed Maori with cod Yoda leanings.The film relies on some gifted kid fighters in a training academy using simulation battles in preparation to launch an assault on the planet of the alien invaders.The fact that some of the kids live in a regimented environment where bullying is common place just like the regular army makes you think what sort of kids were being recruited by Harrison Ford and Co. Ender is the only one who shows sign of actually engaging a tactical brain seems to be lost on the other bullies whose response to losing to a better boy is to lash out. It actually makes the people running the entire academy look like a bunch of incompetents when there is a looming alien threat.There are some good special effects, Asa Butterfield shows spirit as Ender but this is a franchise that is not going very far.",4,8,15,14 March 2014

However when they encounter Muriel, an evil witch they learn of their own childhood traumas and about white witches that reveal the real reason they might have been left abandoned in the forest.The film has enough gory action, good CGI, low running time and some humour.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Hunt and the Syndicate
","Its 19 years since the first Mission Impossible movie and Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is no longer fresh faced he once was.Now in its fifth instalment Rogue Nation is not as portentous as MI:2 and like the Bond franchise Cruise as Producer knows what makes his MI films tick. The downside is we have lost the individual elements that directors like Brian De Palma and John Woo brought in the earlier films.Rogue Nation sees IMF agent Ethan Hunt going after a shadowy criminal organization known as the Syndicate who in a turnaround catch him and he escapes with the help of a Syndicate member Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson.) The IMF have now been disbanded thanks to the CIA Director played by Alec Baldwin and the rest of the team Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames go on a globe trotting pursuit to try to outsmart the Syndicate and be one step ahead of the CIA.Like the fourth instalment with its landmark set piece of Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa this one sees Cruise hanging on a plane. I presume he was aided by being on wires that was later digitally removed rather just hanging on with his hands as the plane took off for his own insurer's sake.There is a nice opera set piece set in Austria but it did remind me of something similar done by Bond in Quantum of Solace a few years earlier as well as the opera backdrop being an important element for the climax of The Godfather III.More novel was the set piece in Casablanca as Hunt dives underwater to change a profile key so Pegg can gain access to a digital safe. However writer/director Christopher McQuarrie surely missed a trick by not recycling lines from the film Casablanca. Not even a 'round up the usual suspects' dialogue somewhere!Pegg again provides the comic relief, Renner and Rhames get to spar with each other as they meet for the first time in this movie. Ferguson is efficient enough as the mischievous spy being used by the Syndicate and MI5. The film also reunites the cast of the BBC comedy Rev with Simon McBurney playing the Intelligence Head and Tom Hollander playing the British Prime Minister.Sean Harris is chilling enough as the villainous Solomon Lane but the MI films never seem to have had memorable villains apart from the first one which was for all the wrong reasons given how they urinated over a much loved character from the original television series.This is a solid and enjoyable continuation of a film series admired by critics and the public. However I do think for the sixth film Cruise needs to hire a director who might inject some quirky individuality.",7,3,8,5 August 2015
Dark City," Not Neo Enough
","Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch in this grungy science fiction thriller which has the look of a 1940s Film Noir. Murdoch lives in a vast dark city which is no to dissimilar to Batman's Gotham City. Murdoch might also be a murderer but he really is not sure of his memories.The city is overrun by the Strangers, a ghostly and bald alien race with special powers that live in human cadavers. They want to understand humanity. They are helped by a human scientist (Kiefer Sutherland) who extracts memories from people and injects them into other human bodies. Murdoch was given the mind of a serial killer but something went wrong.Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is looking for a serial killer preying on prostitutes and Murdoch might be his man. Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly) is the wife looking for her missing husband. However the Strangers want to get hold of Murdoch but he seem to be very resistant and could even expose the heart of this city where it never seems to get light.The film came out a year before The Matrix but it is the latter film that hit the big box office jackpot. The Matrix had zeitgeist this has not. The film feels to derivative and lacks freshness. The interior setting in a place where it is always night just looks like a big movie sound stage not matter how dazzling the art direction which are inspired by Edward Hopper paintings and German Expressionist cinema.Proyas does create wonderful visuals which are now without interest but they have now aged. The editing is too choppy because when the reveal arrives it is straightforward but the director made the film convoluted to keep the mystery going.",6,1,3,13 July 2016
Dunkirk," Lacks an emotional core
","In Mrs Miniver the film had a propaganda even jingoistic elements that inhabited its story and characters.Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece but the story lacks an emotional core despite having excellent actors such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance. At one point I thought where is Hardy?The film is set in a nonlinear fashion and unlike Saving Private Ryan, director Christopher Nolan has eschewed blood and gore.Set in 1940 thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk waiting to be picked up and sailed back to Britain. We focus on Tommy, a young soldier who has survived a German ambush. He meets another young soldier called Gibson on the beach, who is burying a dead body and says little. They try to make their way onto a ship by acting as stretcher bearers and taking a wounded man aboard a hospital ship. We see these two young men just wanting to survive and each time they meet with some unforeseen event.Dunkirk shows the evacuation from land, sea, and air. Rylance plays a small boat fisherman who along with his son and another young boy are sailing to Dunkirk to pick up survivors. They have already picked one up along the way who is heavily shell shocked. Yet his story is hampered by an appalling side plot of a young man injured and wanting his old school to know that he did something important.As the film has little dialogue, Nolan wants to create atmosphere and suspense through its visuals and music. In that sense it only partly succeeds because the film lacks dramatic impact.",6,1,1,16 December 2017
The Intouchables," Chasing the clouds away
","I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.The film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together.",6,1,2,9 June 2019
Ratatouille," Rat in mi kitchen
","Ratatouille had a troubled history despite Brad Bird getting the screenwriter and director credit as well as taking the Best Oscar for Animation. The original director was (Czech born) British Oscar winning animator Jan Pinkava who only now gets a story co-credit for this this film. His vision apparently needed to be Pixar-fied.Yet underlying this movie is Pinkava's vision, when the story gets boring and predictable I see Hollywood at play as the film gets derivative, you know joining the dots from A-Z.Maybe the dirty smelly scavenging rats represent humans with Remy being the most well read and cultured example. Remy does not want to go through rubbish every night he wants to cook and is inspired after taking legendary chef, the late Auguste Gusteau's cookbook, 'Anyone Can Cook.'Remy rises from the sewers of Paris to Gusteau's restaurant where he sees Gusteau's ghost or is it a figment of the rat's imagination? The restaurant is now run by head chef Skinner who believes in the commercialisation of Gusteau's name.Remy hides under the hat of the incompetent, bumbling Linguini new to the kitchen and shows him how to cook by pulling his curly hair, fellow chef Collete teaches him the basic but it is Remy who provides the inspiration that wows the customers and arouses the interest of renowned and intimidating food critic Anton Ego who took one of the stars away from Gusteau. Skinner is also suspicious of Linguini's skills, in fact he smells a rat.This is a breezy film, with rats in the kitchen cooking the food rather than taking it away although we do see that as well. The love angle is boring and predictable as are the few obligatory chase scenes in the streets and river of Paris. Yet I could not help wondering how Pinkava's film would had turned out.",6,0,0,11 December 2016
Bad Teacher," Lessons is life
","Bad Teacher is a wannabe amoral tale about Cameron Diaz playing a selfish character.The Bad Teacher of the film who puts less than minimum effort, does not care about her students and is looking to marry a rich guy.However when she gets dumped she returns to teaching to earn enough money to enlarge her boobs and get another rich guy to marry.Of course despite Diaz doing her best we cannot care about such a character and end up sorry for her pupils who have to watch endless films on television during lessons.Justin Timberlake turns up as a shallow nerd who is descended from a rich family but his character is just pointless.Lucy Punch is the nemesis and provides spirited resistance to the bad teacher and be the foil but you know she will get beaten to the punch by the end of the film.Jason Segel has a small role as a laconic gym teacher. The schoolchildren are the usual mix of geeks and cool kids but the film is a one note idea.A few laughs, some sexy scenes such as Diaz washing cars save this from being a bad film. At least there is redemption with Diaz finding out she is better at counselling than teaching.",4,1,3,7 February 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Empty hearted web slinger
","Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his powers comes responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong. The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield. A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films.",5,2,4,29 August 2014
The Lego Movie," Toys are for pleasure not Lord Business
","My son has been raving about this film for months including singing THAT song.When I initially got around to watch it I dozed off, granted I was tired. I decided to re-watch it later when I was more refreshed. Looked at a different perspective the film was better and less annoying.I could never fathom how they made an animated film about Lego. The whole idea sounds bizarre on paper. Its actually lo-fi CGI with added inventiveness. So a clone worker is suddenly mixing it up with Batman, Gandalf and Han Solo (all legoised) as well as fighting the evil Lord Business.The film then switches track with its underlying message that kids just want to have fun with toys and play with them rather than dad having a prized collection, all neat and tidy. Something I might be guilty of myself according to my offspring!",5,6,9,19 February 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," All the drugs you need
","The early day of AIDS dramas in the mid 1980s concerned the effect of the disease in heterosexual or covert bi-sexual men.Look at the BBC television film from 1986 such as 'Sweet as you are' starring Liam Neeson where he gets HIV after an one night stand with another woman.It was only in later years that we had films dealing with AIDS and the homosexual community, epitomised by film's such as Philadelphia.Dallas Buyers Club focuses on Ron Woodroof an electrician and a hustler on the rodeo scene. He is also heterosexual. You clearly shown early on with his buddies that he is a casual racist and homophobic. He is diagnosed with HIV and given one month to live.The film is set in the mid 1980s just about the time Rock Hudson died of AIDS although the film deals less with the period setting but more with attitudes of that time.Matthew McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof. From the very beginning he looks gaunt and ill. This is an actor lost in rom-com mediocrity until he snapped back in Magic Mike and let loose.He goes one better here holding centre stage as he deals with the rejection from friends and is denied drugs that can help him. The role gave him a best actor Oscar win.Woodruff soon becomes a hustler for alternative HIV drugs as he forms the Dallas Buyers Club which dispenses these drugs for a monthly subscription whilst evading the drug regulators. He becomes an ally of the gay community.Jared Leto is a transsexual also suffering from AIDS who befriends Woodruff and helps him sell the medicine.Both actors deliver good performances. You will think the film would be long, drawn out and heavy going but it's rather light on its feet. It maybe has too much medical politics with its tirade on AZT, the antiretroviral drug used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS infection even today.",7,1,1,3 February 2014
The Exorcist," Tubular Bells
","By the time I was old enough to see 18 rated films. The Exorcist was not available on home video in Britain as the censors would not give it a certification.I eventually saw a special edition of the film and re-watched the original version more recently.William Friedkin has effectively made an art house horror film. It is leisurely paced and the exorcism part only plays a small part right at the end of the movie.The film begins at an archaeological dig in northern Iraq. Catholic priest Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) finds a representation of the devil.In Washington DC. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shooting her latest film. Her bright and normal 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) suddenly starts to display disturbing behaviour. Chris consults doctors and psychiatrists who cannot comprehend her increasingly erratic and bizarre behaviour. It includes mouthing obscenities or her bed violently shaking.When the drunken director of Chris's film dies by falling out of Regan's bedroom with his neck twisted, detective Kinderman (Lee J Cobb) investigates.In desperation, Chris consults Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller.) He is a young brooding Jesuit priest who studied psychology. He is also having a crisis of faith as he was not there for the death of his elderly Greek mother.Father Karras is shocked to see Regan's condition and believes she is possessed. The church puts him in touch with Father Merrin who has performed an exorcism before in Africa, something that almost killed him.Over 45 years later the antics of Regan now look less disturbing. I can imagine audiences would be shocked when the movie was first released. Even more bizarre was the furore that Linda Blair's demonic voice was dubbed. She was 14 years old during the making of the film, it looks obvious that the possessed voice is not hers.The film has a languid pace, it does seem an age before the exorcism takes place. When the exorcism takes place it is both potent and shocking. The performances from both Von Sydow and Miller is intense as they shout: 'The power of Christ compels you.'I found on second viewing that The Exorcist works better if you look at it as the story of Father Karras. His torment, his crisis of faith, his visions regarding his mother coming out of those subway steps. The movie benefits greatly in the special edition when both priests have a discussion as to why such a young girl was chosen by the devil to be possessed.",6,3,3,9 March 2019
Goon," Punching the lights out
","Seann William Scott is kind hearted bouncer Doug, the black sheep in a brainy family. He gets picked as an enforcer for a losing minor Canadian ice hockey team. His job is to protect the team's star player by beating the hell out of his opponents. Something Doug is good at as he has no other hockey skills.Eventually Doug has to go toe to toe with the best enforcer in ice hockey, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) who tells Doug of the downside of his job.The film wants to be a zany version of Slap Shot. It has wacky characters such as Jay Baruchel who plays Doug's best buddy who runs a blog site. The cast also has Eugene Levy who appeared with Scott in the American Pie films.Goon is crude, violent and sporadically funny. It benefits from heartfelt performances from Scott and Schrieber. However as a sports movie and a romance, it is uneven and too formulaic to the point of being predictable.",5,0,0,28 August 2018
Now You See Me," Abracadabra
","Now You See Me is a dazzling heist films heavy on style, visual trickery and fast edits. Four amateur magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco) are brought together by an unknown controller who groups them together as The Four Horsemen and they soon become top Vegas magicians.However that is not the end of it. During the finale of an act they pick a random audience member who appears to have teleported into his bank vault in Paris. He is told to switch the ventilation system that blows out Euros on to the Parisian streets. The audience go crazy and the next day the Four Horsemen are brought in for questioning by the FBI.The bank in Paris was robbed and a prop used in the magic act was found at the scene in Paris.The magicians are being investigated by a determined but dim FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol detective (Mélanie Laurent) who seemed to be more in tune with the conjurer's slight of hand techniques.The Four Horsemen have a patron (Michael Caine) who promotes their shows and latest tricks. Morgan Freeman is on their trail as he makes a living in exposing magicians tricks and helps out the FBI.This is just the beginning though. The Four Horsemen become folk heroes as it turns out that their victims are people or corporations who have duped or cheated the ordinary person and now it is payback time.Director Louis Leterrier keeps his show moving using effects and dazzle. It is frothy fun as the Four Horsemen use all manner of trickery to evade their captures but you kind of guess who the real mastermind is going to be. The clues are laid down as we go along.I was concerned as to why the Morgan Freeman character was deemed to be a fall guy, he might have been smug but he was not a villain. Also these amateur magicians had skills so magical they must have studied at Hogwarts school of magic. So despite being an enjoyable film, it does fall down on logic but it is fun.",7,1,2,24 August 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Tempus Fugit
","X Men: First Class was a clever re-jigging by having new younger actors playing Magneto and Xavier and focusing on the origins of the X Men. However like last year's Star Trek: Into Darkness, the second film gets away from a fresh page and goes back to its franchise history here we have the return of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen playing their older selves as past meets the future. It might be because both actors are not getting any younger that the producers decided to accelerate their appearance in the franchise.The glue is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as he travels into the past and prevent Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) killing scientist Trask (anagram of Stark!) By killing Trask (Peter Dinklage) the governments declare war on mutants and develop the robotic anti-mutant Sentinels who have almost wiped out the mutants in the future.As Wolverine returns he see's McAvoy's Xavier, addicted to a serum, drunk and without his powers. Erik is in a maximum security prison but aided by Quicksilver, they free Erik and set about to Paris to stop Raven. The prison escape scene is marvellously done balancing wit and bravado.The film is mainly set in the past as there is distrust and anger between Charles and Erik and whether Erik can be fully trusted. The set pieces are well executed with a balance of wit and pathos. Because of the focus on the newer actors there is little time devoted to the classic X Men actors as they are reduced to almost cameo status.As a stand alone film I found the film enjoyable, its well paced the film hardly misses a beat. You can quibble about the time travel elements and the changing of the time strands. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, Jackman all deliver in the acting stakes although surely I cannot be alone in thinking that the ageless Logan is actually looking old.Bryan Singer the returning director of the first two X Men films brings a tight narrative focus and delivers a film with little flab but plenty of fab.",7,0,1,31 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Without limits
","Thematically this film has similarities to rival DC Comics/Warner Brothers Batman v Superman. Who watches the Watchmen, sorry superheroes.This is the question asked in Civil War after a disastrous incident in Lagos involving Captain America and his team but the powers that be led by General Ross now the US Secretary of State that various incidents involving The Avengers either as a team or individuals has led to collateral damage. In short, innocent people have died.The film sets up a confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man and the various superheroes choose sides with new additions including Ant Man, Black Panther and Spiderman. Iron Man feels that there should be scrutiny or oversight by an external body like the UN. Captain America has concerns, rightly so after all he revealed Shield as being corrupted in the previous film and so nervous about history repeating itself.History does play an important part in the film. The Winter Soldier has history both with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Something just ripe to be manipulated by the film's villain Zemo who is planning the moves to pit the various heroes against each other.What the directors, the Russos get right here is a layered story with action pieces that are well paced. Some of the action sequences in the early part of the film are maybe too fast and frenetic with almost cartoon like action.The new version of Spiderman is introduced here and along with Ant Man they are there to add zippy humour and expand the Avengers universe.",7,1,6,3 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's a newt wizarding world
","JK Rowling gets sole writing credit for adapting her own story but I reckon she was helped out a lot by Steve Kloves who gets the producer credit here but wrote most of the other Harry Potter films.Newt Scamander is the author of a classic textbook at Hogwarts when Harry Potter started his first year at school. Here we see Newt (Eddie Redmayne) as a young man as he researches Fantastic beasts and has come to America to release a Thunderbird into the wild.It is 1926 New York where things have become chaotic in the wizarding world with a criminal on the loose, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) fears that their world might be discovered by humans especially as some magical entity is causing destruction in the city just as Newt and his suitcase containing the menagerie of fantastic beasts have landed.Also there is an anti-magic street preacher, Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) is trying to unveil wizards and witches to a disbelieving audience including sceptical newspaper publisher Henry Shaw (Jon Voight.) The MACUSA have sent security enforcer Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) a mysterious and powerful wizard himself to find out what is causing the chaos in New York and he pressures Mary Lou's adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) to help him. Newt on the other hand is also being pursued by a security official Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who wants to get into MACUSA's good books.In this prequel world of Harry Potter we see the fault lines being drawn that would ripple through to Harry Potter's time. This first film expands the wizarding world to America who seem to be more stricter, no contact with muggles here. The story though owes a bit to the Philosopher's Stone especially when it comes to unveiling the real villain.There are several mentions of Hogwarts cruelly called Hogwash in one instance, Dumbledore is also mentioned but it is a film in its own right, there are also some fantastic beasts but I did not think this is a film that will enchant a generation of kids like the Harry Potter books and films. The reason, it is not focused on the children characters and we do not see the world from their eyes but Scamander who tries to be childlike.Redmayne's Scamander was a little too downbeat and bumbling for my liking. Porpentina was just irritating although her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) brought the right level of sexiness and charm and her relationship with Jacob was very believable and tender.",6,5,11,24 November 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Three casino heist
","Th 1960 rat pack original was not regarded as a good film which apart from Peter Lawford, the rest of the rat pack did too much partying to take the shooting of the film seriously.Director Steven Soderbergh's remake is light in its feet, he has the actors in shape and makes good stab at a lighthearted, stylish caper.Danny Ocean is a con man straight out of prison who gets a gang together and plans go rob the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand on the same night. All casinos owned by Terry Benedict and he is the man who is now going out with Ocean's ex-wife.The teaming up of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle garnered a lot of excitement and press attention. They even managed to get two rival World boxing champions to meet in the ring on screen. Lennox Lewis who was the world heavyweight champion at the time was so distracted by filming his scenes he subsequently lost the defence of his title.The true assets of the movie is the director and screenwriter who constructed the plot and kept the movie sharp and the egos restrained.The film is fun as you go from the idea of the heist, planning to the recruitment of the team members and then actual robbery itself. The film is escapist fun, its just a shame that it feels a tad overlong, maybe the film could had ended when they watched the Bellagio fountains at night.",6,0,2,27 August 2014
Duck You Sucker," Giù la testa
","Sergio Leone is a giant went it come to westerns but he only directed seven films. Three of which I have watched over and over throughout my lifetime. They were the ones with Clint Eastwood.A Fistful of Dynamite was released in 1971. It was his only movie he made in the 70s. His next release and final film would be the gangster movie, Once Upon a Time in America.This movie in a sense is a bridge from his spaghetti westerns to the flawed gangster epic he made in the 1984.The movie opens with crude amoral Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) robbing wealthy passengers on a train and raping a woman which is done in a slightly comedic style. Once Upon a Time in America features one of the most disturbing rape scenes of 1980s cinema.Set in 1913 with Mexico in the midst of revolution. Juan cares little about politics, he wants to rob for money. When he meets laconic but haunted IRA explosive expert John Mallory (James Coburn.) Juan seizes a chance to rob a bank.However the bank is being used as a prison and Juan inadvertently ends up being a hero of the revolution as hundreds of political prisoners are freed.A Fistful of Dynamite is an overblown and erratic Zapata western. It is an uneven film which lurches from nasty violence to joviality to a darker view of political revolutions.",6,0,0,18 March 2020
No Strings Attached," Not so great romance
","Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher have sporadically known each other since summer camp and every few years they tend to bump each other. Portman is a busy doctor. Kutcher finds out his ex girlfriend is now dating his dad, a former television star and ends up hooking up with Portman to have casual sex with each other without falling in love. In short a relationship with no strings attached.Of course Kutcher realises that he is actually falling for Portman and wants something more in their relationship.The film wants to be a raunchy, ribald black comedy. It is rather conservative instead wanting to go for the formulaic falling in love route. Its actually not very sexy or hilariously funny.It wastes its supporting cast who are in effect cyphers. What is Ludicrous doing there playing the best friend type? Kevin Kline shows up for a few scene stealing performances but even he is wasted.",3,7,8,14 April 2015
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott should had stuck with Knives
","I guess I am not the age demographic that this film is based at but I liked it. My daughter loves it, she even made me by her the DVD.Scott Pilgrim is a magical realism/fantasy teen comedy with pop art video game visuals. Deep in its heart its just a hip, flashy teen romantic comedy.Edgar Wright better known as the director of the Cornetto Trilogy adapts this comic book series like it was an edgy fast paced pseudo Japanese video game.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) plays bass in his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who meets his dream girl Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who is new in town. However he is soon pursued by Ramona's seven evil exes who all challenge Scott Pilgrim to a duel and Scott needs to keep them in check with his zaps and zingers Streetfighter style.Cera has the right balance of geeky, slacker dude, Canadian hipster charm as Scott Pilgrim who is very likable even though he quickly ditched High School student Knives for Ramona.The Evil Exes are a colourful bunch with some star names amongst them. Chris Evans is a skateboarding movie star whose entrance is accompanied with the Universal Pictures theme tune. Jason Schwartzman is a megalomaniac record producer. Brandon Routh is a pretentious vegan rock star with the ability to fly just like Superman.There is a lot of scene stealing in this film like Kieran Culkin as Scott's sneaky gay roommate, Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister and particularly Ellen Wong as Knives the slightly too young ditched girlfriend who is still loyal to Scott.I actually found this to be a fast moving, quirky, rocking, enjoyable comedy drama.",7,2,3,15 August 2015

Being apart from her friends and her hockey team has upset the balance of her her core memories and five emotions of Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling.) Joy is the main controlling factor in Riley's life.It is Sadness though that threatens to unbalance Riley and in the turmoil the two emotions of Joy and Sadness get moved to her Long Term Memory compartment.

Riley gets moody withdrawn and sad. Her parents worry that their sweet little child has gone.Joy and Sadness need to find a way back to the Headquarter before permanent damage is done to Riley and they do this with the of a childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind.)This is a multi layered story shown in a colourful and frenetic way. Kids would enjoy that side of it. However Inside Out is also a bittersweet film. While I appreciated the cerebral subtext of the film, as a feature length cartoon the story did feel clunky at times.",6,1,4,14 May 2019
Yesterday," The Frog Chorus
","A film full of The Beatles songs cannot really go wrong.Danny Boyle has made a whimsical fantasy. What if we live in a world where The Beatles did not happen. John, Paul, George and Ringo never amounted to much because they never got together. Gosh it would mean somebody else narrated those early episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer in a small seaside town who is going nowhere. About to call it quits the only person who believed in him is best friend from school, Ellie (Lily James.)One night when all the lights go out throughout the world, Jack is involved in a bus accident and wakes up in a world where no one have heard of the pop group The Beatles or their songs.Jack writes the songs from memory and wows the audience with Hey Jude, Back in the USSR, Here Comes the Sun, Yesterday and Let it Be. These songs find an audience for the first time.Unfortunately Richard Curtis's screenplay takes some interesting ideas and then diverts its attention to a soppy and unnecessary romance. This is a rom-com and you see Jack and Ellie only ever had a platonic relationship so far, all through childhood, to those teenage years when their hormones were raging to the present day. Jack it seems never had a girlfriend and never romanced Ellie, the woman who has always believed in him. Suddenly Jack realises he needs Ellie when she has found someone else.I would like to have known more about this world that had no Coca Cola, cigarettes and Oasis. The joke about Oasis was funny, a band so influenced by The Beatles, they could never exist if the Fab Four had never happened. Then again without The Beatles there would had been no Bruce Springsteen, The Eagles and Brian Wilson would not have strived so hard to create Pet Sounds. Some young filmmaker called Robert Zemeckis would never had made a movie called 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.' It does raise an issue, The Beatles were more than just the songwriting. It was also the music, the harmonies, how they sang and the production by George Martin.Some ideas are explored such as the music industry sanitising the product they want to sell. The White Album has diversity issues according to a marketing executive. However Curtis goes for the default romance story in the second half which lets it down.",6,9,16,18 September 2019

Avengers: Endgame," It certainly is the end game
","The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on.",7,9,15,29 April 2019
Dirty Dancing," Do the mashed potato
","Dirty Dancing was a sleeper hit that launched a phenomenal hit album. It is now regarded as a romantic musical classic. Some of the songs from the film have become unforgettable hits and the dance moves are now much mimicked.The film is set in the Catskill mountain holiday resort in the summer of 1963. Dr Houseman and his family are taking their annual three weeks holiday there. The youngest daughter Baby has taken a shine to the dance teacher, Johnny Castle who introduces her to a more wild style of dancing that the entertainment staff get up to.When Castle's female dance partner falls pregnant by one of the waiter's, Baby gets some money for her to have an abortion which gets botched and she has to go to her father to help her out. Her father is angry and forbids her to have anything do with Castle and the rest of the entertainment team. However she continues to see and learn to dance with Castle and they fall in love.The film is cheesy with some predictable plotting and a few bad lines including the now infamous, 'nobody puts Baby in a corner.' It has some hissable characters such as the immoral waiter and wannabee doctor who is dating Baby's sister and who knocked up Johnny's dance partner and then washed his hands off her. There is also the slimy nephew of the holiday camp owner with his constant veiled threats against the camp staff.Given all that it is still an enjoyable film now ripe with nostalgia and some cracking songs. Jennifer Grey is vulnerable enough and she has a good chemistry with Patrick Swayze. But this is really Swayze's film, he dances, he broods, he sings and he steals the film.Dirty Dancing shows a world that is changing something Dr Houseman wants to resist with his regular holiday at the Catskills with his daughters. Even the camp owner has realised that times are changing as young people want to go to Europe rather than spend a few weeks at the camp. The dance teachers are bored of the sedate dance lessons when they know that they are capable of more hip and happening dance styles and of course Vietnam war is round the corner. Its almost a final visit to a fading lifestyle and an emergence of a new youth culture that Dirty Dancing celebrates.",7,0,0,23 December 2014
Quantum of Solace," It is all about the water and the writer's strike
","Quantum of Solace is not as portentous as Casino Royale the movie which partially rebooted Bond as a newly qualified Double 'O' but retained Judi Dench as 'M.'Quantum of Solace starts 20 minutes after the events of Casino Royale with a grinding car chase sequence and revealing Quantum's double agents.Marc Forster, the first non Commonwealth director for a Bond film is someone known for serious dramas at the time and it shows in the action sequences which were more Bourne rather than Bond.One of the editors had worked on the Bourne franchise. It meant the action sequences lacked coherence which the audience found off putting yet looking at it again some years later, it looks better as we have got more used to with this type of fast and choppy editing.Forster gives the film more substance with some set piece sequences such the opera scene that is the meeting point for Quantum participants.The setting in Bolivia with its dispute about water gives the film a political edge as did the more cynical view of corporate politics. Corporations making dubious alliances with dodgy dictatorships where the bottom line is mutual exploitation and the ordinary people suffering.The short running time meant the film did not outlive its welcome but the way Bond treated poor Mathis after he was shot did leave a nasty taste.Bond always respected fellow agents and would not treat a fallen colleague in such a distasteful fashion.",7,0,4,7 December 2013

He finds that he is shifting in time that coincides with these blackouts and also the past and future timeline for himself and the people around him changes.This is actually a surprisingly clever time travel film and in my opinion deals with some hard time travel concepts where you enter a world of multiverses, split future events, chaos theory and whether you can successfully change traumatic events.No wonder poor Evan is left confused. If only he watched more Twilight Zone as a child or even Doctor Who he might not had made such a mess of trying to use his powers to fix the past and present.Ashton Kutcher who is more known for comedy and light romance. He tries his best to muster some acting chops but it is passable, it could had been better with a stronger lead.Surprisingly, this was a script that was knocking about for some years and it was only Ashton's involvement that gave it a green light.It starts out puzzling and sinister but leads to a satisfactory thrilling ride as the movie starts to make sense as it progresses.",7,1,5,5 September 2013
No Country for Old Men," Hidden loot, running far
","No Country for Old Men is a grandiose, dark, violent Neo-Western thriller from the Coen Brothers.Adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays an ordinary Joe who whilst out hunting finds a fortune in the aftermath of a drug deal that went bad.This leads to a cat and mouse game involving three men. Brolin who has to evade the relentless hit-man with a bad haircut played by Bardem.He also has to steer clear of Lee Jones, the violence weary veteran sheriff on the hunt for both men knowing that Brolin has bitten off more than he can chew and is in danger.The film is set in Texas of 1980 with a bleak, desert landscape. It is important to note the year, it means Brolin's character is a Vietnam war veteran and the film deals with the purported rise of modern urban violence from the 1970s onwards.McCarty's novel and its adaptation deals with themes of fatalism, conscience and circumstance. The Coen Brothers have dealt with various types of crime genres before in their film careers ranging from Blood Simple, Crimewave, Fargo and Miller's Crossing.In those films there have also been some form of humour even the the dark kind. Here they can pull the themes together in a grander scale as they have the source material that richly delivers. There is much less humour. A journey to bleakness lies for a lot of the participants.It is a combination of a modern western and an urban thriller. Even its 1980s setting with its fashion and style can easily merge with the present day with the presence of four wheel drive vehicles, high rise buildings and automatic weapons.The violence displayed is an important part of the film but some viewers may find this with the grim tone too much for them.",7,4,6,16 November 2013
District 9," Alien Nation
","The film is an allegory of Apartheid in South Africa. District 9 is inspired by events in District 6, Cape Town during the apartheid era.District 9 has a mockumentary setting with interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras.In a dystopian Johannesburg in South Africa; humans and aliens called 'prawns' live amongst each other.The 'prawns' live in government camps but a private security company is hired to move them to an internment camp.Neither humans or prawns are happy living with the other on the same ground and the prawns live in poor conditions and suffer intense discrimination and treated like third class people.Sharlto Copley plays the well meaning but dim bureaucrat and son in law of the boss of the private security firm.He has been the patsy appointed to handle the relocation to the internment camp but is sprayed by some fluid in a canister that the prawns were hiding which alters his DNA. Now the person who was the oppressor experiences life as the oppressed.The mockumentary format works very well in this film and it's Copley's performance that carries this film.Copley was unknown before this film, he really grabs the role and also fills it with a lot of humour. If it was not for him, it may had failed or just remain an obscure movie.The setting in South Africa is refreshing and the special effects are very good. Not everything in the story grabbed me, some of the characters were rather two dimensional.The parallel to the events of South Africa are obvious to older people outside of South Africa as it was a daily news story up to the early 1990s.However it is not entirely original as the film Alien Nation in 1988 had a similar theme regarding discrimination against aliens.",6,0,0,3 December 2013
Mamma Mia!," How can I resist you
","The pop group Abba did produce great songs and their music has lasted. My daughter loved Abba even when she was a toddler, she was born years after the band had broken up. I had to book tickets for the musical Mamma Mia on a visit to London some years ago because she kept pestering us and she was only 5 years old at the time. This film adaptation of the musical consists of Abba's greatest hits wrapped around a thin story. It really is a greatest hits musical and if you think about it, some of the main cast (Meryl Streep) are too old for the role.Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married in her idyllic Greek island and wants to invite her father. However she has no idea who he is. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had three lovers in a short space of time when she was a young woman and then fell pregnant. Donna has raised Sophie on her own and also ran a dilapidated hotel.By looking at her mum's diary Sophie has tracked down the three men, Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) Harry (Colin Firth) Sam (Pierce Brosnan) and invited them to the island who all come looking for Donna.Obviously Donna would had been a teenager when she had her lovers making her a woman in her early 40s when Sophie gets married. The film is cheesy fun but the songs do come thick and first almost to paper over the cracks in the story and in Donna's hotel. You cannot help getting involved with the fun and silliness as well as listening to Brosnan's singing. You have to laugh at Christine Baranski and Judy Walters trying to entice the men.",6,0,0,22 July 2018
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","After Tim Burton reinvented Batman for the movies in 1989 with his darker and disturbed vision.The subsequent sequels directed by Joel Schumacher got sillier and campier. Also Warner Brothers could not keep hold of their dark knight. The replacements Val Kilmer and George Clooney just did not look right in the batsuit.Christopher Nolan was bought in to launch a new series of films. He went back to basics with a prequel and a reinvention of the character.The first third of the film is an origins film. Bruce Wayne travels the world learning combat and find his purpose in life. He encounters the League of Shadows led by Ra's al Ghul in the Far East. However Wayne rejects their twisted message of destroying Gotham.He returns to Gotham as Bruce Wayne the playboy, his family company being run by an unscrupulous executive.However Gotham is a corrupt cesspit run by organised crime. Wayne develops his Batman persona with the aid of prototype technology developed by Lucius Fox.Christian Bale does his best Clint Eastwood impression when he has his bat suit on. There is enough playfulness in his public Bruce Wayne identity.Batman Begins is a much needed return to form for the Batman movies. In part Nolan takes this opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Direct a James Bond type action adventure. The finale is very much like a Bond film.",7,0,0,12 November 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," Pain demands to be felt
","This film was popular with young adults. My daughter when to an advance preview, the kind where you have a live by satellite Q&A session with the stars.As a parent you do end up questioning why would you want to see a romance movie about young people with cancer? In this case beautiful young people in a Hollywood movie. I had a sibling who had cancer at a young age, it was horrible, a nightmare and nothing like this movie.Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has cancer. She goes to a cancer support group where she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) a one legged cancer survivor. Both share an acerbic wit and an unconventional view of life. On a visit to Amsterdam to see a reclusive and alcoholic writer they fall in love.The fact that they have a kiss in Anne Frank's attic where a crowd applauds tells you all you need to know that this film has no taste.It starts off engagingly, like a stoic fight against the odds kind of movie with some black humour. It then becomes inert, really going nowhere, the narration becomes a nuisance and then the saccharine kicks in.",4,4,7,15 October 2018
Wreck-It Ralph," Another level
",Wreck-It Ralph sees Disney trying to go the Pixar route before they decided to buy the company. It is a brisk colourful animation taking a retro look at arcade games. However the makers saw too many Pixar films because you can easily guess who the real villain really is going to be as it follows the Pixar beats too closely and adds some Disney mush to it as well.Wreck-It Ralph is the villain in an old 8 bit arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. It really is a thinly disguised version of Donkey Kong. Ralph though has had enough of being a villain with no character development. He does not even get invited to the game's 30th anniversary party that Felix and his crew throw.Out of the game Ralph is a nice but clumsy guy who just wants to join in with the others but the villains of the arcade games tend to be ignored. So Ralph goes to join another arcade game in order to win a medal and gets involved in more adventures. Felix goes after him before his malfunctioning arcade game is switched off for good.,6,0,1,10 August 2018
Meet the Fockers," More parents
","Meet the Fockers is not as good as Meet the Parents, the plot is basically Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is planning to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) who is also pregnant.Her parents Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner) are travelling to Florida to meet the Fockers Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Rozalin (Barbra Streisand) who are ageing hippies and who probably kickstarted the sexual revolution back in the 1960s. They are the antithesis of the conservative Byrnes.Jack is dismayed at their liberal attitudes, their celebration of mediocrity and Bernie's emasculation who gave up his job as a lawyer to raise Greg. However I am sure Jack already knew this, they called their son Gaylord Focker!The film has lowbrow and smutty humour with a side plot that Greg may have got his large breasted nanny pregnant as he had his first sexual experience with her. De Niro is uptight, untrusting his future son in law. Hoffman is loose and ready to spar with De Niro. Streisand is wasted, she really does not have much to do. However it is amusing enough and will make you laugh along the way.",6,0,2,7 June 2018
Before Sunset," Paris walks
","I have seen the Before trilogy in the wrong order. Before Sunrise saw Jesse and Celine as two young travellers who meet on a train during a trip to Vienna and bond. They exchange little details about themselves and agree to meet up at the same place on a particular date.Before Midnight released in 2013 is set almost 20 years after they have first met. They are now married, vacationing in Greece and have entered middle life and their relationships now show some cracks.Before Sunset is therefore the filling of the sandwich. After 9 years, Jesse is travelling in Europe as part of a book tour. He again encounters Celine who has come looking for him in a Paris bookshop.We find out that Jesse did turn up in Vienna but Celine could not has it was her grandmother's funeral. That event has somehow thrown both their fate in a different direction.Older, wiser, with both having a career established. They still have much to look forward to but there is also now past regrets. Celine has had relationship failures and Jesse is married with a child but its not a happy marriage. Its clear that both carry a torch for each other and their initial encounter left deep marks.The rest of the film is the couple walking in Paris or on a boat on the River Seine. We get to know a bit more about these characters as they fill the gap in between the years we last saw them.Its clear that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have a nice chemistry and comfortable with each other. They look like long lost lovers and of course they co-wrote the screenplay. Just look at Jesse's face when he finds out that Celine had lived in New York and worse he was also there at the same time.I do think that director Richard Linklater could had done more to show the beauty of Paris and to be honest the touristic element of Paris apart from Notre Dame. I have walked a similar route and taken a boat ride on the River Seine and the film could had done with the picture postcard scenes to break up the monotony of these two people walking and talking. Its kind of natural for Jesse who is after all a visitor to the city.The conversation is interesting but not riveting. Its natural but does not flow again because the screenplay wants to unwrap its layers slowly and methodically.Jesse is on a tight schedule as he has a plane to catch but its clear he does not want to leave her. We now know that there is more to their story and shall re-visit them again.",6,0,0,13 November 2014
Non-Stop," The air above
","With a title like Non-Stop you expect non stop action but this is more a thriller with periodical action scenes to keep the beats going. After all Liam Neeson is in his 60s and cannot keep on fighting all through the film.Neeson is an air marshal with personal problems and a fondness for drink. As the flight takes off he receives a series of text messages asking for millions of dollars to be deposited in a bank account or someone will die every 20 minutes.The texts are popped on screen in the style of the TV series 'Sherlock' which is a blessing for the viewer.Neeson now has to find the person making the threats, suspect all passengers and even the fight crew. On the other hand his warnings are not taken seriously and 20 minutes into the first threat the first person dies.The movie is far fetched and convoluted. The reveal is difficult to fathom but it is an enjoyable film as Neeson desperately tries to find the villain while he increasingly looks like he is losing it and attracts suspicion himself.",6,0,1,2 June 2014
Zulu," Once were warriors
","Zulu became so famous that the movie soon descended into parody including that Michael Caine impression: 'Oi, stop chucking those spears at me!' It is noticeable that Caine actually played a posh officer.Zulu is an epic directed by the American Cy Endfield. It is set in 1879 and depicts 4000 Zulu warriors heading for Rorkes Drift in Natal where a small supply post is defended by about 100 British soldiers.The first half of the film consists of showing the various characters from the British side. A barrack room lawyer shirking from battle (James Booth) a by the book pompous posh officer (Michael Caine) and an engineer (Stanley Baker) determined to be tactical and defend this outpost by setting up barricades and getting ready for battle.The second half is the relentless battle scenes as waves and waves of Zulus attack. Although it has to be said, the British soldiers although fewer in numbers have guns, the Zulus being in greater numbers mainly have spears and once they have been thrown, nothing much else.The film might look old fashioned but Stanley Baker was also one of the producers of the film. As a staunch socialist he was determined that this film would not be seen as some kind of jingoistic, colonial boys' own adventure but pay tribute to those mainly Welsh soldiers, eleven of them who were awarded the Victoria Cross. The film stills stands its ground.",7,3,3,26 January 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Not a Tripadvisor review
","Wes Anderson had made a delightful offbeat art house film that never outstays its hospitality. It has a stamp of an assured filmmaker, confident of his eccentric style.Mr Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) his tale of the now faded Grand Budapest Hotel over dinner.In 1932, the Grand Budapest Hotel was epitome of decadent and luxury somewhere in Eastern Europe. Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a refugee started out as a newly hired lobby boy. He is taken under the wing of the eccentric concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes.)Gustave in effect runs the hotel and attends to the personal needs to some of the older ladies who stay in the hotel such as Madame D (Tilda Swinton.) When she dies, Gustave is bequeathed a valuable painting. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is far from pleased with this. Gustave is accused of the old lady's murder and Dmitri's henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) makes sure any irritant is disposed off quickly.Wes Anderson has directed a whimsical and absurd black comedy with a camp performance from Fiennes that has a startling odour. It was a shame that he was not Oscar nominated. There are cameos from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Edward Norton. The story can get dark and murderous at times, it has an underlying sadness. You see proto fascists who demand to see papers of all the travellers on a train. Enough to parallel the real world of the 1930s.",10,1,1,22 September 2019
The Favourite," Palace intrigue
","If The Favourite had music by Michael Nyman. I would had said that it was directed by Peter Greenaway. I do think Greenaway was a big influence with the style of the film, as well as the Oscar winning Tom Jones that lent it some naughtiness.Director Yorgos Lanthimos adds a rich period setting and visual flourishes. He keeps his camera moving and has lot of fisheye views.Underneath it all is a power play between three women in 18th Century England. Two of them vie to be Queen Anne's favourite even if this means massaging more than her legs.Abigail (Emma Stone) has fallen on hard times. She arrives at Court hoping for employment from her cousin, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz.) She is the Queen's trusted adviser, lady in waiting, confidante and even lover.Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is ill. She has gout, she is mentally unstable. She lost 17 children and she has 17 rabbits that she plays with. Governing the country is something she finds difficult especially as Britain is at war with France.Abigail wants to ingratiate herself with Queen Anne and climb the greasy pole to secure her position. Over time Abigail and Lady Sarah fight, dirtily to be the Queen's favourite.The Favourite is a crude, grimy, seedy, bawdy drama in tone and language. Lanthimos is certainly not interested in showing a wholesome chocolate box portrait of 18th century life.This is a sumptuous looking costume drama about fragile cruel people and egos. People who are desperate to get to the top and remain there.The film unravels in the second half and gets bogged down. At the end Abigail may not be quiet in control as she thinks, I did think the ending was weak and disappointing.",6,5,10,10 January 2019
Seabiscuit," A pedigree gallop
",Seabiscuit is an old fashioned feel good film with Rockyesque aspirations of an underdog in a depression era USA which brings hope to a nation.Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a wealthy car dealer (shades of Tucker about Bridges role) who has suffered losses when the depression struck. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a veteran trainer who fixes injured horses and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) a Canadian jockey blinded in one eye and has a short fuse.Then there is Seabiscuit a mistreated and temperamental colt. Red and Seabiscuit who are both volatile become close and the horse racks up some impressive victories in the west coast and captures the public's imagination but there are more obstacles to overcome.Director Gary Ross gives the film plenty of heart and sentimentality and just about gets away with it because the cast invest so much in the story despite some well worn clichés but uplifts you as the viewer.,7,0,0,18 October 2015
Foxcatcher," Buying approval
","Foxcatcher is a brooding slow burn film from director Bennett Miller about two men looking for approval. One from his more gregarious older brother, the other from his disapproving horse fixated mother.Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medal winner in the 1984 Olympics somewhat living in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) also an Olympic gold medal winner.In the opening scene we see Mark talking uncomfortably to a class of children at school. This is good for Mark as it allows him to get out of his brother's shadow. Yet when we see Mark wrestle he is always more effective when David gives him a pep talk.After a disagreement between Mark and du Pont, David is persuaded to join the training team. You can see his more effective training methods at play but at the same time it has a negative effect on Mark who already descended to a spiral of booze and cocaine under du Pont's influence and he becomes embittered performing poorly in the Seoul Olympics.The film is based on true life and tragic events with du Pont's influence suffocating those around him. He wants approval, he wants to be a mentor when all the time you think when you see him wrestle with the young men that he just wants to cop a feel of them.This is an actor's film. Carell looks unrecognizable under heavy make up with Tatum also putting more of a performance where less is more. The film is absorbing and despite the slow pace, yet at times it can also be lifeless.",7,0,0,10 July 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," O'Toole Is Lawrence
","I saw the restored version over 20 years ago but in a pan and scan version on television. I watched it again recently with the recent passing of Peter O'Toole, this time on widescreen and high definition.The film is known for its epic cinematography and vistas of the vast desert landscape. David Lean's film is the dictionary definition of the epic picture.When John Milius made the Wind and the Lion, he boasted 'look we are making our own epic film just like Lawrence of Arabia.' He then realised why it was so easy, Lean did it first and they were just following in his footsteps.Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese were involved in the restored version and have also acknowledged the film's influence on them.The screenplay of Lawrence of Arabia is the prototype that others have used as a template whether its drama, action or adventure.You do not just go to Aqaba, you take a detour to find a fallen Arab (Gasim) and head to Aqaba. Later when a blood feud is ignited and Lawrence decides things would be better if he was the one who killed the murderer. Who does the culprit turn out to be? Gasim, the man who he risked his own life to save.The film's opening scenes acknowledges Lawrence flawed character as we get differing opinions of him from the off. Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is perplexing, infuriating, cultured, enigmatic and pig headed.O'Toole sculptured a character that very much defined his film career. It seems unbelievable that he never won an Oscar for best actor for this film or for any other.There might be liberties taken with actual events. In reality Omar Sharif's character 'Sherif Ali' was a composite of several people and Anthony Quinn's Auda was more urbane, intellectual and cultured rather than the brute shown in the film.Maybe there are too many desert scenes in the film with sunrises and sunsets. There are hardly any female characters in the movie.You do get a vast epic and a literary screenplay that will stand the test of time. It is a deserved classic.",10,1,2,21 December 2013
It Follows," Dangers of the human touch
","It Follows is an interesting low budget independent horror film. It has the decency to have mostly nice likeable young characters.Jay Height (Maika Monroe) is a pretty teenager who has sex with her new boyfriend. He then ties her up and in a desolate house tells her that he has passed a curse on to her.Some kind of malevolent entity will now follow her, it can be anyone and it will try to kill her. The only way out for her is to pass the curse along to someone else and hopefully they will transmit it forward.Jay is troubled, soon she has visions of someone following her. Her friends and family are worried about Jay but rally around her. Yet they cannot see what Jay is seeing.The film can be seen as an allegory of the consequences of promiscuous sex and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. The premise of passing on a curse can go back to cult films such as Night of the Demon by Jacque Tourneur.Writer/Director David Robert Mitchell begins the film with a half naked young woman running scared out of her house in heels. Her dead contorted body is found on the beach. Outside of this he has gone for slow burn suspense rather than visceral horror.The use of electronic music and going for jump scares reminded me of the early movies of John Carpenter.",6,0,0,14 February 2019
Legend," Bonded by blood
","Some years after they died, Reggie Kray and his more psychotic twin brother Ronnie still attract attention.They ruled the London underworld in the 1960s and attracted glamour through celebrities as well as the attention of the police. They used threats and violence to establish a foothold to run nightclubs and operate protection rackets. Dogged detective Nipper Read tried for years to get the twins behind bars.Tom Hardy plays both roles. Reggie is the more straightforward gangster, level headed, he falls in love but still prone to bouts of violence. Ronnie suffered from complex schizophrenia, he was unhinged, homosexual and could fly off the handle very easily.Brian Helgeland wrote and directed this rather muddled film. Apart from the brothers and Reg's romance with Frances, most of the characters are caricatured and the story flatly portrayed which needed a heavy voice over. Christopher Eccleston is wasted as Nipper Read and the third Kray brother is never mentioned.Peter Medak's 1990 film The Krays which was more low budget tried at least to aim higher. It showed the brothers coming up through the ranks as gangsters and the enemies they made, we see them getting into trouble during National Service and we also see a more complex relationship they has with their mother.",3,0,2,4 June 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," The Marvel punch
","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.",9,6,11,3 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood
","Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is maybe proof that Quentin Tarantino ranks alongside Stanley Kubrick. Both started to make overlong movies and were lionised by critics, many who were afraid to be critical of them.This might be Tarantino's most self indulgent film so far despite being a glorious period piece.Set in Los Angeles 1969. The film is an alternate history as it focuses on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was once a star of the hit television show Bounty Law. Now Dalton's career is fading. He drinks too much, he does not remember his lines and his regular work is guest starring as the villain of the week.Accompanying Dalton is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who acts as his driver and gofer. Booth is also short of work as he has a bad reputation in the stunt industry.Living next door to Dalton in LA is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) who has just moved in with her director husband Roman Polanski. Life for her is attending parties and going to the cinema to see her latest movie.Dalton wonders if he should take up a suggestion to go and work in Italy and make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career. Booth gave a pretty hippy a lift to a ranch which is full of strange people belonging to a cult. Booth seemed to have rubbed them up the wrong way.Eventually the various people cross paths in this reimagining of what might have happened on a fateful night in 1969.There is no doubt that that DiCaprio and Pitt give their all in this film as two middle aged men fading away at an uncertain time. Tarantino seems to have given this film a conservative hue, he really dislikes the counterculture. I wonder if he is angry with the #metoo movement which destroyed his friend Harvey Weinstein and raised question over his own conduct in the past.Clocking in at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax. Until then you wonder what exactly is the story. The movie is a series of vignettes that hints at a director/screenwriter who is past his prime and seems to be obsessed with bare feet.",6,5,11,25 November 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Mother love
","It seems bizarre that many people thought Liberace was camp but did not think he was gay.As a young child when his television specials were shown I was aware that there was something effeminate about him even though I had no idea what homosexuality was. He even would have a female companion in these shows, a wink at the audience that he might be straight.Behind the Candelabra is a film from Steven Soderbergh with Michael Douglas playing the entertainer as a reptilian predator of young men. Preening, vain, bejewelled, promiscuous and yet empty. A bit like the top of his head when he took off his toupee.Matt Damon plays his teenage lover Scott Thorson, who is taken by a friend to see Liberace's Las Vegas show and then backstage is bemused by the attention lavished on him by the older star who showers him with gifts and love and eventually ejects him with little dignity as a newer, younger model enters the scene.Of course the film is based on the book by Thorson whose own veracity has been questioned and whose account might be self serving. It is not helped that although Damon looks buff in the disco infused late 1970s era, at the age of 43 when this film was made, he was frankly too old to be playing the teenage Scott Thorson.Douglas who for a period was a sex symbol with sex thrillers such as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct is having a hoot camping it up as Liberace, not afraid to show his vulnerable side. Ultimately the only person he had a real relationship with was his mother played here by Debbie Reynolds.I found the whole drama too shallow and maybe even too safe. After all there is nothing here we have not seen here before. It is just that the gold digger would normally be a young woman who is the plaything of a successful older man.",5,7,10,14 February 2017
Beasts of No Nation," Toy soldiers
","Director Cary Fukunaga brings us the turmoil of war as experienced by child soldiers through the eyes and words of Agu (Abraham Attah).The film starts of sweetly, in a safe zone of an unnamed West African country, Agu and his friends go about with a television box without a screen entertaining villagers and UN soldiers. They sell the TV set as a box of imagination.Before long in the country ravaged with civil war, they are abandoned by the UN soldiers, his father and brother are killed, he is separated from his mother and sister and under the tutelage of the Commandant (Idris Elba) in order to survive he goes from being a playful young boy to a brutal soldier as he is firstly forced to hack a man to death.The Commandant is a sadistic mercenary, who trains the child soldiers and at night selects some of the boys to rape. Agu has a friendship with fellow child soldier, Strika who are both abused by the Commandant.When it seems the rebels might achieve victory, the chief has little use of a savage like the Commandant who might now be a liability and a perfect candidate for the war crimes tribunal.The film to me felt unfocused, I felt the issue was better dealt with in a film like Blood Diamond. By setting the action in an unnamed country we are at loss as to what the conflict was about. Was it tribal or religious?The film is grim, some of the scenes are barbaric. At the end Agu ends in a place where he could be mentally repaired.The issue of child soldiers is a current issue, children who lose their innocence and humanity to the horrors of war.",5,4,7,16 April 2016

As Missouri has the death penalty and Amy's diaries reveal an unhappy marriage, Nick needs the aid of an ace criminal attorney.The film has a tangled plot because it has an unreliable narrator. What starts as a missing person's case becomes more complex, as Nick fights for his liberty we find out what really happened to Amy.Director David Fincher directs a muscular taut thriller with dark comedy elements.

Get Out," Do The Rock Steady
","Get Out is a satirical horror film. In some ways it reminded me of the remake of The Stepford Wives.Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris Washington who is on a weekend visit to the parents of his white girlfriend Rose. (Allison Williams). Her father is a neurosurgeon and her mother is a hypnotherapist.The family come across as an inclusive affluent liberal family who welcome this young black man. Chris however feels perturbed, even suspicious especially as he believes he has been hypnotised by Rose's mother.At a family garden party Chris finds that their friends and neighbours although welcoming also take an unusual interest in him. Something is not right and even Rose might be complicit to whatever is going on.The film directed by Jordan Peele is actually very slow to get going but does leave you intrigued as to how it will all turn out, even hinting that what is going on might all be in Chris's mind. British actor Daniel Kaluuya has a wide eyed look of a lamb being led to slaughter. Comic relief is provided by his best buddy Rod, a TSA agent who finds incidents of young black men who have disappeared and forms a bizarre theory.Like a lot of horror films, much of it in retrospect does not make too much sense.",5,0,4,23 April 2017
Aladdin," Not a whole new world
","Disney continues with their live action remakes of their classic cartoons at breakneck speed. I do wonder if they should had spaced them out more.Guy Ritchie brings a more subdued style like he has been hemmed in by Disney or he just wanted to make a family film that one day he can watch with his grandkids.Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is the street urchin in Agrabah. The diamond in the rough who frees a genie (Will Smith) from a lamp and is granted three wishes. He transforms himself into a charming prince in order to marry Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) the woman he rescued from the market as she wandered outside the palace incognito.The evil Vizier Jafar wants the lamp for his own purposes to rule the kingdom.Ritchie has made a more respectful version of Aladdin. At least most of the cast come from the middle east. He also adds as a joke, a token white man. Billy Magnussen plays a Scandinavian prince, a potential suitor for the princess.The whole film though is rather anemic. Gone is the freestyling of Robin Williams genie. Will Smith is following a script, the classic songs are here. The princess has a modernist interpretation but it is never more than average and certainly not better than the animated film from 1992 because it brings little that is new to the table.",5,5,8,7 June 2019

Its 2012 and the scientists have discovered that the earth's core is melting, the crust will shift and lave will spew out causing earthquakes and rising tides. Even the poles would shift.Politicians, rich oligarchs, various royal families and a few conspiracy nuts know of the imminent disaster and have started planning for it by means of survivals arks being built in China. However a place in the ark comes with a huge price.John Cusack goes all out to get his ex-wife and kids to safety by tagging along with a rich Russian.Danny Glover is the US President who opts to stay in Washington. Oliver Platt is the realist but harsh Chief of Staff. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of the scientists who alerted the government of the impending doom but fearful that the rich and powerful will callously leave millions to die.The cheese-fest is dialled up to 11 as Cusack just escapes disaster by car and plane. Roads splits, buildings come crashing down, volcanoes erupt. Emmerich even blows up the White House once again amongst other landmarks.Its like a roller-coaster ride but the characterisations are a bit paper thin, some of the effects look a bit too much green screened. A good end of the world flick with some tongue in cheek humour.",6,1,3,13 October 2014

","The problem with Ghost Rider is that the film never really catches fire however the climax of the film does have a comic book ending when Johnny Blaze fights the bad guy.Stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze does a deal with the devil when his father has terminal cancer. He signs a contract with Mephistopheles to give his soul for the health of his father. Johnny learns the hard way that the devil has a few tunes up his sleeve. Although his father is cured of cancer he dies in a stunt accident.Johnny leaves the stunt show and his girlfriend Roxanne. He knows deep down the devil will come calling for him one day to fulfil his contract. Johnny goes on to becomes a famous stunt cyclist who has survived many scrapes, I think Johnny knows why. His ex-girlfriend has become a TV reporter send down to cover his latest daredevil stunt.However Mephistopheles steps in who wants him to slay his evil son Blackheart and in doing so he will be released from his contract. Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider and his motorbike goes like a bat out of hell.The flaming visuals are cool, Cage excels as the Ghost Rider who acts more like a vigilante saving good people from bad. Its just the the plot is humdrum with supporting characters being wasted. Eva Mendes is there to look pretty. Peter Fonda is just there to look cool. Sam Elliot is there for his moustache and that horse ride alongside with Cage before he bizarrely bails out of.Wes Bentley does not bring much as Blackheart apart from a generic son of a devil act.Its an adaptation of a Marvel Comic which Marvel Films might have been able to do something more substantial with if they had made the film rather than just be associated with it like The X Men movies. Cage is hampered as Blaze with a distracting wig although he tries to make his character playful but its really an average time-waster.",5,0,0,6 October 2015
Hellboy," Hell let loose
","In Hellboy you enter the world of Guillermo Del Toro as he brings the comic book adaptation to life with his brand of visuals. But to put it bluntly despite the praise Ron Perlman gets for his wisecracking performance he was too old to playing Hellboy because despite his earth years he is supposed to look young and Perlman looks old despite the heavy prosthetic make up.The plot regarding Nazis using the power of the dark arts and a portal to hell harks back to Raiders of the Lost Ark. The government agency with a menagerie of alien species working for them reminds you of the Men in Black franchise.The story is rather so-so, it drags at the beginning and really just takes you from A to B to C. It relies too much on the one liners from Hellboy and despite good support from Doug Jones as Abe Sapien, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor and some dastardly Nazi baddies it is fairly entertaining without much depth.",5,0,1,27 December 2014
P.S. I Love You," Be glad when it is all over
","Hilary Swank plays Holly Kennedy, a fragile real estate broker who cannot hold down her job and gets married young to happy go lucky Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler) but he dies of a brain tumour leaving Holly as a grieving young widow whose life comes to a stand still.On her 30th birthday party she gets a surprise posthumous letter from Gerry informing her that he will be regularly sending her messages containing tasks that she is to perform without question or hesitation. Each message is signed off with the words PS I Love You.With the help of her friends and family Holly follows Gerry's messages such as singing in a bar or going to his Irish village to meet his parents. With the aid of flashbacks we see the significance of some of these tasks. This all leads to a possible romance with eccentric but funny bartender (Harry Connick Jr) who admires her from afar but realises that she may not be ready to move on from Gerry.Eventually Holly learns that these tasks from Gerry is for her to put the past behind her and move on with her life.As a romantic comedy the film is a maudlin cringe inducing mess. I was dumbstruck with the sheer awfulness of this contrived nonsense. I never really bought Holly and Gerry as a couple and believed for a second that Gerry could plan all these tasks for his wife when he was dying.Just look at the scenes set in Ireland. Holly ventures into a small pub and just happens to stumble upon someone singing a song that Gerry sang to her. She is pushed by her friends to have a drink with the singer (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and before long they end up in bed because he also just happens to single and available. It turns out that he was also an old friend and a member of Gerry's band.It simply is a ridiculous film that plods along in a far fetched, drab and clichéd manner.",2,3,5,12 June 2016
Room," From one room to a bigger world
","Room is about two people. Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay.) Joy has been held captive for seven years. She is locked in a small room in a shed with only a skylight. She has been raped by a man called Old Nick and given birth to their son, Jack.Jack now 5 years old has grown up in this captive world, every morning he addresses the thing in the room. His only view of the outside world is what he can see from the skylight.However Room is not a movie about a mother and child locked in a room while Old Nick abuses them. It is about Joy planning their escape and then trying to adapt to a new life with her mother, now split from her father. Her dad meanwhile has difficulties accepting Jack.The film is rather bland. Of course the first portion of mother and son living in such distressing conditions is harrowing but Jack looks a little bit too healthy apart from his long hair. Joy only seems lost when she tries to fit in to her new circumstances once she has left the room.The film was rather underwhelming and uneventful. Jacob Tremblay gives a good performance.",6,0,2,11 February 2018
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Life is an adventure of your dreams
","Ben Stiller stars and directs The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Its based on a shirt story with Stiller playing a mild mannered negative processor for Life magazine who tends to space out as he lapses into daydreams. He dreams of adventure as his real life is so mundane.When Life magazine is shutting down he cannot find a negative for the final issue from ace adventurer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn.) A jerk of an executive brought in for the final days of Life magazine makes fun of him as he strives to find the negative.In search for the lost negative he travels the world to Greenland, Iceland, Himalayas. He escapes from a Volcano, plays soccer with kids in Afghanistan and views a snow leopard. As his adventure increases his confidence grows and the daydreams lessen.The film kind of starts out slow, we have those heroic daydreams, we see that Mitty is a kind of dullard. Nice guy but a bit of a loser. Yet he seemed to be an interesting teenager, he used to skate. Wait he can skate, that surely would be a plot point later in the film!The film is rather jagged, Once it gets going it does flow well at the latter part of the movie. The location shooting in the Nordic countries help. You can kind of predict the ending. There are a few good cameos with Sean Penn standing out in his few scenes.",5,0,1,6 November 2014
The Lion King," The Lion King
",Disney has decided to have live action remake of its classic cartoons with mixed critical results so far. The box office though has been very good.The Lion King is not even live action though. It is a CGI version of the 1994 animated movie.The Lion King cartoon was a kid friendly version of Hamlet. Young cub Simba's father is killed by evil brother Scar but Simba blames himself as he does not know the truth of what actually happened.I would have thought director Jon Favreau would had shaken up the story but it is almost a straight remake of the 1994 cartoon.However this remake has a longer running time and it showed. I felt listless as the movie went on. I realised the film lacked energy because it knew it was a bland copy.,4,2,2,31 March 2020
The Elephant Man," The Elephant Man
","Director David Lynch has made a moving film. Mainly because he chose to film this in black and white and added some surreal touches to it.It lends the film weight when it easily could be turned into a mawkish drama.Surrounded by top class talent. Freddie Francis was the cinematographer who had won an Oscar for his black and white movies. Anne Coates has won an Oscar for editing Lawrence of Arabia.John Merrick (John Hurt) was severely disfigured and exhibited in Victorian fairground shows. He was cruelly mistreated until rescued by Dr Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins.)Under his care, Merrick could express himself and even moved in London society circles. However there were always those who looked on him as a freak to be paraded in front of the public.Hurt gives an astonishing performance under layers of make up which took hours to apply. The make up is so effective and again the monochrome photography works so well with it.Hopkins also gives a compassionate performance, someone who sees Merrick as human but he is also negligent as well.Dr Treves might have just moved Merrick on to being a freak in polite society instead. He also had no inkling as to what was happening in the hospital in the evenings and Merrick was not telling.A lot of the story is made up, which is a weak point of the The Elephant Man. Token villains in order for it to have a three act structure.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
A Quiet Place," On Earth no one must hear you scream!
","I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved. This is a film that easily falls apart if you examine it carefully.However as a horror thriller, Krasinski makes it work to an extent. It is different and eerie with a lack of noise. The ending though is borrowed from Mars Attacks!",5,5,7,4 July 2018
22 Jump Street," Just like last time
","After the critical and commercial success of 21 Jump Street here is the inevitable sequel with a bigger budget, bigger sets and more bromance.22 Jump Street is just across the road from 21 Jump Street but this station is more hi tech. The duo of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) go back on the Jump Street program to work for the angry and shouty Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) but this time they go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as 'WHYPHY' that killed a college student photographed buying it on campus.The film makes a lot of references to the plotting of the previous film as if the film is making a statement that sequels tend to be a rehash of the original and not as good. In essence 22 Jump Street is a retread of the first film with this time jokes about how old they look as college students.Still the film is enjoyable enough, the gags still make you laugh, the cast seem to be having fun, there are enough action set pieces that some to be parodying the Fast and Furious films. The end credits scenes is inspired as they go through future sequel ideas including a cameo from another star from the original television series leading to the poster for Generations: Jump Street.",6,0,3,21 June 2016
Cars 2," Spys versus Cars
","Pixar animation has had a terrific run of films with a high emphasis on quality control. Cars was the one film to have had a decidedly mixed critical response but its international box office led to a sequel with Cars 2.Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel internationally to race in the World Grand Prix. To keep the international audience satisfied the action moves to Japan, London, Paris.However Mater gets caught up in some kind of conspiracy as British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates some untapped oil reserves owned by a group of 'lemon' cars. After being discovered, he is forced to flee and fake his death but mistakes Mater as an American spy who is roped into foiling the plot.Owen Wilson returns once again as Lightning McQueen with his cool, laid back tones but the focus shifts in the sequel to Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. However Mater is a country bumpkin and there is little room for character development. The plot is rather easy to guess, its fun, chugs along easily enough but not up to the usual Pixar standards.",5,0,0,22 July 2014

The Man Who Would Be King," The eye for the gold
","Directed by John Huston. When it was made it had no Oscar winning actors. Now it has three.The Man Who Would Be King benefits greatly from the chemistry between Michael Caine and Sean Connery.They play two scoundrels, British soldiers in 19th century India who go looking for adventure and riches.The film is framed by Peachy (Caine) narrating his story to Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer.)Peachy and his friend Daniel (Sean Connery) make a treacherous journey to the mountainous region of Kafristan that is located near Afghanistan. Daniel through luck or destiny is held to be a divine king by the tribal people in this region. A direct descendant of Alexander the Great.Peachy and Daniel see this as a way to loot all the treasures and make their way home to really live like kings. Daniel starts to take the king bit seriously, making pronouncements on various tribal issues like he was born to do it. The holy men suspect that Daniel might just be a mortal when he wants to take a wife to ensure his line of succession.The film is hokey fun but it does pull its punches with issues of colonialism. Ultimately it gives you the impression that the white man was born to rule.There are also dialect issues. Saeed Jaffrey plays Billy Fish who translates everything into Urdu even though the likelihood is that these tribes would not be able to understand him.Shakira Caine plays the love interest for Daniel. She looks uncomfortable which is reflected in her acting. They should had cast someone who was not married to Michael Caine.",6,1,6,10 February 2019

Call Me by Your Name," Summer of love
","Luca Guadagnino has made a leisurely paced tender gay love story. It is adapted by James Ivory who touched on gay themes in films such as Maurice that Ivory directed. The village summer holiday setting also reminded me of Before Midnight, people eating alfresco, drinking wine and getting into discussions about art or relationships.Set in the summer of 1983 in Northern Italy. Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is living in an idyllic house as he researches Greco-Roman artifacts. Each year he invites an intern, this summer Oliver (Arnie Hammer) arrives from America, he is 24 years old, clever, casual was easy going manner charms everyone around him. Both Pearlmans and Oliver are Jews. While Oliver wears a star of David, the Pearlmans are a bit more discrete in Italy. However they are a cultured family.The Pearlman's 17 year old son Elio (Timothee Chalamet) is musically gifted and like the rest of the family speaks several languages. Although Oliver easily finds it easy to get girls, while Elio rather gawkily tries to relate to them, as the summer wears on both become attracted to each other. Maybe rather awkwardly at first but it becomes more passionate.It is a sexual awakening for Elio, sowing of wild oats for Oliver, his last blush of youth. Elio's parents suspect that their is something blossoming between the two and tacitly approve of it. This is not a film that wants to cast eternal damnation to the protagonists, even though for Elio the ending is bittersweet. As the summer ends he knows Oliver will return to America.Call Me by Your Name is a literate film, it is slow, it is awkward, at times sensual.",6,3,6,5 February 2018

Walt is a former army veteran who fought in Korea and then worked for years in the Ford motor factory.Walt's neighbourhood are full of foreigners. He is racist towards his Hmong neighbours who came here from Vietnam. One of them young, meek Thao is dared by his gangster cousin to steal Walt's Gran Torino as an initiation right. Thao fails and comes first into conflict with Walt.When Thao is sent over by his family to do some chores for Walt as a punishment. Walt gets to understand the problems facing the young man and his family's plight.Gran Torino was an inexplicable hit in the USA. It obviously touched a nerve to those Tea Party types, who believe in things such as: Our country is going to the dogs. Make America Great Again by building American cars with white American workers. Cars built to last by workers living in safe white communities.It is a cynical and manipulative film. Eastwood holds his punches when it comes to racial insults. Walt's a racist but his racial insults are from the 1950s. Warner Brothers knew if you really insulted blacks and asians, then people would boycott the film.There is only one white youth we see in this film outside of Walt's family. He gets attacked by some black people and runs away leaving his Hmong girlfriend at the mercy of these young black guys. Good job Walt comes along.Walt's neighbours, the Hmong family gets attacked by a gang led by their cousin. It is never made clear why a family member would do this or even want some nerdy guy like Thao in the gang.The film is a mess.

The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker
","When The Hurt Locker was released. The joke was that if you see anyone famous in this film. They will be dead within 5 minutes.At the time no one knew Jeremy Renner or Anthony Mackie, future stalwarts of the Marvel blockbuster films.Set in Baghdad in 2004. William James (Jeremy Renner) is the replacement leader for the army bomb disposal unit. Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) finds James to be a maverick and reckless. Both men do not get on.James befriends a young Iraqi boy who he calls Beckham. He sells dodgy DVDs and likes to play football. James is concerned when he disappears. As the unit go about their high pressure work, they encounter civilians strapped with bombs and snipers.Director Kathryn Bigelow became the first female to win the best director Oscar. She was in competition with her ex husband James Cameron that year who was nominated for Avatar. She made the movie like it was a drama documentary with plenty of shaky camera work. The story is episodic, these guys lives are dangerous and pressurised. Death is just around the corner. The film works better with the then unknown cast. Actors like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes make cameo appearances. However the story in retrospect is shallow.The Hurt Locker is the more successful of the post second Iraq invasion cycle of movies. However it is hampered by its non critical approach. In some ways this mirrors Apocalypse Now, which displayed the madness surrounding its characters but is never explicitly was critical of the Vietnam war. This was left until the mid 1980s when films like Platoon were released.There is no debate as to whether these foreign invaders had any right to be here. This is a country in chaos with private contractors operating for money. You see Iraqi civilians at risk if they just to be happening to hold a mobile phone, stand at a rooftop. At one point a DVD market stall trader is attacked and a house of an academic is broken into because James has a suspicion.The upshot of the film is James when he is back at home in the USA is bored of shopping at the supermarket and wants to go back to Iraq. He craves the excitement, sod the people of Iraq.",6,2,2,18 November 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Walking the plank
","It is commonly agreed that The Curse of the Black Pearl was the best POTC film with its two sequels being almost unwatchable.I thought the fourth movie was actually an improvement to parts 2 & 3. Disney however continue to milk the franchise and Johnny Depp feels he has a duty to keep Captain Sparrow lookalikes in gainful employment as well as keeping his bank manager and divorce lawyers happy.Orlando Bloom returns as Will Turner in a short cameo appearance, it is his son, sailor Henry Turner who is searching for the Trident of Poseidon, an artefact which could free his father from his curse.Henry needs Captain Sparrow's help but everyone thinks that the Trident is a myth. Sparrow and Henry get help from a young female astronomer Carina Smyth who claims to have the map to the Trident.Captain Salazar and his undead band of sailors are after Captain Sparrow for revenge, Captain Barbossa also returns initially being forced to help Salazar.The plot is a mish mash of Salazar wanting his revenge and the search for a mythical item that everyone wants. In many ways it retreads the first film and also has elements of the sequels with elaborate comic action sequences, heavy use of CGI and some downright silliness.Thankfully the running time is shorter but it still feels bloated and boring. It is a sinking franchise, yet the film has nice special effects, some of the comedy does work and is still sporadically entertaining.",4,3,4,12 September 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," Out to sea
","Kathryn Bigelow known for action films at the time goes for more drama in K-19, based on true events.During the Cold War era of the early 1960s, the Russian unveil their flagship nuclear submarine but it seems the launch is premature with not enough testing and even safety equipment.Harrison Ford is Captain Alexei Vostrikov, brought in as a troubleshooter, a man who gets things done to replace the more popular Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) now demoted as Executive Officer. This leads to tension between the two as Ford seems to care more getting the sub more ship shape at the expense of the safety of the crew.Things take a turn for the worse as the nuclear reactor leaks and without adequate medication and safety suits, the crew members risk life and limb to save the sub.Submarine films such as this tend to be heavy going. The Hunt for Red October which came out in the early 1990s had a lot of tension and drama to alleviate this. Here things begin slowly as we see the politicians and the military chiefs wanting a show of strength from their new submarine and Ford getting to grips with a crew not quite ready and cursed with bad luck.The sub is well realised. Since the end of the cold war, a few Russian subs can be visited in museums such as San Diego for example and they really are claustrophobic and narrow.Once the sub starts to leak, the action cranks up, as some sailors risk their own lives to enter the leaking chamber, while Ford and Neeson clash as to whether to get help from the Americans. However the film is long and plodding in places.",6,0,1,21 October 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse Now
","The film begins in Ancient Egypt where En Sabah Nur is worshipped as a god. He is Apocalypse, the first mutant and he can amass the powers of other mutants.After an attempt to kill him goes wrong his followers awaken him in 1983 and Apocalypse recruits his four horsemen, a team of mutants that includes Magneto reeling from the death of his wife and child in the Polish forest and a young Storm who has been residing in Egypt. They intend to create a new world order by destroying the previous world first.Professor X and Raven have to lead a new team against them that includes Cyclops, new to the academy and who starts a teen romance with Jean Grey. Comic relief is provided by Nightcrawler who sports a Thriller style leather jacket.This is a bloated film with thin characterisation and even the 1980s period setting was rather empty in comparison of the sheen of First Class which was set in the 1960s. Do not get me started as to how Professor Xavier and Magneto do not age, these guys should be nearing 50 now and look nothing like Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan's older versions.The whole film is an empty spectacle. So Magneto just wants to live an ordinary working life but when he saves someone at a factory we know he can wave goodbye to his family.I even found the film rather morally dubious. We are in a scene set in a former Nazi concentration camp. Magneto asks Apocalypse where was he when his family were getting killed. Apocalypse mentions something like he was unable to help. Well something tells me with a name like Apocalypse he would had admired the havoc that the Nazi's created with the holocaust. After all he only plans to destroy the world himself, men, women, children, animal life, plant life and Magneto helps out as countless people die in the climax.The film has some nice touches, a zinger of a joke about the third film in the trilogy (which this is) never being as good as the younger X Men come out from watching Return of the Jedi in a cinema.The best scenes in the film is when the school is blown up, the students are saved by Quicksilver who literally just dropped by in a slow motion sequence set to the Eurythmics song 'Sweet Dreams.' However much of the film lacks resonance it is moderately entertaining but also a by the numbers action film. We think here we go again. Magneto has just killed millions but Professor X wants to see the good in him.",5,2,15,9 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The weakest web
","If The Amazing Spiderman from 2012 felt like an unnecessary reboot so soon after the original trilogy was completed then this sequel is not going raise much hope for this cycle of films.Andrew Garfield is certainly a zippy and smart Alec web spinner, Emma Stone is an appealing Gwen Stacy but then you rush into the villains where character development reminded more of Batman & Robin.Harry Osborn is introduced as the new heir of Oscorp and a good friend of Peter Parker, something not mentioned in the previous film. Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.",4,15,32,5 May 2014
Ex Machina," To be human
","Writer Alex Garland makes his directorial début in this low budget independent feature. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a top notch but geeky computer programmer who has won a competition to spend a week at an isolated retreat of reclusive, eccentric and wealthy AI engineer Nathan (Oscar Isaac.)Caleb's job is to evaluate by running certain tests on the robot Ava (Alicia Vikander) to determine whether she has human consciousness.Caleb and Nathan party, they drink, they dance but Nathan has also set down some ground rules and when he is testing Ava he is always watched and heard.What emerges is a game of cat and mouse as Ava engineers power outages to speak with Caleb alone and without Nathan able to see or hear them. Caleb is enchanted by Ava but there is a suspicion that Ava might be manipulating him. Vikander brings an intriguing and sensual performance.As for Nathan the way Isaac plays him here is a larger than life character but there is a dark underbelly, you always sense the beast within him will unleash at any moment. Yet there is a great physicality Isaac brings to the character like the way he moves and dances.Gleeson has to draw in the audience in as the every-geek, kind of wide eyed at first at this remote mountain hideout hanging around with a wealthy recluse but drawn in by Eva and slowly repelled by Nathan but he might just be too gullible because he never really asks any smart questions.The film goes back to a lot of robot/AI tropes that go back to the days of Isaac Asimov. In that sense it is as not original but Garland does give it an effective twist but I never felt it always engaged and hence why Garland added so many nudebots to keep the audience interested.",5,1,4,8 February 2016
Patton," Guts and glory
","Patton starts with a big opening scene with the backdrop of a huge American flag as General Patton (George C Scott) gives an inspirational monologue to the audience. What a way to start the movie.Patton was a much decorated warrior who loved the theatre of war, he believed in reincarnation as he said he was involved in some of the greatest battles of the past, an egoist who could inspire men to battle.Patton also had problem following orders himself, he was self absorbed, deluded, often getting into trouble especially when he slapped a battle fatigued soldier recovering in a hospital which troubled his subsequent career.Franklin J Schaffner's film won seven Oscars including best Picture. It is an epic film at times has a cast of thousands in the desert. It is a movie that was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. It is a film about war but we do not see many battles. There is a sequence where Patton's base is being bombed by a warplane and he goes outside to shoot at it with his pistols. Another later sequence we see of Patton advancing in France but it is just him driving through on his jeep.There are no side plots of heroic soldiers in close up battles. The film is about Patton and his many contradictions. It stands out because of Scott's performance, big and brash. He dominates the film only Karl Malden gets a whiff to be memorable, the British soldiers are portrayed as stiff bores.The film was regarded as anti-war. It is not. There is a moment in this film when Patton exclaims 'I love it, God help me, I do love it. I love it more than my life.' The script was co-written by Francis Coppola, these lines would be later riffed by him for Apocalypse Now for Colonel Kilgore. Like Kilgore, Patton would walk to the battlefield knowing he will not die. As soldiers in his command remarked in real life, 'our blood, his glory.' The film is beautifully shot for the big screen but it is a bloated epic clocking at nearly three hours long and at times it comes across as stodgy.",6,1,7,2 November 2016
La Grande Illusion," Longing to leave
","When I saw the ending of this film, I realised I saw this film as a boy many decades ago.Jean Renoir's, La Grande Illusion is set during The Great War. The film was made in 1937 and so its depiction of the Germans has not been tainted with the actions of the Nazis in World War 2.The story begins with two French officers, Lieutenant Marichal (Jean Gavin) and Captain De Boeldueu (Pierre Fresnay) taken to a Prisoner of War camp where the inmates have been digging a tunnel. After several attempts to escape, the French officers get sent to a castle high up the mountains run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim.) He is an intimidating looking, flamboyant but courteous officer we met earlier on in the film who treated the captured French officers very civilly.Rauffenstein sees in De Boeldueu an old way of life run by the aristocracy which is now at risk with the growing middle class in Europe with their newly acquired wealth. There are many times we know that De Boeldueu's word as an officer counts more to Rauffenstein.The film as another sub text about people in this camp trying to get along with people of different classes, religion, colour and nationality. One of the person Marichal will eventually escape with is a French Jew, one of the inmates in the camp who is ignored at times by the officers is black. When Marechal is leaving the first camp he tries to tell the incoming British officers about the tunnel they have been digging it falls to deaf ears as they cannot understand French.The inmates are united as they plan to escape, dig the tunnel and hide the dirt. They feel camaraderie when the British officers boost morale by putting on a stage show and the looks on their faces when one of them appears in drag for the first time, highlighting the fact that they have not seen a female for months or years.The film is in French but has a smattering of German and English. In some ways the film set the template for the second world war POW films like The Great Escape but this movie dos not have the tense excitement of such an action film that would follow three decades later. Then again it is more than just a film about prisoners escaping, more a character piece which also makes the film slightly stage bound and even slow moving at times.",6,3,5,31 October 2016
Grudge Match," Rocky Lite
","In the Mid 1970s Stallone struck oil with Rocky and a few years later De Niro won an Oscar for playing legendary boxer Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. A part where he reached physical fitness and trained as a boxer and then later piled on the pounds to play La Motta in later life.This teaming up of two icons comes across as Rocky lite with only Bill Conti's iconic Rocky Theme missing.Things do not start off too well as we see these guys in their younger years as boxers in their prime but CGI is provided by a Playstation 2!However things step up when this two rivals agree to a boxing rematch. Stallone is the one who left his ring career behind, lost his fortune and works hard for a living and feels the financial incentive is the only reason for this sideshow.De Niro who has a bar and is financially comfortable is motivated by revenge and still bitter. His character even hit it with Stallone's girlfriend years earlier (Kim Basinger) and made her pregnant and is all for the rematch to prove a point.We are then left with these old has been getting ready for the fight. Stallone ropes in his old trainer (Alan Arkin) whereas De Niro needs to convince LL Cool J to give him some training and finally ends up with his new found son he had with Basinger training him.As they near the fight De Niro gets too spend time with his son and grandson and bonds with them both whilst Basinger and Stallone also rekindle their relationship. At the same time their promoter Kevin Hart does a good job in reviving media interest in this grudge match as the fight moves to a bigger arena.The film is actually more likable that I thought it would be as both actors take to the script in the right spirit. Not too seriously and not too lightly. Its still a rehash with Stallone dealing with similar themes of an old boxer stepping into the limelight a few years ago in Rocky Balboa, so it just looks too familiar. Even Arkin's curmudgeon is not that far removed from his Oscar winning role in Little Miss Sunshine.",6,0,0,12 April 2014
Transformers," Robot wars
","One of Orson Welles last film roles was The Transformers Movie, an animated film in 1986. It was regarded as a low point to go out on. However in the cinematic world the name Transformers have been transformed thanks to Michael Bay kick starting the franchise and the original is the best so far.Direction wise this has all the Bay trademarks, swirling photography, stirring music and pumping action scenes with state of the art CGI. There is even some sly digs at the all powerful government agencies abusing the extent of their powers.The plot is straightforward. Shia Labeouf is a nerd who buys a car that transforms to a robot, his grandfather once made a discovery and now two gangs of robots are beating the hell out of each other. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are the good guys. The bad guys are the Decepticons and they are after the cube of power called the All Spark. The film is not as flimsy and indulgent as the sequels. There is plenty of action, explosions and humour in this one and it all blends well to be a good popcorn film.",7,0,3,12 March 2015
Wimbledon," New balls please
","The advent of Andy Murray has badly aged these type of films. When you have a true life British Wimbledon champion, you care less about a fictional one.This film gets served regularly during Wimbledon fortnight. It is a passable rom-com starring an actor who is rather unsuited to the genre.Paul Bettany plays Peter Colt, a has been British tennis player about to call it a day. He has a wildcard for Wimbledon and at his hotel he encounters rising American tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) who is coached by her father (Sam Neill.)What starts as flirting ends up being a bit more serious, the upside being Peter starts to win, he gains the attention of the British public and his agent (Jon Favreau.)It is a likeable film but it is rather bland and also by the numbers with very little comedy.",5,2,4,8 July 2018
Magic Mike XXL," Extra small
","I thought Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 would be the most horrendous sequel I will see this year. It already has had a scornful review from me but hold on, here is a late contender.Well my wife fell asleep watching this which basically tells you all you need to know about this garbage.The first Magic Mike was directed by an Oscar winning director, had a story even though the script and characters were clichéd and had some arty shots with too much yellow as Steven Soderbergh tried to present his movie as some kind of experimental film with a lot of male flesh.The sequel has no Soderbergh, no Matthew McConaughey and no script. What we get are a bunch of guys yakking, some very annoying hip hop music and the dancing is not interesting or sexy and I am sure even the females would be bored with the lack of flesh or just not interested to see wrestler Kevin Nash baring even his chest.This is a cash in of the most cynical kind. I hope Channing Tatum who also served as a producer feels a smidgen of shame.",1,1,2,19 November 2015
Hidden Figures," The right stuff
","Hidden Figures is a starchy film based on true facts of the role three black women who were mathematicians played in getting the first American, John Glenn into space.Taraji P Henson plays Katherine Johnson, brilliant at calculations regarding flight trajectories. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who quickly learns to program the new IBM computers, yet she is not allowed to borrow advanced books from the local library and Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson who strives to be accepted at an accredited all white college so she can become an aerospace engineer.The women just encounter indifference at NASA given various tasks but thing come to a head when Katherine is promoted to work with a core group of scientists and mathematicians who want to send the first man to space until they are beaten to it by the Soviets. They work under fair but firm disciplinarian Al Harrison (Kevin Costner.)However even amongst this elite group she encounters prejudice, she is not regarded to be up to the task, belittled and even ignored. She even has to use her own separate kettle as the main one is for whites only and of course she has walk half a mile to use the blacks only toilet which is in another section of NASA.So here is an example of why I found this film to be infuriatingly hokey. Harrison would constantly come out of his office and asks for Katherine but she is never there and no one answers him where she is. The reason for her whereabouts is that she has gone to the blacks only toilet. This seemingly goes on for months until one day Harrison summons Katherine and asks her why she is never at her post and she lets loose of how she cannot use the toilet in the building and her colleagues watch in silence.The whole thing was just so bluntly done. So Harrison never noticed the blacks only kettle in the office or that the only black person in the team might encounter prejudice or wait weeks to find out why she needs to pop out for so long and also did not admonish other staff for being so insensitive or team leaders such as Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) for being prejudiced.Despite being entertaining and even inspirational I just thought Hidden Figures was so poorly written and structured. The cast made the most out of the material though.",3,19,44,6 February 2017
Coco," Remember Me
","I never really knew much about the Day of the Dead until I saw the Bond movie Spectre which created a fictional parade for this important event.Coco deals with the more intimate aspects and its importance in Mexican culture. Little Miguel wants to be a musician and not a cobbler like the rest of the family.Miguel's grandmother Coco who is now senile had a musician father who abandoned his family to pursue his dream of musical success. Coco's mother was so incensed with her husband running off that music was forbidden in the household.Miguel who wants to take part in a talent contest runs away from his family only to end up in the land of the dead. If Miguel can meet up with his musical hero and get him to say the right words in time, he could return to the land of the living.This Pixar animation has a very colourful and a revered depiction of the Mexican culture of remembering those that have passed on. The songs were a bit weak though and I did think the story was rather predictable, the main twist was obvious. Yet I found this to be a very moving and emotional film.",8,0,0,20 August 2018
1917," 1917
","Sam Mendes has made a technically bravura film which looks like one long take. Something he experimented with at the beginning of his James Bond movie, Spectre.Made by Dreamworks, the company's first shot for the Best Picture Oscar was Saving Private Ryan in 1998.The story is about two soldiers in World War One. Their mission is to make their way across no man's land, the abandoned German lines and reach the advancing Allied troops. They have to deliver a message ordering them not to attack as they are walking into a trap set by the Germans who want to give the impression that they are retreating.One of the soldiers has good reason to take this perilous mission. His brother is part of the Allied group and is in danger. Therefore the story owes a nod to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Impressively photographed by Roger Deakins, it sets out to show the dirty horrors of trench warfare. The story though is slight and gets lost with the style of filmmaking that Mendes has employed.I thought it lacked the verve of Peter Weir's Gallipoli, a film which I kept thinking off when I watched 1917. This might be the reason that although it went into the Oscars as a frontrunner, it lost out on the main prizes.",6,18,41,23 January 2020
Lincoln," The race for the 13th Amendment
","The title of the film implies that this is a biography of the 16th President of the USA. It really is about the adoption of the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal as federal law.The action takes place after Lincoln's re-election during the month of January of 1865 before the new elected politicians take their seats.After four years of Civil War, the North might be close to victory, but before the seceded states rejoin the union, the President needs to pass the 13th Amendment or the war would had been meaningless as the Southern states would still continue to have slavery in some form.So it needed to be outlawed at the federal level.Abraham Lincoln uses political manoeuvrings to get the law passed. The interesting aspect of the film is James Spader and his cohorts (very much the precursor to the modern spin doctors) using patronage, bribes and other inducements to get Democrats to vote for the amendment.However the film becomes scenes after scenes of politicians talking, gesturing, making speeches.Daniel Day Lewis is fine as Lincoln but I would not say it particularly deserved an Oscar. Although these days he just need to appear on screen to get an Oscar nomination.Although he is about the same age as Lincoln at the time of the film's setting he looks too young to be Lincoln.Some hysterical commentators even said he sounded like Lincoln without much evidence for this.To give him character we have way too many scenes of Lincoln telling homespun stories that just drag and drag. At one point one of the Senators complains about his stories and leaves.Even I was praying for John Wilkes Booth to show up early as Lincoln told another pointless folksy tale!There is some attempt to placate the critics from the Southern states as Lincoln discusses how he might have overstepped his powers in declaring war with the south.In that respect it mirrors the political machinations shown in the recent Robert Redford directed, The Conspirator which dealt with the aftermath of the Lincoln assassination.To give Lincoln a rounded characterisation we have some scenes of his family life. His wife played by Sally Field mourns the loss of one of their children.Lincoln is and playing in the White House with their youngest son. Plus we have scenes of his eldest son wanting to fight in the war but prevented by his parents to his frustrations.This scenes are mildly diverting but Sally Field is miscast as she is too old (9 years older than Day-Lewis) and she looks botoxed.The film is nicely crafted, well acted, great wigs and facial hairs. It tries to make politics interesting although the general viewer not familiar with US politics from that era would be left bewildered that it is the Democrats (the party that gave the USA, its first black President) supporting slavery with the Republicans being abolitionists.I am sure Spielberg was greatly tempted to add the line, 'one day they might even be a black President!'However it is a long film, not well written with too much clunky speeches, the screenplay never really catches fire.Just look at the scene near the end when Tommy Lee Jones (one of the most fervent supporters of equality) walks home with the Amendment Bill and as he enters the house, most people can guess what will happen next.",5,1,3,23 January 2014
Sing Street," Teenage kicks
","Sing Street is a feelgood teen film that is obviously inspired by those 1980s John Hughes teen comedy.Fourteen year old Conor Lawlor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) parent's are facing money worries and relationship troubles. He has to move schools and ends up in a severe Christian school. Brother Baxter picks on him because he dos not wear the correct black shoes and he also falls foul of the school bully.He makes friends with fellow schoolmate Darren and they together decide to form a band. Pretty wannabe model Raphina shoots the band's video as they aim to play at the end of term school concert. Conor falls for the slightly older Raphina but she already has a boyfriend.Sing Street has a light plot and thin characterisation. Everyone wants to live a better life and not the one their parents have. Raphina wants to run away to London even with no money. It did feel like bits of other similar movies put together.When it comes to a place and time, the film is all over the place. At one point Conor's family watch Duran Duran's video of Rio and act like it's the first time they are seeing the band. So you think it is 1982. Then you have A-ha's Take on Me and mention of Back to the Future so it must be late 1985 or 1986. Then you get Starship's We built this City that was released in 1987. Then there is Conor's brother mentioning priests abusing kids. It might not even be in the 1980s at all.",5,1,2,14 April 2019
Big Hero 6," Watch out for Stan
","It starts off with young Hiro Hamada taking part in underground robot parts in San Fransokyo. Hiro's brother Tadashi wants him to do something useful and get away from the lowlifes involved in the robot fights.Hiro is introduced to a giant medical robot Baymax that Tadashi is developing at university and is introduced to Professor Callaghan, the head of robotics. Hiro creates microbots that he brings to a science fair to impress the professor and enrol at the university. A shady businessman is interested in buying the micropbots off Hiro.When a fire erupts at the science fair Tadashi dies trying to save the professor. Some time later Hiro, Baymax and a solitary microbot battles with a masked man who made a copy of the microbots. Hiro suspects that the fire may had been started deliberately in order to steal the microbots.Hiro teams up with a group of clever students who were friends with his brother and they use their skills to become superheroes to stop the masked man.Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel Comic character. It blends its animation style with Japanese Anime. Kids will lap it up, Baymax who looks a bit like the Michelin Man is the moral heart of the story as he drums an anti violence message to Hiro.However this is another Disney animation that almost seems like by the numbers with the predictable twist when it comes to the reveal of the villain.",6,1,1,25 August 2019
Dumb and Dumber," Fun but not funnier
","Dumb and Dumber is regarded as a classic of the stupid, simpleton type of comedies. Its unusual casting because although Jim Carrey was an upcoming comedy actor, his co-star Jeff Daniels was known for serious film roles.Despite the gross stupidity on display our two protagonists have heart. Lloyd (Jim Carrey) drives a woman to the airport and retrieves a bag she left at the terminal, with his friend Harry (Jeff Daniels) they go to Aspen to deliver it.However the woman was delivering a ransom as her husband was kidnapped and Lloyd took the bag just before the kidnappers could get it. The kidnappers follow our hapless heroes.Twenty years ago this was very funny and influential leading to a glut of similar but more gross comedies. With a belated sequel now released, I decided to re-watch Dumb and Dumber and sadly its not stood the test of time. I watched it with my kids who did not find it funny and they know who Jim Carrey is.Looking back at it the comedy seems mild, the scenes could had been funnier. It has a charm, still made me smile but not laugh out loud.",6,0,3,17 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It is still a retread
","In terms of visuals, The Last Jedi is the best looking Star Wars film, shiny bright, wonderful use of monochrome and then adding splashes of red in the climactic battle.It is also overlong, flabby, takes an age to get going and at times feels dull. Just as The Force Awakens made you feel that it was a loose remake of Star Wars: A New Hope. At times you feel an air of The Empire Strikes Back here especially when you see the Imperial Walkers in the desert and the rebels being on the run.The Last Jedi has three subplots. Rey (Daisy Ridley) who has the element of the Force about her meeting Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who has become embittered and reluctant to help the rebels or Rey although he senses the Force is strong in her. Rey of course wants to find out more about her parents but she is also psychically linked to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who himself struggling with his own identity on the dark side. Then there are the resistance ships being hunted by the First Order. With General Leia (Carrie Fisher) sidelined, there is tension between impetus hot shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) as to how to evade the First Order firepower when you are running on fumes.Finn (John Boyega) the ex-stormtrooper teams up with a clever mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to go aboard the enemy ship after first finding a master code breaker to disable their tracking system. Finn might be impressed by the high class casino full of wealthy arms dealers when searching for the master code breaker but Rose schools him on the inequalities of life.The film needed to be sharper, it needed a story that was zippy. What we got is a film that tried to be thoughtful but instead became portentous.",5,15,23,20 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Escape
","With Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has gone to the C list of their comic book heroes. Otherwise who the hell are these people unless you truly are a comic book geek.In 1988 a young Peter Quill soon after his mother's death is abducted from Earth by some space pirates. 26 years later Quill is now also known as Star Lord and also a space pirate steals a powerful orb and forms an uneasy alliance with a group of extraterrestrial misfits who are being pursued by Ronan the Accuser.I watched this film twice, the first time I was underwhelmed with it but the kids liked it who were keen to watch it on the big screen. On my second viewing I appreciated the film more. Its an entertaining and anarchic B movie, fast and frenetic but it also felt messy and incoherent and also tricky to get into.Having watched the other Marvel characters where you are introduced into the world of Thor or Iron Man or Captain America here you sometimes feel that you have ended up in someone's party uninvited and no amount of 1970s music will make you feel at home. Its difficult to work out the motivation between some of the characters and the antagonism such as Quill and Yondu.The film takes it cue from some post modern Star Wars mixed with Indiana Jones in space. The CGI characters Groot and Rocket just about work in the film. I still not sure whether its Bradley Cooper voicing it as he sounds so different because he plays him as a more lovable Joe Pesci gangster type.However a bunch of misfits who argue and mistrust each other before putting away their differences and uniting to fight a common foe was played out in The Avengers film.",5,3,7,25 April 2015

","Five young people enter a remote cabin in the woods. One of them, Mia is due to go cold turkey from her heroin addiction.One of them discovers the Book of the Dead and recites from it despite warnings not to. A malevolent force arises and possesses Mia at first.The film had an interesting opening sequence with a lady chanting in Welsh. The film could pass as a subtext of drug addiction and going cold turkey.The Evil Dead remake is certainly splattered with blood, gore and violence. However it is a generic horror film. It lacks Sam Raimi's style, wittiness and Bruce Campbell's swagger.",3,2,5,21 April 2019
The Imitation Game," Breaking the code
","This film is supposedly based on the life of Alan Turing (adapted from a biography of his life). A pioneer in computer science, mathematician and cryptologist. During the war he as part of a team was involved in breaking the code, the Enigma Code that is.The character of Alan Turing tends to pop up in other novels and films usually in the periphery such as the Robert Harris fictional novel Enigma.The real Alan Turing's story had a tragic ending as he was arrested for homosexuality in the 1950s when it was illegal and committed suicide. Over the years pressure have been on to rehabilitate Turing's name. There is a road in Manchester named after him, his work in the field of computers and code-breaking in World War 2 eventually led to a posthumous pardon.The Imitation Game cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and right from the early scenes we see our modern day Sherlock playing a genius like he was another Sherlock Holmes. Clever, insufferable, a loner, arrogant.I thought I would let that slide but the the script which has won the best adapted screenplay Oscar was I am afraid a ham-fisted clunker. It was determined to make the story uninteresting, dull and blah blah blah predictable. It is also probably far away from the actual true story. Just when you thought it was getting better it goes back to its default bad mode.For example when they do crack the code, the team start fighting and arguing and then one of them has a brother who just happens to be on a ship in the Atlantic which might get attacked.Then there is the communist double agent, but hold on there was a double agent in the fictional novel Enigma. It looks like that was added for dramatic effect.Then there is the ludicrous scene where the Commander and his cronies forcibly start to attack the code breaking machine having no idea what it does and wants to go back to manual code breaking when we have been already told that would take millions of years to succeed. It might had helped if it was explained to the audience how the machine worked.The real Turing also had a stutter which in this film is portrayed as being very mild. I much prefer Derek Jacobi's interpretation of Turing in the play and film, Breaking the Code where the stutter was more pronounced.The film is just clichéd rubbish and I was genuinely disappointed as to how poor it was and that it got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar which is very much undeserved.",1,54,82,4 March 2015
8 Mile," Lose Yourself
","In 8 Mile, Eminem is Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith a slightly fictionalised version of himself living in a working class neighbourhood of Detroit. Rabbit has moved back to his trailer thrash mum (Kim Basinger) after a break up with his girlfriend. Rabbit works hard, his friend gets him gigs to engage in rap battles in clubs where he is dubbed as Elvis, AKA as a white guy trying to sell a piece of black culture. The trouble is Rabbit gets overcome with nerves every time he tries to perform in front of a crowd and take his rival down.8 Mile is an underdog story as the working class guy makes good with the help of his multi racial friends.Director Curtis Hanson uses all his Oscar winning skills to try to sell this as a real, gritty film. Eminem is rather flat swerving somewhere between mournful and angry. Each time he goes to his mother's house it ends up in some sort of a fight. Basinger never convinces as a rough lower working class mom type.The script wants to be a modern version of Saturday Night Fever but it lacks that film's showboating.",5,0,3,19 February 2018
Ip Man," Kung Fu Master
","Ip Man is a heavily fictionalised biopic of the founder of Wing Chun style of Kung Fu and someone who went on to become a mentor to Bruce Lee.Ip man is a wealthy family man in 1930s China and a reluctant teacher who we see initially combat with his fellow martial art masters from rival schools who want to see for themselves how they are in comparison.When a rival bully from the north turns up and beats up all the kung fu masters in the town, it is left to Ip man to defend the town's honour as he humiliates the upstart who wants to start his own rival martial arts school.Once the Japanese invade China, Ip man descends into poverty especially when his wife becomes ill. He gets a labouring job and finds out that other kung fu masters are getting involved in duels with the Japanese platoon for an extra bag of rice. Ip man angrily takes on 10 Japanese soldiers and beats them up when he finds out that one of the kung fu masters was shot dead by one of the soldiers.This display puts him in a collision course with General Miura, the Japanese's top exponent of karate and the man who organises the combat bouts with the Chinese kung fu masters and wants to prove himself against Ip man.The film is certainly well made with good production values and art direction. The martial arts does not have the over the top choreography and wire work of many other recent Chinese or Hong Kong films.There are some references to the Bruce Lee action films such as teaching the factory workers to fight in order to defend themselves against the same bully who beat up all the other kung fu masters.The film is certainly restrained and lacks the histrionics of other martial art films, even General Miura is portrayed as more honourable than the other Japanese officers.However it is not a true story. The real Ip man was an opium addict and plagued with money problems.",6,1,1,22 June 2016
Jerry Maguire," You had me at hello
","Jerry Maguire is a feel good romantic drama which surfed a zeitgeist wave in the mid 1990s and coined catchphrases such as 'Show me the money' 'You had me at hello' and 'You complete me.'Tom Cruise plays the successful sports agent Jerry Maguire who upsets his bosses with a mission statement such as having less clients in order to serve them better. His rival at the firm has to fire him and then compete for all his clients.Maguire is only left with one client, a mouthy, flamboyant football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr) who is upset that he is not getting the top endorsement deals. Maguire also is also chasing a hot shot player for the draft and thinks he has bagged him only to be snatched away by his rival.Maguire starts out at the bottom with Tidwell and Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother and one of the assistants from the sports agency who has followed him. Dorothy and Jerry fall in love but we are not sure if he genuinely confused her loyalty with love.Maguire needs to persuade Tidwell to play football with his heart and not think about endorsements or why other players are earning more. Tidwell shows loyalty and friendship to Maguire but in the football field he comes across as shallow and selfish. A reason why Maguire is struggling to get a lucrative contract deal for him.Jerry Maguire is actually a corny film, Cuba Gooding jr provides the laughs but the romance angle is very cheesy.At the end Maguire is successful because of the one to one relationship he has with his only client which other sports player are envious of.I saw this film again after 20 years because part of the scenes were featured in The Lego Batman Movie, the implication being some of the lines are hackneyed.",6,1,1,22 February 2017
Here Comes the Boom," Boomed to fail
","If you are an Adam Sandler fan then this might be for you as it stars Kevin James, a Sandler regular along with Henry Winkler and director Franck Coraci who has directed several Sandler films.James plays a bored Biology teacher, Scott Voss who is spurred on to raise money for the music teacher job that is under threat.Voss does some night teaching which gives him an idea to do some Mixed Martial Arts as an easy but painful way to raise the necessary funds.Although Voss looks out of shape we are told that he used to be a decent wrestler in his youth.You then get several bouts of hilarious beatings, so brutal that even Rocky Balboa would had quit whilst shouting 'no mas.' Someone should had mentioned to the co-writer and star Kevin James that MMA is regarded as being even more brutal than boxing.It is an amiable and sporadically amusing movie. James is likable with his heart in the right place who steps up to save Winkler's job. There is a side plot where he romances Salma Hayek (we live in a universe where Hayek is single, lonely and available!)The plot is simple, the fights are brutal where Voss should be left paralysed, especially with the last fighter Ken Dietrich the performer playing him (a real life MMA star) is magnificent.The disappointing box office showed that this was only a half developed idea.",5,4,8,7 September 2013
Jurassic World," Back to Amber
","Jurassic Park from 1993 was a landmark film that mixed state of the art CGI into a rip roaring disaster film based on the novel by Michael Crichton where the author ripped off his earlier film, Westworld and director Steven Spielberg added some liberal helping from his monster smash, Jaws.The sequels were lukewarm, even Spielberg who directed Jurassic Park 2 struggled to deliver a worthy follow up adventure. Universal Pictures plans for a fourth instalment was on hold for many years until Jurassic World was released to record breaking box office.Here we have billionaire Industrialist Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan) running Jurassic World along the lines of John Hammond's legacy. To bring back dinosaurs to life in a safe environment and visitors to enjoy themselves. However to keep visitor numbers up the park needs to innovate bigger, newer and cooler creatures.Dr Wu (B D Wong who presumably did not get eaten in the first Jurassic Park) returns as a more sinister scientist who has mixed and cooked up new DNA to create Indominus Rex, a dinosaur who is big, cunning and has some kind of superpowers. I can only think that Dr Wu got hold of some Predator DNA from a passing Arnold Schwarzenegger. How the creature escapes from her pen is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs in the way she fooled her keepers.Bryce Dallas Howard is workaholic executive Claire making sure the park runs efficiently and at a profit. She does not even have time to spare for her two nephews who are visiting the park and staying over with her for a few days.When the IR goes loose in the park its up to Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire armed with high heels to come to the rescue of the kids in peril and the park in general. Owen we presume is a sometimes boyfriend of Claire, A navy seal and dinosaur trainer as he seems to have trained Velociraptors like trained dogs. The same Raptors we have been told in earlier films were ruthless, cunning and effective killing creatures. Now they follow orders leading to a ludicrous side plot of having some independent defence contractor hatching a plan to train Raptors for military use in third world countries.I think Universal is confident that this film will not play in Afghanistan given a region of that country is specifically named in and where its people (already ravaged since 1979 by various wars) would be eaten by the said dinosaurs. I will take this opportunity to remind people I used to gain a dubious pleasure in watching Universal movies specifically to see how long would it be before the black guy died. In fact in the first Jurassic Park, Samuel Jackson did not last long!Now the film is an enjoyable ride, finally we have a functioning theme park with dinosaurs and those scenes look great because part of the movie was actually filmed in a disused theme park. The CGI dinosaurs look good but its noticeable some of the climactic scenes were set in the dark.Directed by relatively newbie Colin Trevorrow who has only previously made one notable indie film directs in an efficient manner but without any of the Spielberg flair (nothing like kids climbing over a fence to escape the dinosaurs but unbeknown to them, the electricity is coming back on.) Marvel Films have shown that these days almost any competent director can shoot a blockbuster action film, after all even that Shakespearean legend Kenneth Branagh has directed a blockbuster superhero film.There is a big problem with the screenplay. Its purely a functional plot lacking in any imagination. It gets to it destination in almost robotic manner. There is hardly any characterisation we know nothing about our heroes except what we can gather from a few broad strokes. Compare this with how we get to know Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough's characters in Jurassic Park, even some of the minor characters were well drawn like Wayne Knight. Here zilch, they are merely to function as heroes or dinosaur fodder.Apart from the preposterous plot about training Raptors for military purposes the whole IR going loose story is based on people entering its pen before determining from its implanted tracker device where the hell she is in the first place.I think Universal is pleased that such a slipshod script has turned out to be a monster hit.",6,2,7,12 July 2015
World Trade Center," Disaster day
","On September 11th Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno are sent to the WTC when the first plane crashes. As they try to evacuate people, the Towers collapse and McLoughlin and Jimeno are trapped in the debris whilst their fellow officers are killed instantly or die soon after.I expected World Trade Center to be a rescue film as heroic policemen or more accurately Nicolas Cage goes and try to rescue people from the rubble. Not that they themselves are trapped in the rubble with most of the film taking place in the dark as the rest of the film deals in emotional turmoil of their families cross cutting with the trapped policemen in peril with salvation arriving in the form of a religious, zany and rather on the edge Marine who speaks in slogans. We are told at the end of the film that the marine later did two tours of duty in Iraq (a country which by the way had nothing to do with 9/11 but I am sure the way the character is presented in this film gleefully took vengeance on the Iraqi people!)The films is based on a true story and not a tale I knew about as I came to this film with little knowledge of the plot. Oliver Stone is more restrained in his directing style (keep the camera moving is his motto!) and the film does present challenges for Stone.This ranges from his left wing views that is tempered here, to being respectful to the 9/11 events and this true story of the rescue but also the technical challenge of re-enacting the disaster. Obviously they have created a CGI Twin Towers in the establishing shots of New York and then used archive footage of the aftermath of the incident and the Towers with the plot of the film although not successfully integrated.The film conveys the confusion that occurred on that day but pacing is a problem especially when the police team are literally walking to the disaster area and of course when they are later trapped it is then just two guys talking to keep each other going which of course makes the story drag but its also devoid of tension.",5,1,3,23 May 2014
Black Hawk Down," Super Six-Four
","Ridley Scott directs a muscular retelling of the ill fated mission in the Somalian civil war in 1993. Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared war on the remaining UN personnel and US forces were deployed to capture Aidid.As always Scott assembles a multi-national cast and future rising stars to tell his story without resorting to war movie clichÃ©s. This is a full on assault with bullets flying as the crew of the downed helicopter stave off the Somali militia as their comrades try to extract them whilst other US soldiers try to reach the safety of the UN safe zone.It very much tells the story from the soldiers view and gives a more realistic impression of conflict. It dwells little on the politics but focuses on action but also mixes this with humour even if it might be of the bleak kind. Eric Bana, Josh Harnett give the best performances and good support provided by Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner and Orlando Bloom.This is a strong film, not for the faint-hearted.",7,1,2,16 April 2014
Prisoners," Loki the detective
","I knew so little about this film before I watched it, I really thought at first it would be a Prison movie! The title is a metaphor.Prisoners has shades of Mystic River. It starts during the holidays in a small working town community where two young girls disappear believed to be abducted or worse.A suspect is found and later released by the police. One of the parent abducts and systematically tortures him.Meanwhile the detective assigned to the case methodically works the case and realises that this case may have links to the past.The film is long, harrowing in places and builds a lot of tension but it keeps you glued to the screen, that is no mean feat.It may have flaws with some convenient coincidences as well as some red herrings to keep you off track.Hugh Jackman is the father who takes the law into his own hands, aided by a more reluctant Terrence Howard who is the father of the other child that has been abducted.Jackman is the religious, hard working every-man whose raw anger threatens to tip him over the edge.Jake Gyllenhaal stands out with his tattoos as the methodical Detective Loki, he is more smarter than he looks.Roger Deakins moody cinematography adds a lot of atmosphere to this film which is very well acted by its ensemble cast.",7,0,0,25 January 2014
Silence," To apostate
","Martin Scorsese has made a personal epic which he has wanted to make for years. Silence is an adaptation of Shusaku Endo's 1966 historical novel. The trouble is the older Scorsese is not in the peak of his filmmaking skills and this film is uneven even muddled.Despite some nice photography of Taiwan standing in for feudal Japan, I hesitate to even call it a visual epic, the script is laborious which no amount of praise for the film by Pope Francis can make you overlook it.Jesuits priests brought Christianity to parts of Japan in the mid 16th century but it soon became unwelcome. It seems the Japanese became wary of the ulterior motives of some of these missionaries. In the 1630s, Christianity was banned and those who practised the religion were persecuted.Silence follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver) who make a treacherous journey to Japan to find out what happened to their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is believed to have renounced his faith. The two priests regard the claims as a slander and want to find out for themselves.When they arrive they discover enclaves of hidden Christians practising their faith in secret and then witness the torture and persecution of the peasants when they are caught that includes being beheaded, drowned, burnt alive and crucified. It is only now they realise the true plight and dangers that Christians in Japan face.Rodrigues is caught and his inquisitor wants to make an example of him like they did with his mentor. He is taunted to publicly renounce his faith in order to save the lives of others or let them die horrifically and enter martyrdom. Rodrigues gets visions of Jesus and wonders about the virtues of being flexible in his beliefs.The question the film repeatedly asks is whether Christianity can flourish in a swamp. Well Christianity did spread in south and central America, but there the Jesuits and others forcibly converted people and killed or enslaved those who refused. The casting of Liam Neeson just invites people to recall the more superior film, The Mission.",6,1,4,21 January 2017
Logan," Shane-X
","Logan is an overlong X-Men spin off, the final part of the Wolverine trilogy. A cross country, western that marks the final days of the main X-Men characters.The story is based on Mark Millar's 'Old Man Logan' and it takes place in 2029 where mutants are almost extinct and the X-Men have disbanded.Logan works as a chauffeur in El Paso and his powers are weakening and he is ageing. He regularly crosses the border to Mexico where he looks after the infirmed Professor X (Patrick Stewart) whose powers are also waning and he is becoming senile and has erratic seizures.Logan is approached by a nurse for biotechnology company, Transigen, who wants Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl called Laura to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden.' Logan reluctantly accepts after he is offered lots of money, but the nurse is soon killed and Laura, Logan and Professor X are pursued by goons from Transigen.The company bred mutant children using the DNA samples of mutants. Laura has powers similar to that of Logan because she was created from his DNA.The film starts off really slowly and has pacing issues throughout the film, not helped by the length of the film. When the action arrives it is fast, furious and hard edged. This is the most violent X-Men film, ironic considering that one of the main character is a child.",5,7,15,13 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers return
","The first Avengers film was a fun popcorn film, it helped that it had a fiendishly fun villain in Loki.Age of Ultron begins in the middle of an action sequence with all the Avengers assembled and it is the first of several prolonged action scenes in the film. It reminded me of Man of Steel, a lot of wanton destruction in one film which just becomes dull after a while.The plot, Tony Stark uses Loki's sceptre to kick-start an artificial intelligence peacekeeping programme that he has tried to develop for some time. Even though Bruce Banner warns him several times not to mess around with the power of the sceptre, Banner then goes on to help Stark. The end result is the formation of Ultron who decides that it is the human race that needs to be destroyed and kick-start a new earth that would be peaceful.So in between the wisecracks including an ill judged Latin gag it is Iron Man's recklessness that causes the chaos. Captain America is still an overgrown boy scout, there is a bolt out of the blue growing love affair between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner which comes across as unconvincing as the scenes where they tried to hide Scarlett Johansson's bump as she was pregnant in real life at the time of the shooting, hence why she is the bar woman for the night in that party scene.It is Hawkeye who is more fleshed out in this film and delivers a more human dimension to the plot.Of course along with the main plot we have a whole host of subplots thrown into the mix including more superheroes and villains. So we have the Falcon dropping by, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and the formation of a new Avengers team by the end of it.The film tries to do too much and looks like a film made by committee and lacks the personal vision which elevated Captain America: The Winter Soldier last year.",5,1,5,25 June 2015
Hotel Mumbai," Hotel Mumbai
","I knew someone who survived the attacks that took place in Mumbai in 2008. I reckon they would be thinking who this film is aimed at.The director of Hotel Mumbai talks about all the hours of research they did. He then inserts fictionalised characters into this exploitative drama.You have disparate multinational characters assembled like it was a disaster film such as The Poseidon Adventure. There is a lecherous and arrogant Russian businessman who is arranging escorts to be delivered to his hotel suite. A newly married couple who have had a baby. For dramatic purposes we have a scene where the baby is in danger.Instead of the ship hitting a tidal wave, Muslim terrorists cause carnage by indiscriminately shooting at guests and staff at the Taj Hotel.The focus is on waiter Arjun (Dev Patel) with his ill fitting shoes and head chef Hemant Oberoi (Anupam Kher playing the real life chef of the hotel) who try to lead some of the hotel guests to safety.The film consists of people being blown away. You keep having to remind yourself that 174 people died and someone has made a spectacle of it which includes news clips and mobile phone footage of the real events.It might have been better if the film took a critical stance at the events that took place over three days. The failure of Indian intelligence agencies and the slow response of the counter terrorism forces who were stationed in Delhi. Also what were the motivations of the terrorist and the planning that took place for these attacks. The young men we see look like they are poor, uneducated and have been brainwashed.However I cannot get over that this is an uneasy film to watch. Even one of the film's posters is in bad taste showing a machine gun with the dome of the Taj Hotel imposed on it.",5,5,12,30 September 2019
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","After Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City, Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.",7,1,2,28 January 2020
Everest," Everest tourism
","Everest has an all star cast, great scenery, some nice shots when disaster strikes. The trouble is it's just too disjointed and starts sluggishly as it needs to introduce its over crowded cast and characterisation.Based on true events that happened in 1996. Two commercial expeditions led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) team up to climb the summit of Everest together. However a severe blizzard spells disaster for the climbers as they need to descent the mountain.Despite starting slowly we never get much depth regarding the characters or their motivations. It also never delves into the commercialization of these Everest expeditions where people go for adventure tourism and pay top dollar. Even though it is based on true events the narrative never grabs you but the mountain looks exhilarating and scary at the same time.",6,0,2,8 September 2019
Into the Wild," A leap out of the rat race
","When a film poster states written and directed by Sean Penn, you can be forgiven for breaking out in a cold sweat. After all I saw his directorial debut that was The Indian Runner. Penn until this film has failed to prove to me that he was a worthy auteur.Into the Wild is about Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) a notable student and athlete who after graduation wants to leave his family and society at large and live in the wilderness of Alaska.The film is episodic as we see him finding a magic bus in Alaska living in the wild as the movie flashes back and forth between his adventures in Alaska, his long journey to get there as well as the effect of his planned disappearance has on his family.On his road and rail trip he met a hippie couple, some Scandinavians, worked in farm where he learned survival tips, worked in a fast food outlet and met a lonely, old man who lost his family some decades earlier and wants to adopt him.The film has narration from Chris and his sister some of which are based on his journal entries. There is an important story strand as Chris discovered that his father had been married before and had a child from that relationship and his father had abandoned that family. He felt that his family life was based on lies as well as his parents having an unhappy marriage.This might had been an impetus as to why he abandoned his present lifestyle and went on a journey of self discovery. It is based on a true story although one that has a sad ending.Emile Hirsch does well in channelling the spirit of Chris, his journey, the sense of adventure and yearning for loneliness and yet his character is so likable, mixes well with others, literate, intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate.The film is a tad over-long and tries to be fair on his parents and his sister who felt abandoned. Maybe we needed to learn more about the side characters as they all were helping him, caring and looking out for him. There is only the one sore incident when he is caught jumping on freight trains.",7,0,2,15 October 2014
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","In the late 1970s and early 1980s watching a Woody Allen film was like a visit to the doctor who gives you some foul tasting medicine. Ultimately it was good for you. Most film critics at the time lionised Woody especially when he started to make his films in black and white.I last saw Annie Hall some 30 years ago. Nowadays I can watch some low rent movie and completely forget everything about it a few months later. When I rewatched Annie Hall recently I could recall some of the gags and scenes such as Marshall McLuhan being dragged out to dismiss the opinions of some smart alec or the weird outburst by Christopher Walken who plays Annie's brother or Allen sneezing on some cocaine. Of course the film was famous with Diane Keaton's masculine fashion sense.Annie Hall started out as a murder mystery that morphed into a bittersweet romantic comedy. It sees the shift from Woody Allen making silly comedies to a self reverential continental European type comedy. There is certainly an influence of Fellini here.Annie Hall comes across as a semi autobiographical comedy and even darkly surreal. Woody plays comedian Alvy Singer. He has just turned 40 and recounts his doomed romantic relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton.) Alvy comes from a loud Jewish family. Annie is from a waspish even anti semitic family. Alvy is educated, neurotic who sees a shrink. Annie is easy going, likes to smoke dope. Alvy encourages Annie to take adult education classes, later he is jealous as she spends more time with one of her tutors.There is so much to enjoy here. Alvy's rapid fire wit and neurosis. He thinks someone is being anti semitic by the way he pronounces 'do you' to make it sound like Jew. Alvy breaks the fourth wall, there is animation and subtitles. When Aly and Annie talk to each other, the subtitles indicate what they are thinking including Alvy wondering what she looks like without her clothes.When Alvy is waiting for Annie to arrive for their date, he is accosted by two strange men. When Annie pulls up in a taxi, Alvy tells Annie that he has been harrassed by two men from the Godfather. Of course the audience knows that Keaton appeared in the Godfather films.There are several stars who make brief early appearances in this film. Apart from Walken, there is Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Goldblum.Woody Allen won the best director Oscar and the film beat Star Wars for the best film Oscar. Annie Hall is an oddball film and it works ultimately because of Diane Keaton.",8,0,1,2 October 2019
Green Street Hooligans," Inter City Crew
",Director Alan Clarke who made the seminal film about football hooliganism The Firm has nothing to worry about from Green Street. Probably because he has been dead since 1990.Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is a journalism student in Harvard. He is expelled because a stash of cocaine is found in his room. It actually belongs to his roommate who has powerful connections. So Matt takes the fall.Matt decides to visit his sister in London. His brother in law hooks Matt up with his brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) to watch a West Ham match. Trouble is Pete is a football hooligan and pretty soon Matt gets hooked in the buzz of the gang punch ups they get involved in.British football has been mired with hooliganism issues since the 1970s. Green Street seems to be more interested in glorifying violence almost making it look like fun. The story is cliched and one dimensional.,3,0,0,12 April 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Music and Space: A Odyssey
","Martin Scorsese once said that certain great films need to be revisited at certain points in your life. A film you may have watched when you were 20 years old would give you a different feeling when you are 45 years of age.Well I did watch 2001 when I was about 20 years old. I admired the film's technical achievement but the film outside its opening minutes featuring the ape like creatures left me cold. The latter part of the film being even dull, the psychedelia enjoyed only by people who had popped pills.So after several decades I decided to heed Scorsese's advice and watched it on a high definition big widescreen TV for a more immersive experience. Again the technical achievements is outstanding and still dazzle, it leaves films like Gravity standing because nowadays these types of special effects is common with the technology available to filmmakers. Heck even my mobile phone probably has more computing power than that was available to NASA back in 1968.This leaves the story itself with the monolith appearing in different stages of history pushing human evolution. When a monolith is discovered on the moon it leads to a manned mission to Jupiter to find another monolith. But HAL the advanced computer sabotages the mission wants to get to the monolith instead of the humans so computers can enter the next stage of evolution.With the special effects on screen we have imaginative use of classical music to give us mood. It ranges from soothing to eerie such as when the monolith appears. Again as I get older I appreciate the music more.The film still has problems though. Obviously back in 1968 with all the effort they put into creating the visuals you cannot blame Kubrick for those lengthy shots of the space station or space ship. It does lead to pacing issues and make you feel bored. Even Star Trek - The Motion Picture did the same thing when it was released a dozen years later with all the lengthy shots of the refurbished Enterprise. However the story still gets lost as the film gets lost with its dazzling effects as HAL has to be challenged and then the astronaut enters the monolith. You then see the astronaut as an old man and then is reborn as a baby.I have no idea what it all means and maybe I am not supposed to know as its supposed to be all symbolism.",7,1,5,21 February 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Dignity, always dignity
","In his own words Gene Kelly said that this one will last. Not all of them do as films age but Singin in the Rain will stand the test of time.It is not a perfect film, it does have flaws in its story but it is a gold plated classic and according to Kelly it is all true, these things happened.He presumably meant the various incidents in Hollywood relating to the transition from silent to sound a subject of the more recent silent film The Artist itself based on the Don Lockwood character played by Kelly in this film but set in an alternate universe where he is washed up when sound arrives not Lina.Don Lockwood is a song and dance man who worked his way up to be a movie star via being a stuntman along with hyperactive Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) who these days would be regarded as the gay best friend.Lockwood and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are formidable box office stars and everyone thinks they are an item. In truth he detests her which makes you think that if they have not been together for all these years then who have they been with or were they living like monks?After a film premiere Lockwood literally drops into Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is a wannabee stage actress and he is immediately attracted to her.On the horizon is talking pictures and this makes (as in The Artist) the stars of today 'has beens' unless they quickly adapt to sound, because the kind of films they have been making so far now look laughably bad.Worse as they quickly try to make their new film as a talkie, Lina has difficulty talking to a microphone, she has terrible diction making her sound course and common and worse still the dialogue sounds clunky.After a disastrous test screening which shows Lina up actually as a dumb blonde, Cosmo hatches a plan to have Kathy dub her voice plus add some song and dance numbers.Don and Kathy fall in love, the studio have plans to promote her as a big star but Lina will not take things lying down but she literally gets the last laugh but this time she is the joke.This is of course wrapped in some classic song and dance numbers from the legendary Singin in the rain, Make em laugh, Good Morning and a sultry sequence with Cyd Charisse.It is colourful (I first saw this as a lad on a small black and white television and I always seem to recall it in monochrome) and some of the dancing is fantastic.Kelly was right, this one will last.",10,0,1,26 July 2015
Elysium," Space station paradise for the few
","Matt Damon lives in a society that is like a shanty town and jobs are hard to come by. You can tell this when Matt goes to work and he is rather proud of his employment status but he also has a criminal record so when in the opening scenes there is a spot check by the police at a bus stop, he does not comply but jokes about it resulting in a beating, a citation and injury which threatens him to lose his job.The film very much lost me from that moment on. We then cut to the space station Elysium where people live in a lush lifestyle where the president seems to adhere to some sort of liberal values yet leaves the citizens of earth a wretched existence as the best health care is reserved for Elysium and Jodie Foster is plotting an overthrow. Again a half baked analysis of society, we have little ides what makes the people of Elysium tick. Why does the president care if Foster is merciless as to how she deals with illegal immigrants on rockets when he is responsible for the state of affairs on earth. In fact why will he not send these medical pods to earth yet funds doctors and nurse and hospitals on earth.Back on earth where its clear this is a police state with a huge underclass and workers are glorified slaves with little health and safety protection, Damon having being exposed to life threatening injuries needs to get to Elysium and join forces with gangsters to get there. The film had good visuals and set pieces but many expected better from the director of District 9. The story is simply nonsense, the characters are not properly sketched out and I am not even sure what political point it wanted to make when District 9 was an allegory for apartheid.",4,1,3,10 April 2014
Alice in Wonderland," Still an important date
","Tim Burton has re-imagined Alice in Wonderland as some kind of quasi sequel as Alice (Mia Wasikowska) now an older teenager with a prospective groom on the horizon who she finds boring returns to what she remembers as underland by following a waist-coated rabbit down a hole which is ruled by the maniacal Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who is avenging herself on her sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).The film takes time to get going and it is curious that if she has visited this place as a young girl which she thinks is all part of her dreams yet she has similar experiences as her previous visit. She shrinks and grows tall when she tastes different things and meets various characters as before like the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat, the Knave (Crispin Glover) who does the dirty work for the Red Queen, the Caterpillar, Tweedledum and Tweedledee.The film is fun once it gets going and the plot starts to gel, Burton has made the film visually dazzling. The Red Queen with a bulbous head is crazy, Depp's Mad Hatter is a little subdued yet psychedelic with a melancholy back story. Wasikowska though is a little dull as Alice rather than beguiling.",6,0,0,18 September 2016
Victory," Shoot for victory
","Escape to Victory is really a far out film trying to be a kind of movie they do not make anymore with a casting that requires some stretch of the imagination.Taking its inspiration from The Great Escape the film is set in a World War 2 prison camp. Michael Caine plays an ex England football international who receives a proposition from Max Von Sydow, a Nazi officer and a former German footballer for match against the POWs and the German Officers.Sylvester Stallone who takes on the Steve McQueen type role is the goalkeeper of the team and although some of the Allied officers think that the game will be a German propaganda victory they also see this as an opportunity to organise an escape.Film legend John Huston directed this film with some old fashion war spirit and he assembles a cast that not only sees Stallone and Caine but famous footballers such as Pele, Bobby Moore and some current soccer players of the era such as Ossie Ardiles.Its football, its escape from a prison camp, its a little bit of Rocky with music from Bill Conti and its a lot of fun, simply because you know you will never watch a film like this again.Film critics sharpened their knives when this film was released but years later its still very enjoyable hokum.",7,0,0,30 August 2014

Selma," Civil rights
","Selma does not concentrate on the story of Dr Martin Luther King but does focus on the fight to secure equal voting rights with an epic march from the town of Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.British actor David Oyelowo steps up to the mark with a masterful portrayal of MLK and is matched by Carmen Ejogo as his wife. Two other British actors Tim Roth play Governor Wallace and Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B Johnson.The film takes a tough and gritty look at the civil rights era. An era that does not deserve to be sugar coated. Some of the people who stood up to be counted were killed including King and its easy to forget some 50 years later that rights were not given but had to be fought for and some paid a heavy price.The film makes good use of archive footage and is enthralling although some scenes might had just be a tad overlong with a few cheesy lines. There are a few star cameos and the film has a strong drive that does bot feel too preachy.",8,0,0,21 March 2015
Invictus," The game defining a nation
","I once was lying on a beach in South Africa and noticed a bunch of white school kids jumping off the school bus and heading towards the waves but they were not there to swim or surf. They had a rugby ball with them and in effect running with the ball while others tried to tackle them. It was a beautiful sight.It just shows how popular and important rugby is to the whites in South Africa. To the blacks, soccer is more important. To them rugby was the game of the oppressor, hence why they would support the opposing team.Invictus mashes up the early months of Nelson Mandela's Presidency of post apartheid South Africa and the Springboks preparation of the Rugby World Cup to be held in South Africa in 1995.The ending of apartheid meant that South Africa were allowed to compete in international competitions and the hosting of the rugby World Cup was swift reward.The film therefore has two threads. Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) treading carefully in a country where the white minority are fearful of the future as shown by the distrust with his own security personnel which now includes the black ANC members and the white security team of the former president.At the same time you have the national rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) whose team is almost all white, which has little support from the black majority who want the team renamed and worse they are on a losing streak, criticised by former players and pundits. Its a team lacking in confidence and support.Invictus is a film of how the country and President gets behind the team and how the team responds. Its a true story which resulted in a South African victory against the All Blacks who had the fearsome man mountain, Jonah Lomu. The abiding image of the final was Nelson Mandela appearing in the final to greet the team wearing the green and gold of the Springboks.The film is directed by two times best director Oscar winner, Clint Eastwood. A criticism of Eastwood is that he is the epitome of an efficient director lacking a signature style. Invictus is a good example of this. If you missed the starting titles, you would actually think that its made by a solid British director than an American legend.It is a dependable film with some substance. How can you not fail with such a true story? You have the inspiring Mandela played by Freeman with a twinkle in his eye. Damon is more earnest as Pienaar realising that he needs to lead more than just a sub-par team to the Rugby World Cup but needs to reunite decades of racial divisions in the new South Africa.However the film never goes above such platitudes. I imagined this film in the hands of a younger Richard Attenborough who would never had stooped to use CGI to fill the stadiums. He would had got 60,000 extras and made the film soar and given it a harder edge and I do not mean just in the rugby scenes which seemed a little off to me lacking the blood and guts of the actual game. Eastwood leaves you with a soft centre.",7,0,0,21 September 2015
La La Land," The Artists
","Damien Chazelle whose father is French has made a Gallic tinged song and dance musical set in Los Angeles. In some ways it is a modern variant of Singin in the Rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have. The film has wowed the critics at the awards season but I think like the film 'The Artist' it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years later.This is a bittersweet love story between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity. He keeps on bumping into Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the Warner Bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agents.Both of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first, but love may not be enough when these people also crave success. Sebastian finds it first, recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a strain.Director Damien Chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained. Like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers. The film is right, much of the audience will be put off by the jazz music.The dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate Fred n Ginger and in some ways it works. Chazelle as in in his previous film Whiplash has found a rhythm to his film. It has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love. The story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched.",7,7,12,14 January 2017
Mama," Mama is making eyes at me
","An investment banker Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau) has a breakdown and kills his wife and two colleagues. He takes his two infant daughters to a cabin in the woods and plans to kill them but they are saved by some entity that protects the girls and raises them.

Lucas faces a custody battle with the girl's grandmother but a doctor and a medical institute come to his assistance. Lucas raises them with his rock singer girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain.) When Lucas is hospitalised after an accident, Annabel reluctantly looks after the kids but Mama has been visiting the girls.The film is produced by Guillermo Del Toro and has elements of a dark twisted gothic fairy tale where things certainly go bump in the night. It is dark and creepy but by the end a little too dark as you cannot see what is going on. It probably is deliberate as the film literally falls of a cliff to a messy and stupid ending.",4,2,4,20 July 2018

A group of kids make a zombie movie during their holidays. While they are filming at night, a train crashes into a truck and derails. It is captured on camera.Soon strange things happen in the town and the military moves in to do a clean up. The train had a strange cargo and it is now escaped.As for the kids.

However both men unite to save their kids with something on the loose.JJ Abrams has made a nostalgic film that crosses several genres with shades of Goonies and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In short it is a tribute to Steven Spielberg.It is well acted especially by Elle Fanning. The ending did look rushed and the monster was disappointing.",6,1,3,28 April 2019

More importantly Carl finds a yearning for life as he hangs out with young Russell who himself is freindless.I ended up viewing this film as my wife took our kids to the cinema to watch this and upon her return she told me that I would end being like Carl went I am older. I guess it is a roundabout way of telling me that I am a grouch!The film starts with a segment of Carl and Ellie from childhood to old age. It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie. As life goes on, they could not have children and it is Ellie who slows down as they get older and she passes on, leaving Carl on his own.It is all about Carl rediscovering that zest for life and having that adventure he and Ellie dreamt about all those years ago. This is a fun and imaginative film, slightly surreal and off beat. For a film called UP it actually keeps its feet on the ground in terms of story and emotion.",8,0,0,21 August 2018
A Clockwork Orange," The milky bar kid
","A Clockwork Orange was always a film I wanted to watch but it was one of these films that I was too young to watch when it was initially released in British cinemas and then banned by Director Stanley Kubrick from being available in Britain. The ban remained until he died.The film became infamous for its depiction of violence and sex. It overlooked the fact that despite its initial scenes of brutality and rape, in its heart it is a dark comedy set in a futuristic Dystopian Britain.An adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel, Malcolm McDowell might be a shade too old to play the teenage delinquent Alex getting high on milk-plus which is infused with drugs and then partakes in an orgy of ultra-violence which includes beating up a vagrant, fighting with a rival gang and then speeding through the country roads where they burst into the house of a writer who gets beaten up and watches his wife get raped as Alex sings Singin in the rain.We know Alex is still at school as he lives in his parents flat and is visited the next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence from school.However Alex's luck runs out. He falls out with his fellow gang members and when he breaks into another house, he kills a woman with a phallic sculpture, betrayed by his gang and caught by the police, he is sentenced to 14 years in jail.The opening part of the film would had been deemed shocking in early 1970s Britain. I doubt that level of sex and savagery would had ever been seen before in a mainstream British film.However the film becomes more of a surreal prison film once Alex ends up in jail where he joins a church group and tries to fend off advances from fellow inmates. A visiting government minister offers him a chance to take part in an experiment. Once he undertakes an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks the film becomes a black revenge comedy.Once freed from prison and rehabilitated Alex finds there is no room for him in his parents home, he gets set upon by a gang of vagrants as the tramp who he beat up in the beginning recognises Alex. His old gang members are now in the police and they torture him. Worse still he stumbles into the house of the writer who he attacked and he gets his vengeance as well. Poor Alex now cannot listen to his favourite piece of Beethoven without doing harm to himself.There is an underlying political satire of a government wanting to tackle violence in society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them.The film contains a lot of slang derived from east European languages and although I mentioned he looked rather old to play the teenage Alex, Malcolm McDowell delivers an amazing performance providing a narrative with his Yorkshire tones.The film might put off some of its audience with its disturbing opening but settles in well after that.",7,2,4,13 November 2016
Woman in Gold," Not all golden
","Woman in Gold stars Helen Mirren as Maria Altmann a Jewish Austrian who fled to America. The artist Gustav Klimt painted her aunt who later became known as Woman in Gold. The painting along with others had been confiscated by the Nazis and later went on display at an Austrian museum.After her sister dies in the late 1990s, Maria living in LA seeks the help of a young lawyer Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) whose family also fled Austria during the Jewish persecution to recover the paintings.Maria and Randol travel to Austria and discover the government and the museum are obstinate. As a journalist who befriends them (Daniel Bruhl) informs them that the authorities will put every hurdle in their path.When they return to America, Randol discovers that he could use a loophole to sue the museum in American soil and renews the legal battle.Woman in Gold is more than a courtroom thriller which has been condensed. However it is unfortunately clichÃ© ridden film with little mystery or intrigue. It really could had been a made for television film but for its starry cast.The characters although real, are just cyphers there to develop the story. Neither Maria nor Randol felt like real people to me even though we get flashbacks of a young Maria in Nazi Austria and her attempts to flee the regime. In the modern day setting the museum officials and the Austrian officials are made to look like stereotypical bad guys wanting to keep the painting at any costs or in this case hoping to spin things out until the elderly Maria dies.The performances are earnest, the flashbacks give the film weight which the script really does not deserve and the direction was pedestrian.",5,2,4,1 August 2015
Invincible," Over the hill in the NHL
","This is an interesting sports movie set in the past. Its nothing to do with racial integration! 1976 was a good year for Philadelphia not only does the fictional and over the hill rookie call Rocky Balboa get to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world but here in this supposedly true life tale, part time bartender Vince Papale at the age of 30 goes for tryouts and makes the cut for the Philly football team.Papale lost his job as a teacher, his wife leaves him and his dad helps him out for rent money. He plays football with his friends and the whole city is in an economic malaise with strikes and lay offs. This one shot given by the new coach could be his way out of the slums.I understand that the film really stretches the truth, however the way Wahlberg plays him even sexing up the story cannot ascend him from anything but a shy if dull everyman who is in a team that dislikes him especially the black players for some reason.The film is actually pedestrian, even though he has no interesting personality he gets a hot girlfriend, moments of crisis which is only alleviated when he spends time playing football with his boys in the hood and a climax when he can actually block players running with the ball.I suppose this could had been a better and more melodramatic television film. As a movie its OK but someone other than Wahlberg needed to play Papale.",4,1,2,14 June 2014
Love & Mercy," On the crest of a wave
","Love & Mercy is the story of Brian Wilson, the creative heart and also the troubled mind of The Beach Boys and it takes place in two time streams.Paul Dano plays the younger Brian who slowly descents into madness (with the help of drugs and booze not quiet touched in the film) as he moves away from the popular west coast surf sound and into the more experimental Pet Sounds album. This portion of the film was the best as we see the recording and singing process and his interaction with the rest of the band and his stern, overpowering father who sold away his publishing rights.John Cusack is the older Wilson, his scenes are set in the 1980s when he is under the care and medications of his overpowering, manipulative and Svengali like psychotherapist, Dr Landy (Paul Giamatti.) Love, understanding and eventual escape from the clutches of Dr Landy comes from (Melinda Ledbetter) Elizabeth Banks, a Cadillac car saleswoman who went on to become his wife.The film was just too disjointed and uneven with the Cusack segments being weaker, not helped that his performance was overshadowed by Banks and Giamatti who with his wig looked scarily similar to Phil Spector.",4,7,11,13 June 2016
Total Recall," The air you breath
","Total Recall is one of the great action movies of the 1990s. Director Paul Verhoeven delivers a layered plot, bone crunching violence, state of the art special effects, satirical swipes at right wing corporations. In Arnold Schwarzenegger he found an actor who could deliver the action and the violence.Based on a short story by Philip K Dick, 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.' Total Recall is set in a future where corporations run amok. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a hard working construction worker who visits a company called Rekall. They implant fake memories of a holiday to the planet Mars despite concerns expressed by his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) and his work colleague.While undergoing the process Quaid upgrades his trip as a spy on a mission. However it seems Quaid's memory has already been erased and his existing memories were recreated.Now Quaid is on the run with plenty of bad guys after him. With no one left he could trust, Quaid sets off to Mars to find the truth about himself. In Mars Quaid finds he is someone who was feared and not liked. Quaid decides there is a secret about Mars and Quaid leads the resistance group against the greedy corporation that runs the planet and controls the air supply.The violence is visceral and strong. The action is very well paced. Total Recall also has a terrific story, the plotting is complex and always keeps you guessing whether it is a dream or real.",10,2,7,31 December 2017

All of a sudden he becomes smarter, learns faster and recalls memory from the distant past.However the drug is not without side effects but very soon he attracts the attention of gangsters and business tycoons.Cooper invests in his character and is charismatic in the lead role.

Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes Wide Shut
","Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final film. He died before the film's wide release. The film was in production for over a year requiring various re-shoots. It starred the then husband and wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.Dr Bill Harford (Cruise) is a successful young doctor with his own practice, beautiful wife, young daughter and a swanky apartment in Manhattan.After attending a lavish party where Bill flirted a bit and later smoking some pot in their apartment. His wife Alice (Kidman) tells him that she once fantasised leaving him for a sexy sailor. This rocks Bill as he now keeps imagining his wife having sex with the sailor.This sets Bill on a road to strange encounters where he lets his inhibitions drop and walk the wild side of life. He meets a woman that is a hooker, a bereaved daughter lunges and kisses him. He goes to a fancy dress shop where the owner's nubile daughter gives him the come on. Bill gets an old medical school friend, now a piano player to reveal to him the location of a place where wild sex parties take place.However Bill gets caught out as an interloper in the sex orgy and realises that he might have put himself in danger, especially when a prostitute in the orgy turns up dead and his piano playing friend disappears.Bill is spurred on to confess to his wife about the dark night of his soul and his various encounters, none of which ever lead to sex.The film is beautifully filmed in a Christmas setting that allows for a lot of festive themed lights. The film was shot in London as Kubrick who having settled in Britain never left the country.Despite building a typical Greenwich Village street at Pinewood Studios it looked unauthentic.There is nothing in this movie to suggest why it took so long to shoot the film. At its heart it is just an adult drama with erotic leanings and comic absurdities.Now I know he was not known as 'One Take Kubrick' but really taking over a year to shoot the film was taking the biscuit. I once read a discussion and I think it has some validity that the reason Kubrick took so many takes was he was hoping for some kind of serendipity. A chance magical intervention that would suddenly occur which would elevate one shot from dozens of other similar ones and critics would acclaim Kubrick as some kind of wizard.During the production two actors were replaced. Sydney Pollack replaced Harvey Keitel as Ziegler the gregarious and libertine party host. Pollack was an actor turned Oscar winning director who specialised in making cameo appearances such as the startled agent in Tootsie and the shocked doctor in Death Becomes Her.Pollack also directed Cruise in The Firm. Pollack was right on the money as Ziegler the concerned friend but also a man with a seedy underbelly.Jennifer Jason Leigh was replaced by Marie Richardson as Marion the bereaved daughter who impulsively kisses Bill.The notorious orgy starts out as some kind of Roger Corman-like masked ball from The Masque of the Red Death with some kind of semi satanic rituals before descending into some laughable softcore sex scenes. Some of the over enthusiastic jiggling we get to see, well let us say the man would be slipping out a lot.The women Kubrick hired for the sex party look rather fetching with their thongs and bare breasts. Kudos to the casting director.Cruise's character is very passive with all that is going on around him including the kinkiness. He might had a sharp punch in the gut from his wife's careless words but Cruise does not reflect this. This must a be a directorial choice as Cruise is a lot better and a more expressive actor than say Matthew Modine or Ryan O'Neil that Kubrick had cast in his previous movies.The whole story is too thin and stretched out for a 160 minutes run time. The film is leisurely paced. At least Kubrick pierced the mundane setting with sudden slapstick such as the escapades of the Fancy Dress Shop owner and his daughter.Ultimately the film is about two married people who took each other for granted and failed to appreciate each other. Just look at Alice at the beginning who is peeing in the bathroom as Bill walks in and does not flinch.At the first party thrown by Ziegler, she gets propositioned by an older man and she flirts back while Bill in turn is being playful to two English ladies which Alice sees but does nothing about.Kubrick made fewer films as he got older. Eyes Wide Shut was his first film since 1987. Cruise and Kidman were prepared to put their successful film careers on hold to work for an auteur knowing that they could spend months making the film. It is just a shame that Kubrick went out on a whimper.",5,1,3,9 July 2016
Sicario," The drug trade
","Sicario wants to examine the USA's role in the Mexican drugs war with special ops taking on the Mexican cartels in a ruthless manner, hoping the ends justifies the means but in reality just muddies the waters even more.The film starts of horrifically, a raid in a house in Arizona leads to the discovery of a some corpses blamed on the Mexican Sonora cartel. Director Denis Villeneuve also then makes the mistake of signalling what will happen next.This kind of bluntness in the narrative will follow through the rest of the movie.FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) after the Arizona incident is assigned to a special task force to go after the main guys running the Sonora cartel. The special ops team is led by arrogant and shady CIA operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who you figure will have an hidden agenda. Accompanying them is Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) as some kind of dubious lawyer turned law enforcement officer from Mexico.Although after an interesting opening the film slows down to a snail's pace and it exposes the story as being muddled and the characters specially Brolin as one dimensional and Blunt as someone who is out of her scope in this operation and it dawns on her that she is not only being used but also placed herself in grave danger.The story only perks up later when the film focuses on revenge driven Alejandro allowing Benecio del Toro to take centre stage as he goes after the head of the cartel.The film has good photography by Roger Deakins, Villeneuve wants to give the film a grittiness but the story lacks nuance.",5,4,7,9 March 2016
Some Like It Hot," Some Like It Hot
","I always tell my kids. Remember the last line of this movie. One day you might find yourself on a quiz show and the final line to this movie is the answer to the one million pound question.Billy Wilder has made classic comedy in drag. Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are musicians who witness the St Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago. They jump on a train to Florida and disguise themselves a women on tour with an all girl jazz band.Joe falls for adorable singer Sugar (Marilyn Monroe.) To seduce her he disguises himself as a frigid heir to an oil fortune with a Cary Grant accent. Meanwhile Jerry is pursued by a wealthy older man, Osgood.However pretty soon the mob turn up at the hotel for a big meet up and Joe and Jerry find themselves in trouble.Over 60 years later, Some Like it Hot is still a delight. It has memorable performances from Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe. Wilder does his utmost best to push the Hays Code to the limit. Nowadays people see all kinds of hidden meanings regarding sexuality. I just thought it was a lot of fun although Wilder has made sure that both Sugar and Jerry easily fall for rich men.",10,1,1,2 January 2020
Jack Reacher," Get Jack
","Those people who are knowledgeable about the Jack Reacher books would be aware that Cruise is wrong for the role.Too short, not broad chested enough and too dark haired. These shortcomings are apparent in the fighting scenes, you have to believe in the old Hollywood artistic licence.As an action thriller the inspiration is a film such as Bullitt. This is a thoughtful film, relying more on brains as well as brawn.From early on we know who the killer is, it is more a case of why and who is behind the conspiracy.The film has plenty of sly humour, nasty villains, hard edged action and Rosamund Pike's cleavage which displays its own acting ability.Director Werner Herzog makes a chilling villain and Cruise the investigator is believable even if Cruise the pugilist may not be.",7,9,14,3 October 2013

This has enough quirky charm as well as humour as an outsider who unearths genuine talent in this fact based story and at the same time becomes a valued member of the community.",6,1,1,24 June 2016
Les Misérables," It rests on Jackman's shoulders
","The big screen adaptation of the musical version of Les Misérables has Anne Hathaway knock it out of the park with an emotional version of 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Hugh Jackman shows that he can easily glide from action star to all round singing and dancing entertainer. Russell Crowe despite fronting his own band needs a few more singing lessons.Victor Hugo's epic tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) in 19th century France. Jailed for stealing a loaf of bread and running when chased. He spent years in jail and then more years hunted by the determined policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) for breaking his parole conditions.Valjean has become rich and successful and tried to do good for others. However he failed factory girl Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whose life descended in misery and prostitution. To make amends he takes care of her daughter Cosette. However Valjean cannot escape his past and France is heading for revolution.This is a big musical spectacle. Director Tom Hooper knows which big set pieces to stage for the cinema. Although the novel is long, the film is too long. Some of the songs are rather forgettable. I thought Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were just a little bit too fruity.",6,1,1,22 June 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," You can't beat a bit of ELO
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun sequel that builds on the first film. I was drawn in from the title sequence as Baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky as behind him a monster fight takes place.The focus is on Star Lord meeting his celestial father, Ego (Kurt Russell) living in his own planet and with a name like Ego you can immediately sense trouble.Yet we also have character development as well, the relationship between Star Lord and Gamora intensifies but we also see it develop between the warring sisters as Nebula turns up wanting sibling blood.We are also shone more light between Yondu and Star Lord, Yondu was supposed to deliver the infant Peter Quill to Ego but kept him for himself as he was small and thin, useful for some thieving. In fact Yondu gets the most character development here.Drax also gets to shine with more comical interludes with Rocket and new character Mantis. Baby Groot is fun as comic relief.The film soundtrack works in the context of the film with songs like Father and son (Cat Stevens) and The Chain (Fleetwood Mac.) There are even cameos from Sylvester Stallone and David Hasselhoff.Visually the film looks great, it is very much a knockabout adventure than a superhero film without being bloated or self indulgent as some of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. It does have a thin story but is still an entertaining movie.",7,1,3,6 August 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Cryptic crypts
","Dan Brown is a good enough storyteller to sell millions of books.The Da Vinci Code was a blockbuster of a book and it was only a matter of time that it was turned into a movie.A controversial plot that visits lots of foreign locations, mystery, thrills, graphic violence and a search for religious artifacts where you are chased by nasty villains.You can call this a modern Indiana Jones.Paul Bettany is chilling as a faithful henchman of Opus Dei, aiding Alfred Molina who incidentally was in the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.However, Ron Howard's direction is bland despite the the good use of locations.The screenplay by the hack Akiva Goldsman is uninspired as always, although he or Dan Brown might had got some inspiration from Kevin Smith's Dogma.Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou lack spark and you end up staring at Hanks hair for all the wrong reasons.The film is watchable enough but there is too much silliness and some of it is just implausible with cryptic clues that the greatest minds have been unable to solve until Robert Langdon came on the scene.",6,0,1,21 August 2013
The Happening," Nature fights back
","After the hype created by Bird Box, it is worth revisiting The Happening which was critically mauled upon its release.The reason might be M Night Shyamalan who wrote, produced and directed this film. His success in movies such as The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable meant that critics were just sharpening their knives and waited for him to fail.It starts off shockingly as people kill themselves in New York, such as throwing themselves off a building. The mass suicides soon spreads and the authorities initially think it is some kind of a biological terrorist attack.Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher at high school in Philadelphia. When the school hears about happening in New York, it causes a mass panic.Elliot, his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his young daughter Jess try to escape Philadelphia on the train. The train comes to a halt and they are stranded in the countryside.Julian goes back to look for his wife who could not make it on the train. Elliot tries to figure out what is causing this phenomenon as they witness more disturbing suicides. He thinks there is something in nature, especially the countryside that is causing the happening.Shyamalan was let down by Mark Wahlberg, the most unconvincing high school science teacher. Zooey Deschanel was not much better. I know she is supposed to have marriage problems but there was no chemistry here between the actors. Leguizamo would had been better as the lead.The film itself is much better than its reputation deserves. There is an environmental subtext to it. It is eerie, disturbing and mysterious. I can understand what Shyamalan tried to do and he largely succeeded with a psychological apocalyptic horror. It would had been better with stronger actors.",6,6,7,7 January 2019
The Shape of Water," He has reached his peak
","Guillermo del Toro makes an adult version of ET with some added Beauty and the Beast, Starman and magical realism.Set in early 1960s Baltimore with the Cold War in full swing. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito. She is mute, lonely with some scarring on her neck. Each morning is the same, bath, masturbate and get ready for work.Elisa lives in a creaky apartment above a cinema. One of her few friends is in the neighbouring apartment who can sign with her. Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a veteran commercial artist who seems to have had some sort of breakdown, had drink problems and wants to have a relationship with the man working in a diner. Elisa is a janitor in a top secret research lab with her best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer.) The lab is doing experiments with an amphibious creature from the black lagoon (Doug Jones) captured by Strickland (Michael Shannon) in the Amazon. The creature as worshipped like a god but here he is experimented on and tortured.Elisa when she is cleaning the lab manages to communicate with the creature. She feeds him boiled eggs, plays music and dances for him. She secretly feds him every night with egg and listens to music in his room, and they become close to each other. Her actions are unnoticed by Strickland but she has been observed by scientist Dr Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) who also wants to understand the creature and he is unhappy that the go ahead has been given to dissect the creature.Now there is a race against time to save the creature.Guillermo del Toro has created a watery, fantasy, charming Gothic romance with too much teal. I think he realises this himself by giving Strickland a teal Cadillac. Shannon plays an effective, sneering villain who himself is enchanted with Elisa's silence. There is horror and humour in this movie with a song and dance sequence with an amphibian. I am sure Doug Jones must have enjoyed that.",7,7,13,27 January 2018
The Untouchables," Old school Chicago
","Upon its release a film critic commented that calling The Untouchables the best gangster film since The Godfather II is not saying much as there have been hardly any good gangster films since then.Brian De Palma known as a visually interesting but flawed director got a rather campy television series and made a bravado film filled with his visual touches inspired by his love of Hitchcock and meshed it with an artful gangster thriller scripted by David Mamet.Kevin Costner plays the boy scout Elliot Ness in Prohibition era Chicago initially humiliated but after meeting beat cop Malone (Sean Connery) assembles a team of Untouchables to take down Al Capone (Robert De Niro) for tax evasion.The film looks terrific. De Palma excelled in the art direction, the stage setting, costumes and photography. There is a bombastic and at times cheesy score by Ennio Morricone (just hear those sentimental tunes each time Mrs Ness appears.)Yet the film hits bulls eye despite some hokiness. De Niro plays Capone as camp and loud. Each appearance is a set piece, whether he holds court with the press, cries at the opera or beats someone with a baseball bat. De Niro apparently had each hair in his head individually plucked in order to have Capone's moon face look.Sean Connery dominates as the Irish cop Malone teaching the street smarts to the green Ness on how to take down crime 'the Chicago way.' Yet this is a cop with a Scots accent and who can forget the line: 'brings a gun to a knife fight' before being shot a thousand times.Andy Garcia gives a star making performance as the cool rookie and sharpshooter George Stone and Charles Martin Smith almost steals the film as the meek agent Oscar Wallace whose idea it was to go after Capone for tax fraud. There are spectacular set pieces such as the homage to Battleship Potemkin with the pram and baby descending down the steps.The film is a good blend of action, humour and violence that stands up as a classic almost 30 years later. De Palma makes sure that the violence is not as overpowering as in his previous gangster film Scarface. He behaved himself here and this is probably his most accomplished film.De Palma would once more return to adapt an old television series in the 1990s when he made Mission Impossible a film series that still continues to this day.",10,4,6,11 September 2016

Each time he states one of his rules, you see an example of it in action.He decides to go home to see if his parents are still alive and encounters a redneck zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) with a penchant for Twinkies and a sad history.They become a duo and later have an uneasy alliance with two women.

Eisenberg is a charming but vulnerable lead using his speed and zombie survival rules to his best advantage.Harrelson on the surface is a redneck who just blasts zombies, misses his dog and loves Twinkies but later shows pathos and real vulnerability at his loss.Bill Murray makes one hell of a cameo appearance in a scene set in a Hollywood mansion and his demise is very funny with his biggest regret being The Garfield movie!The weak point is the film drags when they encounter the ladies where they play games of trying to outhustle the only nice humans they seem to have encountered.",7,0,2,12 January 2014

Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!",7,0,3,27 May 2014
A Beautiful Mind," Number crunching
","I first watched this film when it had an advanced preview before its wide release. I liked the film but it did not feel it was a Best Picture Oscar winner and I believe screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is a hack of the worst kind. Well he did write Batman & Robin and here explains 'Game Theory' in terms of picking women up at bars which should had been enough to disqualify him for an Oscar win.Over the years the film's disparity with actual true events has been an issue with a lot of people. The trouble is nearly all films tend to be fictionalised for dramatic effect and A Beautiful Mind I guess is no better or worse but to me felt like a film loosely based on some true facts.I recently re-watched the film and planned to review it. The death of John and Alicia Nash in a traffic accident focused my mind on the review.What I took away from my reviewing of A Beautiful Mind was Nash as played by Russell Crowe being surprised by the varied use of the Game Theory principles in the world of commerce. It makes the hackneyed attempt to explain this theory by Goldsman make it look even more inept. I actually find myself thinking of how Game Theory applies in real life with things like sport rights television auctions.Once upon a time one channel would buy up exclusive rights to soccer. A winner take all attitude which presumably led to underhand tactics such as bribery.Now you have packages sold to various TV channels, which means several channels in one country will show live soccer at different times and days with another channel having highlights and the soccer authorities maximising their revenue. The poor punter gets even more poorer though having to pay more in subscription payments!On the weekend that Nash died I even thought if Game Theory could apply in things like peace talks. Were the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings just another application of Game Theory put in practice?A Beautiful Mind kind of overlooks the most important part Nash work and really places it as a footnote.What we have is Russell Crowe playing the most muscular, dull/shy Ivy league mathematician you will ever get to meet in a film whose depiction of mental illness borrows heavily from the hit movie released several years earlier, The Sixth Sense.You kind of lulled into a false sense of security before you are hit in the gut with a sucker punch, but eh, this is a film of a man who suffered from mental illness. I saw the punch coming.You then see Nash regaining his self, his worth and his wife. He returns to academia and gains academic acceptance with a Noble prize.The film is watchable, there are some nice flourishes put in by Ron Howard the director but it feels less substantial than its critical acclaim suggests which includes an Oscar for best picture.A Beautiful Mind is a picture of a man where they give you the biography but miss out on his thinking.",4,2,5,24 May 2015
Glory Road," Slam dunk
","I suppose these days no Hollywood Studio will green-light a sports film unless it's about the struggle of black minorities to overcome prejudice in the past and make a breakthrough in integrated teams.I suppose in 20 years time we might have similar themed sports films that deal with homosexuality gaining acceptance in sports or female coaches in a male dominated world of team sports. Who knows.Glory Road is based on a true events leading to the 1966 College Men's Basketball Championship. Head Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) of Texas Western College recruits the best players irrespective of race due to a lack of financial resources.By recruiting black players the Coach has to deal with issues of integration, getting the team to bond and racism.Following initial wins against poor teams, Haskins realizes that the black players perform better with more freer movements at the court. His team play with a flamboyant style but this also leads to racial hatred against the team, threats to his family and ransacking of his team's hotel rooms during an away game.The film is made from the producers of Remember the Titans which dealt with similar themes in American Football in College.Josh Lucas holds the film together of what is now a similar narrative path. Yet the film is interesting, holds your interest and is less cheesy than anticipated although it probably has taken liberties with the real version of the story.",7,0,1,12 March 2014
Die Hard," Tower Heist
","When it comes to action-adventure films of the 1980s. You have Raiders of the Lost Ark standing as a colossus. The ultimate homage to the 1930 'B' serials. Hot on its heels is Die Hard the ultimate action- thriller.Bruce Willis was known for the comedy crime-drama Moonlighting and comedy movies such as Blind Date. He was not someone with bulging muscles like Sylvester Stallone or a former martial arts star or bodybuilder.John McClane the every-man who happens to be a New York cop visiting his estranged wife at her firm's Christmas party, rather partial to Roy Rogers ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Just as the party gets into full swing a bunch of European terrorists take over the office tower block to rob some financial bonds, led by the magnetic and then unknown Alan Rickman (who in those pre Google days, some critics mistook to be some undiscovered German actor readymade to be a Bond villain!)However as the villains hold the rest of the group hostage waiting for their plan to unfurl including getting an assist from the FBI, there is a fly on the ointment. McClane is on the loose and picking off the bad guys one by one.You have a beat cop in contact with McClane, some inept cops, even more inept and gung ho FBI agents, a slimy journalist and a film director on top form giving you one of the best action films of all time.A mixture of thrills, action and humour. Just look at scene when Uli (the oriental bad guy) glances at the chocolate bar during a tense moment and steals it, or Rickman naming some freedom fighter groups which seem to be made up and he states to his fellow henchman that he read about them in Time Magazine.Ultimately Willis pitches his character just right. Here is an actor hungry for that breakout role and he sure hit bulls-eye here even though some of his subsequent actions films have been disappointing.At the other end is Rickman playing the suave, sophisticated and ruthless villain. He brings charisma by the truck load and this was also his launchpad to stardom.",10,2,4,7 November 2014
American Made," Top flight
","In director Doug Liman who Tom Cruise has worked with a few times, Cruise has found someone who he could loosen up with a little, make a lower budget colourful flashy film where Cruise can be a little chaotic and free wheeling.American Made is a fast paced film. A wily, naughty mischievous risk taker Barry Seal who goes from being a TWA pilot to a CIA contractor who ends up supplying arms to trafficking drugs for Escobar to training an illegal right wing Nicaraguan army.Seal makes so much money he does not know what to do with it or even hide it. Of course there is a downside, eventually they are all after him and even his cunning cannot evade them all. Pursued by the FBI, Police, DEA, various cartels, Seal really has nowhere to run or hide.Cruise seems to be enjoying himself on screen, Liman keeps the film moving but in a sense it is a familiar story. Once Seal makes it big, has a few bumps along the road, you even get that scene when you know the decline in his fortunes will start.",7,2,2,5 December 2017
Jersey Boys," Silver star
","Its rather refreshing these days to see a movie that has not gone through a grading treatment where the screen gets blighted with orange and teal lighting.Director Clint Eastwood uses light hues which get more colourful as The Four Seasons get more successful and the songs get more bouncier.This is the screen adaptation of the successful stage musical, although I have not seen the musical to make a comparison.Eastwood has opted to use the stage cast rather than plump for known screen actors to play the members of the group and this means the actors can go straight into what should be now familiar characters and age appropriately.John Lloyd Young is mesmerising as Frankie Valli but the adaptation from stage to screen is not wholly successful. The early act was slow to get going and the film was rather long in the middle as it started to drag. The end song of 'What a night' was a hit in the mid 1970s with a different line up of the band. Still if you are a fan of the music of The Four Seasons then this will be an enjoyable film.If you dislike falsetto then give this film a wide berth.",6,0,0,24 October 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," The hunt is on. But first here are some torture scenes.
","Zero Dark Thirty prides itself on being based on documentary evidence but it becomes clear that this is a fictionalized account on the hunt and capture of Osama Bin Laden. The story might be based on true facts but to distill the story in 150 minutes the focus is on a lone wolf CIA operative who spent the best part of a decade hunting for clues and fighting her superiors for resources and support.The film starts to pull your emotional heartstrings from the very beginning with voices of victims from recordings made in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The film-makers must be targeting the kids who might be unaware of the events September 11 2001 or more cynically softening us up for the next sequence of scenes.Now if I was watching a film where some half naked women were being tortured, made to defecate in their underwear, have dog collars put on them, I would find the film under the Grindhouse section of the DVD store with an added commentary by Quentin Tarantino. However as this film features Arab men being tortured, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is the order of the day.The film gives you prolonged sequences of torture and of course the trendy water-boarding sequences are included. The film does not seem to condemn torture apart from a throwaway line later on in the film and seems to give the impression that torture has its uses.The first two thirds of the films is looking for elusive clues that might lead to a breakthrough from all the mountains of information obtained over the years. As we moves on from the Bush regime to the Obama years, we have that breakthrough and move on to the capture of Bin Laden.The central focus is on the Jessica Chastain character who I believe is a composite. She is very driven and carries the film well which does start out rather slowly as we deal with the fragments we offered that might develop into a strand. However Chastain is saddled with more than a few clunky lines.The last third is very much for the Call of Duty generation as the armed forces head for the Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan.Kathryn Bigelow who is the first female director to win an Oscar was working on a hunt for Bin Laden film but quickly reworked the premise when Bin Laden was killed and rush released it within 18 months of the events. I think the script needed more time to develop and the approach might have been different as the film-makers would had been able to have access more information regarding the factual accounts and have more time to mull over things, especially some of the lines given to the actors.It is a good film although in trying to be neutral with the politics especially regarding torture looks like a mis-step. I think there is a better production regarding these events waiting to be told.",6,0,2,10 November 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," War is hell
","Adapted from the book of the same name this is the experiences of the Great War from the eyes of the German soldiers and particularly the sensitive Paul Baumer.The films begins with their teacher giving an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the Army for the 'Fatherland'. The students all enlist and we then see them in basic training under Himmelstoss, who a few days earlier had been the town's postman before he enlisted. He is a strict disciplinarian who is hated by all the recruits.Soon the boys are on the front fighting with the enemy and under constant bombardment. Some will die, some will go mad, others will get injured, a few may survive. The effects of the war causing a profound change to those who are still fighting.It is important to note that this film was made before the second world war so its not tainted by knowledge of that war. Yet hearing the teacher of saving the fatherland leaves you unsure as to what war he is talking about, so fresh the words still sound.Given the film was made in 1930 it really did set the template for the modern war film, you can see the lineage down to even films like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. The director Lewis Milestone served in the Great War and brings great visuals to the battle scenes and profound sorrow for those dealing with their injuries either physical, mental or both.If there is criticism, sometimes its not clear what the injuries to the men are. This might to do with the fact that the scenes are non graphic reflecting period the film was made. Many a time it seems the soldiers died from what looked like a minor injury.Still this is an important war film in the history of cinema.",8,2,2,3 April 2014
Love Actually," Smug Actually
","Sugar, syruppy, a contrived bawdy romantic comedy for Christmas with paper this characterisation an none of it ever rings true.Set in London in the run up to Christmas, we see a range of characters all linked to each other in some way.The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls for his teal lady Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) and when the President of the USA fondles of her, he loses his cool and stands up to the US President.Karen (Emma Thompson) is the Prime Minister's sister. When she finds out that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) has bought an expensive gift for someone else she is heartbroken. Harry has had his head turned by their open flirting of his secretary.Grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) gets to bond with his stepson Sam after the death of his wife. Young Sam fancies a girl in his school who is flying out to America soon.Colin is a friend of a film production assistant who flies off to America to find love, he goes straight to a bar and scores because of his English accent.Swirling in all these and other stories is veteran wild living singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) attempting a comeback by releasing a Christmas single.Richard Curtis inspired by Robert Altman has thrown a confection together some of it sticks better than others but a few of the segments just look creepy. The two body doubles in what increasingly looks like a porn film is not funny. The best man at a wedding who always fancied the bride comes close to being a marriage wrecker.I did find that the film's sickliness and tawdriness works better at Christmas.",4,4,9,25 December 2018
Sausage Party," Willie Wurst
","Astonishingly this R rated vulgar CGI adult cartoon is a lot better than my initial low expectations I had of it.In fact it really is some kind of rude, crude version of Toy Story with an anti-religious subtext as food products in the supermarket come alive, waiting to be selected by humans but not realising that a worse fate awaits them. They will be cooked and eaten.The film starts with a Disney lite song (written by Alan Menken) and is about a hot dog who falls in love with the attractive hot dog bun, just the right fit for him and once he discovers the truth he needs to get back to the supermarket and warn the others of what life outside the supermarket really is like. There is another product whose nozzle was damaged that goes after the hot dog as he blames him for his deformity.The makers play with stereotypes such as the Jewish Bagel, all calm and pacifist and the Arab Lavash being arrogant and rather old fashioned but honourable underneath. You have the German beers who are horrible to the juice.There is a sexy taco who also has the hots for the hot dog bun but that means a same sex relationship which is taboo. However the film ends with a literal food orgy, straight, bi, gay.",6,0,2,4 November 2016
There Will Be Blood," Blood and oil
","Daniel Day-Lewis plays oil prospector Daniel Plainview a man with his business partner goes looking for oil and finds it. When his partner dies in an accident leaving behind an infant, he raises the boy as his own. Together they go around looking for oil prospects and having a small child helps Plainview buy land cheaply and he goes on to become an oil magnate.When Day-Lewis is in full flow you will see two veins on his forehead that pump out and display his passion and ruthlessness. However Plainview has demons of his own, in his own words he dislikes other people succeeding and in his new oil field he takes a dislike to Eli the teenage preacher in a god fearing town. Later on he meets a man claiming to be his half brother and this upsets his son who has since become deaf in an accident.The film strives to be an epic which spans many years but we never understand why Plainview dislikes Eli so much even though Plainview has no time for religion and suspects Eli might be a hypocrite, although his son has taken a shine to Eli's sister who he later marries. At each turn Plainview ignores or embarrasses Eli even when he promised that he would build a church which he does not leading to Eli embarrassing Plainview in a church ceremony.Although Plainview sent his son away after the accident which made him deaf and later brought him back, its obvious he loves his son but later drives him away and not made clear why. Was it because he did not want his son to become poisoned like he has?The film deals with the early days of oil prospecting and part of the script is based on testimony given in a congressional hearing. However the film does not fully succeed because it relies too much on its performances than the overall plot arc, although like Michael Corleone at the end of The Godfather II, Plainview has been corrupted by his wealth and ends up alone.",7,1,3,6 July 2014
Joker," Joker
","What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot. It is a tribute act because of the Scorsese movies that inspired it.",6,26,87,10 October 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Joker in the ward
","I rewatched this film after going through some of Jack Nicholson's earlier performances in Five Easy Pieces and King of Marvin Gardens.He won an Oscar for this film, it is here we get the 'Jack' mannerisms that crop up in later films especially as we see aspects of the 'Joker' as soon as he appears on screen.It is almost 40 years since the film was made. I never realised the film is set in the early 1960s as it had a contemporary setting especially as we see 1970s cars in some of the exterior scenes.The film also has what were at the time unknown actors that have become stars in their own right. Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, Vincent Schiavelli. Even the producer Michael Douglas managed to become an Oscar winning actor!Convict McMurphy (Nicholson) enters a mental hospital thinking it would be easier to do time there than an ordinary prison. He brings chaos in his wake that stirs the other patients.We have had similar themed films done since then and even parodied on numerous occasions. So there is a lot of familiarity to the story even if you have never seen the movie before.McMurphy's behaviour brings him into conflict with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher.) Nurse Ratched is a cold, icy character who lacks empathy. As McMurphy mentions she is not playing a straight game.Although it could be said that it's McMurphy that has brought chaos with his wilful rule breaking. Her mask slips at the end when she humiliates Brad Dourif that brings tragedy.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an example of the edgy, adult 1970s cinema. It dealt with mature themes. It is not an epic dealing with a grandiose story yet it still won the Grand Slam of Oscars with Best actor, actress, screenplay, director and film.",7,0,3,1 March 2014
Downfall," Hitler's last days
","Downfall is an enthralling film that examine the final days of the Nazi hierarchy ensconced in their bunker. It is a war story I have never encountered before, the German view of the last days in 1945. As the war is lost we see the Nazis throwing their own citizens in peril as the red army takes control of Berlin.As Goebbels remarks, he has no sympathy for the German citizens, they made their choice, gave the Nazis the mandate now they will face the consequences.Downfall is told from the view of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) a young woman from Munich taken on by Hitler as a secretary in 1942. Her memoir is one of the sources of the movie's narrative.Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is increasingly unhinged at times shouts like a rabid dog of comrades, generals that have betrayed him. His acolytes in the bunker, some remain loyal, some look to get out, some look for a glorious death, others just to survive. As the city is near to falling, you see a few of the officers getting increasingly drunk, (Eva Braun lives a decadent life even as the city is being pounded) others make way in to the bunker and hear Hitler speak of some miraculous, imaginary strategy that an army division will come to the rescue. In the meantime he is making plans for his own and Eva's death and destruction of their bodies.As Berlin is destroyed, its citizens turn on in each other, people get hung as Russian collaborators. A young boy is part of a makeshift resistance to repel the Russians and then just tries to make his way home.At the end you see the Goebbels who decide it is National Socialism or nothing and Mrs Goebbels calmly kills her own children before they take their own lives.The film finishes as we see documentary footage of Junge who confesses she did not know what was happening under the Nazis but she should had looked harder, after all Sophie Scholl who was also from Munich knew what was happening.Downfall is apparently faithful to the facts. It is not just a film that is set in the bunker, you see the fighting in the city, the German soldiers trying to resist, getting conflicting orders at times impossible orders. One General is ordered to be shot for leaving his lines, he has not and goes to see Hitler to complain.Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a commanding film that holds your attention and a blazing performance by Ganz. His Hitler is ill and mad, knowing his dream of the third Reich is in ruins and flip flopping between reality and fantasy surrounded by sycophants who want him to leave Berlin and suspicious military leaders, who feel betrayed by his overconfidence and ineptitude who wish to pursue peace at this late stage.",10,1,2,26 October 2016
Whiplash," I like to teach the world to play
","Good Job are the key words for Whiplash. J K Simmons psycho jazz teacher, Terence Fletcher recounts a story about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough to uncover a genius. There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job' according to Fletcher.The trouble is Fletcher would not recognise a genius if it crashed into him head on. Simmons creates a monster of a teacher which to be truthful is not unknown in coaching circles in sports and the arts. However a good educator he is not, something his prestigious school seems not to have noticed.Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Eager to impress Fletcher and confounded that nothing he does can satisfy Fletcher. Neiman literally is driven to the edge.However there is only ever going to be one winner, Fletcher does not give an inch. J K Simmons won a best supporting actor Oscar for his mean and blustering performance. There was very little shade to his performance and even in his subdued moments his character was calculating. A man with little ethical core.It is left to Teller to bring soul to the film. The young student whose zest and passion for learning and improvement is fast fading away as he becomes the victim of intense bullying.The film never addresses the bullying by Fletcher. There is a sub plot about this later in the movie but notice how the other students just stay quiet and let the abuse unfurl. Given that cooperating with each other in music is so important, these students hardly talked to each other. They were reaaly a dysfunctional band who certainly did not give a shoulder to lean on which came across as unrealistic. Surely the students would mutter to each other in the canteen as to how horrible Fletcher was?As to the competition which causes Neiman problems as he has trouble getting there. Again you would have thought the Conservatory would had provided transport rather than rely on the students to make their own way.I did not think the film succeeded. The performances were intense but the screenplay had problems because the I never could buy into the band members as functioning students.",5,2,5,21 December 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Golden Hollywood Retriver
","Hail Caesar! is a screwball comedy and satire of late 1940s and early 1950s Hollywood. An era when writers were reds under the beds, stars had scandalous skeletons in the closet and both actors and actresses had to perform on the casting couch to get parts. Studio bosses had to hire fixers to make problems go away. Hollywood executive Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) who in between trying to give up smoking and going to confession is a fixer.Film star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears because he gets drugged and kidnapped by a group of communists and held for ransom but Whitlock at least engages in philosophical left wing banter with his erudite captors. Mannix needs to locate him fast and get the film finished.Mannix also has to deal with a cowboy actor who is good at stunts but no good at speaking lines especially as he is engaged to make a drama. There is starlet (Scarlett Johansson) who might be pregnant outside of wedlock which could lead to a big scandal.The Coen brothers take a scatter gun approach, it is almost free- wheeling in places with star cameos. Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) is a director trying to get Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to speak his lines correctly. Thora and Thessaly Tacker (Tilda Swinton in dual roles) are rival gossip columnists trying out-scoop each other.Somewhere in the film there are some good set pieces, the best of which is an outstanding dance routine from Channing Tatum, playing a Gene Kelly like actor and he really dances to the style of Kelly which is no mean feat.The film is too messy and too lightweight despite a heavyweight cast. The disjointed nature was irritating which tried to disguise a thin plot and some of the humour was as old as the biblical epic that the production company was trying to make.",4,2,5,3 April 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Knights of Columbus
","Anchorman is set in San Diego of the 1970s with Will Ferrell as television news anchor Ron Burgundy. It's an era of when men were men. Sexist, boys will be boys and even more sexist on top.Burgundy is shallow and a dullard, his friends are worse with Steve Carell's Brick, the weather man having a blank space where his brain should be. Burgundy's dog is actually more intelligent than all of them put together.The boys club is jolted when tough cookie Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate joins the news team and is aiming to be the sole news anchor and Ron's life goes on a downward spiral.There is also the deadly rivalry between Ron and the other competing news teams resulting in a deadly fight between them. As always in a Will Ferrell comedy his friends make a cameo appearances. Here Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson turn up as the fighting news anchors. Even Tim Robbins drops by representing the face of Public Television.The film is corny, there is flute playing, the Avengers theme, dogs having a chat with bears, some quotable lines, it is zany, mad and funny.",7,0,1,14 December 2013
The Reader," Learning from history
","In the anti Apartheid film, A Dry White Season the lawyer character played by Marlon Brando stated that Law and Justice are not the same thing, at best they are distant cousins and in South Africa they are not even on talking terms.In a similar vein in The Reader, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz) the law professor argues: 'Societies think they operate by something called morality, but they don't. They operate by something called law.'He goes on to say: '8000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 of murder.'The Reader is an infuriating film although I admire its subtlety and in some ways daring. Although the narrative is jumbled up, it consists of a love affair of Michael Berg (David Kross)a 15 year old schoolboy and a tram conductress Hanna (Kate Winslet) who is over twice his age. It is a passionate affair mainly due to his raging teenage hormones and during their time together he reads books to her.Hanna then suddenly disappears and the story moves eight years later when Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with other students and their lecturer Professor Rohl. To his horror he finds Hanna is one of the defendants as she was a guard at Auschwitz and is accused of allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church.This incidents sullies his memories of Hanna and racks him with guilt. Unable to talk to anyone about this he finds that he has information that could help her and lower her sentence. Micheal realises that the reason Hanna liked him to read to her was because she was illiterate and the accusations she is facing was the she allegedly gave written orders leading to people's death. This cannot be true but Hanna is embarrassed to let people know she cannot read or write.The final section consists of an older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) who we see in some scenes now a wealthy, successful lawyer, divorced but with a child still affected by her relationship with Hanna. Over time he has sent her tapes in which he narrates stories to her and eventually just before she is about to be released from prison he goes to see Hanna who is now an old woman.Eventually Michael goes to New York to see one of the survivors from Auschwitz who a small child at the time. It is an uncomfortable experience for him as he confesses his love affair with Hanna to her. The first time he has ever spoke about it.I somehow felt that the film always did not get its theme across clearly despite its symbolism and imagery. I liked parts of the film but it did not lead to a coherent whole.Hanna asks the Judge at the trial what would you have done?' Of course no answer is forthcoming. In the same vein young Micheal allows Hanna to be wrongly convicted. He is angry, ashamed, bitter or just clueless. Yet someone gave those written orders and he let Hanna carry the blame and let the real culprit get away with a lesser charge.I did think Hanna's lawyer was useless, I have little idea of the German legal system but he let her basically walk into jail and throw the key away. Surely he would had known that Hanna was not exactly that bright and she could not read or write. Did she never sign anything? Maybe one of Michael's fellow students was right, the trial was a sham, deflecting guilt from the many to a few.",6,0,0,5 December 2016
The Wrestler," Beyond the mat
","Mickey Rourke always talked a good film role although a lot of his films were all hype and little by way of substance and entertainment value. Just try watching The Pope of Greenwich Village!However after a few lean years with a detour into boxing and plenty of bad plastic surgery he gets a role to shine in with The Wrestler. He plays washed up, over the hill Randy Robinson known as The Ram. He was big in the late 1980s very much in the ilk of real wrestlers such as the Ultimate Warrior, he even had a video console game after him.Although we are not told why times are rough and where his money went, he is now living in a trailer park, behind on his payments, working in a warehouse and in the weekends also working at the lower rungs of wrestling with other over the hill stars and some up and coming talent. Faraway from the world of arenas that he strutted a few decades earlier.I assume his money went on wine, women, drugs and the good life. He is distant from his daughter who he abandoned when she was a kid and now spends his time in a strip club where he is friendly with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) although she is not his girlfriend.After a rough wrestling match he has a heart attack, he manages to get close with his daughter but he can never gel with her or Cassidy and with ailing health The Ram goes for a big pay wrestling match. He realises that the ring and the crowds is a life that he is comfortable with and at least gives him dignity.It is interesting that in many ways The Ram is a nice guy. He is friendly to the kids in the trailer park, he gets on well with fellow wrestlers, he is tender with Cassidy and wants just to have good relationship with his daughter. He seems to have no obvious traits such as alcoholism, drugs, gambling etc. He does takes steroids, he goes to strip clubs. We only see him lose his temper when someone at the store recognised him when he was working behind the meat counter and he felt embarrassed.Darren Aronofsky directs the film in a hand-held documentary style. It is low budget but he lets his three leads do the talking with their acting. Tomei comes off the best and is striking as the tattooed stripper, who is also commercially minded. She needs money for a better lifestyle. Even the guys playing wrestlers are good at their roles.Mickey Rourke bulked up for this picture. He admits he juiced up to get so big so quickly. This was another shot at the big time and he got a deserved Oscar nomination, although I think Sean Penn was better in Milk.This is a character study, a slow burn film, maybe at the end of the day it does not amount to much apart from a look at a character at the downside of his life.",6,0,0,5 November 2014
Dark Shadows," Shadow spoilt by being so light
","I know that Dark Shadows was a rather campy TV series rather well known in the USA but almost unheard of outside of North America.This was a concept Gothic film right up Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's street.It is a rather forgettable film which is disappointing for a Tim Burton movie.It seems Burton had difficulty in getting the tone right and the script was half baked before the project was even green lit.The film is set in 1972 with a revitalised Barnabas on the prowl again. As he acquaints himself with his descendants he tries to save the family business but old ghosts refuse to die.I can see why this was a box office disappointment, it's visually very good, what else would you expect from Tim Burton. The humour is sporadic, it lacks focus, a developed plot and fully formed characters.",5,0,0,9 November 2013
Kingpin," Witness this
","Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly made their names in crude comedies that pushed the envelope. In Kingpin they display more of their trademark zaniness and crudeness that they showed in Dumb and Dumber Woody Harrelson plays tenpin bowler named Roy Munson, a potential champion who ended up losing his bowling hand after being tricked by a fellow bowler (Bill Murray).Many years later living a deadbeat life where he does not have enough money to pay the rent. He meets a devout Amish man called Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who he sees as a potential champion and gets him to leave his community and head to Reno to take part in a championship where he meets up again with Bill Murray, now a sleazy bowling superstar with a bad comb-over.The film has plenty of crude humour with Harrelson getting into mishaps with his fake hand and hook. There is low brow humour such as milking a bull believing it to be a cow. Murray pops back at the end with hair that has a life of its own.The film starts off brightly, its refreshingly silly and funny. However it loses its absurdity once they hook up with Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and tries to add depth to the characters. It loses its spontaneity and only becomes sporadically amusing.",6,0,2,14 June 2015
Hancock," Scuzzy but super
","A comic book action film featuring a scuzzy, drunk as the superhero who causes mayhem and destruction every time he gets involved. The police, public and civic officials wished he remained a barfly.Things change when Hancock (Will Smith) saves the life of Jason Bateman, a Public Relations expert who wants be a corporate do-gooder and wants to revamp Hancock's image even if it means doing a stretch in jail because of his various misdemeanours.Bateman is married to Charlize Theron who remains cool and suspicious of Hancock but something is drawing them together.The premise of an inept and drunk super hero has some novelty as we see him become a better and more sober superhero who the kids eventually look up to but this does not keep the engine of the movie going.The sub plot involving some bad guys intending revenge is minor as they will never realistically be able to challenge Hancock leading to some plot contrivances involving the weakening of his powers.Yet the film is not over-long, moves at a good pace. Despite its edginess and some bad language even younger kids will find it enjoyable and funny.The film does have plot holes the more you think about it afterwards as to where Hancock came from and the amnesia is a convenient plot point.",6,1,2,10 March 2014
Kong: Skull Island," Kong is back
","By the setting Kong : Skull island in the 1973 the film gets to dovetail the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict onto the plot.The film begins with William Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) trying to get government funding for an expedition to the unknown Skull Island who they have satellite images of for the first time. They recruit a former British special ops James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as a guide and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) for the expedition.Lt Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of soldiers are the military escort. Packard is upset with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam leading what the fighting was for and what to do afterwards. This mission gives him purpose but as they arrive in their helicopters to Skull Island and start dropping bombs as part of scientific tests, they are attacked by the giant Kong who destroys the choppers and kills most of the men. Packard wants vengeance against Kong.Meanwhile Conrad and Weaver discover Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) a soldier from World War 2 who crash landed and resides with the natives in the island. Marlow explains that Kong is regarded as a god by the natives and he is their protector as the island has other monsters especially those underground that only Kong can take on.Kong: Skull Island neatly reworks elements of the King Kong story. We have the helicopter attack at the early part of the story leading to Packard becoming a sworn enemy of Kong. Of course Packard is crazy whose motivations are nonsense. It was he and his men who have invaded Kong's turf and started bombing it which has awaken the underground monsters. You get some mumbo jumbo about superiority of men while they are being killed by giant spiders and lizard creatures.It is an entertaining action adventure with a ludicrous story. At least you root for Kong and he does keep the story going. The special effects are very good and you gets all sorts of nasty creatures in the island which again is a call back to the original King Kong.The film really is unsure what to do with some of the leads. Larson is only there to be the tentative love interest to Hiddleston and bring out Kong's tender side. At least she fares better than the Chinese actress Tian Jing who as the other female is there just to keep the Chinese co-producers happy, she certainly has little to do in this film. Even Hiddleston's action man role is curtailed somewhat.",6,2,2,24 March 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Seduced by gold
","And finally a moderately length children's book beloved to generations of kids (I read The Hobbit over 3 decades ago) comes to a conclusion on screen.When the dragon Smaug meets a sharp end in the opening ten minutes and the credits begin, I thought the story had ended. In fact it was just the beginning of a return journey which would take a further two hours and a bit.In that time Thorin gets seduced by the Gold, goes back on his word and promises. Various armies gather and there are epic battles with decapitations and Legolas becomes a super elf.Bilbo becomes a secondary character in his own story and although the battles in what is mainly CGI is entertaining the whole enterprise is rather pointless as it should had been tagged on in the last movie.Ryan Gage's scenes as the cowardly Alfrid looks misjudged, Lee Pace as Thranduil is an arrogant boreThe film does provide a bridge to the Lord of the Rings trilogy with characters such as Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond turning up and fighting which kind of reminded me of the Star Wars prequel and Christopher Lee's stunt double was in those scenes as well.Lets be plain, The Hobbit films were turned into a trilogy because they were seen as a cash cow and this cow was throughly milked.",3,2,5,9 March 2015
Ray," Ray of hope
","In his heyday Ray Charles was an important and influential figure in rhythm, blues and jazz.To someone like me born after his heyday he was a blind guy playing a piano in a shiny suit. Believe it or not, Ray Charles once advertised a VHS player on American TV.This film is an attempt for the audience to know more about the man, his music and his demons which in his case were addiction to drugs.Like the film Walk the line which came out at a similar time, a boyhood tragedy affects and haunts him.Ray also has a close relationship with his mother until she died in he was 16 years old.His fledgling beginnings in music, being ripped off by friends and people who took advantage of his blindness. His marital relationships and of course his drug addiction in a background where racial strife in southern US states was still rife.Jamie Foxx gives a majestic performance as Ray, totally in control of the screen. Plaudits to Taylor Hackford for making what could had been a run of the mill bio-pic as something that keeps you glued to the screen.However there has been poetic licence taken with the facts, a few minutes at Wikipedia would tell you that his marital relationships does not square as to how its been portrayed in the movie.",8,2,3,5 November 2013
Murder on the Orient Express," A dashing Poirot
","There was a very good star studded version of Murder in the Orient Express made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot.I thought the later David Suchet television movie was disappointing.Kenneth Branagh stars and directs this new version wearing a massive moustache which surprisingly was not too distracting, even if it did make him look like a walrus.This is a stylish and muscular film with a star studded cast. Johnny Depp is the villain who becomes the victim on the train ride. Judi Dench, Michelle Pfieffer, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz are just some of the suspects.It is an enjoyable film even if you are familiar with the ending. Branagh gets to grips with the rather fussy detective who finds murder abhorrent. Even though Poirot is tired he cannot resist exercising those tiny grey cells once more.This Poirot does not overdo the humour and as the director he keeps the movie rattling along.",7,0,5,10 February 2018
Defiance," Fighting back
","Defiance is a well meaning but bloated film that wants to depicts Jews more than just as passive victims in eastern Europe during World War 2.Based on true facts of the Bielski brothers, Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig) is almost Moses like as he leads a band of Jews in the forest of Belarus to survival. He take in fleeing Jews, builds a society with rules of fairness so they do not live like animals. Fight any advancing militia and stave off hunger and disease.His quick tempered brother Zus (Liev Schreiber) wants to take the fight to the Nazis and the collaborators and has little time to help fleeing Jews to survive. He sides with the Russians even though he knows that they too are anti semites.Director Edward Zwick has to keep this two narrative strands going but the film is too disjointed and trite. The third brother Asael (Jamie Bell) is wasted as the one who has choose between his brothers and falls in love with one of the beautiful girls in the woods which causes friction with a rival who throws a challenge to Tuvia's authority.The film is hackneyed, dreary and not even that interesting. The actors speak Russian and then shift to English with heavy accents. The film needed a lightness of touch and maybe even some humour to counterbalance the grimness.",4,0,2,23 June 2016
Lord of War," A deals a deal
","Lord of War sees Nicolas Cage play Yuri Orlov, a Russian émigré to the United States, whose family pretends to be Jewish and living in a dead end world of Little Odessa. He sees an opportunity that violence can make him money and becomes a successful arms dealer as he starts out small in the early 1980s and his enterprise takes off once the USSR collapses.Yuri is immoral, he realises if its not him, then someone else will sell arms. Even then someone will find a way to kill others. The film is driven by its narration and goes on a zippy and st time a sarcastic and cynical pace, maybe too fast as before long Orlov and his brother go from working in a family restaurant to an arms trade fair and his brother being hooked on drugs.Things take a turn as Interpol close in on him after pursuing him for years and his wife probes deeper into his activities, his brother realises the consequences of their actions in giving weapons to local warlords.Cage does not convince entirely as a Russian born American, the film is also a little bit to glib and smug, although the cynicism is a plus but it does come close to some preachiness here and there. Of course Orlov must face the consequences of his action but Ethan Hawke who plays the Interpol agent seems to be too much of a smug boy scout himself. The film loses steam towards the end with what looks like silly plot resolution to give Orlov a crisis of conscience but it still makes for an interesting and at times a funny film.",6,0,1,18 September 2014
Sherlock Holmes," The great game
","Guy Ritchie after a spell in the doldrums returned with a big budget production of Sherlock Holmes with a rejuvenated Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law playing a more brutish Dr Watson.The villain here is aristocratic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has been foiled when partaking in a ritual sacrifice and despite being hung for his crimes, seemingly returns from the dead and kills others by use of black magic it seems as he aims to topple the British establishment.Irene Adler turns up in the shape of Rachel McAdams with a hint of romance with Holmes and there are plenty of hints that Professor Moriarty is lurking in the background.Guy Ritchie has gone for a grimy, steam-punk setting of London. There is plenty of CGI the more effective being the partially built Tower of London but the CGI looks just that and has aged badly even though the film was only released in 2009.Ritchie still sticks with his London setting of cockney schemers and wheeler dealers. Its a muscular film with slow motion fight scenes as Holmes anticipates the combat in advance. His Watson is also handy with his fists, you actually wonder if he is a pugilist rather than a doctor. I did find the sub plot of Holmes being put out that Watson is engaged to get married rather irritating and not funny at all.Still Downey is enjoying himself and gets to try out his English accent again after Chaplin ad Richard III. This is a muscular action adventure film, less of a mystery as the plot places an emphasis on the supernatural and some of Holmes famous deductions are actually laughable.",6,0,0,2 July 2015
WALL·E," Eve of love
","Wall-E starts off unusually enough with little dialogue but show tunes from a Barbara Streisand film. A lone garbage compacting robot in a desolate, waste ridden earth of the future until one day a ship lands and unleashes a female robot, Eve who leaves him smitten. In fact the film makes it plain repeatedly that Wall-E is in love.There is another story of a ship on a centuries old journey where the humans have evolved to be obese and rather lazy. These are the descendants of the people who escaped from the rubbish strewn planet, the ship has a nominal captain but most of the real work is done by a computer.The film although coming in from another angle of a robot wanting, even needing affection and finding it which leads him to a journey in space then falls for some dependable Disney/Pixar plot points. There has to be a villain with a hidden agenda, there will be some pulsating but humorous chase scenes.Also if the humans spend all their time on those hover chairs drinking fizzy drink all day, who was the person having the time to have babies because we get the impression that these people were too busy or empty to have personal relationships.The animation is of a very high standard but the start might be deemed to be slow and the film looks flawed if you examine it too carefully. Also the film ends up paying a homage to 2001:A space odyssey.",6,2,4,12 August 2014
Finding Dory," Forget me not
","Finding Nemo was a big hit with kids and adults alike and led to a surge of interest in clown-fish.Finding Dory is set a year after the events of the first film, as the forgetful Dory, a blue tang fish gets flashbacks to her early fish years in Morro Beach, California and strives to find her parents.Marlon and Nemo assist her but they soon become separated and a lot of the action is set in an Aquarium with narration by Sigourney Weaver. There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest.It is clear to see how much the CGI animation has improved since Finding Nemo, but this sequel is less charming and also has less originality. Too many scenes are contrived so you see familiar faces or have Dory getting flashbacks with her parents. The finale with a truck chase sequence is just far fetched.My kids enjoyed the movie and found parts of it emotional as well. Interest in clown-fish will still be around for a few more years.",5,5,9,27 April 2017
Stalag 17," Inside man
","Stalag 17 is directed by the legendary Billy Wilder. It is an adaptation of a stage play and was filmed just seven years after the end of the Second World War.Its an uneasy mixture of drama, suspense and broad comedy. Given how some British movies made in the 1960s were so pompous about the war its refreshing to see an anarchic take of the war few years after the end of hostilities.Stalag 17 is a Prisoner of War camp inside Germany with captured American personnel. The film opens with two men trying to escape who are soon captured and killed. The prisoners think that one of them is a rat and suspicion falls on Sefton (William Holden) the resident black marketeer and hence not the most popular person in the hut. Sefton's character is similar to George Segal's character in King Rat, a man who knows how to live on his wits and his mission is to survive, preferably in some comfort.Some of the comedy did not work for me, I found it irritating. It focuses on Animal who is infatuated with Betty Grable and wants to break into the nearby compound which holds Russian female POWs and his friend Shapiro. The film would had been better if they were the two characters trying to escape at the beginning of the film and shot.Yet there are some serious aspects to the film. The men are held in filthy conditions given new blankets for a few hours when the man from Geneva arrives to inspect the camp for human man rights breaches and are then quickly taken away. They receive letters from back home and find out that they are behind on their rental payments or their spouses might be cheating on them.However it looks not all of the men are American. One of them is a German inside man, placed there to find out all manner of information that could be important to the Germans. Sergeant Schultz who regularly comes into the hut and takes part in the buffoonery with the prisoners is also exchanging messages with the insider. This plot only unfolds as Sefton realises he needs to clear his name quickly and sets about to unravel the rat.I did feel that bit of the plot was not very strong. No one in that hut played chess, yet the chessboard was always out and no one seems to have noticed the knotted/unknotted cord. Also with Sefton now the prime suspect, we see the real insider asking one of the new men for information on a sabotage event that took place. Its clear that the men would eventually realise that Sefton was not the rat, especially if they managed to get Sefton out of the way like kill him.I class Stalag 17 as a curious war film which was sold as a comedy. It is neither a comedy nor a straight drama. It inspired the television series Hogan's Heroes and William Holden won a best actor Oscar for his role.",5,2,4,22 July 2015
Arrival," Coming to a country near you
","Denis Villeneuve is aiming for a high brow, intellectually stimulating sci fi film. It had all the tropes of an alien invasion film. You might think Independence Day or The Day the Earth Stood Still or even 2001: A Space Odyssey but the director keeps his cards closely to his chest while leaving little clues here and there in the space/time continuum.Twelve alien ships land around the globe. Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the linguist expert brought in by the military in the USA to communicate with the aliens in the ship that is over Montana.Physicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) has also been recruited to find out how the spaceship has travelled through the vast reaches of space but both are really tasked to find out why they have arrived.The various governments and their associated military are convinced that this is an invasion and some of them have become extremely nervous with the alien's intentions and the slow pace in understanding what is going on. Before long nations that were communicating with each other suddenly cease sharing information and throwing down ultimatums to the visitors.Dr Banks makes a breakthrough and finds out that the aliens have a complex visual language but the meaning of the words are open to interpretation which is not helped by a media frenzy based on misinformation and half truths. Dr Banks is also affected by scenes of her daughter who died young through a rare disease but those memories might actually help her to deal with the aliens.Even though the events depicted are on a global scale, Villeneuve keeps the human drama on a smaller more abstract level and lets the film unravel like a mystery. I guess there is something a little Christopher Nolanesque about the resolution. There is clever and eerie use of music and sounds. With the appearance of the aliens, you can understand why people are nervous. I found myself thinking back to Independence Day or the television series Torchwood: Children of Earth for sinister motives by the aliens as they were shrouded in smoke behind a glass wall.",8,2,13,16 November 2016
The Terminal," No duty free
","The Terminal is a small scale film from Steven Spielberg. It is inspired by a true event but is really a fictionalised account.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveller from Krakozhia who arrives at New York's JFK Airport only to find that his passport is cancelled due to a civil war in his homeland. He is left stateless and living at the airport terminal lounge because he cannot leave the airport and enter New York or be sent back home.Vicktor needs to find a way to survive at the terminal lounge, find a way to earn money for food for example, even learn English and pass the time day by day. Frustrating him is Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) the security chief at the terminal who just wants him to leave so he can be someone else's problem. As time goes by Viktor learns English, gets a job, earns money, makes friends with the staff even finds romance with a stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and confounds Dixon which makes him more angrier.Spielberg has made a Kafkaesque fantasy comedy and is helped by a likable performance by Hanks. They just about get away with this absurd premise helped by supporting characters such as Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Saldana (playing a Star Trek fan before she ended up with a major role in the Star Trek films.)If this had happened in real life, Vicktor would had been sent an immigration lawyer and an interpreter and would had got temporary admission to the United States.However Spielberg does lapse into schmaltz frequently in this film and Dixon is a weak token villain of the piece.",5,0,1,21 December 2016
Parasite," Parasite
","Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.",7,3,4,24 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The play is the thing
","Alejandro González Iñárritu has made a wonderful technical film in Birdman with the way the set has been constructed and the movement of the camera to make it look like one long shot. It is also a deceptive film as a second viewing gives you more clues apart from the obvious Chekhov's gun principle.I do wonder if Iñárritu had already signed up Michael Keaton before the script was written or completed. It was well known that before Birdman Keaton was doing inferior films such as Penthouse North and heading television movie land. Although having watched Batman Forever, no reasonable person can fault him for turning it down.In Birdman Keaton plays Riggan, who once made it big as squawking superhero Birdman, years before the current superhero craze. Since then he has been washed up. He tells his daughter a story of being on a plane where he sat a few seats from George Clooney, the plane encountered some trouble and Riggan realises at this point that if the plane crashed, it would be Clooney's face plastered on the papers. The irony being that Clooney was the second actor after Keaton to play Batman and a few years later Keaton was playing a small role in a George Clooney thriller.Riggan is directing, adapting and starring in a play in Broadway to reclaim his career. His recovering drug addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is assisting, girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is a co-star. When the main actor gets injured at rehearsal, it is suggested by another actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) to bring in celebrated but difficult stage actor Mike (Edward Norton.)Straight off the bat Riggan realises just how good Mike is, how the play comes alive when he speaks the dialogue, yet also what a nuisance he can be, throwing tantrums. Mike only feels real on the stage, this includes being sexually functional.Riggan needs to get the play working by opening night and impress the theatre critic of the New York Times and she is sharpening the knives for Riggan. A celebrity (she refuses to acknowledge him as an actor) like him does not belong in polluting the New York stage.Of course Birdman is more than just Riggan getting a play ready. In his quest to be relevant, he hears voices of his alter ego, Birdman. We see Riggan moving things by just thinking about it, is he on the edge of sanity or somewhere between life and death?The film demonstrates how good Keaton could be, it is an astonishingly good performance from an actor known for light comedies back in the 1980s. It is a film with good performances. Norton like Sean Penn shows how effortless he can do comedy even while being intense. The real plus about the film is how you can interpret the film. It is a satire on Hollywood fame (with all its cultural references it will also age quickly) but also a reflective film about life and death.",8,0,0,28 January 2018
The Big Short," Too big to fail
","The Big Short is simply an outstanding film. I wanted to go to the top of a cliff and shout that good intelligent films were still being made. The trouble is it is a long drive for me before I can get to a nice cliff.I remember talking to my business bank manager in 2004 and telling him that there were people who were buying houses that had risen in value by over 300% in the last few years. These people were getting mortgages to buy these houses and their wages had not gone up by anything like 300%. The multiples for the wages/mortgage ratio did not add up.The bank manager who worked for his bank for decades since he left college told me not to worry. There would be no housing crash as they had learned the lesson of the early 1990s when the housing market last overheated. He was right, this time it was different, his bank went bust and had to bailed out. He still would not admit to his bank's stupidity or negligence.What should be a snoozefest about the financial meltdown of 2007/08 due to bad mortgage lending is made exhilarating and informative because the filmmakers use celebrities to coherently explain the financial concepts at the centre of this film.The star studded cast includes three Oscar winners. Dr Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedge fund manager at Scion Capital. A qualified doctor who likes to drum to loud music, he doesn't like wearing shoes, is socially awkward and he has a glass eye. Burry discovers that the housing mortgage market is riddled with bad loans and bets against it. His action scares his own investors.Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) is the narrator of this film. He admits he is not altruistic, he did it for the money. He is an investment banker who learned of Burry's bet against the housing market. Vennett also thinks that the subprime mortgage market is vulnerable.Vennett also wants to bet against the market and persuades Mark Baum (Steve Carell) another socially awkward investor with a strong moral ethic. Baum and his team travel around to see if there is any truth that the subprime mortgage market could fail. They talk to mortgage brokers, people who have taken out loans, people who work in the ratings agencies, dealers that slice and dice the risky bonds full of bad debt. Baum is appalled with what he finds out.Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley are two small time investors trying to break into the big time who stumble on Vennett's proposals. They too think that Vennett's ideas have substance. However as they are small league they need the help of their neighbour Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired investment bankers for the big banks. Rickert felt the whole financial system was wrong and heading for a fall.You can view these guys as mavericks, weirdos or even losers. Once they bet against the mortgage market they have a vested interest. They need the banks to fail or else they will lose money.What they find is that whole system was run by people who had no clue what they were doing, the market was rigged, worse corrupt and they would likely to be bailed out at the end. While the going was good they earned money in commissions and there was plenty of that flowing.The Big Short was directed and co-written by Adam McKay who is better known comedies. McKay won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He just about contains his anger as to what happened and the price ordinary people paid after the collapse. He lets his film do the talking and there is no need for him to do a polemic. McKay adds comedy to an already intelligent film.",10,0,1,17 December 2018
Never Back Down," Karate kid club
","Get some The Karate Kid, add some Bloodsport, mix with Fight Club with a dash of Rocky and you have Never Back Down.Not the most original film but amiable, predictable and silly enough as hotheaded and rebellious Jake Tyler (Sean Farris) who beat up everyone on a football pitch because of a rude comment about his father moves to a new town to help his younger brother play competitive tennis.However in his first day at High School he is lured into a fight by Ryan (Cam Gigandet) who is aware of his exploits in his previous school as they run a not so underground fight club.Jake gets badly beaten up by Ryan and befriends Max (Evan Peters), who introduces him to the world of Mixed Martial Arts run by Jean (Djimon Hounsou) a tough trainer who has a golden rule. No fighting outside of the club. However Ryan keeps on taunting him especially as Jake is going out with ex girlfriend (Amber Heard.)In the climax there is a showdown as both enter a MMA competition. Its a hokey film, Farris looks a lot like a young Tom Cruise without the charisma. Hounsou is the tough trainer with a tender heart (a cross between Mickey from Rocky and Mr Miyagi.) You know that his no fighting rule is going to get breached. The film has a Fast & Furious type beat with the music and is aimed at a younger crowd. The kind that heal quickly from a good beating.",5,0,0,28 September 2015

","John Carpenter directed this low budget classic horror film.Carpenter also provides an irritating slasher style soundtrack that is louder than the dialogue.The film opens with a young boy called Michael killing his sister in Halloween. It then goes forward 15 years when Michael has escaped his mental hospital.Hot on his heels is the psychiatrist, Doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance) convinced that Michael will kill again.Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the young babysitter who along with her friends are being stalked by Michael.Carpenter builds tension slowly along with some gratuitous topless scenes of teenage girls. He creates a creepy atmosphere with the Halloween paraphernalia.The television is showing the movie The Thing from Another World, a movie Carpenter would go on to remake. More importantly he has a genuine heroine in peril in Jamie Lee Curtis.The killings are horrific but less bloodthirsty than modern movies. In Michael Myers he also has an indestructible killer, The Boogeyman who never stays dead. Handy for all future sequels.",6,0,0,28 October 2018

Wonder Woman," The god of war
","DC Comics and Warner Brothers are expanding their universe. After Wonder Woman's appearance in Batman v Superman in 2016, she gets her own standalone film.In keeping with the Justice League universe, the film has that dark and murky look. We get a long drawn out beginning of a young girl who is a descendant of a Greek god wishing to train to be a warrior despite her mother's resistance to the idea.We then see a grown up Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot) who develops little muscular physique despite all her training with fellow warrior sisters on a mystical isolated island of Themyscira.When an an American pilot Steve (Chris Pine) crashes near this island followed by German soldiers, the Amazonians learn of an outside world where humans are engaged in a great war, the first world war. Diana leaves her island with Steve and goes to London with a desire to stop the war.Steve has found out about a German chemist called Dr Poison trying to develop chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless in a background of both sides to the war having peace talks. Diane believes that Ares, the god of war is responsible for the human misery caused by warfare. The film improves once the action moves to London but there are problems with the story. It is weak, when a sinister German general is disposed off well before the end of the film, it just confirms that a certain character is going to be the big bad of the movie.Some of Steve's ragbag of associates who are there for camaraderie and comic relief are useless. A marksman who cannot shoot.The film feels overlong and underwhelming. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief in Wonder Woman's acrobatic abilities as well parrying bullets with her wrist bands.Gadot showed promise in her appearance in Batman v Superman last year, but carrying a film on her own exposed her limitations as an actress.

","As 2014 is the centenary of the beginning of The Great War, many television channels are showing some of classic war films.Paths of Glory deals with the French side of the war and contrasts with All Quiet on the Western Front which dealt from the German perspective.This was the second feature film from director Stanley Kubrick and this might the only film where Kirk Douglas is at his most heroic, the straight up Colonel Dax who realises that his men are being sold down the river.A General promised a promotion ruthlessly orders a tired battalion to charge up a hill and then looks for scapegoats when it fails. He wants to shoot a 100 men for cowardice but this number is whittled down to 3. One of them is chosen by his superior officer because he knows that officer is a drunk, a coward who killed one of his own soldier and so takes the opportunity to get rid off him. Another was drawn by random chance. Colonel Dax defends these men passionately but to no avail because its a kangaroo court.The film has a very effective battle sequence and before it starts you see Douglas walking up the trench with a determined grimace, its Kubrick showing his early promise.After the battle scenes, the film turns into a courtroom film and then it morphs into a film dealing with death as the men are sentenced and await their fate.The film has a raw edge, unlike other Kubrick films its not very long, its well acted with some hiss-able villains such as the dastardly General Mireau but it will also make you angry as the soldiers are used as fodder whose lives are cheap.",7,0,1,7 September 2014
Despicable Me," Bad boy Gru
","Gru (Steve Carell with a east European type accent) is the nefarious despicable me of the tile. A super villain having to fend off the new kid on the block, Vector (Jason Segel.)Gru wants to steal the Shrink Ray weapon from Vector and then steal the moon.In doing so, adopts three orphan girls to help him carry out his scheme. The yellow minions provide slapstick that keep the little ones amused.Despicable Me is a family cartoon with a European slant. There are gadgets, gizmo's, varying villains and sweet kids that finally melt mean Gru's heart. In some ways it shares sentiments with Scrooge.The story is strong without it getting too schmaltzy and the animation is good.",7,0,0,20 February 2014
Back to the Future Part II," Back to Back to the future, present and past.
","Back to the Future was a big, big hit. Everyone was crying out of a sequel and the team of Zemeckis/Gale made two sequels back to back.However with Crispin Glover refusing to return as George McFly meant that the story for the BTTF II had to be drastically altered. They went in a complete different direction with just excerpts of Glover used from the original film as well as a double.BTTF II also replaces Marty's girlfriend with Elizabeth Shue and her role has been drastically reduced.BTTF ended with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J Fox) and Jennifer to the future to sort out his kids. This time where they were going they did not need roads.Marty and the crew arrive in 21 October 2015. The day this review was written. At the time I saw this film in the cinema 2015 sure felt like a long time away and you really felt that there would be hover-boards and 3D holographic films. I guess Avatar was the nearest we got to it.Although Marty sorts out his offspring's future it also allows Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and a sports almanac and drastically change the time-line to a darker one. Marty and Doc have to go back to the 1955 and the setting for the original film to restore the original time-line.BTTF II is a fast paced film as it squeezes the plots of three movies in its running time. However by going for a darker alternative time-line some of the charm of the original film was lost which was largely maintained in the future scenes set in 2015. As Fox remarked when the film came out , they wanted the future to be largely optimistic.My biggest issue always was that sports almanac with all the results of sporting events going back 50 years was an awfully thin book. Was it a prototype Kindle?Fox and Lloyd have no problems reprising their roles and very much carry on from the original film. The only odd change of character being that Marty gets upset when someone calls him chicken when he refuses a challenge.Fox has fun playing multiple characters in the film, Lea Thompson also plays her character in different time-lines and Thomas F Wilson is nasty Biff whichever time-line he is in.The film is a rollicking good adventure and a sequel that is almost shoulder to shoulder with the original. Zemeckis and Gale went on a different direction than many people expected. This is no lazy cash grab sequel. Its a time travel adventure that stands on its own self lacing Nikes and stupendously finishes with the set up to a third film.However the film does miss Crispin Glover's offbeat George McFly. I felt this at the time I saw the movie in the cinema and my opinion has not changed 26 years later.",9,1,2,21 October 2015
Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","Despite the proliferation of channels such as Hallmark and Lifetime. Good films that show a realistic portrayal of a breakdown in a marriage and the subsequent divorce are few and far between.The Oscar winning Kramer vs Kramer was 40 years ago. The black comedy The War of the Roses was 30 years ago.Based on director's Noah Baumbach's own experiences of getting divorced. Charlie (Adam Driver) is a New York theatre director. His wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is an actress who has recently moved back to Los Angeles to make a television series and taken their son Henry with her.Although the couple agreed to divorce amicably without involving lawyers. Nicole then hires a hotshot divorce lawyer in LA, Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) who tells Nicole thaty being LA based would be advantageous for Nicole. In turn Charlie lawyers up. First he goes to a veteran attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda) whose advice seems to vary a lot but at least he sees the need to come to an agreement. Charlie then goes for the more pumped up and expensive Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) and both sides end up slinging mud at each other.I suppose most of the male audience will sympathise with Charlie and would be more willing to see events from his point of view. He is an up and coming theatre director with a show moving to Broadway. Charlie is confused as to why Nicole has gone legalistic. He fears losing contact with his son, he realises the expense of getting divorced and that he will end up footing the bill.Most of the female audience will sympathise with Nicole. She has fallen out of love with Charlie, she now feels held back and thinks she can do better in LA. She suspects Charlie might have had an affair.I watched the movie with my wife and she certainly sided with Nicole.Marriage Story is a mature and intelligent movie. It doesn't take sides. Despite Charlie's and Nicole's best intentions of an amicable separation. They then repeat the same mistakes which thousands of other divorcing couple do the world over.There is some humour in this movie, at times it is sad and raw. I did find the film overlong and the early part of the movie was slow paced.",7,3,6,17 December 2019
The Queen," The Queen
","Peter Morgan definitely got a germ of an idea of doing The Crown Saga for Netflix from this. This is high gloss camp.Made by Granada, it does feel like a drama documentary made for television.The Queen is portrayed by Helen Mirren who won a best actress Oscar. Britain looks fundamentally changed to her when her former daughter in law, Princess Diana dies in a car accident in Paris.Just a few months earlier, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) became Prime Minister as New Labour won a landslide in the 1997 General Election.The British public feel angry that the Royal Family appear to be aloof during the days following Diana's death. Too wrapped in protocol rather than display any grief.It is left to Blair and his press secretary Alistair Campbell to persuade the Queen that they need to show a more touchy feely side. Something that does not come naturally to Prince Philip (James Cromwell.)Although in 1997 it really did feel like Britain has at last modernised, but you can never count out the Ancien Regime. Britain has had a government of public school toffs since 2010 the public just loves them. They cannot get enough of austerity. Not to worry there is plenty of more of that coming.Of course the truth was even the nation's grief over the death of Diana was hyperbole. I went to work on the following Monday and everyone carried on as normal. Just sad that two children lost their mother.You will never get an inkling of that ordinariness in this movie. It is just a rehashing of news footage with both Blair and the Queen reasserting the monarch's authority with some smart public relations.",6,0,0,3 May 2020
Taken 2," Just take it away
","The first Taken was a belated surprise hit in the USA. It was already out on DVD in the UK for some time before it was released in the cinemas in the United States.No wonder then there was pressure for a sequel and this one literally was knocked off on the back of a cigarette packet. Hence note the short running time.Liam Neeson who is now in his 60s returns a bit more creakier as the ex CIA agent.After a job in Istanbul he has a short holiday with his daughter and ex-wife but hot on his tail are the family of the Albanian sex trafficking kidnappers who are thirsty for revenge.We enter a world where in Turkey, mosques seems to chant the call for prayer throughout the day, women are dressed in black burqas and the police drive ancient Lada type cars. I have been to Istanbul and that is far from the truth.I understand Luc Besson was called out for his anti Islamic sentiments in the first Taken film, he obviously cares little about those accusations.We have a story where it is the ex wife who is now taken. His daughter is chased by kidnappers and Neeson must make sure they are both safe and kill the bad guys.The plot is nonsensical and does not make sense. The fight scenes have fast edits like the Bourne films but I reckon they are there to mask Neeson's old age.One is rather thankful the film ended quickly. The Turks were presumably happy for the cash they got for the location filming. The producers ecstatic that they still managed to make oodles of money at the box office.",2,0,1,9 September 2013
The Woman in Black," Atmospheric but bland
","The 1989 television movie made for ITV was creepy and compelling.This remake has a muscular performance with a youthful Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe.) A lawyer with personal issues. He is raising his young son with the help of a nanny.His employer sends Kipps to deal with the affairs of the late Mrs Drablow who lived in a small troubled village.Kipps sees the mysterious woman in black. She claims the local children by having them take their lives as she lost her own son.This is a moody, British gothic horror. It goes for atmosphere and chills rather than gore. I did find it all too predictable. The film is not as good as the 1989 version and Radcliffe did not sell it to me, he was just too young in the role. Maybe if Ciaran Hinds had the lead, it would had been different.",5,0,1,31 December 2018
X-Men: First Class," First mission
","The X Men trilogy seems to have been nicely wrapped up. Of course 20th Century Fox do not want the film rights to revert to Marvel films.So they have to continue the series either with the Wolverine spinoff's or in this case with the prequels.X-Men First Class should not had worked but be seen as a cheap knock off prequel. However director Matthew Vaughn has injected a lot of love and verve here.Like X-Men 1, the film starts in a concentration camp during World War 2 where Dr Schmidt/Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) is experimenting on Jews and Mutants including a young boy called Erik Lensherr.In New York City, a telepathic boy, Charles Xavier meets a young shape-shifter called Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), whose natural form is a scaly blue-skin.Xavier invites her to live with his family as a sort of foster sister.After graduation from Oxford University, Xavier later meets the more volatile Lensherr who discovers that Shaw is also a powerful mutant and wants to take him down for what he did to him in World War 2.Yet at the same time there is something about Shaw's outlook that attracts Lensherr and this causes friction with Xavier.Here is an origins story that really meshes with the X-Men films as we see the forming of the friendship with Professor X (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender.)Both actors excel in their roles. You root for both of these characters even though the seeds for their rivalry has already been sown.The film has great production design and costumes. It shows as the film is set in the past and uses historical events such as the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis to drive the story along.The performances from Kevin Bacon as the villain is instrumental in making the film work. He is a despicable villain and amoral.He is the one that points Magneto the dark side that not matter what good the mutants do, humans will never accept them.I was sceptical of how good the film would be when it was announced, thinking this as a cynical milking of the franchise.Instead it has breathed new life to the X-Men films in more ways than the Wolverine spin off did.",7,0,0,11 January 2014
The Wolverine," Fuzzy Wolverine
","Like James Bond in You only live twice, Wolverine turns Japanese which adds some exotic Japanese locations and actions to the mix but the plot is so hackneyed and nonsensical as it makes no sense whatsoever and it really lets the film down.The X-Men universe is getting to be tiresome despite getting rejuvenated a few years earlier in X-men: First Class only then to make another stand alone Wolverine film which reverses the good work they did in the prequels and quickly sours the freshness.Hugh Jackman might have got comfortable with his hair and claws but he needs better material. The action scenes are good with plenty of CGI and special effects but the story has been sliced and diced by a Hattori Hanzo Samurai sword.",5,4,6,13 February 2016
Win Win," Elderly care
","Paul Giamatti is Mike Flaherty, a down on his luck lawyer who also helps out coaching the high school wrestling team who are lousy. Mike finds out he can get $1500 a month for being a guardian to Leo (Burt Young) a wealthy elderly client who has dementia and who is searching for his daughter.Mike puts Leo in an old people's home despite he wants to stay in his own house as Mike knows this would be easier and he gets easy money just when he needs it most. However things get complicated when Leo's teenage grandson Kyle (Alex Shaffer) shows up for a visit. Leo's daughter is in rehab. Mike puts up Kyle and finds out that he is a great wrestler which gives the high school team a boost. Then Leo's daughter shows up wanting custody of Leo and she seems more interested in her dad's money.Win Win benefits from strong performances and a quirky plot which rather glosses over the problems with its story. Everybody is using Leo for their own means. Mike takes on the guardianship for his monthly fees but at least he puts him in a nice home. His daughter just wants money and cares little about Leo which Mike eventually discovers.",5,0,1,11 February 2018
Black Panther," Fight the power
","Marvel Films have their formula down to a fine art. Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it. It is something Marvel Comics has tackled from its early days.A well mounted, good looking action film but it lacks substance. The box office figures are shocking. It is good but not that good.",6,3,9,13 March 2018
Any Given Sunday," The modern sporting life
","Oliver Stone turns his attention to American Football with a long and frenetic film.The Miami Sharks are in turmoil and struggling to make the playoffs. Their veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), who has fallen out of favour with young owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz)and offensive coordinator Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart)is expected to succeed D'Amato as head coach. During the season the Sharks quarterback, Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and his replacement are both injured. They have to call up the rookie quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen is visibly nervous which includes throwing up during the game and makes a number of errors as he lacks knowledge regarding the team's play-book. Beamen however gains in confidence and quickly his star is in the ascendancy but the can the wily D'Amato turn the team around and outfox Pagniacci?Stone tells us the stories of people from different levels as they struggle to survive within in the world of professional sport. Cap is ageing and maybe past his best but his wife wants him to continue despite the pain of injuries to keep up with the lifestyle. Beamen on the hand is getting endorsements, money and women but loses his long time girlfriend along the way. Many of the others are willing to risk long term health as their ruthless medic (James Woods) is willing to give shots and misinterpret findings so the players keep on playing.Stone like D'Amato now a veteran filmmaker maybe past his prime when he made this film is typically audacious and frenetic. As always he keeps the camera moving, when one player gets tackled his eye pops out. He gets Pacino to let rip in several scenes but gets more nuances performances from Foxx and Quaid. A critical eye on NHL franchises, money and sport but this is a minor film in Stone's resume.",6,1,2,14 June 2014
Creed II," Back to the ring
","Sylvester Stallone did not write Creed but returns as co-writer for Creed II.Although this is a semi sequel to Rocky IV, the plot is really inspired by Rocky III.Adonis Creed (Michael B Jordan) has become heavyweight champion of the world. Bianca (Tessa Thompson) is pregnant. They move to LA so Bianca can kick start her singing career.However there is a cloud on the horizon. A canny boxing promoter has signed up knockout machine Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu,) son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) the man who killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match.Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) warns Adonos not to go for the fight. Just as Mickey knew that Rocky was no match for Clubber Lang, Rocky knows that despite his rawness Viktor is lethal.Adonos refuses to listen to Rocky and takes up the challenge to avenge his father's death. However the Dragos are fighting to restore their pride after Ivan's loss to Rocky which left him being treated like a dog.The film has some nice small touches such as Viktor's mother making a self serving appearance. Ivan although maybe not showing remorse, is haunted by the events of Rocky IV. He lost everything and this is a chance for redemption. Dolph Lundgren always a better actor when he is given the right material displays a presence even though most of his dialogue is in Russian.Stallone too shows the right beat as Rocky is kept as support to Adonis, although he is never out of the picture for long.Director Steven Caple Jr balances the boxing scenes with an emotional story such as Adonis's baby at risk of being born deaf.",7,0,1,7 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Men in tights
","Batman v Superman is a bloated, portentous movie which takes an age to get going. In fact an hour into the film I did look at my watch to see how long it has been going and the person in front of me in the cinema was snoring.The film apart from pitting the Caped Crusader against the Man in the red cape also sets the Justice League universe up for the next slew of films as well as giving us Wonder Woman.The film asks us to forget the events of Man of Steel where Superman did battle with General Zod who was seeking to destroy the human race and led to a destructive battle over Metropolis.This film asks questions whether such an omnipotent being is above the law or whether he should be subject to controls. Bruce Wayne simply blames him for the death and destruction of people in Metropolis.Some sinister forces conspire that Superman needs to be set up to take a fall which plays into Batman's hand who is already getting ready for a fight.The key is a young Lex Luthor who is portrayed here as a whimsical and mischievous entrepreneur doing deals with politicians to gain access to a Kryptonian ship, the body of General Zod and Kryptonite. Luthor has shady plans of his own which includes using new found knowledge to create something with Zod's bodyWhen Luthor throws a party he brings people together which includes Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent and Diana Prince who will later come together as their alter egos.Zack Snyder has chosen to use a washed out palette to visualise his story, foregoing once again the bright primary colours we normally associate with Superman. Henry Cavill again lacks the charisma of Christopher Reeves and his Clark Kent is bland and barely noticeable.Ben Affleck who plays the older Batman was better than expected having a world weariness of a man who lived dangerously in order to die young but is still going. Gal Gadot also came across well as Wonder Woman where previously we just had a bleached out promotional picture to go on which really did not do her character justice.Of course we get an action packed finale, a fight between Superman and Batman is always going to be one sided unless Kryptonite is involved and worse still another monster raises its ugly head leading to our superheroes combining forces.The film is disappointing in its story which drags, it is incoherent and the way it has been brought to the screen is far away from the characters comic book roots.",4,5,12,3 April 2016
Blade Runner," A sense of an ending
","Ridley Scott directed the adaptation of Philip K Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.' Scott called it Blade Runner and had a dark dank rain-soaked setting of a futuristic LA of 2019.Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is called out of retirement to take out four Replicants, fugitive robots led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) who want to find their creator and get him to expand their lifespan.Ridley Scott managed to capture a vision of a future that was regarded as too depressing at the time of the film's release. It was a film noir future that was accompanied by a moody jazz soundtrack. It had top notch visual effects and model work, some 1940s influenced set, costume and art direction. The use of lighting at times was exceptional.In fact Ridley Scott's vision inspired a whole heap of filmmakers who wanted to make a grungy sci-fi film set in the future.The film was at times a detective story with a narration by Ford, it had some strong violence such as when Deckard chases a female replicant, shoots her down and she crashes through plate glass windows. Then there is the fight scene between Batty and Deckard with Batty easily being the more stronger.Yet the film is also a puzzle about identity, Deckard hunts out replicants who are physically indistinguishable from humans but then advanced replicants are created such as Rachael (Sean Young) who do not even realise they are cyborgs. In one of the director's cuts we are led to question Deckard's own identity because of an inserted dream sequence of an unicorn.The film has a hauntingly scary and magnetic performance from Rutger Hauer, Sean Young is beautiful dressed up like a femme fatale. Ford is rather subdued compared to his more famous roles of Indiana Jones and Han Solo but in retrospect he pitched it just right.",9,1,4,5 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," The circus comes to town
","The Greatest Showman gives Hugh Jackman another chance to do a movie musical in a somewhat sanitised story of P T Barnum who conceived a circus of freaks, the bizarre and misfits. More importantly he was driven by self promotion and making money. First time director Michael Gracey does well with the musical sequences, giving it a modern sensibility. However his lack of experience shows in the dramatic moments and with the narrative. The songs are rather bland apart from the Oscar nominated, This is Me that has a barnstorming performance from Keala Settle.The story is a little thin but zips along in an entertaining fashion. It is dazzling yet curiously empty, Maybe a bit like Barnum's showmanship. The best performances are from Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.",6,4,8,25 March 2018
Monsters University," Monster house
","In the prequel to Monsters Inc Mike and Sully are students at Monster University but are unlikely to graduate and both cannot stand each other. Sully is too much of a jock whose talent is one scary facial expression and a family name and Mike is not scary enough.Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) expels them from the scaring course. That is until Mike comes up with a plan to win the Greek Council Scare Games and thereby his fraternity will be accepted into the College of Scaring.The plot is a mixture of the failing student needing to pass their tests in order to graduate. Think Billy Madison, Back to school, Revenge of the Nerds and Animal House as Mike and Sully's fraternity are full of nerds and outcasts.Mike and Sully learn to value each other and recognise the importance of teamwork but the film's message is an uneasy one. Are Pixar saying talent is something you are born with and cannot be acquired?In various studies it has been show that the US Marines have consistently turned people from a lower working class background, involved in petty crime, having minor drug problems into leaders of men in the battlefield.",6,0,0,2 January 2017
Ben-Hur," Chariots of Fire
","Ben-Hur is famous for its chariot race sequence and that it won 11 Oscars including best Picture. The film is of a grand scale and is an adaptation of a fictional book as well as a remake of a silent classic.It also runs in parallel to the life of Jesus hence why its known as a biblical film. The story of Jesus bookends the movie from his birth in Bethlehem to the crucifixion. In between an unseen Jesus appears at various points through the film and encounters the characters in the movie.Charlton Heston is Judah Ben Hur a proud and noble Jew whose childhood friend, a Roman called Messala has returned from Rome and is second in command to the Roman Governor. Messala wants Ben-Hur to help him banish the rebellion to Rome's authority and when he is refused uses an accident to banish Ben-Hur to slavery and his mother and sister imprisoned.In a galley slave ship Ben-Hur overcomes many obstacles and with luck rescues a Roman General who adopts him as his son. He uses his new found position and wealth to return to Judea and get revenge on Messala which he does through the chariot race when he secures a ride through an Arab tribe. However Ben-Hur is still full of hate and bitterness as he finds out that his mother and sister have caught leprosy and only finds his rage dissipates as he comes across Jesus during the cross. The film is long, William Wyler wanted a visual feast and the film goes for some grand scenes and set designs. The script is a bit stilted and in this day and age a little hokey. The uncredited writer Gore Vidal's anecdote that he re-wrote the scenes of Ben-Hur and Messala as spurned lovers to bring out the essence of the story has now become famous although its actual credence is questionable. There is however some homo-eroticism present in the film especially during the Galley scenes.Some of the acting is rather on the fruity side with Hugh Griffith's blacked up Arab with a Welsh accent looking rather odd these days. Charlton Heston is steady and stout while Stephen Boyd bristles with fury and also a touch of guilt as Messala who feels betrayed by his close friend.",7,0,3,5 June 2014
Trainspotting," Choose life
","Trainspotting is a magnetic, exhilarating, repulsive film based in a seedy underbelly of Edinburgh where thieves, drug addicts and violent type underclass live in doss houses with babies crawling round innocently unaware of the dangers they face.Renton (Ewan McGregor) is a heroin addict living day to day stealing and looking for that hit. It is an empty life and he realises he needs to kick the habit but each time he tries to get off heroin something drags him back. Renton experiences the high side of heroin but knows the low side is too high a price to pay and his friends and associates are making it difficult for him to stay clean.Director Danny Boyle infused the film with kinetic energy helped by its soundtrack, it is trippy, disjointed, hip even amoral in places but despite its cool reputation it shows the ugliness of addiction especially as the character of Tommy who is a fitness fanatic and clean but turns to drugs when his girlfriend leaves him and dies a horrible death.Like the movie A Clockwork Orange the film is driven by the narration of its central character which keeps the story together and brings out the dark humour.I only saw the film for the first time twenty years after its cinema release and was impressed how well it has stood up to the test of time.",8,1,1,19 December 2016
Before Sunrise," Walk, talk and romance in Europe
","Before Sunrise is a minimalist film which features Ethan Hawke and Julia Delpy as two young characters walking and talking.The film starts off in a train as a German couple argue and the two couple tentatively talk, enjoy each other's company and make an emotional connection.Both characters share their perspectives on life and love. The film takes place over the course of one day and night as they see shows, view buildings and gardens, drink in cafés and bars and become romantically entangled.They reveal maybe a little too much about themselves as believe they will never see one another again. Hawke has a plane to catch before sunrise as he returns to the USA while Delpy is going to Paris.The film has a charm with its Continental European setting but it's also easy to lose attention with all their talking.It does not quite fly for me although its a brave attempt by director and co-writer Richard Linklater to make an innovative, independent romantic film.However the film is intriguing because it has spawned two sequels so far. So we do meet the couple in the later stages of their lives.",5,2,2,14 February 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," He is the Juan
","Woody Allen set off to Europe a decade ago to make his annual films. Maybe it was to do with lack of funding in the USA but a combination of various production companies in Europe were happy to stump cash for a Woody Allen film.This is a story of two women. Vicky (Rebecca Hall)and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) and they are in the city of Barcelona on vacation from the USA.At a restaurant the encounter passionate painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) whom they had seen earlier at a party and who invites them to a house for a weekend.The impulsive Cristina goes for it but Vicky is engaged in the USA is reluctant but they both set off with him. The encounter with Juan has an effect on both of them. Penelope Cruz later turns up as his volatile and suicidal wife. However she inspires Cristina's own artistic ambitions as a photographer whereas Vicky later has to deal with whether she wants her safe fiancé or someone passionate like Juan.The film is well photographed, well it has to be when you dealing with the subject of art and artists, you need to make good use of light and colours. The film also makes good use of Barcelona with Gaudi's architecture being featured as well as the medieval narrow streets of Barcelona. You also get a bit of the Ramblas as well just to make sure that the tourist trail is followed.However the film is slight, a bit of fluff and the fireworks only start when Cruz turns up as Maria who adds bite to the film. From the early moments when you see Vicky being stand offish to Juan's invitation you know that both women are going to end up sleeping with him, well these artistic types always get the women in films and more freethinking they are then more the merrier.Good performances from the four leads with Cruz being exceptional but Allen's script is so-so.",5,2,3,30 May 2014
Pitch Perfect 3," Not so perfect
","The Pitch Perfect films shows the contempt Hollywood shows to its female audiences. The original was a fun frothy film aimed at women and enjoyed by men as well. A serviceable if flawed date movie.Since then it has been a case of diminishing returns as each sequel gets worse. In the third instalment the script seems to be made up as it goes along.The Bellas have gone their separate ways after the previous film. Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) is leading a new version of Bellas and asks the girls to attend a reunion which they take to mean that the original Bellas will reunite. It seems the original girls are not happy with their jobs and would love to sing together again. Aubrey (Anna Camp) uses her dad's military connections to get into the USO and perform in Europe where they get a chance to compete to be the opening act for DJ Khaled who seems to be impressed by Beca's (Anna Kendrick) vocals.Television hosts Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) pop up again making abysmal catty comments about the Bella's and later follow them to make a documentary on the group, an idea so messily added into the plot, that is forgotten part way through.The main plot involves Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) who reunites with her estranged father (John Lithgow) but he is more interested in her overseas bank account that contains a lot of money.Well at least the singing is nice but the story is awful, at least the cast spent a few days in Nice. John Lithgow has a nice stab at an Australian accent but it seems no actual Australian actors were available.",2,14,21,29 April 2018
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter
","When this movie was released. The popular joke was. I went to see The Deer Hunter in the cinemas, three hours in and nothing happened. There was still another four hours left!When you find yourself watching a movie where Christopher Walken is playing the most normal character at the start, you know you will be heading to some difficult places.It is obvious that Director Michael Cimino was obsessed with The Godfather. The Deer Hunter has a long segment featuring a wedding at the start of the movie. The characters are of Russian heritage instead of Italian. Two of the main cast were in The Godfather films.The wedding scene is used to establish the Pennsylvania steel mill community and the three friends. Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro) is a bit of a loner and a hot head. Steven Pushkov (John Savage) is the young man who is getting married. Nick Chevotarevich (Christopher Walken) is the warm hearted one that everyone likes. He is going out with Linda (Meryl Streep) a woman that Mike also has his eye on.All three men are due to go to Vietnam. When they get there, all three will be captured by the Vietcong and face traumas that will change their lives.Surprisingly the Vietnam combat scenes are brief. There is the famous shot of De Niro with a flamethrower. More infamous is Cimino portraying the Vietcong as savages. One soldier throws a grenade in a bunker with women and children inside.The film was controversial at the time due to the Russian roulette scenes. It is apparent that this is a metaphor for the madness of war and the mental damage of the characters.Cimino wanted to make a modern epic and he succeeded. The film won the best picture Oscar. The authorship of the movie was mired in contention. It has four credited writers and this contributed to the choppiness in the story when the film moves to Vietnam and onwards from there.Like Apocalypse Now which would be released a year later. The Deer Hunter is not strongly anti war even though the characters are damaged by their time in Vietnam. This could be due to the fact the Vietnam war only ended four years earlier. It was still a raw wound. It was not until Oliver Stone's Platoon when the Vietnam war was shown in a more critical light and only because Stone fought in the war.The treatment of the Vietnamese is racism on the level of native American tribes in many of those old westerns where they were stock villains. The accusation of racism followed Cimino when he made Year of the Dragon in 1985.There were some flaws in the story. It was never clear why the three joined up especially as Mike and Nick are older characters.How did Nick know that Steven was in a veteran hospital when Mike had difficulties finding this out. This looks like a flaw further compounded when Mike next sees Nick. By this time Nick has totally metamorphosised who does even acknowledge Mike.I watched The Deer Hunter as a teenager, I managed to rent it on video when I was not yet old enough for an 18 rated film. I should not had bothered, it premiered on television two months later. I watched it again over 30 years later with a cleaned up print.It does stands up well. There was a lot of detail in the Pennsylvania scenes, the extensive use of location shooting. Actors hungry for a meaty script. What a difference in De Niro from here to Dirty Grandpa.One of the weak link was the shallow use of female characters, two of them are literal punchbags. Dare I say it, maybe another actor could had played Stan. I noticed in my first viewing John Cazale looked gaunt and slightly different from the Godfather films. Now watching him in the knowledge that he died before the film was released, he just does not look well and was also too old to be in the main characters close circle of friends.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," The Mary Poppins story
","Saving Mr Banks wants to tell the real story behind the making of the film Mary Poppins.What we have is a fictionalised tale. Something made more digestible for Disney and the general public.The real Mrs Travers might had been a curmudgeon and when she cries at the premiere of the film, it was likely to be at disgust at the travesty they made of her book.The film tries to go to the heart of Mary Poppins, the magical nanny and the effect she has on the Banks family. To this we have flashbacks to the Mrs Travers family life in Australia and that of her bank manager father and his drink problem.We also have Walt Disney whose children loved the book Mary Poppins, trying to obtain film rights by using his charm and guile.Maybe Tom Hanks is maybe a bit too winning and charming as Disney, a man who had a bit of a dark side. In real life Walt Disney had little time for Mrs Travers.Emma Thompson nails Mrs Travers as the difficult to get on with author, desperately in need of money but reluctant to let go of her book.The film also has good acting turns from Paul Giamatti and Jason Schwartzman. The film is at its best with the making of the film and when Disney is at his persuasive best.The film does drag a little with the flashbacks and maybe a few too many scenes with Travers being bad tempered.",7,0,1,14 February 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo Rabbit
","Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany. A lifetime of indoctrination has given him a hatred of Jews. He has been drafted into the Hitler Youth where he does not fit in. He is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit and bullied by the older boys.His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is raising Jojo alone. His father is missing, his sister is dead. He discovers that his mother has been hiding a teenage Jewish girl called Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic. To make his life more complicated, he has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi.)This would had been a brilliant film if the Monty Python team had made it in their prime. If Mel Brooks had made this, he would have added a song and dance number called Springtime for Hitler.Instead Taika Waititi's film left me cold. It had an air of smugness and self congratulation about how zany this movie is. Only Sam Rockwell caught the spirit of the film with his Captain Klenzendorf, a soldier who knows the war is lost. This is such an uneven film and the satire is off target too many times.Eventually Jojo and Elsa reach an understanding but at times I thought I was watching an episode of Allo Allo.",5,2,4,4 February 2020
Beowulf," The legend of Beowulf
","The Olde English poem about the Norse adventure of warrior Beowulf who battles the creature Grendel and then later his mother gets the CGI treatment from director Robert Zemeckis.To be fair CGI would give the film a better graphic representation of the poem but the CGI actors still have that dead eye visuals.The film is set in the time of pagan gods but Christianity is in the fringes and King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) counsellor John Malkovich is an early convert. However the life of merriment in the kingdom is disturbed when Grendel attacks and the King offers a large bounty to the person who slays him but the King seems to harbour a dark secret which is wife (Robin Wright)is suspicious of.Beowulf (Ray Winstone)takes up the challenge and then goes into battle with his mother (a sultry CGI Angelina Jolie) and it seems the mistakes of the past are about to repeat itself.The film is an adaptation of the poem and the visuals add an atmosphere especially the action sequences but the CGI visuals of the actors are still not right. The mixture of different acting styles looks jarring such as mixing Welsh Hopkins, Cockney Winstone and American Malkovich.The film is also portentous and actually starts to drag once the action and slaughter is finished as the screenplay had to expand the story in order for it to be turned into a feature length film.",5,0,1,5 May 2014
Speed," There is a bomb on the bus
","Speed is a terrific action blockbuster. I like to say high adrenaline but I am just limited to 50 Miles per hour!Keanu Reeves is a LA police officer who locks horn with ex cop Dennis Hopper who is hacked off with his retirement. Reeves has stopped Hopper from blowing up a building now cunningly Hopper has rigged a bus that will blow up if its speed drops below 50 MPH. Sandra Bullock ends up driving the bus and Reeves mus save the passengers.The screenplay was probably destined to be Die Hard on a bus, there is a terrific bad guy, some nice humour, action and suspense all make it an enjoyable ride. Good interplay with Reeves and Bullock and although the film-makers know they are not making high art they have given it enough love and attention to make the film an enduring classic.Maybe the film is over-long with an elongated ending which they could had done without.",9,1,3,10 September 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Thor and Loki show
","With the main Marvel players established as film franchises. Marvel turned to their second tier with Thor and Captain America, if their desire to make the Avengers film was to become a real possibility.Kenneth Branagh was entrusted to get Thor of the ground. The Shakespearean actor and director was a left field choice that turned out to be an inspired and bold move.Now with the sequel, we go back to the land of Tolkienism with elves and the age of darkness. Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved the energy source called 'Aether.'Although Malkieth was initially unsuccessful a rare convergence means he can begin his task again to grab this energy source so he can destroy once again.It is up to Thor to stop him and he might need to get Loki to assist him. The action moves from Asgard to Greenwich which seems the London location of choice for many US blockbusters in the last few years. Loki making his third appearance in a Marvel film get the best lines, Eccleston the actor responsible for the relaunch of Doctor Who gets little to do or show his skill because Loki has all the focus.The film despite its action, special effects and CGI is just average. Entertaining but instantly forgettable, but the film leaves you with a set up for a third film because even Norse legend/superheros can be dumb by trusting any stranger with there powerful artefacts.",5,0,2,25 March 2014

Moonrise Kingdom," Scout's honour
","My young son watched the start of the movie and immediately exclaimed that it reminded him of Fantastic Mr Fox. So right from the off, it is a Wes Anderson film with its quirky photography and performances.You also get the Anderson regulars such as Billy Murray, with newcomers such as Bruce Willis and Ed Norton.Norton as the offbeat scoutmaster fits in well here and we see a kind of performance from him that's been missing for a few years.The real stars are the youngsters. Its a tale of two pre-pubescent, difficult children who fall in love and run off with the adults searching for them. One of them is an orphan, rejected by his foster family and social services may farm him out to a home or even worse.I suppose young kids kissing or exploring their sexuality might be off putting for some but it does have real tenderness and emotion.It is a shame that the pace wavers and loses focus here and there. Maybe the film needed to be tighter but is no less rewarding.",7,1,2,12 February 2014
Midway," Midway
","Roland Emmerich's Midway is a loud brash World War 2 action film with plenty of CGI. The inspiration might had been Star Wars rather than actual events.After a prologue set in 1937 featuring Intelligence Officer Edwin T Layton (Patrick Wilson) and Japanese commander in chief Isoroku Yamamoto regarding Japan's increasing bellicose attitude. It then moves to the bombing of Pearl Harbour that marks America's entry into World War 2 and its aftermath.The American navy need to fight back and hotshot fighter pilot Dick Best (Ed Skrein) wants to take the fight to the Japs.Others like Layton and Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) need to work out what the Japanese will do next and rely on their intelligence experts.The film has actual real life players but it tries to cram too much and instead concentrates on the gung ho antics of Best and fellow pilot Wade McClusky (Luke Evans) both with dodgy American accents.The subplot featuring Lt Col Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) was of interest but it just faded away.At least Emmerich did not try to emulate Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour with an attempt to make an epic World War 2 love story. The scenes of domestic life is perfunctory, most of the characters are broadly brushed. The green screen work is very obvious. It does come across as a middling shallow action film.",5,5,8,6 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A new hype
","1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.",6,17,30,23 December 2015
RED," Retired and dangerous
","Comedy spy action films are hard to do successfully. Usually the tone is all wrong, there tends to be lots of violent action and not enough comedy or lots of comedy but it's unfunny.RED is based on a graphic novel and Bruce Willis plays a retired spy. He is bored who phones a clerk every month for missed pension payments before he is forced to spring into action again. He is reunited with his former friends and foes to get to the bottom of what is happening.The friends turn out to be Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich as the paranoid Marvin. Karl Urban is the super CIA agent in pursuit, hampered by these old timers at every turn.Mirren has a hoot of a time as a flower arranging hit woman and it's all nicely played along.This is a good mix of laughs, action. A thriller with a dash of romance thrown in as well.",7,0,0,19 November 2013
Unbroken," Uninspired
","Angelina Jolie aims to direct a prestige film with a stirring score and a screenplay that involved the Coen Brothers.Unfortunately you get a film that has seen it all before written all over it, a film that lacks depth and some of its pure hokum The scene where Zamperini's fellow POWs are forced to line up and beat him up is just so laughably bad and Jolie makes sure the final scene is bathed in sunset colours and never realised it was all utter tosh.Jack O'Connell gives a spirited performance as Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic athlete turned bomber pilot who crashes, he and his crew survive for days in the sea before being captured and sent to a Japanese POW camp.We have little idea why the camp commander takes a dislike to Zamperini and why he shows such brutality towards him but Zamperini stoically and defiantly takes it all. I do think he deserved a better a film.",5,0,2,14 December 2017
The Purge," Running riot
","I have seen the Purge films the wrong way round having seen The Purge: Anarchy first and rather liked the film although it was not entirely original.This is the original written and directed by James DeMonaco and stars Ethan Hawke in a future America which has reduced employment and violent crime through the annual purge where almost anything goes between evening and dusk for 12 hours. The sequel and this are unconnected although they seem to share a minor character.Hawke is a home security sales executive, rather handy to protect oneself from Purge night and has made a lot of money from selling the security system to his neighbours as one of them remarks to him jealously.Hawke lives in an affluent neighbourhood with his wife, sulky teenage daughter and young son. They expect to be safe from the Purge however Hawke is not happy that his daughter is seeing an older boy who sneaks into her bedroom and decides that tonight is the night to have a serious talk with the overprotective father.However things get manic when his young son lets in to the house a homeless black stranger who is on the run from a mob of rich kids who are hunting this man as their prey for Purge night. Hawke is given an ultimatum by the rich kids to throw the stranger out or else they will attack the family. Problem is the stranger is hiding in the house and Hawke does not know where he is and the rich kids are ready to attack his fortress.Hawke starred in the remake of Assault on Precinct 13 which DeMonaco wrote. You know this is really the plot of the original Assault on Precinct 13. It's the fortress under siege plot. There are a few twists here and there and lot of its incredulous. The sulky daughter is a dimwit if she thinks the boyfriend just wants to talk to the dad on Purge night. It's never made clear why the boy was let loose on this night of all nights on his own with the security controls.The family should also had taken more notice of his neighbours and realised they are not exactly the most popular people in the area. In fact the house did not seem to be very secure at all given how the boyfriend could casually sneak in to the daughter's bedroom.Still DeMonaco retooled the film for its sequel which made for a better film, it also gave it more social commentary than this one.",3,2,3,9 July 2015
Pitch Perfect," A-ccaGlee
","Anna Kendrick plays Beca a moody, stroppy and reluctant freshman at Barden University who wishes she was working as a DJ.The Barden Bellas are a female a-cappella group whose authoritarian lead singer (Aubrey) throws up when nervous and in the new academic year are struggling to find new female recruits. Beca decides to join the group but is in conflict with the Aubrey who seems to think despite evidence to the contrary that selecting safe songs from the last century will beat her all male rivals from the same college, the Treblemakers.The film has a feel good feeling with plenty of songs new and old sang in pitch perfect a-cappella, great if you are a fan of the TV series Glee.The film is however pitch perfectly predictable, schmaltzy and with all the stereotypes under the sun with some racist undertones (what a surprise it is a Universal picture, the company well known for killing off the black guy in the first ten minutes!)People from Far Eastern heritage have a hard time getting decent representation in films but here they make one Asian person out to be a weirdo and another to be socially intolerant and racist against whites. The black lady is a butch lesbian and the guy who gets his group disqualified because he was not a student is black as well. For some reason because the the filmmakers want you to think they are equal opportunity racists they also picked on deaf Jews in order to make a DJ joke.Anna Kendrick's character is dislikeable and her love story subplot was poor. Aubrey is so bossy you wonder why she is not on stage as a soloist as no one else would ever sing with her because of her attitude.Aubrey never realises that getting nearly beaten by a glove puppet singing group might be more to do with her failings.On the positive side the songs keep things bubbling along, it presumably would make for a good date film even though there is some gross out humour here and there. Rebel Wilson keeps things fun playing the bubbly fat stereotype.",6,3,4,26 July 2015
The Matrix," Life in reality
","What made The Matrix special was the ground breaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.) Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element is a world where he does not understand the world around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Ann Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to thing about the world around us and our existence within it.The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit to po faced. However the Wachowski's did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the sequels.",7,11,19,28 March 2016
Godzilla," Monsters on the loose
","Gosh was it as far back as 1998 when an over-hyped Godzilla arrived and underwhelmed everyone in its wake. Sixteen years later and another attempt has been made to relaunch this monster franchise.Early scenes start promisingly enough with Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston in a bad wig. But Binoche's role is just a few minutes and Cranston while passionate also has limited screen time. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are wasted with almost non characters.Worse, Godzilla is in effect a cameo character in his own movie. It literally is a walk on part. If there is some monster mayhem action it takes place in the dark. Never mind 3D glasses we should had got night vision goggles.The plot is about a pair of parasitic giant insects called Muto's who are causing havoc. At the same time Godzilla is also on the rampage and it seems he is set on encountering the insects. On a human level Cranston's son is trying to make his way back to his wife and kid in San Francisco, after finding out the truth about what happened to his family home in Japan 15 years earlier.The film starts off interestingly enough but gets lost in bland, clichéd characters and plotting. The script never rises above average. Even some of the action scenes such as the destruction of Las Vegas and San Francisco look undercooked. Yet the film does enough to keep you entertained so its not that mediocre.",4,2,4,7 March 2015
Looper," Cause and effect
","Looper is a movie that certainly divides opinion. Its take on time travel and assassination is certainly flawed and has loopholes.However its certainly an entertaining story and its nice to see a film where Bruce Willis makes an effort, he certainly must have liked the script.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Joe a drug addicted assassin who kills and disposes bodies of victims sent 30 years back in time by a crime syndicate which runs time travel machines. One day these loopers will have to kill their older selves. Its called closing the loop.However it emerges that in the future a person called The Rainmaker has unrivalled telekinetic powers and is sending loopers back in time to be killed.Bruce Willis is an older version of Joe. He through the love of a woman cleaned himself up and found inner peace. However as he is taken to be sent back in time, his wife is killed and he vows to kill the child that will grow up to be The Rainmaker.Younger Joe needs to kill older Joe before the mob in his present kills both of them. He meanwhile seeks refuge in a farmhouse where he discovers a boy with telekinetic powers.Hence we have a chain of events that would go off and affect both Joes. Maybe somehow, younger Joe can close a loop.Its a novel update and presentation of sci fi tropes that we have seen before in films like Terminator. The sci fi is not foolproof as the director would like it to be but the film is appealing and entertaining enough with a nice blend of action and thrills.The kid playing the young Rainmaker was outstanding.",7,1,2,26 April 2015

The crew on the other hand make stupid decisions which puts themselves in further danger.Life is certainly entertaining and wears its influence on its tentacles but the science and story beneath it has little logic.",4,0,2,3 August 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Love at first bite
","Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.",6,0,2,4 November 2017
Deadpool," The rogue marvel
","Merc with a Mouth clowns in his own movie after his cameo appearance in X-Men: Origins as mercenary Wade Wilson which also rather contradicts this film.Ryan Reynolds finally has a monster hit in Deadpool, wisecracking his way through and breaking the fourth wall multiple times. The film also serves as a origins tale which disguises the fact that this revenge saga has a thin story. Deadpool wants Ajax (Ed Skrein), the British villain responsible for leaving him with a deformed face after experimenting on him to unleash his hidden X genes and who has now kidnapped his girlfriend. Deadpool pursues him with the help of a few X-Men that Fox's budget allows.The film was made by first time director Tim Miller who sets his stall and tone of the movie with the flippant opening titles. As Marvel films go, this one is rude, the violence more visceral, the comedy a bit hit and miss as Reynolds makes fun of the X-Men and Marvel in general including the Disney Marvel films. Deadpool even finds time to make fun of a handsome actor called Ryan Reynolds.I found the film amusing but the plot was weak and the budget was low which the director was disguising with his own slicing and dicing. Reynolds though found the right tone.",6,4,13,11 March 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Never mind the Buzzards
","Get him to the Greek is a slightly off beat gross out comedy from Judd Apatow stable, directed by Nicolas Stoller and is a loose spin off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall.Jonah Hill is Aaron Greenberg an ambitious music executive who is tasked by his boss (Sean Combs) to go to London and escort a controversial rock star to LA's Greek Theatre for a multi million dollar tour. The trouble is Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is heavily into the sex, drugs, drink and rock n roll lifestyle and needs careful handling. Greenberg also has delicate issues in the domestic front as his girlfriend wants to move to Seattle to finish her medical residency.As Greenberg rushes to get him to the Greek, Snow always seems to stop off somewhere for some partying, boozing and sex. Even when they get near LA, Snow ends up diverted to Vegas to see his estranged dad where they end up with more partying and boozing until both Snow and Greenberg realise they want to reconcile with their respective partners.The film has a thin story which has been done before such as 'My Favourite Year.' It is sporadically amusing, some of the gross humour is funny and Brand manages to be just on the right side of being frazzled rock star without getting too irritating. However the plot is stretched and repetitive. The duo are always battling for time but manage to get to wherever they need to in the nick of time despite being struck in traffic or being engaged in hard core partying.",5,1,3,30 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The gentleman spy
","Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.Kingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.All the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.Valentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.Director Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!The film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.In short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well.",6,2,10,11 February 2015
Easy A," Chances Are
","Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is a high school student who lies to her best friend Rhiannon that she has lost her virginity. The lie goes round the school and quickly she is regarded as a slut and soon Olive dresses like one.To prevent her gay friend Brandon from bullying, they pretend to have sex at a party while the others listen to their screams from outside the door. Later Olive helps out a fat friend by letting him say that he went out with her in exchange for some gift vouchers. Pretty soon a student who gets Chlamydia tells everyone he got it off Olive as it was the easier thing to do.However Olive's life spirals out of control as nobody sees the real her. Men just want to use her. Even her easy going parents are concerned about her.Easy A is the epitome of efficient writing. If you are a budding screenwriter or want to make your own movies, just make a careful study of it. It even wears its influences on its sleeves. Everything referenced to in this film, it will come back to later. As an example Olive is studying the book The Scarlet Letter at school. Well Olive gets branded as a harlot and she plays up to it by wearing even more revealing clothes with a big label A. Olive mentions 80s brat pack movies of John Hughes. At the end of the film there is a pointless song and dance number just like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I did like the reference to Huckleberry Finn that would later come back like a boomerang.Easy A is fresh and amusing with charming performances from the cast, especially Emma Stone. However it is not as clever as it thinks it is and the wheels fall off as the film goes along. For a start I find it hard to believe that Olive is the only high school student who has had sex!Many of the characters are paper thin and one dimensional. There are lazy stereotypes of Christians but the worse is the one Indian high schooler who speaks with an Indian twang.So Hollywood film studios cannot have a second generation character of Indian origin who was born and raised in America in this day and age?",6,0,0,9 June 2018
Green Book," All roads head south
","Green Book is really an updated version of Driving Miss Daisy directed by Peter Farrelly.Based on true events and set in 1962. Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) is a mouthy nightclub bounce from the Bronx. He is out of a job as the nightclub is going through renovations.Tony has been recommended to be a driver and bodyguard to erudite black piano player Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali.)Dr Don is going on a pre Christmas tour of the deep south, Tony will drive him to the venues with the help of the Green Book, a guide book for black travellers. That will tell him the roads a black man can take, the motels a black man can stay in.The relationship between the two men is like the odd couple. Dr Don is fastidious. Tony is a slob and easily gets into fights, he is also a racist at first.Both men bond as they hit the road, experiencing constant discrimination.It is a well acted film with a regal turn from Ali. There is comedy and the film gets a little gloomier as it heads deeper to the south.The racism is anesthetized to make it palatable for modern audiences. In reality a black man being chauffeured driven by a white man in the deep south would had been odd and more dangerous.I did feel the film is a little too glib and superficial. It has an ending which is a little too neat. I doubt for a moment that even today, those backwood roads in the deep south are safe for some black travellers.",6,7,15,5 January 2019

","As a writer Seth Rogen has a formula. A couple of stoner's/losers getting over their heads with some bad guys and trying to extract themselves from a perilous position in a comedic way.Even Mike Myers knew to make Austin Powers work he needed to break down a James Bond film in a clinical fashion. I am not convinced Rogen is sure like Myers what he is parodying and that the formula is screwed down tightly.As an actor Seth Rogen plays a slacker where he meets stoner's, losers and undesirable types. He has not stretched himself even when he plays a superhero such as The Green Hornet.In Pineapple Express Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server, who sees a killing by a drug dealer and then must evade his gang. He teams up with his friend, marijuana dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) as they elude the gang, a bent policewoman and get stoned.The humour is broad and while some of its knockabout fun the comic book violence is jarring. Danny McBride gets shot point blank and survives, rather a few people get shot or stabbed and survive before being finished off properly.The film is an uneasy mix, it is mildly amusing like the car chase with a foot through its windscreen, but runs out of steam. Maybe the script looked fun when the writers and actors were stoned.",5,2,5,2 December 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," One man and his dog
","After the events of the first film, John Wick manages to get his stolen car back. Not sure why the mobster did not gift wrap it and Federal Express it.Now an Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio wants him to take up a blood oath that Wick made and complete a task. Kill Santino's sister. Wick refuses and his house promptly gets burned to the ground.At the Continental, the hotel for mobsters and hit-men. Winston (Ian McShane) explains the rules to Wick, he has no choice but perform the hit then go after Santino who has puts a large bounty on Wick's head.Once the film gets going from its simplistic story line, it is a nicely shot and entertaining film. It is also perfunctory, as Wick survives countless henchmen who are after him. Some of the combat scenes with Common are good. The scenes with Laurence Fishburne were wasted.",5,0,2,1 June 2017
Aladdin," The Blue Genie
","Two decades on and the animation looks nothing special, the story is rather so-so with the typical Disney flourishes but the Robin Williams voiced Genie is still infectious and makes the movie stand out.Williams is the heart and soul of this film, his free wheeling manner with rapid fire patter and impressions provided a new benchmark for guest star vocals in cartoons. You almost feel that Williams was ad libbing.The songs with 'A friend like me' and 'A whole new world' are endlessly hummable, the film has enough pizazz with despicable villains, animal or bird sidekicks but it reaches a higher gear whenever the genie turns up.Its nice to know Aladdin will in the future enchant a new generation of kids and these kids will hear the hilarity of Robin Williams humour through his characterisation of the genie.",7,1,2,22 August 2014
Incredibles 2," Up to the Parr
","Incredibles 2 has taken themes from films like X-Men. What do you do with people who have special powers? As well as movies like Hancock. What do you do when superheroes cause destruction in the city? Incredibles 2 also adds a feminist bent.The films starts with the Incredibles fighting a supervillain that causes major damage to the city. The villain gets away and superheroes still remain banned.The Parr family are without a job and put up in a motel until they can figure things out.Help comes from Winston Deavor, head of Devtech. He loves superheroes and along with his inventive sister, Evelyn they have a plan to remarket superheroes and make them acceptable.They want Elastigirl to be the focus as she causes less financial damage. This leaves Mr Incredible as the house husband and he discovers that baby Jack-Jack has incredible super powers as well.The story is not too deep, if you have seen other Pixar films, you could maybe guess the ultimate villain. It does have lots of action packed fun, frenetic animation and children will certainly enjoy it.",7,6,7,25 April 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," Blowing with the wind
","Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a guy with a Welsh name who is not going anywhere in the New York folk scene of 1961.Luck is not on his side, the audience do not connect with him and he is full of self loathing. He couch surfs with friends or people he has just met and he can be very rude to people.The film opens with Llewyn singing beautifully in a club, he then gets beaten up outside. By the end of the movie we find out why he was beaten up in this bittersweet tale.Llewyn Davis is in a bit of a mess. His singing partner killed himself. He might had got another woman pregnant. His latest record is not selling and he is on the verge of giving up music. He is lumbered with a cat that has escaped from a house he stayed at, then that goes missing.The Coen brothers give us an initially interesting character study which ultimately falls flat. Isaac gives a beautiful performance. The film has a blue wintery palette. It signifies Llewyn's cold personality and his frosty relationship with life.",5,1,2,16 January 2019
Saboteur," Fugitive on the run
","Saboteur was made in 1942 and thus is a propaganda film by Alfred Hitchcock.The subject is Nazi sympathizers in America working to sabotage key targets such as factories and military installations.Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane an aircraft factory worker wrongfully accused of sabotage which killed his co-worker. He crossed the path of the real saboteur and now with few clues is on the hunt for him and clear his name.The film owes a lot to a previous Hitchcock effort that he made in Britain, The 39 Steps. Both films have similar plot devices as the hero is in a cross country pursuit chased by law enforcement authorities and fascist sympathizers. On the way he meets some people who assist him such as a truck driver, or a travelling circus and more importantly Kane meets up with beautiful model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who is wary of him and tries to turn him in at first.The film very much feels like a remake of The 39 Steps but Cummings lacks the dash of Robert Donat and just looks like too much a solid stock actor. There is some black humour and effective visual touches as Kane goes from California to the skyscrapers of New York.This is still a film that shows us a Hitchcock trying to feel is way round filming in America trying to find actors who will represent his vision. Here he is well served by the bad guys. The suave and wealthy Otto Kruger lusting after power in the new world order and Norman Lloyd the villain who gets his hands dirty.What is effective is the climax at the Statue of Liberty. Not for the first time where Hitchcock will got an American landmark and it is so effectively filmed.",6,0,1,6 December 2015
Gangs of New York," The big city
","Martin Scorcese has wanted to make the Gangs of New York for several decades. Elaborate sets were built at the Cinecitta studios in Rome for this Dickensian yarn and Scorcese spent many months editing this film down to a manageable length as well as smoothing out the violence at the behest of the censors.In 1846, the noble Irish Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson in an all too brief role) leader of the immigrant gang the Dead Rabbits goes to battle with the xenophobic protestants, the Natives led by the vicious Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who plays him like murderous Bill Sikes crossed with the more bluff and charming Fagin.Vallon is slain by Butcher's blade. His son escapes and grows up angry and intent on revenge and calls himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio in almost Oliver Twist mode.) Many years later after reform school Amsterdam returns to the Five Points and plots to get close to Bill in order to kill him but thinks get a lot complicated.Bill Cutting has risen in power, he holds sway with various corrupt politicians and lawmen. Bill has dreams of his new America and it does not include it being a melting plot. Amsterdam worms himself into the Bill's inner circle and almost becomes a surrogate son to him. Amsterdam also takes the pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz who might as well be Nancy) who was once Bill's mistress.However despite the cruel and nasty things Bill has done and his expertise with the blade, Bill is not a caricatured villain and Day- Lewis makes him empathetic and Amsterdam finds respect for him. Just hope that Bill never finds out who Amsterdam really is.Scorcese wanted to make a film about the rise of New York. We know this because the final shot dissolves from the ruins of a riot ridden city to that of skyscrapers in the beginning of the new millennium. The story mixes a revenge tale with the insertion of real life characters to acknowledge a city that is going to advance rapidly from the nineteenth century slums with low life characters.In making this epic which took three screenwriters the focus is on Day-Lewis making his character complex and dominating leaving other characters more vacuous and the film out of balance. Priest Vallon is interesting but is dispatched too quickly.It is a big performance from Day-Lewis but I once read that if you examine it closely, it is almost as if he is doing a Robert De Niro impression. An observation with some substance.The film is long but it is not an epic. The broad strokes of a young city growing up entwined with a young man growing to take revenge is lost in the finer details with uneven pacing and too many sketchy characters.",6,0,2,17 November 2015
Braveheart," Freedom
","William Wallace was as a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th Century. Braveheart directed and starring Mel Gibson is a fictional telling of the Wallace story.Gibson has produced a rip roaring adventure with bloody battles and visceral violence. He certainly has brought his experience of action from the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon films.Patrick McGoohan is the hissable villain as King Edward 1 also known as Edward Longshanks. He is ruthless and cunning. Just see the way he disposes of his son's newly appointed war counsellor. Yet he will also bribe Scots noblemen with land in order for them to switch sides.The film opens with Wallace as a child, his father killed in an unknown battle. The grown up Wallace just wants a peaceful existence as a farmer with the love of his life. All this is shattered with the despicable English, raping and pillaging like they were Vikings.Gibson with writer Randall Wallace show a sure footing in the the story set up and the early battle scenes in the beautiful settings of Scotland and Ireland.It is the latter part of the film that causes problems with pacing that makes the film overlong and the rather shady depiction of Robert the Bruce who is the better known Scots hero. Wallace who has been betrayed by some noblemen takes revenge against them like he was Zorro, he also has a fictional affair with Princess Isabelle which is almost laughable. The final scenes of torture where he is put on a cross makes it look like that he already was planning The Passion of the Christ.",6,1,4,15 March 2016
Joy," Joy
","The Joy of Mopping is lost in a bizarre screenplay which is so unstructured. It keeps going to a soap opera that Joy's bedridden mother keeps watching but then the soap opera element is dropped. The director knows it is not working.David O Russell wanted Joy to be a quirky feminist movie of empowerment.Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in a dysfunctional household. She is a single mother with her ex husband living in the basement.When Joy has an idea of a self wringing mop. Her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) has some manufacturing knowledge, his latest girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) has money to invest.However Joy struggles with her lack of business acumen. She is being fleeced by the manufacturer of her mop, her family give her the wrong advice or make the wrong decisions. Even after the mop proves to be a hit on the shopping channel QVC. Joy is still heavily in debt.A starring vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence, she got an Oscar nomination but she did not wipe the floor on Oscar night. Despite being a strange movie, it is all about a mop that went on to wring its competitors.",5,0,0,20 June 2020
Coach Carter," Hoop dreams for the Oilers
","Coach Carter is based on a true story of Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) who made headlines in 1999 for benching his high school basketball team due to poor academic results.The film is not really about basketball that is just a backdrop. It is more about Ken Carter who becomes head coach of his old high school, where the players are rude, disrespectful and ill disciplined.Carter makes them each sign a personal contract regarding training, discipline, attendance and school grades. Although a disciplinarian the team has an unbeaten run and turns around the lives of their players even though some in the school and many of the parents are unhappy with his methods.I guess I would loath to have Ken Carter as my coach but in this movie with its assortment of High school misfits that are straight out of ghetto casting, it works.Samuel L Jackson has enough charisma and likability for you to invest in his character. The film is enjoyable enough, the music blends well with the urban drama and there are a few future stars in early roles in this film.",7,0,1,10 December 2013
Her," Virtual girlfriend
","Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure.",3,16,33,4 May 2014
The Nice Guys," The lethal two
","Shane Black as a young man wrote the screenplay to the hard boiled buddy cop action film, Lethal Weapon.Black has since messed about with the formula making hard boiled mismatched buddy cop comedy action films laced with sleaze.This is a retro comedy drama set in Los Angeles of 1977. A young washed up private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to find Amelia by her aunt. Amelia has got muscle for hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop him which he does by breaking Holland's wrist.When two hoods break into Healy's place, he hires March to find what is going on. Accompanied by March's bright and ethically centred daughter, they stumble on a conspiracy that involves the Justice department, the auto industry, the death of a porn actress and reel of a porn movie that exposes a scandal.The Nice Guy's comes across as an unpretentious fun film. There are nods to Black's previous films, it can be crude in places, the story can be a bit vague but it did make me laugh a lot. Although set in 1977 it is rather anachronistic in places.",7,0,1,25 August 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max returns
","This is the film that George Miller shall had done 30 years ago instead of the tepid Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome.Tom Hardy steps into the boots of Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky. A man of few words, haunted by the past and cares little of the world he is living in.Charlize Theron is Imperator Furiosa who wreaks revenge on evil Immortan Joe by taking his young wives whose sole purpose is to make babies and be his chattel.As the ladies escape they come across Max who is help captive by Joe's gang and he reluctantly helps them escape while being pursued by Joe, his sons and other members of his posse.No doubt this reboot expands the premise of Mad Max 2 and is effectively a one long bonkers chase film with stunning stunts and visuals.As a nod to the original Mad Max, Hugh Keays-Byrne returns as the villain but plays a different character, the sadistic Immortan Joe. The Mad Max films has form of having the same actors playing different characters.The film adds a feminist twist with Theron joining Hardy as the lead character and Max being helped out by a group of women escaping from Joe's clutches.As for Hardy, it is unfortunate that he had so few lines and I have to say that he has yet to wrest the role from Mel Gibson.The film won six technical Oscars and was a contender for the best Picture and Director Oscars. I doubt this film could be regarded as Oscar bait, it is just an unpretentious action-adventure movie.",7,1,5,2 March 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Saved by Private Doss
","If you see the trailers of this film it does not even to tell you who made this film. Instead you are told that it is from the Oscar winning director of Braveheart. It shows how much the Mel Gibson name is mud in some quarters.This is the first English language film directed by Gibson since Braveheart which was released in 1995. It is also notable that this film was made in Gibson's adopted homeland of Australia, the country his father relocated to in order that his older children would not be drafted to the Vietnam war. The film features many notable Australian actors.Hacksaw Ridge based on true events tells the story of army medic Desmond Doss who refused to hold a gun in battle but saves the lives of many of his comrades.The opening of the film is more hackneyed ridge than hacksaw. Doss father is an alcoholic who also seems to be suffering shell shock from The Great War, Desmond as a boy nearly kills his brother and then he vows to stick to the commandment 'thou shalt not kill.' The older Desmond (Andrew Garfield) finds romance with a nurse but after Pearl Harbour enlists to join the army but because of his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Doss intends to serve as a combat medic. At basic training Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) does the usual clichéd spiel of getting the raw recruits battle ready. Gibson is in on the joke as he has Garfield grinning throughout it all. Doss excels in his training but becomes an outcast when he refuses to handle his rifle and train on Saturdays as he is a Seventh-day Adventist. After Howell and his superiors fail to get Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons, Howell turns his fellow soldiers against him by making Doss out to be a coward.The film comes to life in the Battle of Okinawa. Gibson delivers a gory, violent fuelled, blood, guts and rats battle sequence where Doss goes about saving the lives of the injured soldiers. Doss considers whether this is his true purpose and why he is here.However despite the battle action being well staged, it has to be remembered that Spielberg got here almost twenty years ago in Saving Private Ryan.The film really suffers from a corny beginning and some parts of the script is pedestrian with the romance part certainly being cringe inducing. It is the battle segments that belatedly save the film but even then some of that gets silly such as one soldier holds a dead body as a shield in one arm, walks and fires a gun with the other or where Doss drags Howell in a makeshift sledge while Howells fires off his rounds.",6,8,15,22 January 2017
Warcraft," Not my world
","Having never played the War of Warcraft video games, I knew nothing about the gaming world. The film adaptation boasts great special effects which concerns Orcs escaping their dying world and invade the world of Azeroth. The human inhabitants of Azeroth try to stop them.The trouble is that the Lord of the Rings made this film more exciting and involving. I could not really get into this film despite the interesting opening and immersive world created by director Duncan Jones. The film just gets bogged down making it boring and derivative. At least Ben Foster stands out, many of the other actors just come across as humdrum even Paula Patton in what should had been an interesting role as the green-skinned Garona Halforcen.",4,1,5,18 March 2017
Macbeth," The play's the thing but not here
","After the film finished I asked myself where was Shakespeare's Macbeth as the text had been gutted and the main actors delivering the lines in a flat monotone distilling any passion and energy.Director Justin Kurzel has taken a graphic novel approach in this blood thirsty play, it is less 300 but more Valhalla Rising as Scandinavian moodiness is over produced.The film starts off promisingly as it sets out its stall with an exciting battle sequence that calls to mind Braveheart but at a lower budget, drawing in the crowd who may not normally take to the play but the Bard's words never arrive and when they do, the actors seemed to be embarrassed by it.There are some nice visual touches and interpretative flair but the finished product does not feel like Shakespeare's Macbeth.",3,2,5,29 July 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Ride off to the sunset
","Back to teaching, Indiana Jones finds out that his father has been kidnapped and he must set out to find him.His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the alluring, Dr Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody.) She becomes an integral part of this story.Raiders of the Lost Ark was one hell of a ride, The Temple of Doom was too dark, too gruesome for some.The Last Crusade took the best elements of the first film. The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies.The film starts with a sequence when Indy as a kid. This was an appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures.The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects.It is a Saturday afternoon at the movies spectacular.",9,1,3,3 August 2013
The Great Gatsby," The roaring twenties
","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an extravagant anachronistic stage bound spectacle that is glorious in 3D. It is loud, noisy and brash just like one of Jay Gatsby's weekend parties.F Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel is given a modernist twist but the moral centre remains as represented by Nick Carraway's (Tobey McGuire) narration whom unfolds the story of the vile people around him with only Gatsby having some decency left.The tale is of the mysterious Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who have moved to be near his old flame Daisy (Carey Mulligan) in 1920s New York. Jay was once a poor boy who went off to fight in the Great War. He is now wealthy and made up tales about himself. Is he from a wealthy family, an Oxford man or a bootlegger? He throws parties to get near to Daisy, rekindle his lost love and he brings Nick to the fold because he is Daisy's cousin.Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) a vile man who cheats on his wife, he brags, he lies and has crackpot theories of the superiority of the white man. He also has money of the old kind, inherited.There is an interesting cameo from Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim, Gatsby's ally who has human molars as a tie pin and who never accurately gives the impression that Gatsby could be a gentleman.Maybe DiCaprio overdoes the 'Old Sport' line and is in some ways is less aloof than Robert Redford from the 1974 version. However Redford's reticence gave his Gatsby a mystical quality that DiCaprio could not quiet capture here.",8,1,1,30 December 2017
13 Hours," The emotional manipulation leaves a bad taste
","I like to think Michael Bay has a good film in him that would get him critical acclaim. Pain & Gain was a step in the right direction. 13 Hours is not that film. At times I was left open mouthed with the appalling dialogue coming out of the various actors mouths.Jack Silva (John Krasinski) and best friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) are highly paid private security contractors for a secret CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. Both are experienced men who have worked in war zones.Benghazi is regarded as the wild west where you cannot tell the difference between a friendly faction and an enemy faction. The station chief does not want the contractors to engage in any shootout in case it leads to further problems and negative media coverage.When Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives at the Embassy compound, the contractors are concerned with the light security. Their concerns are dismissed. When the embassy comes under attack, Silva, Woods and the others belated go and try and rescue the ambassador. They later try to hold off the militia. Any outside help seems to be slow in arriving.Bay has no problems with the action sequences. He also has no problems trying to manipulate the audience emotionally. Bay keeps it simple, the bad guys are the weasel pen pushers working for the State Department or the Defence Department. The contractors are virtuous, heroic. Hold on, aren't they basically highly paid mercenaries? Who knows, they are thinly characterised in this film and I could barely tell them apart.Strangely, Bay never specifically blames Obama or Hillary Clinton for the fiasco; yet his film shows that Benghazi was an absolute mess. Why does he pull his punches and not blame the people at the top? Probably in order to make the film, Bay had to manipulate the truth!",5,1,12,23 September 2018
Hustle & Flow," Do the pimp and rap
","Hustle & Flow is a strange hybrid. Part rap, part urban drama and set in the south.Terrence Howard is a Memphis pimp, Djay who runs a stable of prostitutes and still has trouble making ends meet. No wonder life is hard for a pimp.After an encounter with an old school friend who also works as a music mixer he decides to write and rap about his life experiences and hopes to have a shot at the big time.He hopes by persuading a big music star played by Ludicrous to listen to his tape.Terrence Howard would not be seen as your first choice to play a rapping street hustler as he tends to be known for more urbane characters in films such as Crash.He holds attention as the hustler and rapper who lives for today. He is no hero or even that sympathetic, he just wants to survive but at least he does have dreams and talent as the words seem to flow out of him.I guess the film might be problematic if you do not like rap and the subject matters of rap songs. The swearing might be off putting for some.There is tenderness, when Djay, Shelby and Key get together to make music and it's at this point the film displays its heart. Before that, it was Djay pimping out his women.",7,0,0,7 September 2013

Other zombies in his group also start to change developing emotions and speaking again.It is only the bonies who are skeletal zombies who are pure evil.Writer/Director Jonathan Levine does something refreshing and even fun with the zombie genre.

Cinderella Man," No knock out
","After the success of A Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe and Ron Howard teamed up again for Cinderella Man.Now that Howard is an Oscar winning director, the story gets more ponderous and longer. He can also attract the best talent so we have Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger as part of the cast.Crowe plays Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who was down on his luck, in poverty who gets the chance to get back to boxing and ends up getting a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship.In that case it's an inspiring and uplifting tale. However one of the writers of this film is Akiva Goldsman, I do not care if he has an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He is a supreme hack. I refer you to Batman & Robin as Exhibit A.Howard who is one of the last protégé of Roger Corman who used to make zippy films in the 1980s but over the years has become more bloated.In this film you feel some of the moves the director will make will be telegraphed just like a bad boxer.",6,1,1,31 July 2013
Valkyrie," Let's kill Hitler
","Valkyrie is based on the true events in Nazi Germany. The plot to kill Hitler. In 1944 some German officers hatched a plot to take out the Fuhrer and deploy another administration.This film is about the various intricate plot leading up to the assassination attempt and its aftermath.Although we are all aware of the outcome, plaudits has to be given to the writers and director Bryan Singer for maximising tension to the hilt.As always, Tom Cruise gives it his all, although you might think he is a little too earnest here and is ably supported by a largely British cast who either are aiding him or resisting him.Valkyrie could easily had been a cheesy and rather sentimental story but it really works as a thriller.",7,1,1,5 December 2013
Alien: Covenant," In space they can hear you laugh
","I thought Prometheus was a visually wonderful but hugely flawed film with an incomprehensible plot and characters that constantly made stupid decisions.In the sequel, Alien Covenant set 10 years after Prometheus stupidity by the characters has multiplied tenfold.The colony ship Covenant diverts its mission after receiving what seems like a distress call from an earth like planet. The crew beam down without any protective clothing, without any adherence to safety or quarantine protocols. Hell, they do not even have any non slip shoes on. One character even forgets to relief himself at the ship and decides to do it on the alien planet.The reality is that this planet has hidden dangers and the android David from Prometheus who has been involved with genetic experiments with human DNA and the Xenomorph.It is hard to believe that director Ridley Scott made the original Alien way back in 1979. The world has waited with baited breath for his prequels only to be disappointed. Alien:Covenant should basically be viewed as a comedy then it makes more sense.",3,6,12,5 July 2017
The Martian," The man on Mars
",Ridley Scott's The Martian was wonderfully realised on 3D for the big cinema screen. It probably will not come across well on the small screen.Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft and crew on a mission to Mars. Instead of panicking he overcomes the obstacles in his way by thinking outside of the box to survive as long as possible.When NASA find out that Mark is still alive his former crew mates turn around for a rescue mission.The film is essentially a lone survival film without the protagonist not exactly getting too lonely or crazy. There is the parallel story of NASA and other agencies working together on the rescue mission as Mark's predicament catches the public's attention.The problem with this type of movie and it happened with Gravity is that you can be blown away with special effects the first time round but it might lack rewatch value.,8,1,1,22 August 2017
Evil Dead II," Do not read the book
","I found myself tittering a lot when watching this film which is strange as it is supposed to be gore laden horror film. Sam Raimi along with his leading man, Bruce Campbell deliver a low budget, manic, effects filled horror film with lashings of comedy.Ash (Bruce Campbell) is taking his girlfriend Linda to a secluded where he find a tape recorder and a book. The tape was found by a professor who translates the the book of the dead which unleashes malevolent spirits that possess Linda, leaving Ash to chop her head off. Later on Ash hand starts to attack him as it turns evil due to Linda's bite. Ash has to cut it hand off.Later on the professor's daughters turns up with a few other people but faced being attacked by possessed people and the only way out is to read a passage that drives the evil away.I do not know how Raimi managed to do some of the special effects and gore in such a low budget, there is stop motion animation, a tribute to the manic slapstick comic styles of the Three Stooges and Tex Avery. Campbell's broad acting style certainly gets results here.",7,1,2,4 May 2018

","Up in the Air has many corporate digs. Clooney plays a corporate consultant who criss crosses America firing people on behalf of bosses who are afraid to do so.He is a lone, solitary man with no baggage and a love of frequent flyer points. Hence when he gives corporate talks he always focuses on baggage straps that dig into you.His boss played by Jason Bateman sees the recession as a golden opportunity for growth for his company as it means more people will be laid off. When he hires a young, smart executive (Anna Kendrick) to fire people via the internet. It means less consultants who travel, he is even more buoyed.Clooney sees the flaws in these plans. After all he is skilled in these face to face encounters. If it happened via the computer, the sacked employee will just walk off with the computer!Clooney takes Kendrick on the road with him to give her some experience in corporate downsizing as well as travelling on planes efficiently.Along the way Clooney encounters a female version of himself as they have a romantic encounter and invites her to be a date at a family wedding.The film is a comedy drama which takes barb shots at corporate America. It also has an insight on the empty, shallow lives of some corporate executives who may be smart and can flee at a moment's notice with no possessions. This contrasts with the people they fire who have mortgages, families and bills to pay.Eventually Clooney reaches the target of his air miles but he is literally up in the air with nowhere to go.",7,1,1,2 February 2014
From Here to Eternity," Boxing clever
","From Here to Eternity is an adaptation of a long novel, 800 pages plus so the film version has been cut down and it certainly zips along for the most part.This multi Oscar winning film is essentially about two doomed loved affairs in an army base in Hawaii just before the outbreak of Pearl Harbour. One is between Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) and his Captain's wife, (Deborah Kerr); and the other between Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) and Lorene (Donna Reed) a prostitute in a private club.The affair between Kerr and Lancaster happens very quick in the film and they are soon rolling on that famous scene in the beach very much on their first proper date and soon after having their first big bust up.The film does have other cross cutting story lines such as Captain Holmes trying to force Prewitt to join the army boxing team, his friend Maggio's (Frank Sinatra) rivalry with Fatso and then the outbreak of the Japanese attack and the soldiers engaging in action.The film has fine black and white photography and strong performances from the leads especially Lancaster, Clift, Kerr and Philip Ober as Captain Holmes. Strangely I was not too enamoured with Sinatra and he won the best supporting actor Oscar for the role.The film actually does look rushed and also for a film set in Hawaii we see very few native Hawaiian characters in the movie, it might as well be any army base in the USA.However its an engaging melodrama even though you will kind of sense that this may not be a happy ever after tale.",7,0,0,10 May 2014
V for Vendetta," Anonymous wants you
","V for Vendetta is an allegory. It is rather apparent the Wachowski Brothers wanted to make a critique of George W Bush's post 9/11 USA.The vehicle they used was Alan Moore's graphic novel with the setting a futuristic and fascist Britain.The film that inspired Anonymous. We have a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving exacting revenge on John Hurt's High Chancellor whilst trying to save Natalie Portman from the secret police. She later becomes an ally.V for Vendetta deals with issues relating to a repressive state. Totalitarianism, homophobia, Islamophobia and terrorism. The film with its controversial themes has attracted both criticism and praise, although author of the graphic novel Alan Moore is unhappy with the adaptation.The acting from the cast is excellent. Portman, Weaving, Rea, Hurt and especially Roger Allam all excel.It's a brave and a cutting edge film packed with entertainment values and also thought inspiring. A real must see.",9,1,3,7 October 2013
Semi-Pro," Hoop failings
","Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is a singer who had one hit with a crude disco song that made enough money for him to purchase a Basketball team in Michigan. Moon is the coach, player, owner, announcer in this struggling team in the ABA. He is reducing to pulling stunts to attract the crowds and his only hope that a merger of the ABA with the NBA will save him.The film has a nice 1970s setting and the merger of the ABA and NBA is based on fact. However the film flops as a comedy as the laughs are few and far between. In fact I only found the bear wrestling scene with Kristen Wiig raised a laugh with me. Even the announcer scenes were largely predictable.Like other Ferrell comedies the premise of the movie is absurd, the characters in the film are not well drawn and its main failing is that there was no comedy in the script.",3,0,0,3 June 2014
Furious 7," One more ride
","So here we are at Furious 7 brought to us in a convoluted way after the death midway in filming of Paul Walker. The series sees Jason Statham after revenge because of the events of the previous movie (A Plot) as the gang evade Statham they are also on a mission to find a micro chip (B Plot) leading to more crazy and over the top stunts including driving out from one Abu Dhabi tower to another for example.Its an enjoyable and high adrenaline ride but you feel that despite the forced rewrites that the series is running out of gas and the future films will needed to be reworked. As an example look at how Johnson's character was effectively written out after the opening segment and then conveniently pops into the action at the end.The plot and the villains are rather nonsensical, I suppose given that this one will be the most financially successful yet Universal Pictures will need to be careful not to sit on their laurels as viewers will demand better stories and more plausible settings.",6,1,16,13 April 2015
The Godfather," The Godfather
","Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.",10,3,4,14 October 2019
