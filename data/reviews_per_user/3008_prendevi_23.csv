Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Utter brilliance from the master ***** (out of five)
","Far and away the best film of this year so far, and one of the best films of all time. Q.T. -in my opinion the best film writer and director ever! has done it again. Q.T.`s trademark dialogue is much more in this one than Vol.1. Vol.2 is also much more story-orientated. The acting is awesome. Uma Thurman undoubtably deserves an oscar for this there are so many layers to her performance, David Carradine is absoloutley amazing as Bill as is Michael Madsen as Bud and Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver. The score by Robert Rodriguez is excellent, and ofcourse Q.T's direction is absoloutley fabulous. This film is so cool, so funny, so exciting, so enthralling you must not miss this utter masterpiece.",7,0,1,25 April 2004
Minority Report," ***1/2 out of five Fantastic....but a poor ending.
",Speilberg+Cruise would've been expected to be a box-office smash. But in the U.S. so far the movie hasn't done that well. But Speilberg and Cruise can take refuge in that Minority Report is actually a very good film. Its a real roller-coaster ride. Cruise is quite good and I'm Irish and I have to say most Irish movies and actors are crud I thought Colin Farrell was good too. And the direction by Speilberg is awesome. The only real flaw I would have with it is the poor ending.But so what? Its still well-worth going to see for the rest of the movie which is quite simply fantastic. ***1/2 out of five,7,0,0,6 July 2002
The Others," Excellent, with astonishing performences **** out of five
","This really is a good old-fashioned ghost story. It dosen't use special effects to scare (using visuals to scare dosen't work usually anyway) this uses atmosphere. For instance creaking doors etc, maybe your saying to yourself thats not scary thats a clice. But if you do think that way I would still think you would like this- no electricity, no phones, no radios. This is a deep and haunting tale. Nicole Kidman gives a tour-de-force performence. While the childern Alakina Mann as Anne and James Bentley as Nicholas give truly excellent performences- but theey're still not as good as Haley Joel Osment. All the cast are good really. Now the flaw many will have is its resemblence to another film I won't tell you what film- but really I over-looked that because I don't think the writer Alejandro Amenabar set out to steal from the other film. I highly reccomend you to get to your cinema to see this, if you haven't already you don't know what your missing out on. **** out of five.",8,0,0,5 November 2001
Pan's Labyrinth," A masterpiece. One of the films of the year. *****(out of five)
","An amazing piece of work, Guillermo Del Toro's adult fairytale just has to be seen to be believed. One of the most original films in a long time the film blends fantasy and reality seamlessley. The film is often extremely violent which adds to the contrast between the fantasy and reality. I believe this film will go down as a classic in years to come and really should be seen by everyone who has an interest in film. Also, it should be up for more than just Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. The special effects, on a relatively tight budget compared with most Hollywood films are astounding and make-up/costume design is superb as well. An absolute must-see.",10,2,4,20 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," **1/2 out of five. It has some good moments but in the end its style over substance.
","Boy, is the dialogue bad! Aswell as some of the acting. But the great Samuel L. Jackson is good. And the scene in the arena is breathtakingly awesome. But at times the film drags and it feels as if Lucas thought up of some special effects before the script. And that title is pathetic. All n' all a mediocre film.",5,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Peter Jackson directs this masterpiece perfectly and the cinematography is mind-blowing ****1/2 out of five
","People argued that Peter Jackson director of The Frightners, Heavenly Creatures, Braindead etc wasn't the man to bring J.R.R. Tolkein's classic novel to life. Well surley they will admit they were wrong after seeing this incredible masterpiece. The first ten minutes or so after the introduction where everything is jolly and happy is to be blunt quite sick but as soon as the horror kicks in the film becomes absoloute pleasure. The performences are fantastic not the mention the directing. If there is any justice (which I know there isn't) than Peter Jackson should bag the oscar for best director. The cinematography is fabulous aswell. But scrathcing off all technicalities what makes this film truly great is its so unique unlike the likes of tosh like The Mummy Returns you honestly don't know who is genuinley good or bad or who will betray who. This is ultimetley a very dark horror that isn't for childern unless they love truly great adult movies- and I'm sure there are a lot of childern who do. Some childern though will find it far too frightening. A must see.",8,0,0,2 January 2002
Wanted," I got what I Wanted...
","Wanted is the most satisfying action movie I have seen in quite some time. Kudos to Universal for taking a risk in hiring a genuinely distinctive and singular talent in Timur Bekmambetov, director of the excellent Night Watch and its sequel Day Watch. They have also taken a risk in allowing this to be R-rated. They haven't wimped out for the sake of a few bucks like other studios (I'm looking at you Die Hard 4). Instead they have made a foul-mouthed, ultra-violent, hugely exciting action thriller. Sure its plot is off-the-wall and completely ridiculous but just sit back and enjoy the glorious visuals, extraordinary acting sequences and the stellar cast( in particular McAvoy).",8,2,6,30 June 2008
Spider-Man," Geinuinley flawless. A bona-fide masterpiece. ***** out of five
",Tobey Maguire is a a brilliant actor. Hes so natural.When I heard that Freddie Prinze Jnr was tipped to play Spider-Man. I thought it was a terrible shame. But when I heard Tobey was then tipped I thought ''fantastic''. He is again great here and Sam Raimi -director of the great ''The Evil Dead'' and its even better sequel directs this fantastically.This unlike a lot of recent thrillers builds up the characters brilliantly. This reminds me a lot of The Matrix and it undoubtably the best sci-fi thriller since it.,9,0,0,9 June 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Great fun,in a cheesy saturday morning way ***1/2 out of five
",Usually I wouldn't rate just a bit of fun this highly but in all fairness this film has some fantastic car chases and its such good fun. Sure Paul Walker dosen't give an oscar-deserving performence but Vin Diesel makes up for that. This is like a saturday morning serial. And the cars are just so fast. Very enjoyable.,5,0,1,11 October 2001
City of God," Absoloutley brilliant ****1/2 out of five
","Absoloutley brilliant film. Definetly one of the best films I've seen so far this year. A mesmerising crime thriller. I love Quentin Tarantino and his movies he is my idol. This is very much like a Quentin Tarantino movie, so absoloutley adored it.",9,0,2,24 May 2003
No Man's Land," Brilliant. Tense, gripping and very funny. **** out of five.
","This is truly a brilliant film. Great dialogue, very original, tense and gripping. Very well-acted, written and directed. Its such a great movie. Brilliant. Its unique aswell. Though a black comedy about the Bosnian war echoes Three Kings which was a black comedy about the Gulf war this is a very unique and different satire. It truly is brilliant.**** out of five",8,0,1,21 August 2002
Men in Black II," Clever, funny and very enjoyable ***1/2 out of five
","Not a patch on the fantastic original but still a funny, very enjoyable film. Really enjoyable as a matter of fact. Its well-acted ,zany, quirky stuff. Great special effects aswell. All n' all great stuff. ***1/2 out of five",4,0,0,11 August 2002
Children of Men," Superb, electrifying cinema ****1/2 (out of five)
","This sci-fi thriller based on a book by P.D. James is absolutely magnificent. Its premise is high-concept yet totally believable and Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) shot the film entirely using hand-held cameras adding to the realism and grittiness of the picture. Clive Owen gives the performance of his career in the lead role while there is a scene stealing supporting turn from Michael Caine. The film is a tonce poignant, tense, exciting , disturbing and even funny especially in Michael Caine's scenes. Cuaron is certainly proving himself as a hugely talented man and could go on to great thingsThis film is a must-see ****1/2 (out of five)",9,6,10,30 September 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Film of the year ***** (out of five)
",By far the best filmaker in the world ever! returns and dosen't dissapoint.This is far and away the best film of the year. I don't care what comes out over the next couple of months nothing can top this. This has gone straight into my all-time top-five. All of Q.T 's movies are there Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are joint first with Jackie Brown joint fifth. And True Romance is just outside the top 5. You simply must see this masterpiece I really can't wait for volume 2.,9,0,1,12 November 2003
The Dark Knight," An Amazing Film
","Christopher Nolan's sequel to 'Batman Begins' is not only the best superhero film ever made but also a supremely intelligent, intricate and thoughtful meditation on how to achieve your goals while adhering to your principles. It really is a masterful film and confirms Nolan's status as one of the most talented directors working today. Of course when talking about the film one cannot but mention the late Heath Ledger's stunning performance as The Joker. Its an undeniably singular and special performance and it lies at the heart of this deep, dark masterwork. There is also great, understated performances from Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and in particular Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent- the character that the moral framework of the film rests on. The film is also a stunning visual experience not to mention the brooding, unnerving Kubrickian score that punctuates the action brilliantly. This really is one of the films of the year and is in fact arguably a reinvention of the superhero genre. This is more of an urban crime drama in the vein of 'Heat' than it is 'Batman and Robin'.",9,2,6,28 July 2008
Green Street Hooligans," One of the best movies of the year ****(out of five)
","Elijah Wood is fast becoming one of America's bravest actors. Many felt that after playing Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy that he may do a Mark Hamil and disappear. On the contrary though he has instead made eclectic choices ( a mute cannibal in the excellent Sin City and a football hooligan in this) as not to be typecast and next he will be seen in the Liev Scriebher directed Everything is Illuminated, another brave choice. And while Wood is excellent here his co-star Charlie Hunman steals the show as hard-hitting football hooligan Pete. His energy and naturalistic stile are superb. A real talent. The film as a whole is one of the best of the year. A gritty, very well written take on a controversial subject. First-time director Lexi Alexander dosen't tiptoe around the subject either not afraid to show while this is a disgraceful activity it does have plus points for the thugs involved and it shows how easy it could be for a normal person to get caught up in this violence. Extremely good. **** (out of five)",8,0,0,28 October 2005
Reservoir Dogs," One of my all time favourites
","Simply one of my all time favourites this is an out and out classic. So original this brilliant film has been quite often imatated but any imitator hasn't even come close to this. Its flawless in its script, acting, dialogue everything its totally and utterly flawless. And whats this about it being so shockingly violent,in the controversial scene which even though I'm sure you have all heard off I won't tell you what happens there, it dosen't actually show anything. This is basically the hippest coolest film of all time and one of the best.",10,0,1,4 October 2001
Pulp Fiction," In my opinion this is definetley one of the 10 best movies of all time ***** out of five
",Incredibly good. Not quite as good as Reservoir Dogs but but pretty close and anything that one would come in a mile of Reservoir Dogs must be incredible. In my opinion the greatest writer/director of all time Quentin Tarantino- who is my idle writes and directs this and incase you don't know wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs aswell. This really was and still is ground-breaking so clever and funny with great performences. In my opinion this and Dogs are far superior to the likes of The Godfather- not that that is a bad film thats fantastic but not nearly as good as this and Dogs (in my opinion) QTs next film after this was the excellent Jackie Brown and I can't wait for Kill Bill,10,1,2,11 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Awesome, breathtaking and brilliant ***** out of five
","I loved the first Matrix film and this really does match it. Some of the scenes in this really do have to be seen to be believed. Incredible. This is much, much better than X-Men 2. This is far more spectacular and has far,far more substance. Its really interesting to see how much Neo has evolved the fact that he can fly and everything. Also this has some great twists. This really does live up[ to the hype.",6,0,0,25 May 2003
The Departed," By far and away Scorsese's best movie since Goodfellas. A masterpiece. ******(out of five)
","Based on the enjoyable, if flawed, Asian film Infernal Affairs Scorsese and screenwriter William Moynahan expand on that films neat premise and where that was a cops and robbers thriller here Scorsese has fashioned a gangster epic almost on a par with Goodfellas. Speaking of Goodfellas, this is easily Scorsese's best film since that 1990 masterpiece. Its as if Scorsese has rediscovered his youth with this film its sparky energy and style resembling Mean Streets. The acting as well as the directing and screen writing is outstanding. But what would you expect from a cast that includes: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone. As for Oscars, personally I think it shows the idiocy of the awards that Scorsese who is undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of all time has never won an Oscar and the likes of Ron Howard has.So he probably won't win this year either. Nicholson may(deservedly) get nominated for best supporting actor but even though DiCaprio and Damon are awesome in this movie, they probably won't get nominated. But its Marty, Jack, Leo etc that will have the last laugh as I feel in twenty years time people will still be talking about this movie. Jack and Marty quite possibly the greatest actor and director of their eras have finally made a film together and they can add it to their already massive respective lists of masterpieces. ***** (out of five)",10,0,1,15 October 2006
Signs," Has moments of utter brilliance but has sentimentality *** out of five
",A very entertaining and well-directed sci-fi horror. It geinuinley has moments of utter brilliance. Like the camera showing a torch on the floor only hearing the noises in the background. Moments like that reminded me of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-in my opinion the best horror of all time though Scream is also flawless its more of a comedy while Massacre is so clausterphobic. But then this film also has moments of sentimentality. All n' all this is a very entertaining piesce of fun.,6,0,1,15 September 2002
Identity," Original, compelling and very tense thriller/horror **** (out of five)
","A truly original thriller/horror with some great twists. A clever intelligent film that also has some very sharp dialogue.John  Cusack, Ray Liottta, Amanda Peet etc. are all  very good.And James Mangold's direction is also fantastic! Not to be missed",8,0,0,3 July 2003
Sin City," One word sums this movie up: Masterpiece! *****(out of five)
","Kudos to directors Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino for ''Sin City'' a landmark film. Its a landmark not only for the astounding cinematography (which mixes black and white and flashes of colour to sumptuous effect) but also Rodriguez's decision to bring the man behind the comic books on which this is based - Frank Miller- on board is throughly groundbreaking and gutsy. Rodriguez actually had to resign from the DGA to bring Miller on board as it was breaking their rules. But this decision well and throughly paid off and Miller's emphatic influence on the style of the movie is there to be seen. A third director-Rodriguez's buddy Quentin Tarantino- also came on board for a few days as a ''special guest director'. Tarantino directed one brilliant sequence with Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro in a car on his own and also co-directed a few other scenes with Rodriguez and Miller.This is adapts Miller's books more faithfully than any movie based on something else before. And that is throughly what the genius that is Frank miller deserves. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and so far this is my MOVIE OF THE YEAR by a country mile and I really can't see it being topped. It ingeniously interweaves three of Miller's stories into one whole movie through a pormanteau structure similar to that of Tarantino's masterpiece ''Pulp Fiction''. The film is clever, fast-paced, exciting and sickeningly funny. The entire cast is superb but the standouts are Bruce Willis who excels as hard-boiled cop Hartigan, Nick Stahl who is terrifying as a deformed sadist known as ''Yello Bastard'' and comeback kid Mickey Rourke who is absolutely outstanding as violent thug with a heart of gold Marv.You simply cannot miss this film!",10,3,4,24 June 2005
