Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Masterpiece.
","If you liked the first film, you will love the second. I can't go on and describe the movie without spoiling it, but I can say that this masterpiece is an awsome ending to an awsome series. Quentin Tarantino has done it again. The cast is great! Uma is perfect as The Bride, and David is awsome as bill. The rest of the cast is just so good! There is less violence but more dialogue, precious dialogue. You will love the action. You will savor the Dialogue, and you will go out of the theater more than satisfied. I give it 5/5. What are you waiting for? Go see this no! (See Vol.1 first on DVD!)",10,1,2,15 April 2004
