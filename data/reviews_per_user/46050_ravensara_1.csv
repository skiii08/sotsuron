Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ignore Critics
","I don't care what the critics or anyone says about this movie--I liked it! It's Star Wars and it was fun. I admit I liked the originals more, however; it's a set-up for a story, so I'll wait patiently and see where Lucas takes this.",8,0,1,22 February 2000
