Black Swan," I should have walked out of the theater
","This is undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. Every second in the theater was utter pain and agony. Its depiction of mental illness is void of all realism and highly offensive. It's nothing more than an extreme version of the psycho/schizophrenia clich√© that has haunted movie-making for decades. If it is well-made, well-acted, or whatever, I don't care, because the movie has nothing to tell or to motivate its existence. The only two remotely interesting characters, Ninas mother Erica and the director Thomas Leroy are obscured by the persistent mood of psychological terror radiating from every scene. How the movie will end is made clear before it has even begun, perhaps purposely by Aronofsky who wants to convey the inescapable fate of Nina who is suffering from schizophrenia or some other mental disease. Add some lesbian sex scenes, and you have a low-water mark that is hard to beat. Never again will I watch a movie by Darren Aronofsky.",1,17,30,13 March 2011
