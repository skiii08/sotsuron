The Blair Witch Project," Creepy to the Bone
","after the all the hype of the blair witch, i expected to leave the theater in complete fright.  but instead, i left with a boggled mind.  since the ending of the movie was only round 7 minutes long, i feel that if the tape ran for at least five more minutes, it would have easily been one of the scariest movies i have ever seen.  but when the movie ended i could not help but think.  rolling stone said 'scary as hell.'  did they see a different screening that was longer.  i feel that the ny post said it perfectly with 'creepy to the bone.'",Null,1,1,4 August 1999
