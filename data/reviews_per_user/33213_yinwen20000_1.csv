Resident Evil: Afterlife," Never go to a movie just because it is 3D
","Well, yes. I am well informed before watching this movie. Played the video game from when it first came out. great video games, no question about that. watched the previous series and that's why I call myself well informed. So I am not really expecting to watch a master piece or well structured story or anything. But I do expect the 3D would worth it since that's the point, right? a 3D version using the name of this series, is gonna attract fans no matter what crap they make.But, still, totally does not worth it. The storyline is moronic, the action is sort of cool for the first 5 mins? Too many useless trash taking most of the time and at 1 hour I realized the story has not spread out yet!!!! There could be some scaring moment, cheap ones, nothing you really can not expect. totally pointless movie and if there is anything I acquired from watching this one? 3D won't make a crap any better. and sadly, that's the 3 point I vote refers to.Don't watch it unless you really wanna see Alice in 3D.",Null,7,15,18 September 2010
