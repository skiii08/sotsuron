The Avengers," Amazing Simply Put
","This film is a testament to action / superhero movies as there has never been one like it. There is plenty of character development as well as incredible set pieces filled to the brim with exciting action. Each Superhero has a chance to shine as the film progresses and that was something i thought about before seeing this film.Iron-Man, Thor, and captain America are a fantastic bunch of superhero's with amazing strenghts but The Hulk was probably my favorite here as you will see his moments are monumental and add a degree of amazement to the film in my opinion. I hope you all enjoy this fantastic film as much as i did! 10 STARS!!",10,1,4,4 May 2012
