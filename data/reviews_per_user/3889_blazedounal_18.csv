Passengers," Best science fiction movie
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the 'critically acclaimed' films I've watched this year. The movie is worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. The movie is cherished and loved. The movie is so great.The starship Avalon is transporting over 5,000 colonists to the planet Homestead II, a journey that takes 120 years. The colonists and the entire crew are in hibernation pods, but as the ship passes through a large asteroid field, the ship's shield is heavily strained causing a malfunction that awakens one passenger, mechanical engineer Jim Preston, 90 years early.After a year of isolation, with no company except Arthur, an android bartender, Jim contemplates suicide.

After so much about struggle within inside, he awakens her, claiming her pod malfunctioned like his. Aurora, devastated she may grow old and die before the ship reaches Homestead II, attempts a fruitless effort at re-entering hibernation, just as Jim had tried. Eventually, she accepts her situation and begins writing a book about her experiences.

Before dying, Gus gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge to access crew areas and repair the ship.The two find and trace a colliding asteroid's path through the ship's hull from two years earlier that damaged the computer administering the reactor. Attempts to repair the computer lead to further reactor damage. Jim realizes a fusion reactor must be vented by opening an outer vent hatch. Aurora assists while admitting she is terrified of losing Jim and living on the ship alone. Aurora, from inside the ship, and Jim, outside, successfully vent the reactor. However, Jim's tether snaps and his damaged spacesuit is losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves and resuscitates Jim in the Autodoc, relieved that he is alive and seemingly forgiving him for his decision; the two share a moment of embrace. Jim later learns that the Autodoc can act as a makeshift hibernation pod for Aurora. However, she realizes this would mean never seeing Jim again. After 88 years, the ship's passengers and crew awaken shortly before arrival on Homestead II. They discover a small house amid lush vegetation on the ship's concourse area. Aurora's book reveals that she chose to stay awake with Jim and finish writing her story.",8,2,4,21 February 2017

The Lion King," New movie, new generation
","I did not know why a lot of spoil comment for this movie. Back 30 year ago, the Lion King movie is fantasy, remarkable, and remember able movie. Now Disney made with live action. After I watched the Lion King (2019), I still remember the first the lion king movie. The new one is the same the old one, so it is predictable, less emotion and CGI technology is still new today. The song of the movie is the same and always great part; However, the movie is less of emotion because real animal can not sing and talk to each other. Your pet or my dog can not talk to owner. For the new version, some line is better. It still gave me the emotion when I watch the movie 'run Simba run'. I did not compare the old one and the new one because the old one was so successful movie. If I have not watch the old one about 30 year ago, I will go for this movie which is the new one. We are grown and the movie is grown too. The new Lion King is the new and remade for new generation. The new kid would not want to watch the old one which was a 30 year ago so the new Lion King is still the best for new generation. I think parent should bring the kid to watch the new Lion king movie. The Lion king was the best in my time, and it will also the best for new generation today.",9,0,1,20 October 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Movie from Johnny Depp alway is great
","I loved it! Yes, it is made for the family audiences but it really kept me going for two hours! It is an action filled adventure on the high seas from the times when Britannia ruled the waves. It has it all! Action, pirates, sailors, ghosts and what not, but it really is entertaining. I am a huge fan of Pirates of Caribbean franchise. I was desperately waiting for this 5th installment. I watched it in IMAX 3D. The movie is full of actions, adventures and there are a lot of surprises and you will not keep your eyes away even for a min. This franchise has some of the perfect special effect. I love this movie.In first movie, 12-year old Henry Turner boards the Flying Dutchman to inform his father, Will Turner, that the mythical Trident of Poseidon is able to break his curse and free him from his ship, and of his intent to seek Jack Sparrow's help to find it.Nine years later, Henry works on a British Royal Navy warship. While chasing a pirate ship, Henry realizes they are sailing into the Devil's Triangle. The captain dismisses his concerns and has Henry locked up for attempting mutiny. Upon entering the Triangle, they come across a shipwreck, and are attacked by Captain Salazar and his undead crew, who slaughter everyone on board except Henry. Salazar sees that Henry is searching for Jack Sparrow, spares his life and asks him to tell Jack Sparrow that death is coming his way.In Saint Martin, a young woman named Carina Smyth has been sentenced to death for witchcraft because of her knowledge of astronomy and horology.

Barbossa meets with Salazar and offers to help find Jack in exchange for sparing his fleet.

Logan," Excellent movie but not super hero movie
","Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. What makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core.In the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James 'Logan' Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has been severely weakened and he has aged due to the adamantium on his bones beginning to poison him. Logan lives with mutant tracker Caliban in an abandoned smelting plant across the Mexican border, where they care for Professor Charles Xavier, who is suffering from a neurodegenerative disease which causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities to devastating effect. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden'.After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Logan and Xavier learn that Laura is one of several mutant children Transigen was breeding using DNA samples from several mutants for the 'X-23' project, and that upon completion of the 'X-24' project, the children were deemed obsolete and were to be euthanized. Gabriela helped several children escape from the Transigen compound before smuggling Laura, who is revealed to be Logan's biological daughter, across the border.The Reavers catch up with them in Oklahoma City, but Xavier suffers a seizure and telepathically freezes everyone in their hotel, allowing Logan to kill the attackers before injecting Xavier with a suppressant and escaping. While on the highway, the trio helps farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident. The Munsons invite them over for dinner, and they accept under the guise of being a trigenerational family. When a nearby pipe springs a leak, Logan and Will leave the house to fix it.While Logan is gone, X-24 stabs Xavier through the chest before slaughtering the Munson family. When Logan returns, Xavier succumbs to his wound and Caliban sacrifices himself by setting off two grenades to destroy the Transigen van in which he is being held captive. Logan engages X-24, which gains the upper hand, but Will impales X-24 and shoots it before dying, allowing Logan and Laura to escape.After burying Xavier, Logan passes out from exhaustion. He wakes up in a clinic that Laura had driven him to, but refuses to get further treatment and wants to abandon the trip. Laura convinces him to complete it, and they arrive at Eden, a safe haven run by Rictor and the other Transigen test subjects that managed to escape. Logan learns that the children plan to journey across the Canadian border and decides to part ways with them. However, when the children are intercepted by the Reavers, Logan intervenes. Dr. Zander Rice, the head of Transigen, pacifies Logan and reveals that the destruction of mutantkind is due to a genetic dampener created by his corporation. Logan shoots Rice dead.Logan and Laura fight X-24, with Rictor using his seismic powers to help them. However, X-24 brutally impales Logan on the branches of a fallen tree. While X-24 is trying to finish Logan, Laura shoots X-24 dead with an adamantium bullet Logan had been keeping. Fatally wounded, Logan tells Laura not to be the weapon she was made to be before dying in her arms. Laura and the other children mourn his death and hold a somber burial. Laura adjusts the cross on his grave to form an 'X' before continuing on their journey across the border in search of a new beginning.",10,4,10,3 April 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Disappoint movie

Kong: Skull Island," This is call kong movie
","Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production. This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures. There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. Kong: Skull Island is the perfect monster movie. It's an epic display of what a popcorn movie should be.In 1944, in the midst of World War II, two fighter pilots – an American soldier named Hank Marlow and a Japanese soldier named Gunpei Ikari – parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight. They both engage in close combat, with Ikari gaining the upper hand, but the fight is interrupted by a behemoth ape known as Kong.In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out an island known as 'Skull Island' and with a Vietnam War helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates, Major Jack Chapman and Captain Earl Cole. Upon arrival at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks to map out the island. However, the air unit is attacked by Kong, who kills a number of military personnel and scatters the others across the island.After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch, which was trying to prove the existence of monsters and determine their threat to humanity. The other survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko, and Landsat employee Victor Nieves) try to get to a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days' time. They encounter the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. He reveals that Kong is the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting the island's inhabitants from many predators, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed 'Skullcrawlers'. They have killed Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind, and that one of the Skullcrawlers killed Ikari.Packard's group begins making their way to Chapman, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, Chapman is ambushed and eaten by a Skullcrawler. Jame Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts scavenged from Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride the boat down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group, but the boat is attacked by pterosaur-like creatures which kill Nieves. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman, though his true objective is to find and kill Kong.There, the same Skullcrawler that devoured Chapman attacks the group, killing Randa and many soldiers before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, a vengeful Packard blames Kong for the deaths of his men and becomes determined to kill Kong. The two groups part ways, with Packard's group laying a trap for Kong, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. As Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong, Packard's group triggers napalm explosions to lure him in. Kong charges to the lake, where they manage to incapacitate him with ignited gasoline, though Woodward is killed. Conrad's group arrives and persuades the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to stand down. Then, a massive Skullcrawler. Emerges from the lake. Packard is crushed to death by a recovering Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong in a brief battle and then chases the survivors. Kong returns to rescue the others and with help from the humans, kills the beast by ripping out its innards. He saves Weaver from drowning, and allows the surviving humans to leave the island.During the credits, Marlow returns home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a Chicago Cubs game on television. In a post-credits scene, Conrad and Weaver are detained by Monarch and informed by Brooks and Lin that Kong is not the only monster to roam the world.

Arrival," Best fiction movie
","Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. This movie is the best movie.Louise is lecturing at a university; twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the planet. U.S. Army Colonel Weber asks her to join a team, with physicist Ian Donnelly, to decipher their language and find out why they have come to Earth. The team is brought to a U.S. military camp in Montana near one of the spacecraft. They call two alien which is nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Louise discovers that they have a written language of complicated circular symbols, and begins to learn the symbols that correspond to a basic vocabulary. As she becomes more proficient, she starts to see and dream vivid images of herself with her daughter. When Louise is able to ask what the aliens want, they answer: 'offer weapon'. A similar translation 'use weapon' is received by one of the other sites. Fear of a potential threat from the aliens leads other nations to close down communications on the project, and some prepare their military for attack. However, Louise thinks that the symbol interpreted as 'weapon' might have an alternative translation, such as 'tool' or 'technology'.Rogue soldiers plant explosives in the spacecraft. Unaware, Louise and Ian re-enter to communicate with Abbott and Costello again. The aliens give them a much larger and more complex message. Abbott ejects Ian and Louise from the craft as the explosion occurs, which leaves them unconscious.After Lan and Louise wake up, Ian works out that the symbols relate to the concept of time, and that it is one-twelfth of the whole 'gift'; they conclude that the aliens must want nations to cooperate.Louise rushes back to the spacecraft, which sends down a shuttle to take her inside. She meets Costello, who communicates that Abbott is dying. Louise asks about her visions of a daughter, and Costello explains that she is seeing the future, revealing to her that her 'visions' were not flashbacks but flash forwards. Costello also communicates that they have come to help humanity by sharing their language, which is the 'weapon' or 'tool' because it changes the mind's perception of time. The aliens know that 3000 years into the future they will need humanity's help in return. They ask her to use her 'weapon' - her ability to see into the future.Louise returns as the camp is being evacuated. Louise use her future power to know Shang's wife last words and she use to that to stop Shang's military power (China power). The planned Chinese attack is called off and the other nations resume contact with each other, as the spacecraft disappear from Earth.When packing to leave the camp, Ian admits his love for Louise. They discuss life choices, and whether they would change them if they knew the future. Louise foresees that Ian will father her daughter Hannah, whose name is an intentional palindrome, and leave her after discovering that she knew their daughter would die before adulthood. Despite also seeing that Ian will leave her when she eventually reveals their daughter's future, when Ian asks her if she wants to have a baby, Louise agrees.",10,2,14,30 January 2017

The Nice Guys," Excellent buddies movie
","The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is an excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. It is a ton of fun. Watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy.

Sully," best and emotional movie 2016
","Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger has experienced both. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports. Sully landed the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him with nightmare, and he repeatedly imagines the plane crashing into a building.Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to land the plane.The two simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is landed. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.",9,1,1,6 March 2017
