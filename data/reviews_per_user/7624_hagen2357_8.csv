Casablanca," Casablanca
","After seeing this film, it's no question as to why this is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. Director Michael Curtiz did essentially everything perfect. The plot, lighting, sounds, and even the political message was clear and well done. Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine) did a great job playing a character who is quite powerful and doesn't like to get involved in other peoples affairs. What makes this film so significant is the political message at the time. At this point in history, America attempted to stay out of the affairs of other countries of the world. Rick Blaine represents America in this film. As time went on and the war started to become a threat to our everyday lives, America became involved. As the story of Casablanca goes on, Rick becomes more involved as well. What I also enjoyed about this film is that while so many different things are going on, a simple love story is unwinding and it is quite a good one. Overall, this is one of the best films of that era and would recommend to anyone.",9,0,2,18 March 2015
Chinatown," Chinatown Review
","Personally, I am a big fan of the film noir genre (mostly mid 1940s for my preference), so hearing that Chinatown was the last 'great film noir', I wanted to check it out. Even though every film noir I had seen before this was in black and white, this film had the same undeniable feel of a classic film noir. In the sense of a mysterious woman and underlying crime. Jack Nicholson played the perfect bold role of a private detective while also being soft spoken to an extent. I thought the setting/scenery was beautiful in this film, Being set in Los Angeles, California, some of the desert/mountain views were breath taking. In terms of film elements, Chinatown was quite unique. While most of the film was in color, the opening scene was in black and white as well as yellow tinted scenes throughout to indicate past events. Overall I thought this film was significant because of the countless elements to make this the last great film noir.",8,0,2,13 May 2015
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane Review
","It is generally known that Citizen Kane is widely regarded as the best film ever made. Knowing this, I watched this film for the first time with a probably unattainable standard than I do with other films. I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the film, I just expected too much. The story itself is interesting as we get a glimpse of Foster Kane's life piece by piece as he runs a newspaper that reaches people all over the country, Foster Kane was a man who seemingly had everything but eventually lost it all due mistakes and the envy held by his enemies. I enjoyed many other aspects of the film as well including the scene in which the newspaper men are seen in a photograph and then filmed in the same exact position, then stand up and walk away: I thought it was a neat effect. I also enjoyed the scene from Kane's childhood showing his home and the snowfall which has an impact later in the film. Overall, I though Citizen Kane was a good movie but in my eyes would not be considered as the greatest film of all time.",7,0,3,31 March 2015
Annie Hall," Annie Hall Review
","Almost immediately, you can tell that there is something different about this film. Woody Allen talks directly to the camera multiple times which is pretty uncommon in films. He seems to almost narrate, however he is shown talking instead of an omniscient voice talking over different scenes. This direct connection to the viewer is a significant point in this film. I enjoyed the variety of settings in this film. While most of the story took place in New York City, Annie and Alvie were also seen at the beach and in California. There is also a beautiful shot of the Brooklyn Bridge shown as Annie and Alvie walk through the city. I enjoyed this film due to the acting style of Woody Allen. Before this film, I had never seen a work done by Woody Allen. His awkward humor really makes this movie great. At its roots or the overall content, once again its another love story while being told in a different way.",7,0,0,12 May 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate Review
","Like many movies in this era, this film did a good job of showing the differences between the older and younger generations which was reflected in society at the time with controversies such as the Vietnam War. An example seen in this film occurs in the beginning of the film when Ben is having a graduation party thrown for him. He is shown being obviously uncomfortable in front of his parents older friends and doesn't have much in common with them. Never seeing this movie, I had always heard about Mrs. Robinson but never knew the whole story. I thought her character was great in showing a rebellious side while also feeling bad for her. Along with many different problems occurring in the story, including Ben not knowing what his future holds in store for him, this is another love story told in a unique way. The music in this film provided by Simon and Garfunkel helped give this its feel and actually was thoughtfully done in many ways. For example, the guitar playing slows down as Ben's car breaks down which occurred simultaneously. The camera-work in this film was also significant. Split screen and zooms were frequently used which is unique.",8,0,0,12 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain Review
","Personally not being a huge fan of musicals, I actually really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. The first enjoyable piece of this film is without a doubt the music itself. There were several songs such as 'Good Morning' and 'Singin' in the Rain' that were catchy and are well known even today. I thought the acting was great with every character. I was especially impressed with Donald O'Connor's role of Cosmo. He was a phenomenal supporting actor and was extremely talented dancing, singing, and playing various instruments. This film also features basic elements such as a simple love story between Don and Kathy that evolves throughout the film. I also thought this film was pretty funny overall, especially the ending scene at the theater. Although the character Lina had an annoying voice, I thought she served well as the films main antagonist and provided a humorous role as well. Overall, I can clearly see why 'Singin' in the Rain' is highly regarded as the greatest American musical. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.",9,0,1,25 March 2015
Psycho," Psycho Review
","Never seeing this film or any other work of Alfred Hitchcock, I was intrigued to see what many people loved about him. There is just something different about him, but in a good way. First of all, Psycho was released in 1960 in black and white. At this point in film history, almost every single movie that was released was in color and watching this film definitely gave it the feeling of a film released in the 1930s-40s. The shower murder scene is one of the most famous scenes in film history and is definitely worth noting. Never seeing the scene in its entirety, I wasn't sure what to expect. Originally I was a little bit disappointed in the realism of the scene but after further analysis, I realized that Hitchcock might have done this on purpose just to fit his mold of uniqueness. Overall, I was a fan of the film as the suspense seemed to build tremendously behind a very creepy character of Norman Bates. I'm not sure if I would call myself a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan but his work is certainly unique.",7,0,1,13 May 2015
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby Review
","Roman Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' is an early great horror film that I particularly enjoyed. I think the difference between horror films now and in the past is that the plot of older films are generally more scary than the plot of horror films today. I think in many horror films today, the loudness and 'pop ups' scare you more than the actual story itself. This is not the case in Rosemary's Baby. The story follows the ancient tales of sacrificing young children in return of certain promises with evil and good characters. The constant reference to Satan worshipers and the overall feel of evil give this film its greatness. A part I thought that was interesting was the lack of settings in a way. It seemed as though Rosemary never travelled far and was always in reach of her apartment. Many movies I enjoy have a variety of settings but this was different and I enjoyed it. Overall, this movie is significant to the truly horrifying plot and the way the story is told.",8,0,2,13 May 2015
