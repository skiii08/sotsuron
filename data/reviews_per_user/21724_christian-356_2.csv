Marie Antoinette," Modern music gets me every time
","I only want to state one point about this movie at this point. And its about the music used in it.Having learned little from the fiascoes of movie history of mixing historic eras, Coppola and crew decided on using contemporary music in the setting of the French Revolution. Here we have yet again a movie with potential but rendered ridiculous from the very title screen. Abhorrence. When will the world learn that fat and water doesn't mix. The other, but worse commercial movie which comes to mind is A Knights Tale, with the rock dances in the banqueting hall.There's few enough quality historic movies being made already...",5,0,0,15 February 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Oddities
","A nice blend of action, effects, and a bit of flirting as in the first movie, and the rest of the Marvel movies. However, there are a couple of oddities in the story which made even me think: How unrealistic is that! - And I'm a pretty mindless guy. I guess some ideas travel better through time than others...Weak point 1: Here we are, in the middle of our top lock-down facility, we're the army, we've brought in the alien. Let's place it in a room without camera surveillance. That makes sense.Weak point 2: During the movie we can assess the powers of the Silver Surfer. At the end of the movie, we have a pretty good idea of what he is capable of. So how can the Silver Surfer destroy a planet-eater, come on! The Silver Surfer is not powerful enough for that. Flying up the crack of Galactus wont get you anywhere, little guy. That ending simply doesn't work.Weak point 3: The combining of the four powers against Victor made great visual effects, but kind of ruined the idea of the Fantastic Four. This is more like Superman.Weak point 4: In the end, it's not the Fantastic Four who deals with the bad guy, it's somebody else - they only do it indirectly. But worse, it's all a StarTrek-like riddle with a self-contained clich√© psychological solution.Weak point 5: What does Galactus actually look like? Weak point 6: Richards invents a flying machine. Wow.Weak point 7: Surfing is a universal pastime.Weak point 8: Victor doesn't really get to show off with the surfboard. I'm telling you, that guy is not evil, he's just misunderstood.Weak point 9: How can the Fantastic Four combine their powers at the end? We have only seen them swap powers until that point.Weak point 10: So Galactus needs thermo and biological energy. What's wrong with the sun's energy? Why destroy earth? Why not just harvest it?",6,2,4,11 September 2007
