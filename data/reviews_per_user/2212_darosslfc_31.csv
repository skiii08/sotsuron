The King's Speech," Sets the Tone From the Start
","The first scene of The King's Speech depicts Albert George (Colin Firth), soon to be King George VI, as he makes a speech at Wembley. The direction and cinematography of this shows the story the film will tell. Trembling hands holding the speech papers, out of focus shots of the speech's words, and stepping up to the podium seeing the crowd through the microphone, this film is about King George's struggle to overcome his fear of public speaking. This is a fear that many people can identify with and the film does an excellent job of bringing that fear to the screen in many different ways. The editing, sound, and cinematography combine to give the film a depth that should be studied and appreciated. The acting is another attribute to the film that give it Best Picture quality. Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffrey Rush give arguably the best performance of their respective careers. The screenplay and dialogue gives these actors the resources to bring the story to life and keep the audience invested and entertained.The King's Speech won Best Picture in 2011 and deserved it. It showed quality in all aspects of the medium of film. It seemed like everyone came together and gave their best to make this film special. This is a Best Picture that won't be overlooked. Some of the award winning films are lost in the past but this one will remain in the minds of those who've seen it.",9,1,1,10 September 2015
Vertigo," A Thriller for Today
","Vertigo is one of the perfect examples of a film that will always stand the test of time and one that should never be remade. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius and has many excellent films under attached to his resume. Psycho is the one synonymous with his name but Vertigo is arguably his best directed piece. Scottie Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) is a retired detective who dwells over a failed case. An old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), goes to Scottie and asks him to investigate his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), who he thinks is cheating on him. Scottie accepts with the hope this will allow him to put the past to rest, but it turns into a twisted obsession that engulfs him. This film was glossed over at the Academy Awards in 1959. But today the film will always stick out for its directing, the superb screenplay, and the amazing performance of Jimmy Stewart. These factors make this film a classic and give it top shelf status even still, today. Vertigo sets the bar for a lot of thrillers today and many directors and writers have taken lessons and paid homage to this film. If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything about it. Go into the movie and get lost in where the story takes you.",9,5,7,13 August 2015
Casablanca," Timeless
","Almost 75 years later and Casablanca still contends with the best of them. Movies you've seen in the past five years fade from memory while Casablanca will forever stick in your mind. It is the epitome of a classic and will never be outdated. Casablanca tells the story of an American ex-pat night club owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), during the early days of World War II in unoccupied Africa. While following his usual tact of lying low his ex lover, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), shows up at his gin joint in Casablanca with her current lover, underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The film expertly relays subtleties of the War and depicts the disarray that ensues following the appearance of two letters of transit. Nazi Major Henreich Strasser arrives in Casablanca for this reason following Lazlo and the police Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) does what he can please the Major but always looks to help himself. Things escalate from here, and Casablanca continues to be one of the most memorable films to date. Skeptics see a release date of 1942 and a film that touts black and white cinematography. But for most this film will always be viewed as one of the best and considered timeless.",10,1,2,2 August 2015
John Wick," Dinner Reservation for
","This is a film that you just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and devour. It has a simple plot that moves quickly to set up the action scenes. The writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters. It could have been just another mindless action flick, but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once. John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired legend in the assassin world, mourns for his dead wife. Her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace. It doesn't take long for Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) to mess up John's path to these things. In response, Wick delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for Iosef's actions. The story weaves Wick's past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including: the female assassin Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki), friend (Willem Dafoe), and former employer Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He faces the difficult task of breaking Viggo's organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him, Viggo's son.Put this on, sit back, and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of: action, a simple but tight story, and an enjoyable time.",7,1,3,9 July 2015
Argo," Made for Best Picture
","Argo is one of those extremely well scripted movies that doesn't have much surprise or creativity. This true story easily translates to the screen and was done so without any faults. This film didn't take any risks and was a shoe in for Best Picture at the Oscars because of the size of the story and efficiency of the final product. The film tells the story of the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran, during 1980, from the point of view of a CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), who is tasked to come up with an rescue operation for six Americans. The idea for the operation is for Mendez to go to Iran under the guise of a Hollywood Producer scouting an area for a futuristic Sci-Fi flick. He would then make contact with the six Americans and bring them back under the guise of his crew.This film received a lot of praise and certainly deserved it. Ben Affleck has shown yet again he can direct a superb film. He also proves that given the right story he can still show his acting chops. Along side him in this territory are Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman who portray their roles expertly and with gusto. Argo while being a simple story, is one that will reach a wide audience. When you watch this film you will have a smile on your face at the end. It gives you that feel good vibe that Hollywood loves to instill in its movies. There were nine movies nominated for Best Picture in 2013 and Argo won. It won because it was made for Best Picture.",8,0,2,9 September 2015
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams Lives On
","Dead Poets Society is a film about a group of boys attending a prestigious Prep school in New England during the 1950's. The story follows Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), the younger brother of a former valedictorian, and his roommate, Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a exceptionally bright, artistic student with a overbearing father. The school rests upon four pillars: tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence. However, a new outlook comes in the form of a new teacher. The new English teacher, a former student John Keating (Robin Williams), presents the students with a different outlook and encourages the boys to seize the day. His unorthodox teaching methods stir up his students imagination and anger some of the more traditional characters in the film. There are many themes throughout, but above all else the message is to follow your heart. The story is extremely well written and the cast of young actors do well to bring the out the uncertainties and excitement of adolescence. The set design and direction capture this period and produce a story that will pass the test of time. Robin Williams performance in this film ranks among his best. He has departed us, but his legacy lives on. He visits us through his films and tells us 'Carpe Diem'!",9,3,4,23 June 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," Take It For What It Is
","The Day After Tomorrow is a global warming Earth disaster movie. A it does pretty much what it set out to do: have a lot of big special effects scenes, have a basic plot, and some dialogue that will advance the film from scene to scene. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist who warns world leaders about the dangers of global warming. He is laughed off by many, but Jack believes that it will be the next generation that pays for it never his own. However, sooner than he predicted extreme weather events pop up all over the world and the another ice age looms. The film then takes the turn of Hall going to save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who gets stuck in New York with Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) on a school trip. This is pretty much the movie in a nut shell. And this doesn't ruin it because when you go into it you get exactly what you're expecting. It succeeds for most part on the big special effects scenes, it succeeds in having a basic plot that does enough to keep you watching, and it succeeds in having dialogue that you can tolerate that will bring you to the next scene without cringing, for the most part. The Day After Tomorrow isn't going after Oscar Nominations, it's just there to give you an entertaining watch. If you decide to turn on this movie take it for what it is, a popcorn flick.",7,1,1,31 July 2015
Notting Hill," One of the Best
","Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies out there. The reason for its status is the well written story, the dialogue, and the actors.The film tells the story of a simple travel bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) who meets a famous movie star (Julia Roberts) when she walks in his shop. And it goes on to show the resulting relationship that starts from this point. The story follows the guidelines of most romantic comedies but it does so with its own flair. The dialogue is very sharp and the characters' conversations with each other are either thought provoking or laugh inducing.The chemistry between the actors on this film was perfect. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant dazzled in the lead roles. They make the audience care for each of the character's storyline no matter where the story takes them. The supporting cast compliments the main characters immensely. Rhys Ifans as Spike, Hugh Grant's flatmate, is comedic genius. Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies because it is so much more than just that label. The film sucks in the audience and at the end gives the viewer something more than just laughs and a happy ending. It gives the viewer insight and hope. I don't want to explain why because you should watch the film and find out for yourself.",9,5,6,27 August 2015
Nightcrawler," A Poignant Reminder
","Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a self educated man who desperately seeks work that he can immerse himself in and excel. After he witnesses a man film the aftermath of a car accident with the purpose to sell to any local news station, Bloom makes moves to enter the field. He quickly learns that the more violence he captures the more interested the news stations are. It doesn't take long for Bloom to become and expert at capturing disturbing footage and make his presence known to morning news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). After finding a taste for the work and seeing the threats of competition, Bloom starts to take the news into his own hands and blurs the lines between what is moral and what is the law. The story reveals from the beginning how Bloom treats people in a dehumanizing way and will do anything, to anyone to get what he wants. Nightcrawler is a film that holds your focus for the entire film. Louis Bloom even explains how local violence and crime is more of an attention grabber on the news than politics and global happenings. The story depicts a dark side of the violence humans seek and that dark side is personified by Louis Bloom.",8,1,2,1 July 2015
Hugo," Scorsese for the Children
","Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas) was critiqued by his daughter about how nothing he's made is something that his grandkids could go see. Scorsese then went on to direct Hugo. John Logan (Gladiator, Skyfall) pens the script about an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station, and how that boy searches for a message from his late father in the form of an automaton the pair embarked to fix. Hugo's (Asa Butterfield) escapade begins when a shopkeeper, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) catches Hugo stealing parts for the automaton from his toy shop. Georges takes a notebook from Hugo and is disturbed by the drawings of the automaton by Hugo's father. He tells Hugo that he shall burn the notebook and Hugo becomes distraught himself.Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), Georges' goddaughter, pairs up with Hugo for an adventure and promises not to let anything happen to his notebook. The tale goes on to tell the story of how Hugo and Isabelle try to find out the automaton's purpose, and how Isabelle's Papa Geroges is connected to it. They have to watch out for the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who determinedly rounds up any trespassing, stealing orphan to send off to the orphanage while they try to solve the mystery. This story tells the spectacular narrative of Hugo and has a backdrop of the history of the first films interwoven it. It is a wonderful film that was made in mind for children, but is one that both kids and adults can enjoy. Scorsese has added another work of art to his list. One that is unlike any of his other films. I advise you, if you haven't seen it, to add it to yours.",9,2,4,17 July 2015
The Intouchables," A Gem
","Intouchables is a film that has the rare quality of telling a story about a situation that is sad and putting a uplighting spin on it. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a rich quadriplegic looking for a caregiver. He hires Driss (Omar Sy), a young man, from a background that most people in Phillipe's circle wouldn't trust. Phillipe is looking for someone who won't pity him and what he gets is a person who gives Phillipe a perspective that makes the both of them grow to become better people. The film is funny, sad, and above all else extremely well made. The story which is superbly written flies by. The cinematography and the editing contribute to the film's smooth style. And with the soundtrack not to forget, you're in for a good time. It can cross languages and cultures and can still be viewed as a gem of a movie.",9,1,2,19 June 2015
Tropic Thunder," Oscar Worthy
","This film is arguably one of the best comedies of the 2000's. Ben Stiller after having a lull in his career came back strong with Tropic Thunder. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. The cast for the movie was spot on. It brought back Jack Black back to the spot light and allowed juggernauts Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise to give iconic performances.The plot of Tropic Thunder is that it's a movie about a movie. A group of actors set out to make a big budget Viet Nam film. However, they end up being put in the thick of a drug zone that forces the group to assume the roles they are playing. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an actor who use to be hot and now finds himself trying to save his career as leader of the team. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) is an Australian with multiple Academy Awards who undergoes pigment surgery to play his role. With the addition of Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) as the rest of the team they set out to make movie history. This film was nominated for one Oscar. It went to Robert Downey Jr. While this was the only Oscar it was nominated for it could have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Since the Academy doesn't often nominate comedies it didn't happen. That aside the film is a work of genius. I have watched this movie year after year and still find it funny as I did that day in the theaters. Tropic Thunder gives you a chance to laugh at the Hollywood depiction of making a movie and gives you the chance to appreciate the talent that went into some of the performances. All together this film is just a great chance to let yourself laugh and have a good time.",8,3,6,15 August 2015
Hardball," Reality and Entertainment
","Hard Ball is a slice of life film about an aimless young man given the opportunity to make a difference in the life of ten young boys from the projects of Chicago. Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is an addict to gambling and this weakness lands him in a spot of trouble where he has to pay off two bookies and needs money fast. He reaches out to an old friend, who's in business, for cash and agrees to coach a little league team for the money. The film goes on to tell the story of O'Neill and the boys as they change each others perspectives and end up helping each other become better people. John Gatins (Coach Carter, Flight) begins his writing career with this as his second feature film. It is a straight forwards predictable story but it has a special quality about it. The film stays away from making things bigger than they are and opts for a realistic outlook on the lives of the characters involved. Keanu Reeves gives a performance that not many would attribute to his successful career, but is a performance that shouldn't be overlooked. Michael B. Jordan (Chronicle, Fruitvale Station) is a one of the kids and gives a performance that foreshadows his career to come.Hard Ball, while not an Oscar worthy film, is one that will lift you up without asking for the suspension of belief. You don't need to put aside unrealistic happenings in the film because it doesn't try to be something its not. This film is there to give you insight into a story that you don't see everyday. It leans towards reality rather than entertainment and achieves both.",8,6,8,5 September 2015
Independence Day," The Ultimate Popcorn Flick
","Independence Day has everything you need for a summer blockbuster: big stakes, exotic location, and larger than life characters. It has the big stake in the form of aliens coming to destroy the Earth. It has the exotic setting of exploring Area 51. And it has larger than life characters, as well as average Joe heroes. The larger than life characters include the President of the United States (Bill Pullman) and the First Lady (Mary McDonnell). The average Joe heroes consist of: computer expert David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), Pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith), single mother Jasmine (Vivica Fox), and single father Russell (Randy Quaid). Independence Day is arguably one of the best summer blockbusters to have come out in the last 20 years. It has even deemed itself a spot on the endless list of sequels and remakes being done today. Before you watch the new ones or the remakes its always worth checking out the originals. Be sure to catch this one if you missed it and throw it on again even if you haven't because this film has made its name as one of the ultimate popcorn flicks.",7,1,2,1 August 2015
Gone Girl," Basic Instinct Would Be Proud
","Gone Girl is a mystery thriller that would make fans of Basic Instinct proud. It has the vibe of the 1992 film and does an excellent job of keeping the viewer following the story as a bystander from the film. When events unfold the audience is lead to have the view point of those watching the story on the news. You rarely have time to think ahead as the film has so much action and information relayed in the present.The film follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) as he discovers that his wife is missing and the resulting media attention to the disappearance. As more and more clues turn up events cause the viewer to question the husbands role in his wife's (Rosamund Pike) disappearance. This story is expertly written to keep the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) directs the film to perfection. He creates an atmosphere of suspense and doubt that grips the viewer and never lets go. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry give great performances that show the versatility of their acting skills. Ben Affleck gives another top notch performance to add to the list of his recent hits while Rosamund Pike steals the show.If you are looking for an intelligent thriller that views like you are reading a book make sure to add Gone Girl to your list. Watch it with a friend or during the daytime because a late night solo viewing might test your nerve.",8,3,7,2 September 2015
Django Unchained," Not Top Shelf but Still Top Quality
","Quentin Tarantino's seventh film falls short of his best work. It is still a great piece, but by the standard he's set for himself it doesn't make it to the top four of his films. Inglorious Basterds was his latest film proper to Django and it marked a return to top form for him. Arguably Inglorious is in the top three. And Inglorious was the last Tarantino film Sally Menke edited of before she passed.I do not think it is a coincidence that Django was a step down from Inglorious with Menke not heading the editing room. She worked on every single Tarantino film prior to this and the only thing lacking, or that could have been better, in Django was the editing. A few scenes ran long and could have used her touch to tighten them up. One in particular that comes to mind is the bag head scene. It was funny but the laughs ran out before the joke was over. All this being said Django is a very entertaining film and is well done in many ways. First and foremost though this film has to be viewed as a Western. Any view other than this is doing a disservice to the film. Critics hit out at Tarantino as they always do when this film came out and a majority of them did not view the film as it was intended. Besides the writing and directing which are always top notch from Tarantino, the acting from Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, and Leronardo DiCaprio were superb. Django Unchained is the story of a freed slave who, with the help of a German bounty hunter, sets out to rescue his wife from a savage plantation owner in Mississippi. When you watch this movie have a good time. The topic of slavery is dressed and not glossed over, but what this film offers is a entertaining Western where Django (Jaime Foxx) turns the conception of a slave on its head two years before the Civil War.",8,1,4,8 August 2015
The Incredibles," Fun for the Whole Family
","This film for Pixar has to be one of their greatest achievements. Many of their movies revolve around animals who have feelings, but The Incredibles is a nice change of pace from that usual plot line. The Incredibles tells the story of the Parr family, a family of undercover superheroes, who try to fit in to suburban life after being told by the government they most go into hiding. Some of the superheroes wish the old days of crime fighting would return while some wish that they could be normal rather than just pretending to be. Stakes are raised as the film continues to show the stories of each character and how they react to the events that happen around them. The film has great characters that are more than two dimensional story conveyors. The writing is superb and will entertain adults just as much as it will kids. The Incredibles is a fresh breath of air brought to animated films by writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille). The story he made for the audience is one that is intricate and deep. It deserves to be remembered as one of the Pixar greats.",9,3,4,10 August 2015
The Imitation Game," Well Done Drama
","The Imitation Game is the kind of film where it hits all the right notes. The script is excellent, the actors brilliant, and the directing on point. There are no real surprises to this story, but it pleases from the quality of an interesting biopic. The film is set in World War II England, and follows the story of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), and other code-breakers as they attempt to break the Nazi's code machine, enigma. The film starts with events from after the war, where Alan Turing is arrested from homosexual activity, and flashes back to his time during the war and his time at school as a boy.The Imitation Game reminded me of Argo in terms of the type of film it is. They are both about an event from history that most people probably haven't read too much about. And they are great stories and translate to the screen very well. The Imitation Game had a great chance for Best Picture because it did everything just right. It did not win because there were a few more daring films in the mix. Quite simply though, The Imitation Game is a well done drama.",9,3,6,4 August 2015
Jurassic World," Almost
","Jurassic World starts with all the bangs and whistles. It even has a reasonable plot for most of the movie. I won't spoil anything, but I will try to give you an idea of what to expect. The story follows the visit of Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids, who visit Isla Nublar where their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) works. After ten years of operation Jurassic World has relied on new attractions every couple years to keep the visitors coming back for more. This time they create a hybrid dinosaur from gene splicing. Owen (Chris Pratt) works with the velociraptors on the island and is brought over to check out the containment center where the hybrid is kept. This is where the story picks up. And for the majority of the film it keeps a good pace with an entertaining story and decent dialogue. Chris Pratt is the stand out in the film and continues to show that he can carry an action flick. The movie starts to dip toward the end and you are left with the feeling that the writers didn't know how to end it. The film did so good for almost the entire film, but what you're left with is a jumbled final act. That doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching, but tailor your expectations for a complete package. It will sure to impress and is well worth seeing, but as far as rankings go it deserves a 7 at best.",7,5,14,20 June 2015
Big Fish," Immortal Father-Son Story
","Big Fish tells the tale of Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as he tries to learn the true story about his dying father's life. The stories that Will knows about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) are fact and fiction blended and Will spends his time for most of the film trying to separate the two. The audience views the journey of Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) through flashbacks as Will recaps the tales his father has told over the years. Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It, Remember the Titans) create a tall tale world that combines both fact and fiction, the story of Edward Bloom. It could have been very easy for the effects to feel awkward, but they truly compliment the stunning story.The cast in the film is immense in talent. Supporting Crudup, McGregor, and Finney are: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Allison Lohman, Robert Guillame, Matthew McGrory, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito. Each bring their own brilliance to the story and together they make the film shine bright. Will Bloom has to come to terms with his father, Edward, and he has to decide how he wants to view the legacy of the man. The climax of the story places the film in the category of the last word uttered, immortal. Do not miss this beautiful film.",9,1,2,12 July 2015
Super 8," Bring Back Sci-Fi
","Science Fiction is a genre that its hard to pull off. I'd put it on the same difficulty scale as Comedies. Every person has their own expectations and preferences when it comes to these genres. Some people will be impressed by the material while others will scoff at it. Super 8 received mixed reviews and I think that could be attributed to different people having different expectations.For me this Sci-Fi renewed my faith in the genre. Amidst the many remakes, sequels, and superhero movies there haven't been much show of original stories in recent years. Super 8 took a few ingredients from other successful Sci-Fi films and blended them together to make a up to date recipe. Now some people might not like this, but I think J.J. Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) did an excellent job bringing back Sci-Fi. It may be an old wine but it's in a new bottle. Super 8 follows the story of Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and his friends as they try to make a short film. While the group shoot at nearby train station they experience an event that they know they need to keep secret. After the incident mysterious happenings occur in their town and the kids realize that what they experienced might have more consequences than the single incident. The film impresses on a lot of levels. The writing and the directing is something you come to expect from J.J. Abrams. And the cinematography is excellent. But what stands out are the performances. Joel Courtney does a solid job of leading the film at such a young age. And opposite him Elle Fanning (Deja Vu, Babel) makes her presence known as Alice Dainard. A nice surprise is Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) playing Joe Lamb's father. All in all this film did a decent job of doing a well celebrated genre justice. Your preferences may be different to what this film offers, but it is definitely one to watch to see if it does meet your expectations.",7,1,2,5 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Good Film, but not the Book
","Harry Potter, arguably one of the most famous book series, didn't take long for to be adapted for the screen. Facing big expectations the first movie did well to hold its own. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is a neglected boy who lives with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin. Odd things happen around him and before long he is told that he's not like other people, he is a wizard and a famous one to boot. He leaves his world of neglect behind and enters the magical world where young wizards of England attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With the help of friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Harry navigates his first year of school with the looming prospect of the dark wizard who killed his parents trying to return to power. The film has an all-star cast including Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Alan Smith. Chris Columbus (The Goonies) directs and does a fine job of bringing the magical world to life. It is definitely worth seeing but be sure not to neglect the books. It would be interesting to see how a Harry Potter miniseries would do, but at the moment we just have the films. The movies can only create so much of the books' brilliance, but to be fair this first one does a decent job.",7,1,2,30 July 2015
Whiplash," 'Good Job'
","Whiplash is a powerful film that tests the boundaries of how to treat adolescents. Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is an instructor of the at a conservatory and is notorious for being one of the most hated teachers. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a student who aims to be one of the best jazz drummers and to one day play at Carnegie Hall.Fletcher takes the complete opposite view of Robin Williams character in Good Will Hunting and pushes his students well past the breaking point. Andrew is determined to prove himself and tests himself again and again past the breaking point as the film goes on. Director and Writer Damien Chazelle made a short film by the same name and was given the backing to make it in to this feature length film. It is a good thing too, because from the script to the editing this is a film that gets it right. And the music is absolutely superb.I say 'good job' in spite of Fletcher's position on this term to everyone involved in this production. This is a film to remember and definitely one not to miss.",9,2,4,21 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Brilliant Story Without an End
","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio combine again to make another excellent film. DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort and the story spans the majority of his life. Belfort starts with humble beginnings, but when introduced to the survival of the fittest world of Wall Street he thrives to become the top dog.Belfort finds the hand over fist way to make money with penny stocks, and gets a group of guys he knows together to start a hedge fund. In the process he links up with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) who quickly becomes his right hand man. The story goes on to tell of Belfort's meteoric rise and how the riches enrich his life in all aspects: women, drugs, toys and travels. When Belfort and company get in trouble with the law the film shows how they try to maneuver around it. I won't go on to spoil anything, but for me the ending lacked a final blow. Scorsese and DiCaprio have come out and said that the final part of the film was to show how it was the common people who are being duped by the likes of Belfort, but it hardly seemed like that was the message. There have been articles telling of how this movie has spawned a high that some of the young generation are trying to attain. Belfort has become someone you strive to be, and that is exactly what the story isn't about. Hopefully it will be remembered for its true meaning because it truly is a great film.",7,1,3,24 June 2015
Hancock," Caught at the Warning Track
","Hancock was an attempt at something different in super hero genre. And it deserves applause for this. Instead of focusing on an earth threatening villain the film focuses on the villain within the hero. The superhero by make not by consensus, Hancock (Will Smith), fights bad guys when he feels like it. He does as much damage to the city he's in as to the bad guys he stops. The majority of the civilians of the city view him as a cause of disturbance rather than a preventer. Hancock has accepted this general opinion and does not care to change it until one of the people he saves, Ray (Jason Bateman), wants to help him. The film has a great premise and does well for the majority of the movie in executing it. However, the movie falters when it attempts to tell Hancock's past and bring it to the forefront. The movie had a great thing going but when the ball was almost out of the park, it got snagged on the warning track. Hancock is still a fun movie to watch, but you will most likely be disappointed with where the writers take the story. Will Smith delivers a top notch performance that is vastly under rated. He gives life to the character and made the viewer care about his plight. This film is worth renting or watching on TV, but it's not one for the collectors shelf.",6,1,2,16 August 2015
Never Back Down," Three Reasons to watch this movie
","Never Back Down reminds me of a Disney Channel Movie back in days of Brink and Johnny Tsunami. It has simple characters and doesn't really have too many surprises. That being said the movie is well written and has a classic plot. Plain and simple, it's just light hearted good watch. Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) is a kid troubled by the death of his father. After moving to a new town the local tough guy (Cam Gigandet) picks him to be his latest person to beat up on. The thing to do in this town is being into UFC/MMA and participating in the low key fight club.If you're looking for some time to kill or your looking for a simple yet enjoyable movie check this out. The three reasons to are: entertaining story, decent acting for a small movie (with a small part from Dijon Hounsou), and a good motivational message.",6,2,3,17 June 2015
The Sixth Sense," M. Night Shyamalan on the Map
","The Sixth Sense did an excellent job of combining drama with suspense. The cinematography has slow pans and long shots which allow you to sit with each scene and take it all in. From the beginning M. Night Shymalan draws the viewer in with the stillness of the scenes, and immediately you are sucked into the world of Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis).Dr. Malcolm is an award winning child psychologist; however, the story focuses on his feelings about his failure to one of his patients. He sees a second chance for himself in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), and is determined not to fail this time. Malcolm has self admittedly been detached from his home life and believes that he won't be back to normal until he helps Cole. Cole is a young boy who is the odd one out at school. He fears events that happen around him that no one else can see, and he is afraid to tell anyone his secret. Cole doesn't have any friends and his mother (Toni Collette) is not always able to see everything going on with him due to the responsibilities she takes on as a single mother. M. Night Shyamalan creates a wonderful film that follows the relationship between a troubled young boy and the doctor trying to help him. It begs the audience to suspend belief as you delve deeper into the story. Shyamalan has made a classic that you have to at least see once, but gets better with multiple viewings.",8,1,2,3 July 2015
The Replacements," It' Decent. And yeah, I can live with that.
","The Replacements has been criticized for not being entirely accurate when it comes to football. That's not the point of this film though. It wasn't made to be an Oscar contender. It was made for sports fans who want to see a fun story and laugh while watching it. The Replacements delivers on both these aspects. The story's backdrop is a strike among the professional football players with four games left in the season. Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) is brought in to coach the Washington Sentinels and bring in a group of replacement players to finish out the season. The unconventional McGinty picks players that others might not have deemed NFL worthy. The list includes: wide receiver Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), linebacker Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), kicker Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans), and quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves). Most of the players McGinty picks haven't played football in awhile, but he believes that they have something the spoiled professionals don't, which is heart. The film goes on to tell the story of these replacement players and their fight to get into the playoffs. The players have to come to terms with their fears and learn to trust each other in order to do this. And they have their cheerleading squad, led by Falco's love interest Annabelle Farrell (Brooke Langton), to help them do this. Shane Falco leads the squad in a way that isn't classy or inspirational, because that just wouldn't be their style. And that is the style of the film. It doesn't go out with the aim to be a story that will move you to tears, except maybe through laughter. The film is one to watch when looking for a light hearted story that offers some laughs.",7,4,6,11 July 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'Manners Maketh Man'
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that you watch when you just want to have a good time. With all the Super Hero movies coming out it is nice to see a movie that takes a bit of the super natural and brings it down to Earth. It takes the Spy genre and makes it something that the audience can relate to. The film tics all the boxes on bigger than life issues with the world at stake, a super villain who's hand hovers over the detonation of it, and a group that acts above the law, with the good of the world at mind, to stop it.However, what makes this film truly a gem in the genre of Action/Comedy is the relationship between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and the rest of the cast. He goes through the character arch of a young man trying to find his place in the world. He uses his surroundings to explain his failures, but when given the chance to prove himself he strives to make his mark. The film does well to keep you entertained with a main character having a different perspective on an environment than the people he's with. The action is top notch with gadgets and fighting scenes. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Kick Ass, Stardust) have scripted another outside of the box film that is clever and entertains. If you're looking for a film that above all else entertains; and, is well written, with a good plot and strong characters take a try on Kingsman and watch how 'Manners Maketh Man'.",7,2,7,16 June 2015
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," I assume it needs no introduction...
","I have only recently seen this film. Going into it I was expecting to see a moderately good story about vampires. However, I was pleasantly surprised. For me it was an amazing story of emotion. Louis (Brad Pitt) is a man who mourns for his wife and baby. He seeks for a way to end his sorrow and Lestat (Tome Cruise) offers Louis a cure, but is it the right one?This was the first film I saw directed by Neil Jordan and I'm certain it won't be the last. Neil Jordan has given us something that enraptures the emotions. He has adapted the book into a film that couldn't have been made better.The duo of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise as Louis and Lestat is nothing short of memorizing. The performances from each of them glue your eyes to the screen. These two great actors continue their filmography with roles you won't forget. Kirsten Dunst gave an impeccable performance for one so young. She was perfect for the role of Claudia. And let's not forget Antonio Benderas as Armand and Christian Slater as Daniel Malloy. Even though they had little screen time, they made their effect.Interview with the Vampire is a film that will stay with you. The emotions that come from the characters will make this movie last. The existential whitens that drive the movie are even more interesting given the immortality of the characters. It is an amazing film and should be on any avid movie lovers list.",8,2,3,15 August 2008
The Cabin in the Woods," Reminiscent of Scream
",I'm not a big fan of horror movies other than the classics. I went to go see this movie with my film class for a field trip. I was curious because my professor was not one to recommend okay movies and I didn't hear much about this film prior to seeing it. I went in with no knowledge of what I was going to view. And I was pleasantly surprised. I had a great time and thought it was a great concept that was excellently executed. It played on a lot of the classic horror films but made its own statement. It turned the movie on its head reminiscent of how Scream had its character discussing horror films and situations in its movie. Cabin in the Woods is about five college friends who take a vacation at a remote cabin in the woods. What they discover is the events that unfold are the making of someone setting them up for a trap. You see both sides of the coin and it makes for a very entertaining watch. While the movie is a horror film there are plenty of laughs throughout. Even though you are aware of everything going on you still feel for the character's plight. This movie is a very intelligent film that wouldn't appear so on the surface. It is a great movie to watch with your friends. You will definitely be thinking and talking about it after it's done.,8,1,3,11 August 2015
