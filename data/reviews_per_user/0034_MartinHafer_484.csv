The Double Life of Véronique," an okay movie
","This film was moderately interesting and had a very haunting musical score. It concerns two women who are not related but are identical twins--complete with some sort of inexplicable psychic connection. That unexplained connection along with a relatively dull story line resulted in my being rather disengaged from the film. Stylistically speaking it is a lovely film, as were the director's trio of films Blue, White and Red--which I much prefer. Their stories also feature similar music, excellent cinematography and are VERY unusual films but they just kept me more interested and their stories just seemed better developed and less silly. To me, this is an interesting film but a bit of a misfire.",6,6,21,28 August 2005
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Full of clichés but enjoyable
","If you are a fan of Simon Pegg because of films like SEAN OF THE DEAD or HOT FUZZ, then you might be a bit disappointed in this film. It isn't that it's a bad film but that the style is so different and it really isn't nearly as funny as these two previous films. In addition, this is certainly not a movie I would have wanted to see in the theaters, but it's more of a movie to rent or watch if you happen to have Showtime. In other words, it's a pleasant little time-passer...just not much more.The story is about a cowardly jerk that left his pregnant girlfriend at the alter. This and the first 1/3 of the film really make you hate Pegg--he is very unlikable. Selfish and whiny--as well as cowardly. It's also hard not to turn off the film because he's such a jerk. However, soon after his ex-girlfriend introduces her new boyfriend (Hank Azaria), Pegg is filled with jealousy--especially when Pegg's son seems to perhaps like the new guy more than him. So, just to keep up, Pegg announces that he, too, will be running in a charity marathon--even though it's only two weeks until the race and Pegg is really out of shape.What happens next and how Pegg's character grows is all straight by-the-numbers. There are absolutely no surprises here at all, though the ride along the way is pleasant. And, when 'Mr. Perfect' (Azaria) blows up near the end and shows his dark side, this, too, seemed quite predictable. But, the characters are endearing (particularly Pegg's Indian neighbor) and the film has a nice feel, so you can't help but finish the film--and perhaps end it with a smile. However, don't expect any magic or major surprises.",6,1,4,27 June 2009
Ford v Ferrari," It's okay.
","'Ford v Ferrari' is a film that has a very high overall score of 8.1...meaning that folks love the movie. As for me, I don't share this same level of enthusiasm. To me, it's an okay film with some nice driving sequences. I prefer films like 'Le Mans' or 'Grand Prix'...mostly because the ending isn't as obvious and fore-ordained. In other words, if you know about the history of the famed Ford GT, you KNOW how well it did in the race that takes up almost half of this film. Still, the driving sequences are nice (not done with CGI) and the actors try their best....although the script occasionally (or more than occasionally) plays fast and loose with a few of the facts. Overall, very watchable but not a great history lesson and a film where you KNOW that the GT will eventually prove better than the Ferrari...otherwise, what would be the point of this film?!",6,1,4,8 May 2020
The King's Speech," Yeah, it's really, really good...what else would you expect?
","By the time I've gotten to see thing film, a bazillion others have already seen in a a huge number have already reviewed it on IMDb. So, frankly, by now, what more do I have to say? The film IS exceptional--well-made, compelling and worth your time. And, not surprisingly, it won a huge number of Oscars. Is it the very best of the film nominated in 2011? Maybe, maybe not--but even if it isn't the very best, it's certainly close. As for all the film I've seen that were nominated for Best Picture it's at least my second favorite--right behind 'The Black Swan' and just ahead of 'Winter's Bone'. The bottom line is that Colin Firth did a marvelous job--as did Geoffrey Rush. It's wonderfully entertaining, well made and does something rare for a film--it humanizes the monarchy. I could say a lot more, but as I s a lot has already been seen about this lovely film.",9,3,7,24 April 2011
Despicable Me 2," Not as good as the first film due to little in the way of plot, it's still worth seeing just to watch the minions.
","I adored 'Despicable Me' and my wife and I could never agree which we liked more--that film or the similarly themed 'Mega Mind'. We liked them both but she preferred 'Mega Mind'. Regardless, both films are excellent and entertaining for all ages. Because 'Despicable Me' made a huge amount of money, it wasn't surprising that soon after they announced they were making a sequel. And, when the early teaser promos arrived in theaters, they stressed the minions and said nothing about the sort of story the sequel would be. This was, apparently, very prescient--as the film turned out to be exactly that--a film with a vague plot but which was worth seeing just for the antics of the minions. In fact, my wife decided to see 'Despicable Me 2' simply because she heard me laughing many times at the minions.The film picks up pretty much right after the first one. Gru has adopted the three little girls and they, along with the minions and Dr. Lethario, are one big, happy family. However, trouble is brewing. Some super-villain has stolen a top secret formula that transforms nice creatures into killing machines--and a top secret international organization approaches the ex-villain, Gru, to help the locate the formula. They give him a spunky female sidekick and eventually romantic sparks fly. As far as the secret formula and the villain are concerned, this really seemed secondary to the romance and antics of the minions--and this plot seemed to wrap itself up quickly and easily.As I said, the plot, for what it is, is minimal and seems to be just an excuse to watch the minions as well as the romance. And, for me, this was enough to justify recommending the film. Clearly not as good as the original, but filled with fun nonetheless.",6,0,0,28 February 2014
The Mask," Not for children...but very enjoyable.
","I have a friend in Italy that has been pestering me to watch 'The Mask'. Angelo thinks it's one of the best movies...ever! Well, while I don't match his level of enthusiasm, I did really enjoy the movie and think it's well worth your time...unless you are a kid. While the movie looks like a kids' film, there are too many adult jokes and kicks to the groin to make it a good movie for younger folks.Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a nice guy but also a total wimp who lets people walk all over him. Upon discovering a strange Norse mask and uncovers who you really are down deep, he becomes a Tex Avery-style cartoon character in the real world. Now, Stanley is part lover, part trickster...and he runs afoul of a gang intent on doing bad stuff. Can Stanley manage to stop the gang, save the girl AND stay out of jail??This film is enjoyable on a turn off your brain and enjoy level. It's filled with CGI, homages to various cartoons (such as 'Swingshift Cinderella') and is worth your time. And, in this case, Carrey was the perfect actor for the role due to his energy and athleticism.",8,6,12,26 October 2018
Saturday Night Fever," A film about a dumb guy whose shallowness reaches amazing depths!
","I think that your opinion about Saturday NIGHT FEVER may have a lot to do with your age. People who were of age during the Disco Age probably will love it. Older or younger people may feel less impressed. As for me, I was rather young during this disco craze and thought that the gold chains and unbuttoned polyester shirts were all pretty tacky--so the film doesn't hold the same wonderful nostalgic memory it might for others--though I will admit that I liked the music (yes, folks, it's true--I am so uncool that I actually like disco).As for the film, it is unusual in structure in that much of it is like a very prolonged music video. While this sort of film is more common today, in 1977 it must have been revolutionary to have such a meandering film that isn't always plot-driven. What was also unusual is that unlike most films, the main character is amazingly stupid and shallow--his friends are even worse. For Tony Manero (John Travolta), what matters most to him in life is his hair, his clothes and disco--and little else. As for his friends, their priorities would be drugs, sex, date rape, driving like idiots and disco. Not exactly a group of Einsteins, eh? This is a problem for folks like me, as I have a hard time really getting into a picture if I don't like anyone. My only emotional connection was feeling sad for the desperate women with low self-esteem that actually cared about this shallow guy or his obnoxious friends. Otherwise, I just didn't care about what happened to anyone--including his slap-happy family! While it probably sounds like I hated the film, there were some things I did like or at least respect. As I mentioned above, the music was nice--with one of the best soundtracks in movie history. While no one today admits to liking disco (other than nuts like me), it did produce the biggest-selling soundtracks in history. Plus, while I didn't love all the dancing, I sure could respect all the work that went into choreographing it and making it look so effortless. What Travolta and the rest did to get ready for the film is incredible. I just wish, however, that the film was less like the prolonged music video and was more plot-driven at times or had greater importance than 'who will be Tony's new dance partner?'! Of course, this shallowness might actually be a great metaphor for the era--an era typified by loud clothes, drugs, sex without consequences and Studio 54.Overall, an interesting time capsule hindered by characters that are mostly low-lifes and co-dependents.At one point in the film, Tony muses 'there are ways of killing yourself without killing yourself'. Wow, such amazing depth to his utter shallowness!",6,8,14,3 July 2009
Moneyball," But what if you don't like baseball films?!
","I would sure think that 'Moneyball' would have a very limited international appeal--especially in countries where they don't have professional baseball. And, even in the States, I can't see this as being an easy sell if the audience member is not a fan of the sport. While I have enjoyed some ball films, I am not a huge fan of pro sports--so keep this in mind when I say how underwhelmed I was by the whole thing. Much of this also is because the film has been nominated for six Academy Awards--one for Best Picture, one for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting Actor. So, I expected a lot and the film seemed to deliver less.This film is based on the real life general manager of the Oakland A's back in the early 2000s. He came up with a statistical system by which he was able to replace big-money free agents with lesser players and STILL win--all by applying a lot of statistical analyses. For fans of fantasy baseball, this will be of some interest. As for me, I just didn't care--mostly because with the huge salaries, teams that move at the drop of a hat and various scandals, pro sports lost me as a fan long ago--and I just didn't care who won or lost. Now IF Brad Pitt's character had seemed like a particularly compelling person, I might have cared...but he didn't.Overall, unless you are a big sports film fan, don't see the film or at least significantly lower your expectations. Pitt's and Jonah Hill's performances weren't bad...but both have done better work.",5,4,13,4 February 2012
Whip It," Not without quite a few plot problems, but it deserves kudos for daring to be different!
","I think it's important to point out that I am 45 years-old and I am sure my 'advanced age' has a big impact on my vote. Had I been a young hipster (grrr...hipsters!), then I am sure I would have enjoyed it much more--and I realize that I am NOT in the target demographic group for this film. Keep this in mind as you read this review.Ellen Page plays a high school student whose mother (Marcia Gay Harden) lives out her dreams vicariously through her and her younger sister. It is the mother who wants her daughters to be beauty pageant winners and puts all her hopes and dreams on the girls--even though clearly Page hates the life. But, as her mother is quite domineering, Page longs for a change but will never directly deal with her mom. Instead, she sneaks off and creates an alter-ego, 'Babe Ruthless'--an up and coming roller derby star!! Talk about going from one extreme to another!!! While this IS a truly original idea and hooked me, how it was executed caused a lot of problems for me. I mean absolutely no offense to Miss Page--who is a likable actress and quite reminiscent of MTV's 'Daria'. But, she seems very, very wrong for the part. She isn't pretty in that plastic and perfect way to be a believable beauty pageant contestant. While she is cute, her looks are just not the type for this life. And, as she appears to weigh about 95 pounds, she also is ridiculously cast as a derby participant--particularly since one good hit would most likely kill someone her!! However, I should point out that her character IS interesting. What isn't so interesting are a few of the supporting characters. Her best friend is very, very inconsistent and seemed to need a bit of a re-write. For example, late in the film, this 'friend' sulks off and blames her problems on Page--though this makes no sense and seems more like a plot device than anything else. It's like someone said 'wait...we need some conflict in this film....let's have the two girls have a falling out...and, by the end of the film, they can make up!!' (also known as cliché #15). And, while I liked some of the roller girls (such as Juliet Lewis and Drew Barrymore), some seemed a bit one-dimensional--such as the two deaf ladies.Still, while these complaints are important, the film gets a 'see it' vote from me--simply because the movie IS unique. And, also, while not believable, the film is nice mindless fun and can even be enjoyed by a middle-aged guy like me. Plus, I appreciated how Page's character dealt with the boyfriend at the end of the film--and not like some dishrag! Worth seeing but not life-changing.",6,3,7,12 May 2010
The Avengers," The world loves it, though I still think the original 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and 'Captain America' were my favorites.
","At this point, 'The Avengers' has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it's obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in 'The Avengers'. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",7,14,27,12 May 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very good, but not as much like 'Kill Bill: Vol.1' as I expected.
","I was very surprised when I saw this film, as I expected a movie that was roughly a continuation of what I'd seen in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1'. And, while the story does continue, the style and pace are very different--almost as if the follow-up was made by a different film maker. Now this does NOT mean that either is a bad film--it's just that 'Vol. 2' is so very different. I think the body count in 'Vol. 1' was about 1792134935947523 more or less, but in the second film very few people actually died--and very few at the hands of Uma Turman's character. In addition, the pacing is much slower and the music is good, but much more sedate--and it's very drawn out and deliberately paced. Personally, I prefer the first film--even if there is less depth to the story and many things are unanswered. In the second film, there is more story and depth to the characters--but it's less stylish and intense.Now I could discuss the plot or describe all I liked or didn't like about the film. However, there are already a butt-load of reviews for this film--too many to make any additional comments I could make particularly important. The bottom line is that the two films together make for an incredible viewing experience--but not one you really want to show to your children or mother-in-law!",9,1,6,13 February 2010
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," There are already almost 450 reviews, so I'll be brief...
","I went to the theaters tonight and saw 'Mockingjay: Part 1' and it's February...and the film came out in November. So, by now a whole heck of a lot has been said about the picture. Because of this, I'll try to be brief. I really liked the film. Well, perhaps I should say a bit more. For someone who has NOT read the books, it was a very enjoyable picture and kept my interest throughout. The acting, as usual, was really nice and once again Jennifer Lawrence did a great job in the lead. The film was filled with action and excitement. Before I went to see the film, I was a bit annoyed that the final book was split into two films. Is this shameless commercialism? Sure. But it seems like it will work--it certainly did in part one.",8,2,15,22 February 2015
Vertigo," Creepy and engaging.
","It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with 'Vertigo' is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.The film is the story of a somewhat creepy ex-cop (James Stewart). When the film begins, he's emotionally scarred in an accident-an accident that leaves him with a HUGE case of psychologically-based vertigo. He decides to quit the job and is soon approached by an old friend--who wants to hire him to follow his emotionally disturbed wife. What happens next is very weird--and later becomes really creepy. I could say A LOT more but think it's best you just see the film--it has quite a few twists and turns that are bound to catch you by surprise.Overall, a wonderfully original film. The only deficit, for some, is that although Stewart was a wonderful actor, he was too old for this role. Still, I could look past this and enjoyed it immensely.",9,5,7,31 August 2012
Black Swan," I can't believe the work that Natalie Portman put into this film and it's easy to see why she received the Oscar.
","By now, Natalie Portman has already won the Oscar for Best Actress for this film. And, because my oldest daughter adored this film and strongly recommended I see it (WITHOUT her due to the content of the film!), I decide to see it and am glad that I did. Natalie Portman's commitment to this film is incredible. Seeing the weight that she lost, the ballet moves she worked on and the wonderful acting, it's very obvious why she got the award.As for the film itself, I have got a STRONG warning! Before you consider watching the film think twice. The film is at times VERY adult--very adult. Even though there is no nudity per se, there sure is a lot of very graphic content and simulated sex--such that I could understand my daughter not wanting to see this movie with her dad!! Because there are so many other reviews at this point, I'll wrap it up quickly by saying that the film has a wonderful script for two main reasons. First, it's highly original--and I love originality. Second, from a psychological point of view, there are many possible interpretations and it's a great portrait of madness. At the very least, the leading lady is suffering from a SEVERE anxiety disorder as well as schizophrenia--a very, very bad combination to say the least! But I also love how, because the film is often shown from her point of view, you never are sure what is real and what is not--even when the film concludes. You are left wondering exactly what happened and what didn't--and that ambiguity might annoy some, but I appreciated this--mostly because most films explain EVERYTHING and assume the audience is too dumb to try to sort it out for themselves. An intelligently written, directed and brilliantly acted film. Exceptional.",9,14,23,12 March 2011
Changeling," Extremely hard to watch--think twice before you see this emotionally draining film.
","My summary is NOT to discourage you from watching the film--just to encourage you to think before you watch it. If you are easily disturbed or a child--by all means DON'T watch this movie. It earned its R-rating because it is so incredibly disturbing--very disturbing!! I was very surprised to see that this film was based on a real case that I had never heard about and which was apparently pretty much forgotten until the brilliant writer, J. Michael Straczynski learned of the case. A mother (Angelina Jolie) is called away to work and leaves her young son home along back in 1928. When she returns, the child is gone--with absolutely no trace of him. Five months later, a child is located in Illinois and brought back to the mother--but the child is NOT hers!! It seems that the LA Police are so intent on closing the case that they push a child in her lap and demand she accept it--even though the boy is now 3 inches shorter and has been circumcise!!! Insane as it all is, when she complains, the police try to sweep it all under the rug by shoving her into a mental asylum--which is more like a chamber of horrors than anything else!. There is much more to the story than this--a much darker and more disturbing plot than just seeing the inside of the mental hospital. But, because I don't want to spoil the plot, I'll say no more about this.The film excels in almost every way. Aside from a bit of dialog that seemed anachronistic, the film gets very high marks for an excellent script, wonderful directions, a great performance by Miss Jolie and great music--written by the director, Clint Eastwood. One other thing I loved about the film was John Malovich's character. He played a radio preacher who was NOT some hypocritical, evil self-aggrandizer--as so many preachers are portrayed in films. Instead, he was a good man and important to the plot--thanks for a positive portrayal instead of a clichéd attack on ministers! See this film--just be prepared for some horrifying images and themes.",10,3,13,11 February 2010
Come and See," exceptionally gritty and realistic
","This film was no fun to watch, nor should it have been considering it is about the Nazi atrocities in Belarus during WWII--as seen through the eyes of a young recruit for the partisans. This young boy appears to be about 12 or maybe 13, though through the course of the film, he ages what appears to be many years, though the action that occurs seemed to take place over just a few days. The movie was a solid recreation of the horrors and is good because it makes the faces and lives affected by this sick war so very real. Because of its content, it is not a film for children, though it probably is okay for teens provided you discuss the movie with them afterwards. No serious complaints about the movie at all, though it would have been nice if the German planes they used in the film weren't the same FW-189 reconnaissance aircraft over and over again--but this is the most minor of complaints--it was a great picture overall.",8,7,9,29 January 2006
Scarface," Unrelentingly vile
","I am sure that I'll probably get some nasty emails about this one, but I think SCARFACE might just be one of the worst movies of the last 25 years---especially since it is so adored by so many and been so readily accepted as a 'great film'. It is supposed to be an updated remake of the classic film of the same name from 1932 (starring Paul Muni). Despite this, the movie is sloppy and cheap. Instead of good writing and intelligent film-making, they hired Oliver Stone to write a hackneyed film. The result is a deliberate assault on the sensibilities by using the f-word again and again as well as using extreme and pointless violence throughout. It's easy to say 'f---' and the like and it's easy to have millions spent for special effects explosions and gunfire, but these alone do not constitute a good film, as the writing was almost absent in the film and it was just a giant over-the-top parody of gangster films. It's as if DePalma's mantra for the film is 'when in doubt, have Pacino say the f-word or have him kill some people'. Also, while some have praised Al Pacino's performance, to me it seemed like ridiculous self-parody--like a dirty version of the guy he played in DICK TRACy--which, at least, was SUPPOSED to be a cartoon. None of his brilliance from THE GODFATHER is present, as he plays a buffoon. There is absolutely no subtlety, no finesse and nothing of value in the film. In fact, and I know this will again prompt some nasty emails, I really think the film is intended for a stupid and undemanding audience who actually get off on this sort of brain-rot. Avoid this like the plague--your brain will thank you for this!Ed Wood, Jr. could have made a much better film had he been given this budget.",1,60,134,8 June 2007
Love and Death," funny but,....
","I think this film marks the beginning of Woody Allen's attempt to be seen as an intellectual film maker. Up until this movie, his movies were often pretty silly--even dopey at times. And he was great at being dopey--producing some movies that were jam-packed with laughs. However, in this film we see SOME of his previous silliness but it is now combined with references to Russian literature that only Russians, intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals would understand. For the first time, he shows that he is beginning to lose his audience--his 'regular' fans. References to Uncle Vanya, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy will no doubt go right over the heads of fans who were used to a different brand of humor. While the film is NOT devoid of laughs, they are fewer and the overall message from Allen seems to be 'wow--I'm funny AND an intellectual'. I guess I'm not an intellectual, then.",6,4,15,22 March 2006
Frost_Nixon," Exceptional--especially for Langella's dynamite performance.
","What I am about to say may sound a little mean. However, until recently I never took Frank Langella all that seriously as an actor. With film credits like 'And God Created Woman' (1988), 'Masters of the Universe' and 'The 12 Chairs', I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However, here in 'Frost/Nixon' he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wrong--he is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderful--especially when it COULD have come off as a parody--like Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But, he was able to capture the man very well--and, provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.As for Michael Sheen, who co-starred and played David Frost, he was excellent as well--but he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon character--even if they dislike him.As for the movie, it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me, I'm a retired history teacher, so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned, I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So, when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the cover-up are discussed, it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this, reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.Looking at the film's box office receipts, I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all, the acting and writing certainly were not at issue--they were top-notch. And, I must also admit, the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies (you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end, but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd). An amazingly good film.",9,5,5,12 September 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Great provided you are not a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan or watch the film with one!
","I went to see this film with my anime and Diana Wynne Jones-loving teenage daughter. And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it! It was as if we saw two entirely different films. Why? Well, she is a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan and has read and re-read just about everything she ever wrote. And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki. However, my advice is DON'T read the book and just go and see the movie. Then, after enjoying it, read the book ONLY if you are 100% sure you can do this without freaking out because they are so different!! I didn't know the difference and had a great time seeing the film!",8,6,9,11 June 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wildly uneven and a bit cruel
","This is a very difficult film to review since there is absolutely nothing like it. Sacha Cohen perpetrated a hoax by traveling across America claiming to actually be a visitor from Kazakhstan. However, instead of begin a documentary, it was a comedy in which Cohen acted like an obnoxious idiot and filmed how people reacted to him. In other words, most of the participants had no idea it wasn't a documentary and most of those on film appeared to be exceptionally patient with Cohen--even when he behaved like a boorish idiot (such as when he and his 400 pound friend ran naked through a hotel or pretended to become 'born again' at a Pentacostal revival meeting). In some ways this was very funny and in others very cruel. Because of this, at times I laughed loudly but others I was just too uncomfortable and felt sorry for the people who were tricked into being in the film. As far as the humor goes, it was wildly uneven. Some was extremely funny and on target. Other portions were exceptionally crude and really seemed intended to make idiots laugh.Sadly, despite being rated R and having LOTS of adult content, kids at the school where I teach saw it in huge numbers. I am NOT one to blame the movie, however, as it made no pretenses about being a family film. It was crude, offensive and very adult and this was not kept a secret when it was marketed. However, parents just didn't bother exercising reasonable judgment and many pre-teens were taken to see a movie I would have been embarrassed to take my teens to see. Bad parenting should not be blamed on Fox Films or Cohen. So my advice is to see it--but DON'T let your kids. It's just too jam-packed full of crudeness. It's definitely an adult guilty pleasure.",6,3,8,7 September 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Despite a ton of smashing, this film actually was a tad dull...but watchable.
","Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren't all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal's theme park, The Island's of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.This film is a sequel (of sorts) and it's obvious from the beginning that the film has come after a lot of things have occurred. Bruce Banner is already the Hulk and how that all came to be was explored in the first film...or at least that's what I've been told. Oddly, he's in Brazil and perhaps he chose this nation because of their spiffy green flag. After a short time, the evil general (William Hurt) and his minions pounce on Banner and try to kidnap him. Not unexpectedly, Banner becomes Hulk and kicks butt. Later, they try the same thing repeatedly, but this time they give Tim Roth (why is an English guy playing a guy in the US Army, by the way--he certainly was no Rambo!) a series of injections to make him a super-soldier--and giving him a chance to defeat the Hulk. The only trouble is--who is going to control this new insanely dangerous nemesis.Despite my being a relative Hulk newbie, I was surprised that my opinion AND the opinion of both my daughters (including the comic book geek one) was pretty much the same. The film had some nice action but not a whole lot else. As for the rest of the film, it was a tad dull and the relationship with the girl really seemed to slow down the film. As a result, the film is a time-passer and not a whole lot more. I sure hope that the folks at Marvel think twice about all their many, many announced upcoming films. If you keep making mediocre super-hero films, you might just end up killing the genre. This is NOT a film of the same quality as 'Iron Man' or 'The Dark Knight' (yes, Marvel fans, I know this is a DC franchise--back off, nerd-boys!!!).",6,4,13,24 July 2010
Requiem for a Dream," A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.
","Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.'Requiem for a Dream' is an exceptional movie and there's nothing else like it. However, it's a film that I am happy did not spur on other similar films, as it's also a visual assault on the senses and very difficult to watch...and I would hate to see film after film made like this Darren Aronofsky project. Using rapid intercutting (far, far more than normal) of scenes, fisheye lenses, exaggerated sound effects, shaking lenses, multipanes, television characters that come popping out of the screen and other strange gimmicks, he makes the viewer feel as if they, too, are stuck in the throes of addiction and, eventually, insanity! It's mesmerizing as well as unpleasant...and it's appropriately so considering the subject matter. In fact, I don't think a better film has ever been made about the hellishness of addiction...it sure captures it in all its vivid awfulness!In addition to the incredibly clever use of all these films techniques, the movie has a lot going for it. The script, though very episodic, works well...and is made all the better thanks to some amazing performances, particularly by Burstyn. My only complaint about the film, and it's very minor, is that Jennifer Connelly is just way too pretty to be playing a woman who is that addicted. Sure, over time she falls apart...but she still looks model beautiful during most of the film. She would have been better looking skankier...or an uglier actress might have worked better!So who would I recommend should see this film? Well, anyone who loves films and longs for something different should certainly see the film. Also, despite all the nudity, violence, vomiting and nastiness, I actually recommend parents consider showing it to their kids (especially if the teens have begun dabbling in drugs or thing it looks cool or fun). It will do far more to discourage them from using drugs than any pat message or sermonizing!! It shows drugs in all its sleazy awfulness....no holds barred. I challenge you to find a film THIS difficult to watch and effective when it comes to presenting the effects of drugs. I am not sure how the film received an R rating, as it seems more like something that should be NC-17. Horrible to watch...especially as the film progresses, so don't say you weren't warned!! By the end, I was in tears...I should note that the Etc (electro-convulsive therapy) they show in the film is similar to the type done decades ago. They do NOT do shock treatment like this today and it is a relatively benign sort of treatment for folks who simply won't respond to other treatments for depression...thank goodness.",10,4,9,23 August 2016
Your Name.," You wonder HOW the Academy didn't nominate this lovely picture...
","A few months ago when they announced the Oscar nominations for 2017, I was very surprised to see the French film, 'The Red Turtle', among the nominees for Best Animated Feature. After all, this strange film featured a plot involving a man who falls in love with a woman who used to be a turtle.and has also earned less than a million dollars at the box office worldwide. At the same time, the Japanese animated film, 'Your Name.', earned over $350,000,000setting box office records throughout Asia for a Japanese animated movie. It has even earned more than any of the films from the terrific Studio Ghibli.home of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki! Fortunately, 'Your Name.' is now playing in select markets throughout the United States and I was in Philadelphia this week.where I jumped at a chance to finally see this record-breaking yet inexplicably snubbed movie. If it's playing near you, I suggest you consider also seeing this lovely and rather adult picture. Now when I say 'rather adult', I do not mean it has any objectionable content. However, parents should understand that just because it is a cartoon does not mean that younger children should see it. They simply could not be expected to follow the plot, as the film is complex and clearly designed for teens and adults. As to the story, for some time it's a tad confusing.and that's okay as it will eventually all come together. It seems that Mitsuha and Taki are somehow psychically linked. When Taki goes to sleep, he finds himself as Mitsuha.which is a bit embarrassing for him since he is a teenage guy and Mitsuha is a teenage girl! But why.why is he experiencing Mitsuha's life? And, the strange part is that he soon learns that what he's experiencing happened several years ago!! And what does a comet have to do with this as well? How can Taki's strange dreams possibly save Mitusha and her small village? I'd say more, but don't want to reveal too much about the story. The quality of this film is very, very nice. I would not say that the animation is quite as good as a typical Ghibli picture, but it is close. But what makes this a delightful film are that it never tries to be cute or formulaic.it's a wholly unique viewing experience. It also is very well written and kept my interesteven though I was suffering jetlag! I saw the film in Japanese with subtitles, though the theater and many others are showing an English dubbed version as well. So, in this case, I actually had the choice which I wanted to seewhich was very unusual.",9,6,12,16 May 2017
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Good but a bit scary to this old fashioned father.
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is a good movie. However, as a father of two girls in college, watching this film is a bit tough for me, as I WANT to assume that real young people don't do drugs, stand up in fast-moving cars, have sex, or, well...have sex. But I also know this naive and although I would hate for younger teens to see this movie (as it might give them a sense that they should grow up too fast), it IS a good film. Far from perfect,...but a good film.The film is about a very insecure and withdrawn young man entering high school. He doesn't fit in and knows it. However, surprisingly, he does soon get taken into a small group of friends--friends who are seniors and mostly have a lot of hangups too. It takes place over this single year of high school and ends when the older friends go off to college.The film has a very smart script. Sometime, perhaps a bit too smart because too often the kids come off as a bit hipster-ish and too glib. But it is very enjoyable throughout and quite poignant--and deals with some VERY tough and complex topics--some of which are rarely ever addressed. While I don't think the movie is as wonderful as most (since it's in the IMDb Top 250 List), it is quite good and excellent for an audience 16 and up...well, perhaps 17 and up.",8,23,38,23 January 2014
The Sound of Music," My advice--Ignore reality and just enjoy.
","This review contains LOTS of spoilers. My advice is not to read my review at all, as it will no doubt hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful film! I mean it--DON'T READ ON.....I adored 'The Sound of Music' when I saw it for the first time when I was 16. I loved the film and was completely infatuated with Julie Andrews. Frankly, this isn't at all surprising as practically EVERYONE was in love with Julie Andrews after they watched the film! What wasn't to like?! The music was AMAZING, the story very romantic and the film uplifting throughout. However, I made a mistake. I loved the film so much that I read up on the real Von Trappe family--and it was little like the wonderful family in the film! The Captain was actually always a pretty nice guy and Frauline Maria wasn't exactly 'practically perfect in every way'! To make things MUCH worse, I traveled to Salzburg, Austria several decades later--and I learned THE TRUTH!!! The wonderful Von Trappe home in the film was actually a composite of about a half dozen different homes in the area! The gazebo was miles from the riverfront which was miles from the interior of the Von Trappe home--and the truth got worse! When we visited the cemetery where the family hid out at the end of the film, we were shocked (and VERY offended) at a memorial in this cemetery for the SS--the same folks that manned the death camps! All in all, this is a case where the truth really, really hurt. And, although I am a history teacher who loves historical accuracy, this is a case where I wish I'd never learned the truth. Heck, at the end of the film, you see the family escaping over the Alps to freedom--and in real life, they just took a train to Italy!! Hrmmph!!",9,7,16,22 May 2012
Source Code," Brilliantly inventive...and yet another wonderful film from Duncan Jones.
","During the last week, I've become a HUGE fan of Duncan Jones. That's because I saw his amazing sci-fi film 'Moon' (which he wrote and directed), his short 'Whistle' and his latest 'Source Code'. These three films, all super-well made and inventive, represent the three films Jones has so far made--and I can pretty much guarantee you'll see a lot more from him because these three films are simply amazing.I scored 'Source Code' a 9--which is actually not quite as high as I rated 'Moon', but the film sure came close to also getting a 10. The plot is so inventive and the film made so well that I can't see why it isn't scored higher than 7.5 on IMDb.When the film begins, Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a train heading into Chicago. He knows no one aboard and is NOT the person people think he is. He is, in fact, a soldier serving in Afghanistan--so how did he magically appear on the other side of the planet?!?! While this is only the beginning of the film, I will say no more because the film has one surprise after another--and I'd hate to ruin the film for you.In many ways, the film plays a lot like 'Inception', 'Groundhog Day' and a bit of 'The Sum of All Fears'. However, this is a great oversimplification--there is so much more to the film than this. Wonderful acting, wonderful direction and a thrill-a-minute script make this a must-see film. Really...you MUST see this film.",9,1,3,10 March 2014
Skyfall," If you love lots of stunts and action, you'll like this one.
","'Skyfall' is a good film and it made a buttload of money. Whether or not you love it will depend on how much you love stunts, explosions and chases. If you adore them and can't get enough of them, then this film is for you! It's more like 'Die Hard' in many ways than a traditional James Bond film. As for me, I don't particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn't a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn't boring.I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don't feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it's a decent film but nothing more.",7,3,15,21 March 2013
50 First Dates," Enjoyable despite a tough to believe plot
","50 FIRST DATES is a very enjoyable film--especially as a date movie. However, it's also a film that also has a plot that is completely ridiculous and unbelievable, so you really need to be able to put aside your critical side and just sit back and take the movie for what it is--a nice romantic-comedy.Adam Sandler is a tough actor to pigeonhole. On one hand, he's the guy who made such obnoxious comedies as LITTLE NICKY but on the other, he can make some enjoyable comedies (WATERBOY) and probably his best film was another romance starring Drew Barrymore, THE WEDDING SINGER. Considering how successful and sweet this film was, it's certainly not surprising that they'd return for another try.This time, the plot is very unusual to say the least. Adam plays a rather shallow womanizer who becomes totally infatuated with a woman who is just about impossible to get to love because she cannot remember anything that occurred after an accident. In other words, no matter how much he captivates her and makes her love him, when she awakens, she can't remember anything from the previous day. While brain damage can create an individual with impaired short-term memory, the way the illness is portrayed is pure fiction....as is the idea that any guy could see a future with anyone with such an injury. It's sure fun seeing Drew and Adam together, but you just can't take the plot seriously at all.My advice on this one is to watch it. And, if the plot is too much to handle, switch it off and try something else. However, if you stick with it, nice acting and a nice quirky romance might just make it worth your time. Oh, and guys, this is a great 'chick flick'--even if you don't like it, your special someone very likely will.",7,3,3,1 May 2009
The Young Victoria," A nice, loving portrait...
","As a history teacher, watching this sort of film is pretty natural. However, it was actually my youngest daughter and her obsession with the British monarchy that got me to watch this film. I am happy to report that this film was far better than I expected, as I usually HATE costume dramas because they are very dull and stuffy--with way too much emphasis on clothing. 'The Young Victoria' succeeds because it attempts to show the viewer insights into the personality of the princess--not just show you a series of events from her life that are re-created on screen.When the film begins, Victoria is still a year from ascending to the throne. How her mother and her mother's lover attempt to manipulate her is the subject of the beginning of the film. However, surprisingly, who will manipulate and control her next seems to be the gist of the rest of the film. But, as Victoria was a strong woman, over time, she learned to strike a balance and chart her own course. This was not without a few hiccups along the way, however, and a few of them are shown in the film--though one of the more famous blunders of the period involving a dead lady-in-waiting is skipped--mostly because the film just wasn't long enough to include this sticky business.Much of the last third of the film involves her marriage and learning to trust and rely on Albert to be her husband and confidant. I really liked this part of the film, as the movie became amazingly romantic and touching. According to the movie, Albert was one heck of a guy--knowing that he died extremely prematurely made this all the more touching.All in all, there is a lot to like in the film--even if it DID take a few liberties with the truth. For example, when an assassin tried to shoot his new bride, Albert is shown shielding her--which he DID do. However, in this and two subsequent attempts by other maniacs, Albert was NOT shot in the process! It made for better drama to have him shot--but it's just not true. But, we sure wish it was!! By the way, I'd sure like to see some followup films from this production company--perhaps the middle period of her reign would be a great subject for another film--though I am sure a few would be turned off by how utterly sad such a film must be, as her beloved Albert died at only age 42.",8,3,3,30 April 2010
The Hangover," I guess I am missing something with this film....
","I felt so out of touch with everyone when I got around to seeing this film. After all, it has a very respectable score on IMDb and a lot of folks seemed to like it--yet I found it about as enjoyable as dental surgery. Part of the problem might be that I only watched it because I was bored and on a cruise ship with a very limited selection of DVDs. Part of it might be because the day before (also out of boredom) I watched 'Hot Tub Time Machine'--and it was practically the same film.'The Hangover' is a story about four completely unlikable guys who seem more like caricatures than anyone you'd ever meet. In addition, they were so unlike each other you wonder if such friendships ever exist anywhere but in a Hollywood film. One is the guy who is about to get married--and wants to screw some hookers before he ties the knot (how heart-warming). One is a handsome school teacher who is just nasty and 100% unlikable. One is a screw-up and idiot--so they naturally make him the fat guy. And, the other is the man in a relationship with a castrating female. If these sound familiar, they were pretty much the same characters you'd see in 'Hot Tub Time Machine'--but even more one-dimensional and this is especially true for the last two characters I mentioned. They go to Vegas, accidentally ingest some of the date rape drug and do lots of insane things--little of which is particularly funny. And this is the problem with the film. If you laugh at very low-brow humor, don't mind that the plot makes no sense (such as the tasering scene) and think that a dirty word is THE punchline for most jokes, then you'll enjoy the film. As for me, I can enjoy a dopey film (such as 'Talladega Nights' or 'Strange Brew')--but there is a limit to dopiness. Plus, it's hard to stick with a movie when you simply don't care what happens to any of them. Overall, over-rated unlike any recent movie I have seen. Unpleasant, unfunny and for the undemanding.",3,8,14,29 July 2011
Iron Man 3," Decent, but it ain't no 'Iron Man'.
","I am sure that 'Iron Man 3' will make a ton of money and satisfy audiences. But, at the same time, it delivers something that is not the original 'Iron Man'—it's got more than the original and so much less. First the more—the film has more stunts, more CGI, more action and more explosions than ever before in the series. If that is what you're looking for, then you'll no doubt be satisfied. As far as less goes, the film has much less in the way of plot, characters and, especially, fun. Now I am not saying it's a bad film—but by this third film in the series (and the fourth appearance by Robert Downey Jr. as the lead) the formula is a bit faded. Good.but faded.By this installment, like his comic book character, Tony is a serious screwball. He rarely sleeps and has significant problems with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. And, at times, he seems more machine than man. Not surprisingly, his personal life is a mess. At the same time, two threats are looming—one by a brilliant but morally suspect inventor (Guy Pearce) and another from a lunatic seemingly modeled after Osama Bin-Laden (Ben Kingsley). While the Pearce plot is much more important to the film, I really liked what they did with Kingsley, as this was an injection of humor—and the film needed all it could get. In fact, Kingsley's character and performance is my favorite thing about the movie. Now the cute is isn't bad, either, but he did seem a bit like a cliché. The bottom line is that Tony needs to come, once again, to the aid of the world and in the process there are fifty bazillion stunts, explosions, MANY situations in which he could not possibly survive (yet he doeswhich makes little sense) and a lot of 3-D. Now the 3-D portion bothered me, as it really wasn't necessary for the film and didn't enhance or detract from my viewing at all. If I had the choice, I'd probably see the normal version simply because it's cheaper.Oh, and by the way, where are the great AC/DC tunes? Instead, the soundtrack is okay but features songs by Dwight Yoakim. I am sure Yoakim is a nice guybut he's not AC/DC. So, in summary, I wanted more humor, less explosions, more plot and more AC/DC. If we can't have that, perhaps this should be the last film in the series—and the end does hint that that COULD be the case.maybe.",7,7,13,19 June 2013
Spartacus," ALMOST great
","What a wonderful film! It, along with PATHS OF GLORY and DR. STRANGELOVE, are my favorite Kubrick films. However, while I could find no fault with the other two films, there is ONE flaw that prevents this movie from being truly great: it just didn't know WHEN to end. When the Romans capture the rebels and announce that they will kill Spartacus but spare the others if they turn him over, the movie SHOULD have ended just AFTER all the rebel slaves stood up and announced 'they were Spartacus'. This would have made this movie PERFECT. Instead, it drug on for another 20-30 minutes trying to needlessly tie up all the loose ends. It was as if Hollywood would not allow the movie to end any other way.Just imagine the impact of ending the movie earlier followed by scenes of the thousands of impaled rebels as the closing credits rolled!!As for the rest of the film, the acting and screen writing were superb--as good as it gets.",9,7,18,25 May 2005
It," Not at all the type of film I usually watch...but I did enjoy it and am glad I saw it.
","Of all the different genres of films, I think modern horror is probably my least favorite. I love old horror films...mostly because they aren't extremely graphic and leave a lot to the imagination. But this is a case which proves I can be won over by a violent modern horror pic. The only reason I saw this one at all is because my daughter wanted to see it...and I didn't wanna disappoint her.I am not going to make this review long...as there are nearly 800 for this hit film already. Suffice to say, the movie is scary, the story very good (the things omitted from the book are generally best not being in the film) and I enjoyed the heck out of the picture. Who knows...maybe I don't hate the genre...just the brainless teens begin slaughtered at the abandoned amusement park/roller disco by a guy in a hockey mask sort of film.",9,8,15,26 September 2017
Casablanca," A perfect film.
","Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people.",10,9,17,30 December 2008
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Cruella is what makes this film so good.
","I have always thought that the animation and story of '101 Dalmatians' were actually a bit weak. After all, a crazy lady who wants to steal puppies to make them into a coat ISN'T especially deep. And, the xerox process they used in this film did make the movie look a lot cheaper than the exquisitely animated films of the 1950s. But what makes it very good and well worth watching is the character Cruella De Vil. Her voice work by Betty Lou Gerson was just fabulous--and very obviously inspired by Tallulah Bankhead. Her mannerisms, style and voice were Ms. Bankhead all the way--but with a wonderful insane quality that made a horrific act (slaughtering puppies) so ridiculously comical that it was watchable and fun. Otherwise, this film would have been seen as cruel and just awful. Plus the 'Cruella' song was a hoot--with great lyrics and a perfect accompaniment to this horrid character.The bottom line is that I nearly scored this one a 9--it's awfully good. But having the sub-standard animation brought it down a point. Enjoyably sick and funny--even for adult audiences.",8,6,7,27 January 2014
Finding Neverland," Charming and creepy....a strange combination.
","creepy--especially when seen today treated own wife horribly--very selfish Barrie was VERY successful before Peter Pan Like most bio-pics, 'Finding Neverland' plays a bit fast and loose with the facts in order to build a better story. Now this film is NOT completely made up but if you study about J.M. Barrie's life, you'll see it does differ quite a bit from the film. For example, Barrie knew Mr. AND Mrs. Davies quite well and they lived much longer than they did in the movie. Additionally, you'd get the impression that Barrie was a failure as an author before he created Peter Pan, but he was highly successful and well thought of before Pan. But, to make a greater sense of tension, the film changed the facts here and there. So, as you watch, keep this in mind.The film begins with Barrie's (Johnny Depp) most recent play flopping. At about the same time, he meets a young widow, Mrs. Davies (Kate Winslet), and her young sons at the park and befriends them--particularly the boys. They become playmates (which is pretty creepy if you think about it) and they behave almost like a family--which is really bad for Mrs. Barrie--who is left at home to fend for herself. Not surprisingly, people begin to talk--both about him spending time with a woman other than his wife as well as his preference to spending his time with young boys. Considering our present sensibilities, this isn't at all surprising that people would talk and that the Barrie marriage would crumble. Much of the rest of the film concerns his production of the play 'Peter Pan' as well as the decline of Mrs. Davies and future of her sons.If you completely divorce this film from reality and simply enjoy it for what it is, then you'll most likely enjoy the film very, very much. The acting is quite nice, as are the costumes, sets and music. The writing, though not always accurate, was also very good because it really stirs up a lot of feelings in the viewer--and as a result, it's enjoyable throughout. It's a shame they didn't trust the complete and true story, though, and that's why I give this very high quality production a score of only 7.",7,1,1,9 January 2013
In Bruges," A film loved by many and offensive to many more
","WARNING--The language in this review is like the language in the movie--just not gratuitous!Colin Farrell plays an assassin who is pretty much like 'Father Dougal' from the 'Father Ted' television series, though he also is sadistic and thoroughly unlikable and obnoxious. Brendan Gleeson (from the Oscar-winning short SIX SHOOTER) plays a less obnoxious murderer. These are the two 'funny' heroes of this film.According to IMDb 'The word 'fuck' and its derivatives are said 126 times in this 107-minute film, an average of 1.18 'fucks' per minute'. To me, this combined with the fact that the leading men are assassins, is more than enough reason to hate this film. While at times it seemed pretty clever and even interesting, I found everyone so repellent and stupid that I just couldn't stick with the film. Life is too short to watch crude films like this and I hate films where there is no one to care about at all. Although this film IS in the IMDb top 250, I can assume that this is a film you'll either love or hate--but probably mostly love. If you are a rather traditional guy like me, you'll be irritated by the sloppiness of injecting the f-word into every other sentence and see it as not just offensive but poor writing. Any idiot can say obscenities again and again--this isn't a sign of brilliance but of inadequacy and this seems to be the recent trend in other supposedly 'great' films. And, making hateful heroes is a sure way to drive away many in the audience. Truly a film you either love or hate.",2,21,65,26 January 2009
John Wick," Probably NOT a film to watch with your kids or mother.
","When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.To say 'John WIck' is a violent film is a gross undestatement. Once the dog dies, it's pretty much a bloodbath from then on...with Wick dispatching countless goons VERY realistically on his way to ultimate revenge. And, he doesn't just kill a few...he makes sure to kill them by double and triple-tapping his prey. Blood and mayhem make this a lousy film to show your kids, mother or Father O'Reilly when he comes over for a visit!So, aside from being a bloodbath, is it any good? Yes, it's an excellent all-action film...but....it IS hard to watch and is essentially a giant gore-fest. In many ways, it's like the Sonny Chiba 'Street Fighter' films....that violent and that dedicated to making sure all the victims are indeed dead! Mindless violence....albeit well choreographed violence. Not really my sort of film...perhaps it will be yours.",7,1,4,10 September 2019
Kung Fu Panda," Entertaining and quite beautiful
","I had the fortune of seeing this film the same day I saw another Dreamworks film in the theater--MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. Because of this experience, I think I enjoyed KUNG FU PANDA much more, as by comparison it was a much better film. In fact, though the Oscar folks would heartily disagree, I even enjoyed it more than last year's Oscar winner, WALL-E. That's because while these other films looked exceptionally nice, KUNG FU PANDA actually looked as good but offered a lot more entertainment and fun. Sure, it wasn't as deep as WALL-E, but it was enjoyable and didn't try to be a message film. And MONSTERS VS. ALIENS had a great idea, but the laughs were rather sparse.The film is essentially a story about a young panda learning that he has a lot of heart and skills deep within--in other words, it was a lot like THE KARATE KID. But it also had a lovely artistry that I admired---the scenery and style looked very Chinese (although too many voice actors were non-Asians).I could say a lot more, but now it's a year after the film debuted and there are a bazillion reviews already. Suffice to say that I was surprised that I liked this film so much--it made me smile and was fun from start to finish.",9,1,1,24 May 2009
Chinatown," A very nice, if imperfect, homage to Film Noir
","While I know that CHINATOWN has a great reputation and has received many 10s from reviewers, as a fan of Film Noir, I saw a few minor problems that kept the score from being a bit higher--though it's still an exceptional film. First, as any devoted fan of Noir knows, Noir is always, and I repeat, always filmed in black and white. The great shadows and camera angles are an important trademark of the style. While this Roman Polanski film is beautifully filmed (with a lot of sepia tones) and it definitely has the look of a late 1930s Warner Brothers gangster film, it just isn't true Noir because it's in color! Second, and this is a problem shared by THE BIG SLEEP, is that the plot is very, very complicated--perhaps a bit too complicated--making the resolution of mysteries and complications a bit too simple. The end, in particular, just seemed too convoluted a solution and left a lot of loose ends. BUT, getting past these factors, the film is still exceptional. Jack Nicholson was terrific and so was the rest of the cast. And the film was definitely interesting and exciting. It's definitely one of the better films of the 1970s--but I just can't see this as a better film than many of the earlier Noir films, such as THE KILLERS, KISS OF DEATH or DOA.",8,3,12,26 April 2007
A Star Is Born," A lot of folks simply need to see earlier versions of this story.
","After the 2018 remake of 'A Star is Born', I heard a bazillion different people talk on and on and on about how amazing this film was. However, after seeing it, I realize that none of these folks saw the earlier (and much better) versions of the film...such as 'What Price Hollywood?' or the 1930s and 50s version of 'A Star is Born'. All three* are vastly superior and I think most of it is because they come off as more a fairy tale--a nice tale about success and failure. In the newest version, however, the story seems more real...and more pathetic and difficult to watch as a result.Overall, I challenge you to watch an earlier version and then you'll realize that aside from hearing Lady Gaga sing a few nice tunes, there really isn't any improvement on the original story in this remake.*There also was a version with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson--which I have not seen, so I cannot compare it to the others.",4,3,10,4 November 2019
Gravity," Absolutely unique and spellbinding.
","I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a score of 1. I just don't get this, as 'Gravity' is one of the most creative and visually striking films I've ever seen. The only film that reminds me of it, somewhat, is 'Avatar'--where an entire world is created digitally--much like in 'Gravity'. However, 'Gravity' is very much unlike 'Avatar' is most every other way and represents an interesting 'what if' scenario in this near-future sci-fi film.The date in which the film is set is uncertain but is sometime in the near future. In this near future, the International Space Station is still in use, the Chinese Space Station is up and running and the Americans once again have a shuttle program.The film begins with an American space mission in progress. A scientist (Sandra Bullock) is working on fixing her pet space project while being overseen by an experienced astronaut (George Clooney). Without warning, a series of explosions emanating from a Russian satellite create a chain effect--launching space debris everywhere and destroying the shuttle and severely damaging the two nearby space stations. Unfortunately, at this point only the two astronauts are left alive--but not for long unless truly extraordinary events take place that allow them to return to Earth.I was worried that I'd find the film boring. After all, 13 minutes into the movie, you are left with two living characters--and you see no others for the duration of the film. Yet, inexplicably, the script and direction keep the film from being dull. There are no lulls--and the action and acting really work well together and suck you into the film. I have rarely felt as tense as I did as I watched the movie and many times I found myself moving about in my seat along with the action.Technically, the film was amazing. Using the actors' faces, a CG world was created that looked real. You really felt that it was filmed in space and the physics were really awesome. I rarely use words like 'awesome' or 'amazing' in my reviews--but this IS the only way to describe the technical prowess of the film. While I am sure physicists and rocket scientists could spot a few flaws here and there, the film makes it all seem so plausible and real that I cannot help but admire and love the film.Do yourself a favor--see this film and try to see it on the big screen.",10,14,25,28 February 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Excellent propaganda comedy
","During and just before WWII, there were a lot of propaganda films created by Hollywood to drum up morale in our fight against Fascism. Nearly all of them were deadly serious war films. And, while many of them were great, after a while they all tended to blend together. Because of this, TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a real standout picture. The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so well-made as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand (among others). However, the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role (along with the wonderful Carole Lombard). For years, Benny made fun of his acting and the movies he made, but he was great and the film was great. Aside from the rather dopey HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT, in fact, I really like the few films he made.All-in-all, a fine and fun film--chock full of quality.",9,7,20,18 March 2006
The Death of Stalin," Far better than I expected.
","'The Death of Stalin' is a somewhat fact-based film. In other words, it tries its best to recreate the events around the time of Stalin's death, though the sources aren't exactly unbiased or 100% truthful....and sometimes the writers needed to infer what was said and done behind closed doors. Look at it as the best guess as to the events instead....and in this sense and many others the movie is marvelous and very well made.
The story begins shortly before Stalin's death from a cerebral hemorrhage. The machinations before and especially after are what is intriguing about the story....and how various evil scum surrounding Stalin all vied for power after his demise. It culminates with a very vivid and bloody scene...of a man who truly deserved his fate but watching it is NOT for the faint of heart.Apart from a bit of violence that might be off-putting (after all, the Stalinist regime was one of the most brutal and bloody in history), the film is a delight to watch. Excellent acting, amazing makeup and an interesting story all work together to make a really exciting film...well worth seeing.",9,1,4,14 April 2020
Mulan," I really liked this Disney flick that seemed to slip between the cracks
","In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult.",9,25,28,10 June 2007
Se7en," Very well made, but....
","I think the audience for 'Se7en' is rather self-selecting. If you don't mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural I'd get to it sooner or later.As for the film, I won't say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy.",9,5,11,20 January 2015
Wayne's World," way too conventional
","Despite its popularity, I didn't enjoy this movie. Mostly because as a 'wacky' comedy, it's awfully conventional and doesn't make me laugh. I know many people LOVED this movie, but I just didn't.If I want a wild and weird comedy, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Producers, Start the Revolution Without Me and Strange Brew are all a lot more fun and a lot more bizarre.Prat of the problem for me might be that I was never much of a fan of the skit on SNL. I though it was only okay and didn't merit an entire movie. Another SNL skit that was turned into a movie that had a more entertaining movie was The Coneheads. But, based on ticket sales, what do I know?!",3,2,14,12 June 2005
The Big Lebowski," A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!
","I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.",9,4,12,28 January 2010
Star Trek," Not for the Star Trek purists, but it's still enjoyable.
","I have seen all the Star Trek shows and movies, so I am well aware of how all the shows fit together. However, this new Star Trek movie really doesn't concern itself with fitting as much as capturing the interest of a new generation of film goers. Because of that, while the show has many similarities to the old, it actually ends up re-writing the series because, based on this movie, everything to come is actually re-written. In the Star Trek of the original series, The Next Generation, the movies, etc. there will no longer be a planet Vulcan and the Romulans will also cease to exist--as Vulcan was destroyed mid-way through this film and the coming destruction of Romulus is shown as well. For the Trekkies out there, this is heresy. They will say 'Spock's mom CAN'T die in this film--I saw her in 'Journey To Babel' episode in the original series AND this series is supposed to come AFTER this Star Trek movie. All this is very true, but most newer fans will care less. Plus, some of the older fans may accept the notion of Romulans from the future going back in time to destroy Vulcan--thus undoing much of what we saw over the years.I could go on and describe the plot but frankly, with a bazillion reviews already for the film, what's the point?! Let's talk about the technical and story aspects of the film. Despite being told that the film was character-driven, I still think the film relied too much on special effects. They were gorgeous and it's obvious they spent a fortune to make the film. The problem, though, is that since all the crew members are brand new to the ship and don't know each other, there is no chemistry between them as of yet. This is something they'll have to create in future films--and hopefully they won't forget to do this. Now, there are just germs of what these characters will eventually be. It's nice to see that they remembered characters like Christopher Pike and the rest, too. What I don't understand, though, and it just didn't seem to fit was this odd romantic pairing of Uhura and Spock. Where did this come from anyway?! There was no hint of this on the show and having the emotionally controlled Spock in the clinches with her made no sense. Now, having the galactic horn-dog Kirk try, on the other hand, was believable--very believable! From a 40-something guy who loved the shows, I only mildly liked the movie. It's not for the die-hard purists but is entertaining and fun...and probably more for younger and more forgiving audiences.",8,4,20,13 June 2009
Fight Club," Impossibly overrated and unsettling
","Edward Norton and Brad Pitt form a very strange bond that seems, at times, like it has strong sadomasochistic and gay undertones. They both get off on fighting and at times there seems to be a very odd chemistry between them. During the course of their friendship, Pitt shows Norton how to be more and more and more bizarre and wrapped up in a weird hobby they created, the 'Fight Club' where testosterone-hyped idiots experience the joy of beating each others' brains in so they can prove their manliness. However, as the film progresses, the club becomes more like a club for anarchists and Norton begins to question where they are headed.This is a movie that had lots of interesting little touches and twists. However, in many cases, they were very cool but also didn't particularly make much sense. The last 20 minutes of the film in particular is really cool--but it just doesn't make sense psychologically and seemed more interested in wowing the audience instead of ringing true. Because of this, I felt that this cult film is impossibly overrated--especially since it's now #25 all-time on IMDb! I won't spoil the surprises, don't worry but suffice to say that by the movie is finished you have absolutely no idea what actually happened.As a high school teacher, I also was alarmed that this film actually encouraged the growth of a sick subculture. A group of boys in my school started their own 'fight club' and took great pleasure in proving their manliness. I guess if they didn't get off by hurting each other UFC-style, they'd have to 'prove' their manliness by shooting bunnies or some other mindless guy way--but I hate to see that supposedly civilized people LIKE the idea of watching others become hurt.Additionally, the film is packed with some of the most brutal violence you'll find on celluloid and there is tons of nudity, sexuality and terrorism--just the sort of stuff you'd never want your teens to watch. Unfortunately, among teenage boys, this film is practically a 'must-see'. Parents, exercise some common sense and keep this nihilistic and cruel film away from your kids. If you want to see it yourself, fine, since you probably WON'T be tempted to imitate it. Kids will---I can attest to that.",6,29,95,11 September 2008
Akira," good but not great
","Before reading this review, understand that I am over 40 and am not an avid anime fan. I have watched MANY anime movies (my daughter is NUTS about anime) but my primary interest is in Japanese movies (such as those by Akira Kurasawa---a DIFFERENT 'Akira' from the one in this movie). So, look at my review in this light.Artistically, this movie is brilliant. When I was a kid, Japanese animation meant crap such as KIMBA or SPEED RACER--very choppy style animation and in their American form ONLY for the kids! Calling that old stuff AND this movie 'anime' seems like a disservice because of this. Instead of poor backgrounds and extremely low frame-rates that made the shows look more like slide shows than cartoons, Akira abounds with high quality animation, backgrounds, intense sounds and action! This is certainly NOT 'your father's anime'.So why only a score of 7? Well, the story is incredibly confusing---even for anime. I felt like I needed a script so I could logically follow along or that MAYBE the translation into English subtitles was flawed (I've seen this ruin several movies before).In addition to being totally confusing, the main characters are unlikable street thugs. It's hard to get into a movie when you just don't like ANYONE (well, maybe I liked the one freaky kid who had neat mental powers).But, for lovers of anime and anyone who wants to see an incredibly intense and high quality Japanese animation movie, this will definitely be a must-see. HOWEVER, I STRONGLY WARN PARENTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO LET THEIR KIDS SEE THIS. The movie, is at times, intense and gory AND features one attempted rape that gets pretty graphic! If you aren't sure if your kids are ready, they probably aren't!",7,5,14,30 June 2005
As Good as It Gets," Well, I certainly can say I've never seen a film like this before!
","Several years ago, my wife watched 'As Good As It Gets' and she told me she didn't like the film. So, I avoided it for years....and now I wish I hadn't listened to her. I loved the film---just don't tell her I said so! The film, to me, was perhaps a bit different experience than it would have been for the average viewer. As a former psychotherapist, I kept trying to analyze Jack Nicholson's character in order to understand the story better. He appeared to either have a variety of personality disorders--including an avoidant personality (where he pretends to HATE everyone and pushes them away to avoid being hurt), an obsessive-compulsive personality (or perhaps an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and probably a nice dose of either Asperger's or was just socially retarded. Regardless, this sort of person would NORMALLY live a very solitary and sad existence. However, the film manages to make it seem believable that a man like this could change...some...as well as find love. It's all very improbable but also very charming and sweet. And, later in the film rather oddly romantic. Additionally, the film is, at times, rather funny. Overall, a quirky and well-written film with some terrific acting.A lot of other stuff has been written about this multi-Oscar-winning film....so I'll just end by saying my wife is 100% wrong...but I still think she's terrific.",9,7,9,19 February 2013
Darkest Hour," Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance.
","At this point, 'Darkest Hour' has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film.",10,342,429,24 October 2017
The Birth of a Nation," sad relic of racism
","First, I want to point out that just about every nation on Earth has struggled with racism and this review is not intended to slam the USA. Second, though this film was one of the very earliest full-length films and it has absolutely amazing battle scenes and production values, you cannot admire them and turn a blind eye to the rest of the film.I just read an idiotic review on IMDb that indicated they liked the film and it was essentially true! Huh?! I am an American History teacher and I can assure you this 'true' movie is complete hogwash and a horrible testimony to our country at the time that this WAS widely regarded as truth.Here's the problem--nearly all the black roles are played by white people in black makeup. And, when the South loses the war, these 'uppidy black folk' then run amok trying to rape the white women, subvert the rule of law and spend most of the time eating watermelons and dancing to banjo music (I kid you not--this REALLY is in the film). So, according to D. W. Griffith's view of the Reconstruction Era is that the blacks took control of the legislatures and went mad with power until the honorable KKK came to the rescue!!! The most awful scene involves sweet and innocent Lillian Gish being repeatedly approached for sex by a black man. He will not take 'no' for an answer and eventually she jumps to her death rather than to be defiled by a Negro! My heart cringes just writing this!So, my overall verdict is this is a horrid film with wonderful production values. Also, and this may sound stupid I know, I recommend you DO watch this film! First, because how can you know about how far we have come as a people without knowing our past. Second, the idea that repellent images and movies should somehow be censored is repugnant--burying your head in the politically correct sand is just silly. But, for the love of God, DON'T TAKE THIS TO BE FACTUAL! If you do, I feel very sorry for you. And if you know someone who takes this for truth, set them straight.FYI--When this movie debuted, the KKK was practically dead in America. Thanks, at least in part, the KKK soon became one of the strongest political forces in the country--all the way through the 1920s. This is sad but true.",3,25,52,23 May 2006
The Maze Runner," Rather nasty...
","It seems that Hollywood is always looking for the next franchise film series aimed mostly at young adults. Following in the wake of the 'Harry Potter' films, other series were quickly put into production to see if they could be the next billion dollar franchises. Some, such as the 'Golden Compass' simply fizzled whereas 'Twilight' and 'The Hunger Games' hit pay dirt. In light of these big bucks, it's not surprising that 'Maze Runner' would make it to the screen, since it's just the first of three books--three books which seem strongly inspired by 'The Hunger Games'...only a bit gloomier. And, given that it's already earned about three times its cost just here in the States, it's not surprising that the sequel is due to be released next September.So is the film any good? Well, it looks nice. Other than that, no. It's violent and nihilistic without the interesting social commentary or originality that you get from the 'Hunger Games' films. Instead, it's just ultra-violent and nasty--with scores of teens being killed for our entertainment. Plus, in the 'The Hunger Games' films you have plucky and likable characters with some depth, but in 'The Maze Runner' they seem much more flat and ill-defined. In other words, they're mostly just there to be killed or survive but little else. Overall, it's a film with little depth, lots of nasty mayhem and a cast of cute boys meant to appeal to the same folks who love 'Twilight'.",3,1,7,21 January 2015
Memento," Intriguing idea--but #26 on IMDb??!?!?!?!
","Huh? Talk about an unreliable score for a film! Unfortunately, IMDb is very, very, very skewed by recent movies. So many older great films have very few reviews or have generally lower scores--not because they are worse than newer films, but because there is a bias against older films because SOME reviewers are teens or people who simply won't consider anything that was not made in the last decade or so. Likewise, there is often a strong bias only for Hollywood blockbusters, even though many foreign or 'small' films deserve recognition but are ignored because people just refuse to try something outside their comfort zone. This is a real shame, as there is just so much more out there. While MEMENTO is a decent and very unconventional film (I sure respect them for trying something DIFFERENT), it isn't great when viewed in context.Okay, so you may think I am just some crazy crank who is totally negative! Well, this might be true (the verdict is still out), but of the IMDb top 250, over 30% were made just in the last two decades. Also, films like THE WALLACE AND GROMIT movie, MAGNOLIA, FINDING NEVERLAND and V FOR VENDETTA make the top 250 and yet films like MARTY, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US, SHOW PEOPLE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, BANSHUN, THE CAINE MUTINY, CAPTAIN BLOOD, MY MOTHER'S CASTLE, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DINNER AT EIGHT, DODSWORTH and ELMER GANTRY don't make this list (among others). It's sort of the like the expression 'out of sight, out of mind'--if a film isn't recent or make a ton of dough at the box office, it's chances of making the list are very low indeed.Okay, enough of my rant--now on to this movie. MEMENTO is a very strange movie in that the film starts at the very end and works its way backwards towards the beginning. This is an intriguing and clever idea. You know that the main character who was brain injured committed a murder, but because his injury makes it physically impossible for him to remember any events AFTER his injury, he tries to solve a mystery by leaving notes for himself and tattooing himself so he can eventually put all the pieces together. The problem is that after a while, the very stylish film becomes awfully tedious. Plus, the ending, to me, just wasn't very satisfying--it's an ending you will either love or hate. Leonard Maltin gave the film only 1 1/2 stars out of 4. I won't be THAT critical, but I just can't see how stylish film making and an odd plot result in this movie being elevated to near the top of the IMDb list of films!!NOTE TO PARENTS--the 'f-word' is used about 200 times in the film and there is some intense violence, so this film is rated R. I watched it with my 16 year-old, but you might want to think twice about letting the kids see this one.",7,10,25,7 December 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.
","This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a 'guy film'.Second, the film has almost nothing to do with the original 'The Inglorious Bastards: (1978)--other than the fact they were both about American soldiers fighting the Nazis. Both are very good and in a homage to the original, director Tarantino cast Bo Svenson (from the original film) in a role in the accompanying DVD extra 'Nation's Pride'. This new version is more like a Spaghetti Western than the earlier film--complete with music in many places of the film that would have worked great in a Sergio Leone movie.Third, although Tarantino did NOT mean for this to be realistic in the least, I hope that you don't believe that this is in any way based on history. Sure, there are some similarities, but so much of it is pure fantasy. There was no such military group like the 'Basterds' and American soldiers did not do what these guys did! Heck, they made the 'Dirty Dozen' look like pacifists!! And, unless you are a total idiot, you'll realize that the ending did not really occur!! As for the plot, I'll skip discussing that as the film came out several months ago and by now lots and lots of reviewers have already discussed this to death. Instead, I'll just say what I liked. Brad Pitt was terrific in the nominal lead. While he was NOT in the film as much as you might expect, he was hilarious and I loved his accent that was highly reminiscent of George Clooney in 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'. Also, the German Colonel was amazing--speaking four different languages and making a great villain. The action was great and the film very enjoyable--but not as action-packed as you might think based on the commercials. Lots of fun and an interesting film because of all it's inside jokes, references to other films and it seeming a lot like a movie serial version of WWII. Watch this one.",8,8,16,17 January 2010
Kickboxer," The first half was actually much better than the last.
","'Kickboxer' is one of the early films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and like his older movies, it's pretty good. The set-up is good....the finale, however, is pretty predictable and cliched.When the story begins, Eric Sloane has just successfully defended his kickboxing title. With nothing interesting to do at home, Eric decides to travel to Thailand to fight...bringing along his younger brother, Kurt (Van Damme), as his trainer. Eric is overconfident and gets his butt whipped in the ring...and the evil Tong Po refuses to quit when the fight is called...and leaves Eric paralyzed. Not surprisingly, Kurt wants revenge and seeks out a local guy to train him.When it comes to the final big battle, the film throws in every cliche known to martial arts films. Po's boss is determined he's going to win and has Eric kidnapped and help prisoner until Kurt throws the fight. Additionally, evil Po rapes Kurt's girl. So, apparently paralyzing the brother isn't enough....and the film threw everything into this one.The best parts of the film are the fighting sequences. While he's no great actor (and his accent and brother's are TOTALLY different), Van Damme has incredible skills in the film....and it's worth seeing for this reason alone. So, ignore the cliches and just enjoy.",6,1,6,4 May 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An enjoyable film with a zombie in one of the leading roles.
","Back in 1977, Peter Cushing starred as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original 'Star Wars' movie. 'Rogue One' is set in the Star Wars world just before 'Star Wars' and the studio decided to have Tarkin as one of the major characters, even though Cushing died in 1994. So instead of re-casting him, they did something that only modern technology could allow them to do--create a CG Tarkin that actually looks and sounds like Cushing!! It really is amazing and lifelike and for this reason alone, it's worth seeing the film. Now I pray that this sort of thing does not become the norm. Think about it...they COULD start making new films starring Clark Gable with Jennifer Lawrence or The Three Stooges and John Gielgud using CG-- it's getting THAT good!As for the movie, it's NOT as wonderful and perfect as many of my friends have said nor is it a bad film in any way. Instead of recapitulating the plot, I'll just say what makes this movie different from most Star Wars films. This is NOT a cutesy film. Aside from a tiny appearance by R2D2 and C3PO, the characters, including the droid, are not designed with cuteness and marketability towards children in mind. I really appreciate this-- and thank God there is no Jar-Jar!! Additionally, unlike the previous films this one is a downer with an ending where pert near everyone dies! I mention this because I would NOT advise folks with very young kids to bring them to see it.Overall, it's a well made film with a lot to recommend it. My only gripe is that you KNOW what will happen because it is a gap-filler and the audiences already know what must happen in the next film. I might be inclined to say more, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this blockbuster...so I'll end it here.",8,7,16,15 January 2017
Captain Marvel," You cannot trust the reviews....see it for yourself and decide for yourself.
","As a long-time IMDB reviewer, I have noticed that often films which haven't even been released have received a lot of reviews on this site. In a few cases, it's because folks saw the films at pre-screenings (such as at film festivatls), but for most it's more insidious. Some films appear to have many fake reviews--either fake positive ones (often, I assume, posted by the production companies or actors in the films) and some fake negative (such as when a fan group decides to attack a movie for some perceived slight). In the case of 'Captain Marvel' the fake negative attacks were so many that Rotten Tomatoes decided for the first time, to not allow reviews of the film before its release. It seems a lot of fan guys objected to the perceived political correctness of the movie....and they were posting without even having seen the movie. I notice there are ALSO a lot of angry reviews here on IMDB as well...and many appear to have been posted before the film was released. Because of this, it must be very frustrating for you trying to determine whether or not it's a film worth seeing. I could say 'trust me....I am objective'....but without knowing me, I, too, could be one of these folks posting a false negative or false positive review! So, I guess you'll need to see it for yourself.For the most part, I tired of watching superhero films long ago....mostly because after a while they all seem the same. But my daughter is visiting now and she wanted to see 'Captain Marvel' and 'Shazam!', so I broke my resolve and went along to see these comic book-based films.I enjoyed 'Captain Marvel' very much because it did not feel like all the other DC and Marvel films. It had a few distinctive touches which made it more exciting and worth my time. Much of it takes place in outer space and apart from bits of 'Thor' and the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' franchises, which also take place in space, it sets the film apart. It also sets itself apart by having a female lead. And, like 'Wonder Woman', a ton of trolls hated on the film before it was released because it had the nerve to actually have a woman in the lead! This is sad, as Brie Larson was fine in the lead and did a nice job. Ditto for the writing, as the plot had a few very nice surprises and the film kept my interest throughout. Well worth seeing and quite the adventure.",8,30,58,12 April 2019
Coraline," Exceptional, but probably not for younger viewers
","CORALINE is an exceptional movie and I really have to admire the folks who made it. However, I should point out that this is NOT a movie for younger viewers because the movie is basically like walking into a nightmare. I think I'd be very hesitant to take a child younger than 10 to see it--it is that dark and scary.When the film begins, you are blown away by the amazing stop-motion film work. I assumed it must have been computer generated, but amazingly the film was made using models and figures with interchangeable features. It is many generations beyond the old Rankin-Bass animation or even 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (also by the folks who brought us CORALINE). The artistry was amazing and so many little details and touches made the film look magical. In addition, I found a theater where it was shown in 3-D and I really think it's well worth the extra money to get the three dimensional experience because it was flawless.The story is about a young girl who is unhappy. Her family just moved into a weird old Victorian era home but the parents are so busy with their job that they don't have much time for poor Coraline. Later, however, Coraline discovers an alternate world--one where everything looks a lot like the real world but seems perfect--so perfect that she'd rather live there. However, being a scary story, things of course aren't as they seem and this leads to a confrontation that could spell doom for the girl and her parents.Excellent all around and I have no serious complaints. A very good film for older kids, teens and adults....but not little kids, as the film will probably scare them out of their wits. Don't let the PG rating fool you--this is NOT like a Disney or Nickelodeon film but more like an even more intensely dark Roald Dahl story done in stop-motion. Neil Gaiman is the author of this tale and my daughter read his story and the film and although they were different here and there (the film adds Wybie, for example), she said both were equally wonderful.",8,19,22,7 March 2009
Iron Man 2," I was ready to love this film...
","About three days before I went to see 'Iron Man 2', I watched the original 'Iron Man' for the second time. This time, my 20 year-old watched it with me. She'd never seen it before and loved it--thanking me for recommending it to her. And, considering that I not only saw the film twice (that's very rare for me) and gave it a 9 in my review, I obviously was stoked to see the sequel. Too bad I was so underwhelmed by it.While my daughter said she also liked this film and said Tony Stark (Rober Downey, Jr.) was a jerk like he was in the comic books, I though he was simply a jerk--and perhaps my not reading the comic book made it harder for me to take this bothersome portrayal. Now I am NOT saying I expected him to be perfect--after all, in the first film he was truly irresponsible and sarcastic. But, in 'Iron Man 2', you also liked him despite, or perhaps because of these flaws! In this sequel, that likable roguish quality was missing...he was simply an annoying and self-indulgent jerk. Now my perception is not everyone's, I know. Perhaps it's because I am 46 (a bit old for this sort of film) and because I haven't read a comic book in 35 years. Whatever the reason, I found it hard to love the film when I disliked the leading man so much. Heck, while he was very one-dimensional, it was often easier to like the baddie (Mickey Rourke)!! At least he had some sense of purpose in life other than his own misguided narcissism.My other serious problem with the film is the over-reliance on special effects. Too often, the film simply overloaded my senses--as it seemed bent on topping the eye-popping images of the first film. And, while it did this clearly, it did so at the expense of the plot and, more importantly, character development. As a result, I just can't see this film as anything more than eye-candy for the very easily amused and not a film with any serious depth--something that was NOT a problem with 'Iron Man'. Watch it if you want...just don't expect a lot of magic.",5,9,17,7 July 2010
The Hunger Games," I did NOT read the books and still enjoyed the film
","I should tell you right up front that I have never read 'The Hunter Games'--so this review is more for this group of folks than the die-hard book lovers. In many cases, I have no idea where the book and film differ and my expectations were quite different from my daughter--who has read the series. However, one this that DID bother me is that despite the film's title, no one appeared to be all that hungry in the film and the way food was used to manipulate and control the masses was not explained well. The only way I knew this was that my daughter sat next to me and explained this (and it helps that we both know sign language). But apart from that and the god-awful 'shaky cam' (one of the WORST inventions in the history of filmmaking), the film was enjoyable and engrossing throughout. As I said, though, the shakiness of the film (especially at the beginning) was a problem--and I felt motion sick just watching the movie! The plot and movie have already been discussed in a bazillion reviews. The film has already been out about 45 days when I saw it tonight, so I don't want to give a lengthy review. Instead, I'll talk about what I liked. Foremost, the acting was really, really nice. I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about and it tore my guts out when one of them was killed in the film--showing what a nice job they did and how well the director elicited the performances. I liked the story a lot--especially since I love dystopian sci-fi films. In many ways it was like combining the original 'Rollerball' and, perhaps, 'Gladiator'! It was truly original and kept me riveted. All in all, a terrific film--well worth your time provided you don't mind the violence necessary to convey the story. However, despite the books being very popular with kids, I would think twice about bringing any kids younger than about 12 or 13.]",8,12,24,27 May 2012
Zootopia," I loved the film...it's wonderful...but where's the short?!
","It's quite amazing how far computer graphics have come in films. Watch an older film like 'Toy Story' or 'Shrek' and you'll see what I mean. They were the cutting edge CGI movies when they came out but when seen today you realize just how far they've come since then. As an experiment, try watching one of these older films and then see the best computer animated film you can find, 'Zootopia', and you'll see just how far they've come. The characters not only are gorgeously animated but the film is so rich in texture. Scenes of the characters flying through a rain forest or walking in a bustling metropolis simply look astounding. Combine with that some of the nicest 3D effects you can find and some very lovable characters and you've got a winner.The story is set in a world without humans. However, these animals act and dress much like people. Oddly, however, the predators and prey have somehow worked out their differences and live in peace. However, despite it seeming like a paradise, there still are some prejudices in this world. Animals are often locked within expectations...and the cute bunny, Judy Hopps, finds out the hard way about these expectations. As a child, she wanted to be a police officer...but she finds that the expectation is that they be the huge, hulking animals...the wolves, the rhinos, the elephants and the bears. But Judy is persistent and fights these prejudices in order to become the first rabbit cop...but along the way she learns that hard way that she, too, has prejudices of her own and her new unlikely friend, a fox, helps to show her that she, too, has a way to go when it comes to expectations. Fortunately, while this strong message of political correctness and inclusion is clearly there, it's not obnoxious in its presentation. Additionally, there is a mystery within the story that is clever and diverting...and offers some nice twists as well.So is the film perfect? Not quite. Unlike the typical CGI film, this one did not have a short the preceded it and because of this I felt a bit cheated since this has become the norm for most computer animated films from major studios. Additionally, some might find the message within the film to be a bit heavy-handed...though I didn't mind. Overall, this is a great film for all ages....something that makes it a major plus for families. Parents won't feel like taking a nap and kids will be captivated because the film, if anything, is amazingly cute!",9,13,30,4 March 2016
12 Monkeys," Not my kind of thing....
","Obviously, a lot of people adore 'Twelve Monkeys', as it's currently #180 on IMDb--placing it among the very best films ever made. While I recognize that it is an amazingly unusual plot (done before in the short French film 'La Jetée'), it just isn't the sort of film that appeals to me--though I generally do like fantasy and sci-fi films. I guess the film's weirdness and very slow pace just didn't appeal to me--perhaps you'll love it.Bruce Willis plays a criminal from the future who has been sent back in time to try to prevent a HUGE apocalyptic event in which most of the people on Earth will be wiped out in 1996. Now I NEVER understood why they put the entire future of mankind on a criminal nor did I understand why they just didn't send dozens or thousands back in time to make 100% sure the plague would not occur. Regardless, he arrives too early--back in 1990. And, unfortunately, he's seen as a crazy man and is sent to an asylum. There, he meets a goofy psychiatrist (are there any other type in films?!) and a real crazy guy (Brad Pitt). How will these three folks work together to either cause or prevent devastation? See this film if you want to know.Aside from seeing Frank Gorshin in a very unusual role as the man running the asylum, not a lot appealed to me about this one. I didn't dislike the film--I just never felt all that interested. Part of this might be because I never liked 'La Jetée'--part of it might be because Madeline Stowe's character seemed really hard to believe (sort of like Ingrid Bergman and her incredibly gullible character in 'Spellbound'--another goofy female psychiatrist with no personal boundaries and a tenuous hold on reality). All I know is that I wanted to like this movie but didn't. However, I did respect that it tried to be different and quite complex. Worth a look, though I can't figure out exactly what everyone loves about this one.",6,32,49,21 July 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," excellent
","There's not a whole lot negative to say about the film. This is yet another excellent film about the holocaust. What I especially like about it is that it offers a view that is not typical of other films (i.e., the perspective of children in a boarding school). This unusual perspective lifts it about other holocaust films--nearly to the same level as the wonderful Shop On Main Street (from Czechoslovakia). It, too, had an unusual perspective.The one thing, though that surprised me was that there were some sympathetic German soldiers in the film--such as the one who told the self-important French collaborator to leave the restaurant and leave the Jewish man alone as well as the apparently decent soldiers that brought the two lost boys home. Though surprising, it did add to the picture in that both good and bad Germans as well as good and bad Frenchmen are presented.This film would be acceptable to watch by most anyone. Despite Malle having made many non-family friendly films, this one has very little objectionable material. For younger viewers, I would recommend watching the film with them, as it is sure to bring up a lot of confusion and emotional issues for younger viewers.",9,4,6,20 August 2005
Rang De Basanti," Rekindling the patriotic spirits of their forefathers in a bunch of spoiled jerks.
","Sue is a pretty young British lady who wants to make a film about the Indian uprising of the 1920s. This is because she's read through her grandfather's diary and although he was a British officer, he had great respect for these Indian patriots. But her bosses have no interest in such a project (perhaps because she's in the UK), so she takes off for India to do the film herself...with no funding. But because there is no money, she decides to use some college students instead of professional actors. There is a huge problem, though, as the students are mostly very spoiled young people who are more interested in becoming like Westerners than doing a serious film about their forefathers. Can she get through to these jerks and get them to realize the great price that was paid to create modern day India....and thus get the film made?Like most Indian films, this one is quite long--nearly three hours. And, like a typical Indian film is shows a lot of fun-loving young Indians singing and dancing. I liked the film but think they overdid this aspect a bit. The students should have been oblivious to their past but making them annoying jerks seemed a bit too much, as it was very hard to like any of them during the first portion of the picture. A bit more subtlety would have been nice. Fortunately, through the course of the film, the students did improve in this regard and began to take the project more seriously. This later portion was much better and poignant, as the students start to realize that even today in India there is corruption and repression that must be fought and it's a close parallel to the story about the Indian revolutionaries of the 1920s. I am pretty sure the Indian politicians did NOT appreciate this film and its condemnation of brutal police tactics to squelch protest! Overall, despite being uneven, the film is quite good and interesting as it seems to encourage what might be perceived as terrorism! A very compelling film despite the slow start.By the way, the MiG-21 crashes which made up a significant part of the latter portion of film have apparently been a serious problem in India. And yet, the film says at the beginning that it's a work of fiction...interesting. Also, for Westerners not used to Bollywood films, you might be interested to hear that corruption (particularly police corruption) is a relatively common theme in Indian films.",8,0,3,14 December 2015
42," Very inspiring and while this isn't a complaint, it's only part of the story.
","Up until this film, probably the best film about Jackie Robinson was the one in which the star played himself. This wasn't a bad film, though it seemed very over-idealized. Finally, after all these years, Hollywood has finally put a nice budget into making a lovely tribute to this baseball great. However, and this isn't a complaint, it is NOT a film about the entire life of Robinson--just a tiny portion. Of course, it's clearly the most important part--his career in the minor leagues and his first year in major league baseball. It does not discuss how his career was unfortunately cut short by diabetes--as was his life. But the movie makers clearly couldn't do EVERYTHING--and they were wise to narrow the focus. But as for me, I'd like to see a sequel--and what happened to Robinson AFTER the 1947 season. In fact, when the film ends, you see that Dodgers win the National League pennant--but you don't learn that they lost the World Series to the Yankees (that WOULD have been anticlimactic).So what did I think of the film? Well, I thought it was terrific--and I really appreciated how the film tried to get the history correct (with a few tiny exceptions). Ben Chapman (the manager of the Phillies) really was a racist jerk. Robinson did, for a time, live in Sanford, Florida (that's a bit ironic). And, the film tried very hard to get the look right. I also appreciated seeing Harrison Ford try to stretch his range--uglying himself up and changing his voice so much to try to adequately portray Branch Rickey. All in all, a very, very inspiring and touching film--one even non-baseball players could love.",9,0,0,19 August 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Top 250....nah. But it's still very good.
","This was a very good film, but like many recent films, its score has been inflated on IMDb thanks to young viewers that have no appreciation for anything made before they were born--hence older deserving films often are rated lower even though they are excellent films. As a result, lots of mediocre or above average films are given astronomical scores (a great case in point, the film MEMENTO). Now this ISN'T to say that SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a bad film--it's very good, but it isn't so good that I would rank it in the IMDb Top 250! In fact, it's a darn clever film that manages to inject life into a dull genre (zombie movies--when you've seen one, you think you've seen them all). In particular, it's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor was quite refreshing and the film had one of the best endings I have ever seen--I was laughing about the shed scene for weeks. Excellent, refreshing and clever--just NOT Top 250 material.",8,3,13,8 May 2007
Argo," Oddly, I couldn't find anything to dislike about this film!
","I will readily admit that I am a very critical person when it comes to movies. After all, a normal person doesn't contribute over 13800 (and counting) reviews to IMDb! However, 'Argo' is an unusual film because I honestly can't think of a single negative thing to say about it! Really...it's THAT good! The film is about a joint effort by the Canadian government and the CIA to rescue a group of six Americans stranded in Iran during their revolution in 1979-80. It seems that most of the Americans in the US embassy were captured by extremists but a small group of folks escaped and sought shelter in the Canadian embassy. What happened next? See the film.It's odd. In light of the film's greatest strength, how could the Oscar folks NOT have nominated Ben Affleck for Best Director? After all, in so many ways the film was wonderfully directed. Although I knew the fate of the six refugees, I STILL found myself reacting to the incredibly tense ending. I was actually chewing my fingernails and could feel my heart pounding. Additionally, the film was wonderful how it kept weaving the characters into a VERY complicated and wonderful story. The other unsung heroes of the film were the producers (and there were many) and makeup folks. They managed to really capture the look of the era and look of the actual characters in real life. And, finally, the script was just terrific. Overall a magnificent film--one that clearly is in the running for Best Picture this year. And, incidentally, the audience at the showing tonight broke into applause when the film ended! I can't say that it should win, as some of the films nominated are so different and I haven't yet seen them all. Heck, I'd love to see a couple take home the statuette as it's been a very good year for films.By the way, if you are the sort to leave when the final credits roll, DON'T. Watch and see.",10,6,19,18 February 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," As long as you know it ain't really 'Star Trek' and don't mind, you're in for a nice ride.
","As an old fogey of 49, I can't help but love the original 'Star Trek' series. To me, this is THE 'Star Trek'. I had difficulty with the last Trek movie, the reboot, as it just seemed to violate so much of the original canon. However, given a bit of time, I guess I can turn off my brain and ignore the inconsistencies between the old and the new--even if the notion of an 'alternate universe' where such inconsistencies are accepted is something I still struggle with a bit.Since this film came out several months ago and by now there are 1832934 reviews (more or less), I won't make my review that long and I won't explain the plot. Sure, it's once again inconsistent--with an entirely new beginning story of how Kirk met his nemesis, Khan. And, it's inconsistent in a few other ways. However, it IS exciting to watch--and never really lets up. Plus, a few of the inconsistencies were still nice homages to the original (such as near the end when a DIFFERENT crew member enters the engines to save the ship and then says goodbye). Overall, a lot of action, a few nice explorations of characters and a film that lovers of Simon Pegg will ADORE since Scotty is given a much larger part in this one than in previous Trek films. Well made all around and well worth seeing. I assume they'll be making more of these and I hope to see them as well...unless they suck like 'Star Trek V'.",8,3,7,14 October 2013
12 Angry Men," An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff
","This is one of the greatest films ever made...period. Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual 'who's who' of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show 'The Odd Couple'--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!",10,25,42,13 April 2007
Beauty and the Beast," Perfection.
","This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made 'Bambi', 'Little Mermaid' and many other great films. 'Beauty and the Beast' represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar. Well worth seeing and owning--a truly great film.",10,7,10,13 October 2012
The English Patient," why is this film so popular?
","Years ago, I saw an episode of SEINFELD in which Elaine described this movie as a colossal bore that seemed to go on forever (though less than 3 hours long, it did seem to go on for an eternity). I should have taken her advice and avoided this movie like the plague. The first tip-off that it would be a bore-fest was that it had won so many academy awards. In recent years, several amazingly dull films have been the recipient of arm loads of awards but were box office poison because the public couldn't stand them (another example of this would the the sterile LAST EMPEROR).My wife and I were amazed at how much we disliked the film. The 'love' affair between the leads was completely unbelievable and stupid. One minute, they hate each other and the next they are copulating like crazed weasels! And, to top this off, these were perhaps the ugliest stars ever seen naked on the screen. I kept wanting to shout 'put it BACK on--PLEASE'. In fact, they were such an unappealing couple that I strongly recommend parents send their teenagers to watch this film. The sight of their naked bodies is perhaps the strongest enticement towards abstinence known to mankind!However, the ugliness of the film doesn't end there. Towards the end, in order to try to save his lover's life, the male lead makes a deal to help the Nazis....yes, Nazis!!! Who cares that they were trying to take over the world and liquidate a few million?! All his character cared about was his sweetie. Oh, and did I mention that along the way they ended up killing her husband? Nothing says romance like this film!!",2,14,36,2 March 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Well-made and enjoyable....but.....
","Technically speaking, this was an excellent film. Up until very recently, doing a competent live-action version of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was really impossible because the special effects were technically impossible to do and still make them look real. Now, thanks to computers and incredible software, it is possible to get the look right of the book and Disney did a great job. And, having read the books, I was impressed that they got the story right. The problem for me, though, was that although everything seemed to fit just fine, the story itself didn't fully engage me. Perhaps I'm just getting old, but after this eye-candy was over, I just felt a great sense of 'is that all there is?'. The biggest problem related to this were that the LORD OF THE RING movies were so great, so grand and so wonderful that this left this film in the category of 'also ran'. You just can't help but compare the films and when this occurs, the depth and complexity of the Peter Jackson films is apparent.",7,3,6,10 June 2007
Happy Gilmore," Formulaic and dumb....but worth seeing for one scene.
","HAPPY GILMORE is a very shallow and formulaic film. Despite some odd twists (such as a hockey player somehow making a great golfer), the overall plot structure is very, very familiar. In many ways, this film is like CADDYSHACK combined with the typical 'poor guy makes it big' film--with few major surprises. So, when Gilmore ends up having his big golf game at the end of the film, don't look for anything particularly novel or surprising.So far, it sure sounds like I am not big on this film and that would certainly be correct. However, part-way through the film, there is one of the singularly funniest scenes I can recall seeing in a film in recent memory. DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND MY SPOILING THIS FOR YOU!!! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!! During a celebrity golf tournament where celebrities are teamed with pro golfers, Happy is paired with Bob Barker. Repeatedly, Happy makes a nuisance of himself. It becomes so bad that the usually nice persona of Barker disappears and they have a UFC-style fight that is very funny. After all, seeing a very elderly Barker in a fight is funny--at least in a silly and unsophisticated way. And sometimes I could use this sort of laugh.So, while the film is far from great, there is enough to see and enjoy that I mildly recommend it. Plus, for parents it's one of the few films that kids like that you can watch without feeling your brain cells rotting away--like it would if you were forced to watch LITTLE NICKY!",6,3,7,1 March 2009
The Babadook," Miss Fisher, what has happened to you?!
","Essie Davis is rather famous in her native Australia for starring in a wonderful television show 'Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries'. In the show, Davis is very glamorous--with he lovely black hair and perfect makeup and clothes. So imagine my surprise when I saw Davis starring in 'The Babadook'--with her natural strawberry blonde hair and absolutely no makeup whatsoever. In fact, instead of being a timeless beauty like she is in 'Miss Fisher', Davis looks haggard and old in this film--perfect for the character but also a bit daring and very brave considering her sexy image as Miss Fisher.In 'The Babadook', Davis plays a harried and overwhelmed mother. Her husband was killed on the way to the hospital when she was going into labor and for the last six years, she's refused to deal with this loss. Additionally, her child is a holy terror--one that would drain even Mary Poppins! These serious problems combined with clinical depression and a lack of sleep make for an interesting combination. Soon, a frightful character from a sick children's book, 'The Babadook', begins terrifying and tormenting her. Soon the audience begins to wonder just how real any of this is and just how close to losing her sanity this poor woman is.This film is a very, very different sort of horror film. It lacks the usual cheap thrills and frights...and I appreciate that. Instead it shows the darkest recesses of the human mind and is enthralling. Much of it is due to Davis' amazing performance (she makes the film) and bizarre plot. This is much more of a thinking person's horror film-- one you won't soon forget.",9,2,11,14 May 2015
Elizabeth," Well made though not exactly great history.
","Making a historical biopic like 'Elizabeth' is a very, very difficult thing--something many viewers would not expect. Although Elizabeth I of England was an incredibly important figure, there are two HUGE problems with a film about her. First, although she had LOTS of folks executed for treason, we really have no idea if many of these folks were actually guilty of anything. Executing potential threats and rivals back then was like eating potato chips--you can't stop with just one! Untangling this mess of intrigues is impossible today, so many of the plots you see in this film might not have even existed or occurred later in her reign (the executions in the film actually occurred over a very long period of time--not all at once). Second, there is scant little written from the time about the character and personalities of the major characters you see in the film. So, the film makers either inferred or simply made up stuff for the sake of cinematic style and intrigue. For example, Sir Francis Wallsingham was a man of intrigues and operated a personal spy network--so the inferences about him in this sense in the movie are reasonable. BUT, showing him with the young man who he then viciously kills at the beginning of the film is completely fictional. There is no evidence he murdered people with his own hands and I think the scene STRONGLY implies that he's either gay or bisexual--something that is made up for the movie. Another example is Elizabeth's sex life. This is NOT something they kept records of (for obvious reasons) and there has been MUCH conjecture that she was gay, asexual or carried on affairs behind the scenes with men. No one really knows the truth. So, my advice for the film is to take it all with a grain of salt--the main points are accurate but so many of the details are fabricated in order to create a neat sort of fictional non-fiction.As fictional non-fiction, the film looks great. The costumes and sets are wonderful. The acting is also quite good. And, the film is rather interesting and gives a good GENERAL overview of the early years of Elizabeth's reign. However, be forewarned: the film is NOT for the squeamish, prudish or easily offended. It is very bloody (beginning with an incredibly vivid opening execution scene) and there is a lot of nudity. In many ways, this film helped set the template for later historical mini series which are much like history, a soap opera and a bit of skin combined. Well made but like most biopics, short on historical accuracy.",7,1,1,11 December 2013
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Not really a comedy...but well worth seeing.
","Although this IS a Will Ferrell film, do not watch 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' thinking it will be anything like 'Talladega Nights' or 'Anchorman'. In fact, I would go so far as to say I wouldn't even consider it a comedy...though it has some comedic portions. Instead, it's a strange tribute to Eurovision from some folks who seem to understand and love it.Now this MIGHT mean that the best audience for this movie are Europeans and folks from a few other countries that also compete in the competition (such as Israel, Turkey and Australia). After all, few Americans (apart from me and a few other strange folks) watch Eurovision or even know what it is or how it's conducted! But, if you don't know about it, you might still enjoy it...who knows?As far as the movie goes, it is the fictional story about Lars and Sigrit (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams)...a singing duo who, frankly, don't seem very good. But through an odd set of circumstances, they find themselves the Icelandic entry into Eurovision!! Do they stand a prayer? Probably not...but the film is about them and how they manage to salvage some dignity out of this!What really helps this story is that so many Eurovision winners and famous competitors appear in the film. Additionally, they must have gotten permission to use the name, bumper music and more...making the film look and sound exactly like Eurovision!Overall, a wonderful and enjoyable film for anyone who loves Eurovision...and a mildly enjoyable movie for anyone else.",8,24,40,28 June 2020
Knives Out," How can this film currently have a 6.8 rating when it's one of the best pictures of the year?!
","Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with 'Knives Out'....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.'Knives Out' is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie.",9,313,659,3 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Very good....but perhaps they wrote the main character wrong...
","I enjoyed 'Spider-Man 2' very much. It had lovely special effects and interesting characters. However, I also felt annoyed about one major aspect of the film. Tobey Maguire's version of Peter Parker was just too darn stupid and annoying. Throughout much of the film, Parker has horrible problems balancing his life as Spider-Man and Peter--and did a horrible job as both. In fact, his ineptitude really made me cringe. Can anyone be THAT klutzy, nerdy and dumb? It tried to make him endearingly inept--but I wanted my superhero to be less of a knucklehead and less pathetic. Peter, unfortunately, was often just pathetic. So, when the movie introduced a great villain, eye-popping stunts of Spider-Man appearing to really fly through the streets of New York and a very spunky and likable Aunt May, you still couldn't help feeling that Peter needed to stop whining and be a man! Too bad, as otherwise this was a likable film and an amiable follow-up to the first Spider-Man film.Also, what's with that scene with the annoying woman on the street singing the Spider-Man song in the most god-awful rendition in movie history! Homer Simpson's 'Spider-Pig' song would have been far more fitting than this tuneless moment.",7,2,11,18 August 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Good, but I think it's a bit overrated.
","'The Secret in Their Eyes' is a very good film--I don't in any way deny this. However, given that the film is in IMDb's Top 250 List, that it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and is currently rated much higher than 'The official Story' (the other Argentinian film that has won the Oscar), I really expected more. Now you cannot blame the film but sometimes such high expectations set the viewer up to be disappointed...and I was to a certain extent. But, I still recommend you see it.The story begins with a retired investigator struggling with a story he's been working on for years. He's been trying to write the story of his most perplexing and haunting cases--the senseless murder and rape of a young lady. What follows is a film where the story bounces back and forth over a 25 year period--from the present to the days when the case first began. Interestingly, the story (like the film 'The Official Story') also is an indictment of the corruption of the Argentinian government of the 70s, as the identity of the perpetrator actually is eventually determined--but justice, it seems, is never to be.The best things about the film are the acting as well as the wonderful ending. While I did guess the ending, it still was very, very satisfying to see. My only reservation is that this is a VERY adult film. Not only does it show a rape occurring (though it was done tastefully and respectfully), but you see a very nude corpse as well as a man dropping his pants to reveal his penis. It's certainly not the sort of thing you'd normally show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins when he stops by for a friendly visit. Additionally, while the film is quite interesting, it never seemed great--like a must-see film and you certainly would expect that with its 8.2 rating on IMDb.",8,6,9,11 September 2013
The Irishman," Expertly crafted...just not the sort of film I love.
","When you read my review for 'The Irishman', please keep in mind that I am not a big fan of gangster movies nor am I a huge fan of director Martin Scorsese. It's not that I think the movies are terrible and I know that Scorsese is a great director...but I never would have even seen the film had it not been featured at the Philadelphia Film Festival this past October.The film is a very long saga about the live of Frank Sheeran, a real life mobster who brutally murdered quite a few people. At about 3.5 hours, the story did keep my interest...though I do think about 30 minutes could have been shaved off the story. This is my only complaint about the film....and it's minor. On the plus side, while the film is very violent, it's not as intensely violent as some of Scorsese's other pictures....though it's hardly in the category of his brilliant flop, 'Hugo'!",7,17,49,3 November 2019
Billy Elliot," Decent, though rather predictable
","BILLY ELLIOT is about an 11 year-old boy who hates boxing and instead of continuing with this class, switches to ballet. He loves to dance but is afraid to tell his working-class family because of the perceived 'unmanliness' of dance, so he practices without their knowledge until he can no longer hide it--as he has a chance to go to a prestigious ballet academy in London. Will his father and weasel-like older brother back off and let him be who he wants to be or will Billy be cursed to be stuck in a dying town for the rest of his life?I was very surprised that an inspirational movie like BILLY ELLIOT would be rated R. Generally, this sort of movie is perfect family fare and in so many ways this film is. However, the profuse use of vulgarities really make this a family-unfriendly film and it loses most of its audience. It wasn't just the language that was crude, but hand gestures and sexualized nature of the film that disturbed me. Now for non-British audiences, this might not seem as bad because some of the references have different meanings in other countries. The word 'fanny' and the gesture looking like the 'peace sign' are interpreted 100% differently in the US, for example--as here, neither would be considered obscene or family-inappropriate. Some may argue that the film used these crudities because that is how people are in these mining towns and perhaps this is true, but would it have seriously negatively impacted the film if these references would have been toned down? I sure doubt it AND the movie could have reached a much wider audience. This is all a real shame, as the structure of the film is similar to many family films. You know, one where someone or a group overcomes tons of obstacles in order to make their dream come true. Plus, as you KNOW that they will win in the end (so there isn't much real tension), this is a style film that might NOT appeal to the more discriminating adult viewer and SHOULD have more appeal more to kids.As for the rest of the film, it's very well made and entertaining. The acting is fine, the cinematography and direction are all fine. It is a good film--though also one that isn't a 'must-see' due to it being rather formulaic and therefore predictable. Worth a look, but don't rush out to rent this one.",7,1,2,15 July 2008
The Fifth Element," Aside from Chris Tucker, I loved this film!
","Okay, I must first point out that Chris Tucker in this film was like a walking and talking migraine. I know to some extent that is EXACTLY what the producers and director wanted, but he was so whiny and nasal I wanted to see him hit by a laser! That's out of my system, so I can go on with my review. This is perhaps the strangest sci-fi movie to come out of Hollywood and starring a first-tier American actor (though the director is French). I might have expected something this strange and risky to come from an independent producer, but for the 'big boys' to finance such an odd film is quite 'odd' in itself.Aside from Bruce Willis, whose character seems like just a guy taken out of the 20th century, all other actors in the film seemed strange and other-worldly. This was true for the female lead, Milla Jovovich, who looks a lot like an 80s punk rocker but who speaks a strange foreign language no one other than Willis can understand. But, this strangeness was even more apparent by all the odd creatures that inhabit the film--ranging from a blue-skinned woman with a very odd-shaped head who sings in a sort of alien operatic style to Gary Oldman's thugs who look a lot like,....nothing I have even dreamed of before! The worlds, too, are very very strange and look nothing like the Star Trek or Star Wars worlds--having their own unique look and charm that shows that the film must have cost a ton to make and had a strong commitment by the studio for its completion as the writers had envisioned it.The plot is too difficult to adequately describe in the space I have here. In fact, it would probably be best to just leave that all up to you. Watch it if you are a lover of sci-fi or you are willing to see something VERY unconventional. Otherwise, I doubt if you'll get a lot out of this film, since it is certainly NOT derivative or like anything you've ever seen before (unless you are psychotic or have done some MASSIVELY powerful drugs).",9,2,6,12 July 2006
Black Book," Definitely worth seeing but DEFINITELY for an adult audience.
","'Black Book' is an excellent film about a seldom talked about period and place in history--the final days of Holland during the Nazi occupation. Unfortunately, however, it is not a film for everyone because it is very, very graphic--in many different ways. As a result, it clearly is not a film for everyone and I certainly would not recommend it to kids or the easily offended. It's sad, because with a few edits, this would have been a fantastic film--one for everyone. But, at heart, it's still an exceptional film.Carice van Houten did a great job in the lead. She played 'Ellis'--a Jewish lady whose hiding place was destroyed in 1944--a year before the war ended. Now with no place to hide, she and her family head to supposed freedom in Belgium (which at this point in time is under Allied control). But they are betrayed in a scheme to loot and then murder all of them. Yet somehow, she escaped and falls into the lap of the Dutch Resistance. There she is soon called upon to do something horrid--to seduce the local head of the SS and thereby infiltrate the Nazis. And, as she's beautiful and a very talented singer, she is soon in a position where she can help the Resistance. But it isn't all that easy. First, many different surprising things occur--and I won't mention them to you because I don't want to spoil the film. But one I will mention is the surprise--as eventually she finds herself in love with her quarry--a Jewish lady falling for and having sympathy for a 'good Nazi'! Let's talk about the acting. First, it's interesting that van Houten didn't get nominated for a Best Actress award, as she did exactly what another recent great performance did. In 'Inglourious Basterds', Christoph Waltz rightly wowed the Academy--with his fine acting AND great multilingual performance. Well, van Houten did the same--speaking four different languages and doing a heck of a performance. Plus, she really allowed the director, Paul Verhoeven, to put her through a hellish performance! The difference, I think, is that 'Black Book' was not a Hollywood production AND it was not a nominee for Best Foreign Language film. In addition, can van Houten looked better simply because all her supporting actors did a great job as well. You can't help but give a great performance when those around you are professionals on top of their game.As for the graphic aspects of the film, the worst was not the nudity (though there was a lot, I could at least understand the purpose to almost all of it) but the gross imagery not necessarily related to the war. Now it did not bother me seeing dead bodies--wars are about death. But I did NOT want to watch people urinate, throw up or have HUGE buckets of human waste dropped on them. Couldn't have been done without this?! The film, aside from the nasty graphic portions, was nearly perfect. And, despite its length, it was neither over-long nor had any lulls. Exciting, compelling and very different. This is a film you may love but it's a hard one to to respect.",9,1,2,21 May 2011
127 Hours," To really enjoy this film, you need to love indie music and have a high tolerance for things icky
","Each of the last several years, I have tried to watch all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture. Of last years' crop, '127 Hours' was the last I watched—and I dreaded it. After all, a real-life story about a guy who falls down a canyon and needed to saw off his own hand to survive is NOT the sort of movie I would rush out to see! Heck, 'Winter's Bone' was practically a comedy compared to '127 Hours'! Yes, it was unpleasant, as it includes scenes involving the main character drinking urine, cutting off his hand (it wasn't THAT graphic) and all the blood make for a tough to watch film.The film was co-written and directed by Danny Boyle—the guy who brought the world the Best Picture winner 'Slumdog Millionaire'. While I wasn't that thrilled with the screenplay (after all, the story is extremely simple and the film seems heavily padded to make it full length), I was impressed by a lot of the inventive camera-work and direction. But the story, overuse of indie-style music (which is great if you are a hipster—I certainly am NOT) and the gore makes it a hard sell for me and probably most out there. This film is definitely a niche film that is not for everyone.By the way, this story is to have taken place over a period lasting more than four days. Then why is it the guy ALWAYS seems to have his camcorder on?! What brand is this that has a 127 hour-plus capacity?! I'd sure like to buy that one!",7,3,13,28 July 2011
Spice World," Vanity, thy name is Spice....
","I'm not even sure if you can call SPICE WORLD a movie, per se. That's because instead of having actors and a plot, the film plays like a giant advertisement for this prefabricated 'super group'. In other words, the cynical folks who brought us this 'film' were basically trying to squeeze every last drop from the franchise and sell more records. Fortunately for the world, the group was already on their way out and the film made much more of a fizzle than a sizzle at the box office (thank God).As with other vanity products, the actors really cannot act and have the charisma of cheese. While I know this may sound like sacrilege to some, this is a lot like Paul McCartney's vanity opus, GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADSTREET. Like this other film, lots of glitzy locales, special guest stars and noise were all used to try to hide the fact that the singers were not all that talented as actresses. Had all the glitz been removed, you would have been left with...well...nothing. So, instead there are a billion costume changes, crazy sets and pointless cameos--all to hide the utter vapid nature of the film. Overall, a total waste of time for anyone but a Spice Girl zombie-fan. I saw it because I am a masochist--otherwise, don't bother.",1,7,12,8 May 2009
Batman Returns," this movie went so wrong!
","Although Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return for this sequel to BATMAN (1989), this movie was a terrible followup to the blockbuster film. While the original film was dark and terribly entertaining, this film was far, far darker and offered little that could be seen as entertaining.Instead of a funny and over-the-top villain like the Joker, this one features Danny DeVito as one of the ugliest and most repellent villains of all time. In addition, the back story just made no sense at all and was just 100% stupid. A horrid couple have a horribly deformed baby. So, they do what most folks would do--chuck the kid in the sewer! There, he is somehow transported to a land where he is raised by animals. Later, he creates an army of evil armed penguins.Now, no matter how good the film is from this point on, the premise and characters are so stupid that it can't help but fail. It's visually impressive but also ugly and nihilistic. After starring in this mess, I can understand why Keaton bowed out of future Batman films.",3,47,79,11 July 2006
Finding Nemo," Cute and pleasant fare for the kids
","Okay, I am NOT a huge Nemo fan, but considering the film's modest pretenses and how much kids loved it, who am I to complain--especially since the animation is so nice? Plus, the film is much, much better than the knock-off film, SHARK TALE.The film has one of the simplest plots I have ever seen in a kids movie. Nemo loves his dad and vice-versa. When Nemo is captured for a home aquarium, the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results. There are no major surprises BUT the journey along the way is pleasant and cute. The kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit 'sticky' and shallow like I did. But considering how much fun my daughter had watching it, this can all be forgiven.",8,2,5,10 June 2007
Blade," 100% insane....and that's not necessarily a bad thing!
","Up front I must admit that this is not the sort of film I usually watch. No, I usually am very content to watch foreign films, classic Hollywood or silent movies. So me watching an action film like 'Blade' is highly unusual--and I am obviously not in the target demographic audience. Yet, despite this, I still enjoyed this movie because although I usually don't like films like this, sometimes you just have to turn off your brain and enjoy an insane action pic.'Blade' originally was a comic book and although he's not one of the biggies at Marvel (like Spiderman or Captain America), he has gained a lot of popularity due to the Blade films. That's because at least the first one (I've not see the others) was exciting and had non-stop insane action. And, unlike the Twilight series, the changes in the vampire canon are exciting and make for an excellent and non-whiny film! No, these vampires do NOT brood about their lot in life--they totally enjoy the killing and revel in it! Apparently the only thing that might stop them is Blade (Wesley Snipes) and people like his assistant (Kris Kristofferson). However, how they stop them is new--using a kitana, bombs, fire and guns that shoot silver bullets to dispatch vampires even faster than you see folks die in a samurai film! As a result, the film is INTENSELY violent and bloody---INTENSELY. So, this is definitely not a film for kids or for those put off by gallons and gallons and gallons of blood and entrails. For example, in the first scene (at a vampire rave), you must see at least 200-300 hundred gallons of blood--and it's very realistic looking! And, when it comes to the language, it's equally explicit.So, despite being much of the sort of thing I usually hate, I really liked 'Blade'. Call it a guilty pleasure...it was one intensely wild ride. The only problem is that after a while there are SO many deaths and so much fighting that the plot really loses momentum. Still, it is extremely well done for what it is.",7,4,9,5 March 2011
Superbad," An excellent film for idiots
","Considering all the money SUPERBAD made, I really worry about the future of the human race! I must admit up front that I simply couldn't finish watching the movie because it was so offensive and stupid. To make things worse, it wasn't even funny and yet it was billed as a comedy. Listening to unlikable teens talk about sex CONSTANTLY is pretty dull and after half the film was over, I was done--sick of the film and amazed at how stupid people are who actually liked this drivel. Now understand that I am not a super-prudish person, but the movie wasn't even funny--just obnoxious, crude and unlikable. If you really must hear a lot of obscenities, I suggest you try watching IDIOCRACY--at least it's funny and there is a purpose behind all the gutter language.If your teens watch and enjoy this film, I suggest you either hire an exorcist or have them sterilized--people who like this film should NOT be allowed to breed! Plus only an irresponsible idiot would let them watch a film that glamorizes teen drinking and encourages teen sex (duh).",1,10,34,9 July 2008
The Great Dictator," very good but uneven
","This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking film. Yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear Chaplin speak on film.The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I enjoyed the film, I was not nearly as impressed by this as Chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I really felt annoyed by some of Chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the Three Stooges). Plus, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me to take.However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The final speech by the barber (impersonating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the film for this reason alone.",8,1,6,7 May 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The writers obviously had little respect for the fans....
","This film is a prequel—about the origins of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). It follows Wolverine and his brother, Sabretooth, from their carefree days fighting in various wars (Civil, WWI and II and Vietnam), to personality changes in Sabretooth (turning him into a sociopath) to the ultimate operation that gave Wolverine his Adamantium skeleton.As a prequel it stinks because it honestly looks as if the writers didn't even bother to watch the earlier films. So, when time and time again the story completely contradicts the previous movies, I couldn't help but be annoyed. Who cares if Wade/Deadpool is little like his character—let's give his Cyclops' eyes! Who cares that several characters were much younger and appeared as teenagers in the first X-Man movie—let's have them be adults in this film that takes place BEFORE the first movie! Who cares that Stryker is not punished at all after he does innumerable atrocities—and the good guys had a chance to finally settle to score! Who cares that the dialog is god-awful and the characters take turns spouting nothing but macho clichés?! And, most importantly, who cares that unlike the other X-Man movies, this one is not the least bit fun or enjoyable! This is a very easy film to skip, as it just doesn't fit into the X-Man world and shows that given a great idea and excellent source material, bad writing and an over-reliance on action (and ignoring dialog and the idea of depth to characters) will spoil the film. Not horriblebut not at all good. As prequels go, I'd recommend 'X-Man: First Class'.",4,6,8,28 July 2011
That Thing You Do!," Charming homage to the early 1960s
","This film is a very slight film that probably won't change your life or have you announcing that it's the greatest thing you have ever saw. But, it is still worth seeing--particularly if you'd like to see a little slice of life film about the early 1960s and the burgeoning rock and roll industry. The movie is about a fictional singing group that called itself the 'Oneders'--a poor choice in names as although they pronounce it 'wonders', many of the confused fans call them the 'O-needers'! Anyway, despite the poor choice of names, this young local boys perform a song called 'THAT THING YOU DO' and it becomes a smash sensation--catapulting them to instant, and very brief, stardom. How this journey occurs and how they all ultimately deal with this is what makes the film worth seeing. The characters actually seemed pretty realistic and likable--not just caricatures like you see in some films. A good, fun film for the whole family with enough going for it to held your interest.",7,2,4,15 July 2006
Hot Fuzz," Far better than I expected
","When HOT FUZZ came out, I heard a lot of less than spectacular reviews and naturally thought that the movie wasn't up to the quality of SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which starred the same actors and director). This letdown after a blockbuster isn't uncommon (just ask singer Cris Cross or the group Boston) and I just assumed this was again the case. However, I was very, very wrong. Not only was HOT FUZZ a very good film, but I preferred it over SHAUN OF THE DEAD because it managed to make me laugh even more and I thoroughly enjoyed this clever film.Unlike many films, I actually liked the back story when the movie began at least as much as the rest of the movie. Seeing how the hot-shot cop was punished for his brilliant police work was a great commentary on bureaucracies. I also enjoyed seeing Sgt. Angel as he sprung into action when he first arrived in the small town for his new assignment. I assumed from the promos that Angel was an over-zealous idiot, but was surprised to see he was just an excellent cop who lived in a world of idiots! This juxtaposition was often very funny--particularly when he made his first drunk driving arrest.As for the rest of the film, it was also quite enjoyable, though for me the last thirty minutes were a minor let down. Now most will probably LOVE the over-the-top action and it was a cute parody on the 'buddy cop' films, but I think I enjoyed the stupider and quieter moments in the film just a bit more. These charming little scenes of daffiness reminded me a lot of the town from the great BBC series, 'The Vicar of Dibley'.The only negatives I would note are the film style and the violence. As far as the style goes, sometimes the choppy and 'hip' edits actually seemed like overkill. Many may like it--I think it was just trying a bit too hard. As for the violence, for adults it's fine and appropriate, but since I am a school teacher I am a bit concerned to hear that so many young kids went to see it. For an older teen, it's a good film, but with kids as young as 10 or 12 apparently seeing the film, this is sad. Where are the parents and why the heck won't they exercise a bit of common sense?! This is a rated R movie because it's so violent--not the sort of fare younger kids should be watching.I could say a lot more, but frankly with 12,305,308,028 reviews to date for this film AND because I don't want to divulge any spoilers, I'll wrap it all up now. Overall, the film is highly imaginative, fun, extremely well-written and engaging. While this WON'T appeal to people that hate action films (and I am actually usually NOT one for this style film), most others will have a great time watching it. Also, if you do watch, note the GREAT editing and choices of songs throughout the film.What were those TV and newspaper reviewers thinking? This was one terrific film!",9,6,11,18 December 2007
The Natural," A gorgeous mythical sort of baseball film that even non-sports fans can love.
","Before I get into the review, I want to relate a little story about when I first saw this film. My girlfriend (now my gorgeous wife) and I set in front of some elderly folks who seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with the film. Repeatedly, we kept hearing them asking each other what had just happened. However, near the end of the film, I had a big laugh. When Roy (Robert Redford) hit the huge home run and the film went into slow-motion with sparks flying everywhere, we sat--marveling at the predictable but wonderful finale. When it was all over, we heard one of the folks behind us say 'Did he hit the ball?!'---well, I guess you had to be there.This is an amazingly loving tale--told with amazing care to get the look and feel of 1939 just right. It also showed an amazing reverence for baseball--not just real baseball, but the mythical and metaphorical game. The cinematography was amazingly beautiful and helped set the wonderful mood. And, the acting was terrific. The film is simply among the best sports films ever. But unlike some other great sports films (like 'Raging Bull'), this one never attempts to be realistic and presents an amazingly idealized and nostalgic version of the game. Well worth your time and nearly deserving a 10.",9,4,6,26 January 2012
The Others," Much like 'The Sixth Sense', how much you know about the film ahead of time will strongly impact how much you enjoy it.
","'The Others' is a 'twist film'--one that relies heavily on a twist ending that gives the film a great 'AHAH!' moment. But, if you know about this twist ahead of time, it really negatively impacts your viewing of the film. Unfortunately for me, some idiot talked about the twist and so I avoided watching the film for many years. It's a shame--and folks who do this sort of thing deserve to be tied up and forced to watch every episode of 'Three's Company'! The same can be said for those who insist on telling everyone about the twist in 'The Sixth Sense'--a film which, fortunately, I was able to watch before some dummy told me the spoilers! Even with the ruined twist, the film is still very good and merits an 8. It's a bit overlong but solid throughout and quite original. I could say more, but I don't want to be one of those jerks that spills the beans!",8,1,2,11 March 2012
Rise of the Guardians," Pretty good--and the star is definitely the animation.
","Before I discuss what I thought of this film, my oldest daughter insists I talk about the film as seen in theaters. She LOVED the animation and when we watched it on Cinemax HD on our large HDTV, it apparently lost a lot according to her. A lot of the wonderful details were lost and the beauty of the film was lost--at least to some extent. Just thought I'd mention this.As for the film, the plot is quite strange. Among the many fictional characters (though they are real in this film), the Boogeyman is intent on filling the world with awful dreams and driving out all sense of hope or joy. To counter this, Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman all seek out a new guardian--a strange character that will help them fight Mr. Boogey. This character is the hipster-like Jack Frost. Together they do battle to save the children of the world and keep faith in them alive.Overall, while a gorgeous film, the plot is a bit limp and is more of an excuse to show off the lovely CGI. Not a great movie but worth seeing. I especially liked Alec Baldwin as the Russian version of Santa--what an interesting accent and characterization.",7,7,8,25 December 2013
Ed Wood," A must-see for Ed Wood fans although others might not get it
","This is probably my favorite Tim Burton film because I love the incredibly wretched films of Ed Wood and appreciate a bio-pic of this king of dreck! Having seen BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN 9, NIGHT OF THE GHOULS AND JAIL BAIT, I was absolutely thrilled that the stories behind these films was finally brought to the screen. Plus, it was a great thrill to see the behind the scenes work that crazy of Ed did to get his horrible films made. It also helped that Johnny Depp played the character with so much energy and sincerity. It helped even more that the producers took such great pains to replicate the weird group of stock characters from the Wood films. Of course Martin Landau got a lot of attention (and an Oscar) for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, but the rest of the characters were so close it was spooky. Plus, I admired that even the clothing and sets were dead on as well. Instead of simply making fun of Wood's horrible career, the film is more of a loving homage to a man who made rotten films that were still somehow very appealing--leading his films to be regarded as trash film cult classics. Perfect and enjoyable throughout and a truly wonderful time capsule.",9,4,5,6 August 2008
Chicken Run," A delight
","While this is not the best product Aardman Pictures has ever made, even a film that comes very close to the fun and creativity of the Wallace & Gromit films is a delight.The film stars all new characters and is quite a departure for the animators, as this is a full-length film, not a short. But, you'd never know that these film makers hadn't made such a picture before, as the product is exceptional from start to finish.It all takes place on a bizarre chicken farm. That's because the sets and action in the film more approximates the film THE GREAT ESCAPE than anything else--and this is deliberate. On this odd chicken farm, there are some determined chickens--determined to escape because some of them realize what their fate will be if they stay. All doubts about this are removed when Mr. & Mrs. Tweety invest in a horrid chicken pie producing machine. You just drop in a chicken, and out drops pies!! Unfortunately, the chickens have no idea how to escape. Aside from a slightly loony old male chicken who acts like a WWII vet, the rest of the chickens are all layers and have no idea what the real world outside is like. Then, out of the blue, a performing chicken (more precisely, one who is shot out of a cannon) arrives in the farm and the ladies all know that he will lead them to safety. If only they knew that he hasn't the foggiest idea how to help.The film features the usual plastic figures that are pose-able, along with very detailed and realistic miniature sets. It's actually quite amazing how far these characters are from the original clay Wallace & Gromit figures. They don't look quite as crude and they seem to have tons of personality--so much so that you soon forget that you are rooting on a whole bunch of dolls! The effect is further enhanced by excellent writing throughout--with a healthy dose of humor for the parents.Overall, a wonderful picture...though my favorite was their next feature, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. Great stuff.",9,1,2,14 August 2009
The Hustler," It's all about the acting...
","'The Hustler' is a great example of a film with a relatively simple plot, simple sets, not a lot of action and yet it's a great film nonetheless. Why is it great? The acting, writing and direction are simply superb and are great examples to folks in the field. So, without glitz, special effects and huge casts, you can STILL make a terrific film.The story is simple. Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler. But he wants to be more--he wants to be the best there is. The best, it seems, is Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and Eddie will do almost anything to beat Fats. It's a mania...one that dogs him through most of the film.In addition to amazing performances by Newman and Gleason, the film features particularly strong supporting performances by George C. Scott and Piper Laurie. The bottom line is that these four did a terrific job--thanks in no small part to a wonderfully written script and excellent direction. See this film.",10,3,6,25 August 2015
Spotlight," It will leave you shaken....
","Before you consider watching 'Spotlight', I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!",10,5,7,9 August 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," I loved the film but know there are now three versions on video in the USA
","Although so many reviews have been written here for the movie, I am including one because there are now 3 different video versions of this movie and all three are certainly worth watching.Originally in the United States, 20th Century Fox released the movie on video in the early 90s. This is the version I first saw. Then, a few years later, Studio Ghibli (who made this film in Japan) signed a deal for exclusivity with Disney. This has resulted in a more widespread release of their pictures but has also recently resulted in a new dubbed version of the movie. The Disney version has, perhaps, more realistic voices--as the children sound more like kids. However, I prefer the original voices--particularly the voice for Mei. I think it's the same lady who does the voice of Angelica on Rugrats.Finally, there is the original Japanese version that is subtitled into English. I am a bit compulsive and actually have seen all three versions! I think the subtitled is best because there are also a few tiny scenes that are in neither dubbed versions (not enough to change the story, but still I prefer a complete film). Of the dubbed, my loyalty is to the Fox version--it just sounds more charming and cute.Now about the movie itself, the animation is about the best you'll find anywhere--particularly the gorgeous backgrounds. They seem to yell out 'QUALITY PRODUCTION' throughout. The story, though very simple, is very captivating and the emotional response the film triggers is amazing. Anyone (except a total curmudgeon) will love this charming and simple film. See the movie, as it's about as good an animated film as you can find--regardless of where it was made.",10,4,5,24 June 2005
Juno," Complex...
","When I first heard about this little film I wasn't particularly interested. Being a high school teacher, I wasn't impressed with the idea of seeing a movie concerning a teenage mother. Believe me, I know enough of them already! However, on a lark, I decided to finally watch the film--almost two years after it debuted. And, in hindsight, I should have just gone and seen the film when it came out, as unlike my ASSUMPTION, it was not really a glorification of teen pregnancy but a very complex film--a film with a lot of different messages and possible interpretations. This is definitely NOT a by-the-numbers (formulaic) film--there is a lot that is original and new. And, if you were worried that the film would be pro-teen pregnancy or abortion or whatever and it might offend you, don't think that way....the film is great for anyone, conservative or liberal alike. And, it might just be an excellent film for you to see with your teens. Excellent, simple and very effective.I could say a lot more about the film, but considering the huge number of reviews already and the film came out some time back, I'll be brief and stop here.",9,10,18,23 October 2009
L.A. Confidential," not as good as I expected
","This movie is a 1990s version of the old film noir movies of the 40s and 50s. Technically speaking, it is an excellent movie. The photography (though not in black and white) was good, direction and pacing smooth and acting was top-notch. So why didn't I like the movie more? First, I found it hard to like anyone. You don't want to like the bad guys, but having the hero have sex with prostitute Bassinger seemed really out of character for a 'good guy' (as well as yucky considering how many other men had plunged into her nether-regions before him). Secondly, film noir WAS violent and, at times, unforgiving but it wasn't this graphic. Yes, this is probably because LA Confidential was made in 1997 but showing so much isn't so much a homage to the genre but ignoring the rules of film noir--where the viewer knew blood and sex was there but it wasn't explicit.",6,5,17,4 June 2005
The Jungle Book," While it's not up to the standards of many of the earlier Disney films, it is quite enjoyable.
","I noticed one reviewer who called this film 'the best animated of the golden era'. Hmmm. I beg to differ. While I LIKE the film, the single biggest weakness is its animation. It's good but not at all of the same quality as earlier artistic triumphs such as 'Pinocchio', 'Bambi' and 'Peter Pan' (among many others). So don't try to tell me that 'The Jungle Book' is Disney animation at its best. It's a pared down form of animation--done with copy machines like '101 Dalmatians'. I am NOT complaining about the use of Xerox machines instead of hand-drawing every scene but it did tend to make the films look a bit rougher. After all, Disney had to save money as production costs were skyrocketing and the public seemed to be embracing cheaper animation (hence the rise of UPA and Hanna-Barbara Studios).As for the rest of the film, it has two big things going for it. First, the songs are mostly very, very good. You cannot hear 'Bare Necessities' without bouncing along with the tune and several other songs are just plain fun. And, this brings me to the second reason- -the movie, over all, IS fun. You simply cannot watch it without smiling and enjoying yourself. Well done overall.",8,2,3,7 February 2015
Children of Heaven," seemingly dull plot but marvelous!
","When I repeatedly passed this film at the local library, I completely ignored it because it looked rather dull and I must admit I had a prejudice against Iranian films. I incorrectly assumed that the movie would somehow be anti-Western or full of Islamic anger. Boy, I am VERY glad I was proved wrong.When I say 'dull' above, I am referring to the incredibly simple and mundane plot--the movie is ACTUALLY far from dull. A boy loses his sister's shoes after he picks them up from the shoe repair shop and the rest of the movie consists of him and his sister trying to hide this from their parents. So, HOW does this merit a 9? Well, actually it came pretty close to a 10 (for that see the follow-up film The Color of Paradise)--it was that good. This is thanks to excellent acting by real people and a humanity about the film that crosses all cultures. Despite so many differences between the people of Iran and the United States, this film gave me a ray of hope due to characters' decency and sense of values. This film reminds me very much of the simple yet wonderful films by DeSica, such as Umberto D., The Miracle in Milan and Two Women.",9,2,4,28 August 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Star-studded and a bit overlong...but still well done.
","'A Bridge Too Far' reminds me of one of those Irwin Allen mega-epics of the 1970s. Like 'The Towering Inferno' or 'Earthquake', 'A Bridge Too Far' is jam-packed full of celebrities and celebrity cameos...something that usually does not work very well. Similar films, such as 'Midway', seemed to spend ALL the budget on stars and there was little left for anything else...such as a decent script or the limited and appropriate use of stock footage. So is this another overblown epic or is it worth seeing? After all, 90% of the budget must have been to pay these stars! Fortunately, while I was not in love with the film, I didn't hate it...and that makes it a whole lot better than the movies I just mentioned (particularly 'Midway'...what a terrible film).The film is a very long (too long if you ask me) recreation of Operation Market Garden, a failed attempt by Allied troops to dislodge the Germans and take bridges in Holland. Again and again, you see troops being tossed into various fronts...with mostly expected results since you know ultimately the Germans won this battle and pushed off the offensive. It's competently made and the director used some creativity to make the battles seem more realistic (such as the use of fake Sherman tanks...as discussed in the IMDb trivia). My only reservations are the film's length, the odd casting of Gene Hackman (what WAS his accent?!) and the way the film seems to go out of its way to portray General Browning as a complete horse's butt...and I am not sure if this is reasonable or not. According to at least some folks, the General wasn't actually incompetent.",7,1,6,18 June 2016
Youth," Endless contemplation....
","The story is set at an expensive Swiss health resort and it focuses, in particular, on an aging director, Mick (Harvey Keitel), and an even older ex-composer, Fred (Michael Caine). Fred seems like a man waiting to die and even though the Queen of the United Kingdom wants him to perform for her, he makes lots of excuses. His friend Mick, however, seems very active...trying to make that one great film which will be his finale.The film has hardly any plot apart from two old men contemplating life and their existence. In many ways, if you like one of Ingmar Bergman's more depressing films, you essentially know what 'Youth' is going to be like...somber, depressing, supposedly insightful and as much fun to watch as your grandmother taking a bath. Overall, a hard film to watch, let alone enjoy. Some obviously like it based on the other reviews, but I found that even though the film was made well and well acted, it was tedious and depressing. Even an incredibly beautiful and sensual nude scene wasn't enough to spark my interest in this story.",4,1,2,26 November 2017
The Prestige," Some very interesting plot twists and originality, though it's a bit grim and lifeless
","After seeing that this film is in the IMDb top 100, I thought it was a film I must see. Now that I've seen it, I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists, though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless, Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while, Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However, I will say that it gets really, really, really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic, the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall, I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it.",7,5,11,17 January 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Great special effects and action--dumb script
","Well, after seeing this film I would have to say that this is about the worst Tim Burton directed film I have ever seen--mostly because the script is hopeless. The problem seems to be that although a fortune was spent making the town of Sleepy Hollow for the film as well as doing some incredible stunts, no one seemed to have bothered making sure the script was up to snuff. The bottom line is that cool decapitation scenes are not enough to carry this movie and it seems as if the film is designed for undiscriminating audiences.So what's so bad about the script? Well, it didn't bother me that practically none of the film was based on the original story--after all, that was a short story and it would have made a relatively dull 15 minute movie. No, instead the problem was that the story just seemed to revolve around just action and special effects. So much of the dialog seemed pointless and sloppy. In particular, late in the film, Miranda Richardson goes on a long-winded exposition in order to explain the film--like she was reading from a script in order to explain what had happened to the audience. In addition, there were so many needless story elements--particularly those about Ichabod's childhood that seemed so needlessly antagonistic towards Christianity as well as a strong bent in favor of 'white witchcraft'. Throw in a silly and pointless meeting with a witch with no eyeballs, 18 decapitations, tons of gratuitous blood and you're left with a film that bears much more resemblance to THE GRUDGE or Friday THE 13TH than THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW! If you like dumb big budget films or will watch anything that teams Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, try any of their other pairings--such as the excellent films CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE or SWEENEY TODD.",3,2,15,1 March 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Not surprisingly, you'll need to have some Kleenex nearby as you watch this film.
","'Hotel Rwanda' is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.Instead of 'Hotel Rwanda' showing the violence in a general fashion, it focuses on a very brave man. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was the man who ran the swank Hotel Rwanda around the time of the genocide. In a very brave move, he opened the hotel to the Tutsi (who were being massacred) and created a tenuous safe haven. However, when the UN pulled out (as the UN did what it usually does in these situations...NOTHING!), Rusesabinga had to learn on the fly to work with the ruling powers, the mobs and the few remaining UN troops (though most had left). Rusesabinga managed to not only save his family (his wife was Tutsi and children half-Tutsi) but 1200 people through his heroics. The film shows the way he connived and begged and worked to make this possible in the midst of Hell.The film is a high quality and well made product. Not surprisingly it's on the IMDb Top 250 list and it also was nominated for three Oscars (including one for Cheadle who sure sounded African to my untrained ears). And, not surprisingly, it's an awfully tough film to watch. I don't recommend it for very young audiences but folks need to see this film and realize we have not come that far as a world. And, it's sad the film and other films about Rwanda during this period didn't come out until a decade after the massacres. It also makes you realize just how far from its original charter the UN has gone--it SHOULD have been able to take a stand against such evil.",10,1,1,20 January 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Either I am a complete idiot (it IS possible) or this movie was incredibly boring....or both!
","I have a VERY high ability to pay attention to very long films (having seen all of the Russian version of 'War and Peace' at 414 minutes---TWICE, as well as 'The Winds of War' and 'War and Remembrance' at 883 and 1620 minutes each), although I could not stick with 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. I even tried watching this film on two different occasions--and just found my mind wandering. It isn't that the acting is bad (the film is made up of wonderful actors such as John Hurt and Colin Firth). And, perhaps it isn't because the story sucks--as a bazillion copies of the book have been sold and it also was a very successful British TV series. No, to me the trouble is the mood. The director chose to film the movie in the most somber manner possible. As a result, despite being a spy film, there is almost no energy. And everything is GRAY--very, very gray. Despite 1973 being a year known for its outrageous colors, everyone in the film wears gray and brown suits---and even the brown looked rather gray! This, combined with oppressively dismal music just made this a very unpleasant viewing experience for me. So unpleasant, I just didn't care at all for the characters and was kind of hoping international Communism would win JUST to shake it up and provide some interest!! I know the film was Oscar-nominated and folks love it based on the reviews I read, but apart from 'Tree of Life', I can't think of a duller film that's received a nomination in recent years. I really wanted to like this.",4,64,118,26 April 2012
"I, Tonya"," The acting and direction were pretty amazing....
","Tonight I went to the opening night film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and it turned out to be 'I, Tonya'. I wasn't particularly thrilled about this, as I really didn't care much about seeing a biopic about Tonya Harding. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it as the film was exceptionally well directed and the acting was occasionally brilliant. In particular, Australian actress Margot Robbie was simply amazing as Harding—turning in the sort of performance that could mean an Oscar nomination. Likewise, Allison Janney was amazing as wellplaying Tonya's incredibly despicable mother. You really have to respect the great job both of them did in the filmas well as Robbie's learning to skate well in order to make this movie.The film is about the life of Tonya Harding.yes, THAT Tonya Hardingthe one who gained infamy for her part in the attack on rival ice skater Nancy Kerrigan back in 1994. My daughter was only a small child at the time of the attack and I told her nothing about Harding because I wanted to see her perspective on the story. Both of us left very impressed. However, I must put in a warning about the film. It is very violent.filled with intense and very realistic domestic violenceamong the most realistic I have ever seen. With my background as a psychotherapist, this churned up a lot of memories for me and the film often had me in tears. If you have been a victim of domestic violence, then I strongly urge you to think twice before you see the pictureor at least see it with someone you love. Seeing Tonya being slugged, slapped and even shot was tough to watch. Interestingly, often the audience responded by laughingan inappropriate but thoroughly understandable coping mechanism for such ugliness.Does the film excuse Harding's behaviors or paint her out to be a victim? Not reallyand if it had, the film would have been a waste of time. What it does do is help you at least understand who she was and why she did what she didas she was more than just an intense competitor who didn't come forward when she learned her husband and his friend had physically assaulted Tonya's competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. Overall, a fascinating look back to one of the most celebrated news stories of the 1990s.one that folks who are old fogies, like me, well remember!",8,138,174,19 October 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," it just didn't do much for me,...
","Every so often, I see a 'must see' movie and say to myself 'what's all the hoopla all about?' and this describes my reaction to this movie perfectly. I'm not saying it's a bad movie disguised as a good one (such as The English Patient or 2001) but it just seemed so incredibly ordinary. Now I know that my scoring the movie a 6 won't affect its overall score and there are TONS of reviews that say it was great, but I just hope against hope that I am not 100% alone on this. There were some scenes I liked, such as the fight scene, but so much of it left me cold (particularly the music--very popular then, but kinda hokey to me). If you want to see a better Redford and Newman pairing, watch THE STING.",6,16,30,18 October 2005
Moana," Exceptional...though the songs are only okay.
","'Moana' is the latest full length animated film from Disney and it's a worthy successor to its last CGI success, 'Zootopia'. While the film isn't perfect, it is very enjoyable and original.The story in 'Moana' is based y loosely on Polynesian folklorein particular, their trickster demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). Because of Maui's actions, nature is very slowly dying off and ruin is coming for Moana and her people. However, Moana's father, the Chief, is afraid of what lies beyond their island and forbids Moana from leaving on a journey to try to restore the lost heart to the Island Mother. Using pluck and determination, and with a bit of help from Maui, Moana makes this journey. This synopsis might sound very strange and confusingand it's best you just see the film for yourself. Suffice to say, it is a real crowd pleaser due to an interesting, stunning computer animation and very original story as well as some interesting characters. I particularly liked Moana as she was strong and likableand not someone needing rescuing. But she also wasn't harsh or stereotypicaljust determined. I also loved her pet sidekick, as this chicken is nothing like any Disney sidekickand you'll soon realize this animal is possibly the dumbest in Disney historyas well as very funny.. As for Dwayne Johnson ('The Rock') he was also very goodand I was surprised that he had a decent singing voice in the film. As for the singing in general, however, this is the weakest aspect of the film. While most of the songs are enjoyable, a few are quite forgettable and none have that singability you look for in a full-length Disney cartoon. You'll almost certainly not be singing or humming the tunes once the film has concluded.Finally, I'd like to point out that I really loved the look of the film. I've visited the South Pacific and New Zealand and the movie really does a great job of capturing the look and spirit of this part of the world. It's also nice that kids in this part of the world now finally have their own Disney princessone who isn't a carbon copy of other Disney females.",8,10,37,22 November 2016
Crash," Sublime...
","'Crash' won the 2006 Oscar for Best Picture. I don't quite understand that, as IMDb lists the release date as 2004. Well, whatever...all I know is that it is without much doubt one of the most unique and emotional films I have ever seen. While it is NOT a film I recommend to everyone (see later in my review for more on this), it's a brilliantly creative film that is more like riding an insane roller coaster for 110 minutes! Seriously.Describing the plot in this film is VERY difficult. In fact, if I tried, the film might seem ordinary but it certainly isn't. Suffice to say that the movie consists of many separate stories in Los Angeles that all come together in a strange tapestry. And, most of the stories involve gun violence, race prejudice and misunderstandings. I just can't say much more to describe it--see it and experience an emotional film that will leave you numb and make your heart skip a few beats.Now as I said above, the film is not for everyone--though it is brilliant. There's a lot of harsh language (necessary for the plot--not gratuitous) and the movie is a serious emotional roller coaster. You will probably feel about to cry and it will affect you--I can't see how it can't. It's amazing, actually, but so intense that I don't recommend it to kids or folks with a weak heart (I am serious). Watch it and be amazed.sublime--something that is beyond words.",10,2,6,13 February 2012
Snatch," Good, but it's not a film for most folks....
","My summary sounds a bit vague, so let me explain. 'Snatch.' is a very, very, very bloody and violent film. It also has a lot of very rough language and a bit of nudity. So, it's obviously not a film you show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins!! This isn't as much a complaint as an observation--one you really should heed before you try watching the film. I just can't see most folks gravitating to a movie like this one, though if you do, it IS incredibly unique and well made.This film begins with a jewel robbery in which a nearly baseball-sized diamond is stolen. While this might seem like a great thing for the thieves, it sets of a LONG series of violent events as practically every gang in the UK seems willing to kill to get it. Most of these gangs are insanely dangerous, while some are comically stupid and a few are really hard to size up. Repeatedly, folks are killed and repeatedly the diamond changes hands. Who, ultimately, will get the diamond and who will survive? You'll have no idea up until the final crazy ending.'Snatch.' is an incredibly stylish film--quite artistic in the way it is pieced together. It is even more stylish than Tarantino's 'Kill: Bill' movies. And, the plot is amusing (while it isn't nauseating or scaring the life out of you). A thoroughly unpredictable and ROUGH film. If it's the sort of thing you like, you'll love it. As for me, I rate the film highly but it really isn't the sort of thing I like because of its excesses and I felt a bit uneasy laughing through the carnage (and, oddly, the film is quite funny). Worth seeing for the right crowd.",9,1,5,12 August 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," This gets better with repeated viewings--what a film!
","I saw this film originally when I was about 12 and I wasn't super-impressed by it--particularly since my father was a bit like George C. Scott's character in the film!! However, years later (long after the threat from nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union has greatly diminished), I was a lot older and experienced and thought the film was brilliant--and not the 'Commie Plot' my Dad had envisioned!The film features some amazing performances that are absolutely mesmerizing. Sterling Hayden is excellent as the schizophrenic general that orders a first strike on the USSR--he's gruff, weird but pretty believable. However, his performance is unfortunately overshadowed by two other actors. My favorite of these was George C. Scott. Although he didn't need to do the amazing multiple roles that Peter Sellers did (the man was AMAZING), the one character he played was hilarious and chilling. He was the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and you just have to see and hear him to believe him. Although technically NOT schizophrenic like Hayden, he was a totally insane general that actually seemed to look forward to a nuclear war with the '!@&%@# Ruskies!'. His swagger and bravado was perfectly balanced with all the truly stupid things the character unintentionally said--again and again.Now as for Sellers, he was such a great character actor but all too often, he was remembered more for Inspector Clousseau (a good character, but only one of MANY the man was capable of doing) or he was remembered for all the BAD movies he did in his lifetime. It seems for every great film he made (such as THE MOUSE THAT ROARED or BEING THERE), he also made crap (such as THE PRISONER OF ZENDA or THE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU). His lack of discernment tended to hide his brilliance. And, in Dr. Strangelove he was absolutely brilliant--playing three totally different roles. As the British Colonel, he was quite believable and underplayed the role. As the President, he was a little more comical and yet pretty convincing. And, as Dr. Strangelove, he was an over-the-top ex-Nazi (not all that 'ex' if you ask me) madman. The variety was stunning and almost without precedent--except for a very similar multiple role situation Sellers also played in 1959's THE MOUSE THAT ROARED--another brilliant comedy about nuclear war.In addition to the great acting and writing, I do have to take my hat off to Stanley Kubrick. In past IMDb reviews, I was not particularly kind to several of his 'masterpieces' (I am one of those who actually disliked 2001, CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON). However, I hope I am intellectually honest enough to view his films individually (PATHS OF GLORY, THE KILLING and SPARTACUS were wonderful).The bottom line is that this is a great film and can be enjoyed by anyone who has a decent handle on world events and history. Unfortunately, for a generation that now is at times obsessed with Paris Hilton and SURVIVOR, I also believe that the film is quickly becoming one that is simply beyond the capacity of many to even comprehend, as they can't even remember the past and have no trouble living that way.",10,7,14,15 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Incredibly graphic...so think twice about watching this one....
","'Pan's Labyrimth' is an exceptionally good film in many ways...but I am apprehensive to recommend it without first providing a warning. The film is brutally violent...more than most any film I've seen. The violence is so realistic and awful that I cannot imagine it wouldn't be a chore for many viewers to watch it to the finish. After all, who wants to see close-ups of a guy getting his face smashed in, another guy sewing his face back together or someone being tortured? You're in for that and MUCH more if you see this strange yet strangely violent story set in post Civil War Spain.The film is set in the early 1940s...a few years after the Civil War has ended officially. However, pockets of resistance still remain and an incredibly sadistic and brutal Captain is out to root out this resistance even if it means murder and torture. Through the course of the film, he torments most everyone around him and you see much of it through the eyes of his new step-daughter, Ofelia.As for Ofelia, she is a child who either sees magical beings or is insane...and you aren't exactly sure which during the film. She sees a magic faun and fairies and they seem very real to her. The faun gives her tasks to do and she sometimes does them wrong...supposedly because she had a strongly oppositional streak within her. Or, she simply could have been insane...and you never really are sure which.So what did I like? Well, the scenes with the faun and other magical creatures were incredible--quite beautiful and amazing to watch. On the other, the story, despite its unusual and interesting aspects, is grim and awful. I much prefer the writer/director's other films such as 'Crimson Peak' or 'The Devil's Backbone'. Both seemed less nihilistic and grim. It is finely crafted....just not all that pleasant to watch.",6,2,11,5 June 2016
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Well worth seeing.
","'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is a film about the life of Milkha Singh--a man who is beloved in India but who I'd never heard about before I saw this movie. He is about the most famous Olympic non-winner you can find--and the film begins with him coming in 4th in the 400 at the Rome Olympics.The film is non-liner in style, as it goes from this even in 1960 back a few years to when Singh enlisted in the Indian Army to his childhood. But, unusually, it bounces back and forth repeatedly--and might confuse some viewers.The big reason for this film is not only because Singh was a three-time Olympian (only two times are mentioned in the film) or an Asian champion but because of his roots. He was born in a region that was India but became part of Pakistan after the partition in 1947. This was a serious problem for Singh and his family, as they were Sikhs--and non-Muslims were apparently not welcome there. This isn't surprising, as the partition resulted in the deaths of anywhere from 200,000 to a million according to some estimates--on both sides of the border (everybody seemed to be killing each other in the name of god!). So, that Singh's family was displaced and his father murdered isn't surprising. Years later, the Indians and Pakistanis were planning a joint competition--and Singh would be an important part of that team. However, because of his past, his participation was doubtful and the film chronicles this.While this is a sports drama, I wasn't surprised that, yes, there were still several song and dance numbers. Not all Indian films have this but a huge percentage do--so expect a few nice musical interludes. Additionally, expect AMAZING cinematography, direction and special effects--making it equal in quality to the films of any nation. What really impressed me as well as Farhan Akhtar as Singh. Farhan really buffed himself up for the film and was a very impressive looking guy with his taut figure and muscles. He really LOOKED like a world-class athlete. Overall, an enjoyable film and one well worth your time.",8,1,1,11 February 2014
Megamind," Sort of like 'Despicable Me' but for an older audience...
","I think that the timing of the release of 'Megamind' hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, 'Despicable Me', which came out shortly before 'Megamind' made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that 'Despicable Me' stole 'Megamind''s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.So what's my verdict? Well, frankly I think both films are about equally good but have a slightly different audience. 'Despicable Me' is clearly marketed more to kids and has cuteness as its advantage. The minions from 'Despicable Me' are magnificent and adorable. It's also a tad formulaic--but not bad at all despite the predictability. 'Megamind', however, is more a film for teens and adults--as cuteness is not really something I'd associate with the movie. It also has a few more surprises and a more adult sense of humor. My wife and oldest daughter preferred 'Megamind' while I preferred 'Despicable Me'--but we all agreed that both were really nice films.I could say a lot more about the film, but since it's now out on DVD and already has a ton of reviews, I'll pass. Suffice to say it's well worth seeing and is excellent entertainment.",8,8,10,30 April 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Brilliantly executed but highly disturbing
","Sweeney Todd is an old story that is not based on a real 19th century murderer--despite some recent rumors that this legend is true. Though the original story has changed a bit over the years, the basic elements remain. A man is wrongly convicted and returns years later to exact revenge--slicing the throats of the wicked (and sometimes innocent) and then having the bodies disposed of in meat pies sold to the unsuspecting public! The movie is based on the Sondheim musical. Over the years, there have been other non-musical versions of the fabled story of Sweeney Todd, but Stephen Sondheim has truly popularized this grisly tale of revenge and madness. However, if you are used to the Rogers and Hammerstein or Lerner and Loewe style of musicals, be prepared for a wildly different sort of musical. This isn't just because of the very, very dark subject matter but also the style of singing. Unlike these other famous musical teams, SWEENEY TODD does not offer songs that you will quickly find yourself humming or will hear on an elevator. That's because this production isn't a traditional musical with catchy lyrics, but where the dialog is sung to music--somewhat like the wonderful UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG (wow, aside from this, you can't find two films more unalike). And since the emphasis is on dialog that is sung, the style may take a lot of getting used to. Plus, you probably WON'T find yourself tapping your feet and humming to the amazingly fast-paced and somewhat maniacal music. About the only really traditional style song is the lovely 'Joanna'.This style singing does take some getting used to, though this film adaptation of the musical is much more approachable to the casual viewer. That's because in the play, many of the songs are sung in a crazy and cacophonous manner--with many singers across the stage singing DIFFERENT parts that generally DON'T harmonize well with each other. This strange and sometimes painful style was done to emphasize Sweeney's madness and I understood the symbolism--I just didn't particularly like it and I was thrilled that these twisted chorusers were absent from the film. Instead, the music was sung by either individuals or in duets (which were ALSO often sung very separately but with much less cacophony than an entire chorus). My daughter, quite the purist and lover of theater told me she missed this aspect of the film--she WANTED the insane chorus. As for me and the average audience member, I am sure this change by Tim Burton is a welcome one. The bottom line is that the stage style was just too annoying and headache-evoking.While I am talking about the songs, I must point out that despite originally feeling very skeptical about casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in the leads (after all, they're NOT known for their singing ability), they and the rest of the cast did quite well. I am sure that the modern ability to make practically ANYONE a singing sensation (such as Hillary Duff or Ashlee Simpson) was employed, but it did work. Now this isn't to say that they or the rest of the cast have gorgeous and melodious voices--they don't. But, for this style of film, it worked perfectly. Had they been cast in a remake of THE SOUND OF MUSIC or some other more traditional musical, it probably wouldn't have worked. Oddly, despite their being more than competent in the roles, I have heard some snipes about them and I can assure you they DID do well and were well cast.Now as for the rest of the film, I must STRONGLY urge caution, as this is one of the most violent films I have ever seen. Sure, some films show many more deaths but the closeup shots of throats being slit and profuse torrents of blood is NOT for the squeamish nor is the sight of seeing the corpses splat onto the floor below as they are dropped through the trap door. I noticed several in the theater covering their eyes during the murder scenes--including my daughter. It's not for the faint-hearted and really is up close and brutal in how it depicts the killings. It worked--the murders looked very vivid and real--perhaps too real. With a little more left to the imagination with the killings, I really think the film might have worked a tad better for the average viewer. I have a very high tolerance for this stuff (probably partly due to my being a human biology minor in college), but most will cringe at all the carnage.Now as for the aesthetics of the film. As you probably would expect, director Burton did his usual marvelous job. The dankness and awfulness of a Dickensian England is vivid and convincing. The plethora of roaches and rats also heightened this awful realism as did the terrible dental work of the actors. Unlike many films set in this era that featured actors with lovely capped teeth, the actors here abounded with crooked teeth! What I particularly liked about the film and what really jumped out at me was the cinematography--how almost everything was done in sepia and gray tones. There were a few exceptions but these were wonderful and were designed as the occasional and shocking contrast (such as the blueness of Pirelli's clothes or the intensity of the blood). Additionally, the fantasy sequence was extremely colorful and this made it one of the most striking and funny scenes in the film--quite appropriate to the mood.So overall, apart from the intensity of the violence, this was a great film and a nice improvement over the Sondheim stage production due to its wickedly dark humor and style.",9,13,21,23 December 2007
Blades of Glory," Totally stupid--and I liked it!!
","BLADES OF GLORY seems like a natural follow-up to Will Farrell's TALLADEGA NIGHTS, as its spirit and silliness are sure reminiscent of this wonderful comedy. However, here the setting is ice skating and Jon Heder ('Napoleon Dynamite') is also the co-star.The film begins with Heder and Farrell tying for the gold medal in the world championship that is obviously supposed to be the Olympics. However, the Olympics are an extremely litigious organization and would have sued the studio for every penny they could get, so the Olympic trademark rings were changed and the word 'Olympics' never were uttered in the film. Despite both men winning the men's individual gold, however, they were bitter rivals and began a hilarious fight on the podium--with horribly unexpected results. In retaliation, the men are stripped of their medals and banned from Men's Figure Skating. However, later they learn that this did NOT mean that they could not compete in pairs and they men create the most unusual skating team in history!! Now before you read on, it's very, very important that if you see the film you are the type person who can suspend disbelief. Sure, the moves they make aren't legal, two guys are NOT allowed to skate in pairs skating and the film is chock-full of impossibilities....and don't even get me started on the ending!! The bottom line is that if you are a nit-picking twit, you'll drive yourself crazy making sense of the impossibilities in the movie. My advice is to resist this urge strongly and just sit back and enjoy. The film is hilarious and it's amazing to see Farrell and Heder skate as well as they did (though it's obvious that some CGI was used--believe me, NO ONE could do much of what was done in the film!).Original and exceptionally silly and stupid, this is a great 'turn off your brain and enjoy' sort of film (much like TALLADEGA NIGHTS). While I often like very cerebral films and art films, sometimes I just need a liberal does of stupid and fun and this film fits the bill very nicely.",8,1,2,7 September 2008
Malcolm X," It inspired me...
","As I watched MALCOLM X, I was surprised how much I liked the film and how interesting it was. So interesting, in fact, that I soon was inspired to read 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' that was compiled and written by Alex Haley. Then, I read a rather interesting (warts and all) account of Malcolm X's mentor, Elijah Mohammad.From what I have since learned from these and other sources, I was quite impressed at the movie--it seemed to try very hard to get the story right. Malcolm X's life was neither over-glorified nor was he portrayed the opposite--the story seemed to be quite balanced and without a serious ax to grind. It would have been easy to make the movie just an attack on the Nation of Islam or an attempt to make the title character some sort of saint.As for the acting, it was super. The script, excellent. The direction, first-rate. An excellent film that everyone should see--it is fascinating from start to finish.",10,5,11,26 September 2009
Nacho Libre," Basically, a one-joke film.
","The title 'Nacho Libre' is a take-off on the Mexican word for wrestling, Lucha Libre. And, as far as Nacho goes, the title character is named Ignacio and Nacho is a variation of this name...sort of like James and Jim or Richard and Dick.Ignacio (Jack Black) is a monk, though he longs to be a wrestler. And, after finding a most unlikely looking partner, they both enter the world of Mexican wrestling. Ultimately, however, he is worried what will happen when the other monks discover what he's doing in his spare time.This really is the movie...period. Monk becomes wrestler. Not a lot of jokes and Black's character becomes a bit tiresome after a bit. Purely a time-passer and not much more.",6,4,6,21 February 2019
The Best Years of Our Lives," My vote for best American film of all-time
","Wow. I have a ton of reviews and never got around to reviewing one of my very favorite films. While I know you can't really say which movie is best, I really can't think of another film off the top of my head that is better. I can easily see how it made the top 250 and think it would probably be rated a lot higher if it had come out recently--as the 250 is very much skewed towards newer films.I think the biggest reason I love the film is the casting. While Frederic March and Dana Andrews were genuine stars at the time, they were not huge names like Gable, Stewart or Grant. I love these three actors but think the film benefited from March (who was no longer the handsome matinée idol he'd been in the 30s) and Andrews (who played an 'everyman'-type guy in most of his films). Plus, the genius of casting Harold Russell as the third returning serviceman cannot be minimized. While I hate movies that patronize the handicapped (I have a deaf daughter and cringe at patronizing), Russell's performance was anything but and was amazingly honest and powerful--earning him a very well-deserved special Oscar for his performance, not his disability. The family and friends of these men also worked out so very well. I just can't say enough positive about it.And, of course, the choice of actors and the type performance they gave was due in large part to William Wyler--my vote as the greatest director ever. Why he is not recognized as every bit the genius that Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosawa or Kubrick were, I don't know (actually, I think he was far better than all these directors with the exception of Kurosawa, but that's a discussion for another place). If you don't believe me about his genius, do an IMDb search on the films he made--no other director comes close in the sheer number of great films. Plus, watch the film at least two or three times and you'll notice all the fantastic scenes--wonderful camera shots (like the ones in the nosecone of the airplane) or scenes involving real people (such as the one with Harold Russell with his fiancé as she tucks him into bed--I am fighting off tears now just thinking about it).This film also has an unbelievable script--pure, real and captivating throughout! A film about returning war vets could have been trite or jingoistic, but this one maintains it dignity and humanity throughout. I challenge you to watch this and not be impressed. Unless you are a member or Al-Qaeda or a 100% America-hater, you will be hooked. And this means that French or British or Italians or those of any other nationality should be able to find so much to love and appreciate from this film than transcends nations.",10,12,17,11 July 2006
Battleship Potemkin," Complete propaganda but technically brilliant
","At the onset, it must be understood that this film was a propaganda piece that was made with the backing of the new Soviet government. I doubt that director Eisenstein had a lot of control over the product as it had to conform to what the government demanded,...or else! And, as far as producing a propaganda film to commemorate the abortive 1905 Revolution goes, he did an exceptional job! So good that it took years for Stalin to get around to persecuting the director and purging several of his later films (now THAT'S gratitude 'Stalin-style').The film is a pretty simple movie that concerns a real-life rebellion on the Russian naval ship POTEMKIN as well as an uprising in Odessa by the masses. And, from what I was able to learn, the story was probably relatively faithful to the events though they were of course dramatized a bit here and there. Despite the movie making it appear that all the officers on board were killed, the crew killed several but others were allowed to live. Also, the incredibly sensationalistic and evil character of the insane-looking priest on board the ship was just a very clumsy attempt by the Soviets to ridicule their enemy--organized religion. But, the crew really DID rebel, the citizens of the city really were massacred by the army and the Potemkin did actually escape unscathed because the other ships refused to fire on her. Unfortunately, what happened next was never covered in the film and I wish it had been. While it made it look as if perhaps the other ships joined Potemkin in rebellion, this wasn't the case. Instead, the ship defected to Romania and most of the crew either stayed there or returned after the 1917 revolution--the few that returned sooner were prosecuted.If you ignore some inconsistencies and over-the-top priest character, the rest of the film is brilliant, moving and was a very effective piece. Compared to other Hollywood productions, the camera-work was amazing--with crane shots, cameras that seamlessly moved with the action and terrific dramatic scenes that made you almost wish you, too, were a Communist.I noticed that there were quite a few negative reviews and those who felt the film was overrated. While I do agree its reputation is greatly overrated, I can't agree with scores of 1, 2 or 3 stars, as technically the film is well-made and effective compared to other films of the day. Don't let the film's political bias make you dismiss it unfairly, but also do not accept the film as Gospel (that's an interesting choice of words considering the Atheist Soviet government, eh?).",9,8,11,29 July 2006
Elf," Enjoyable fluff.
","'Elf' is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!",7,3,5,20 December 2011
Taxi Driver," It's very violent and unpleasant...though well made.
","Some movies just confuse me. They have fabulous reputations but I find them difficult to like due to their excessive and pointless violence. Well, I may just be 'out of touch', since this movie is in the top 50 on IMDb ratings. However, I also worry that this film and other ultra-violent films like SCARFACE (the Pacino version) are adored by so many. We live in a violent world--that's a fact. And, I wonder how much of that violence is either exacerbated by it or it encourages good people to become desensitized to violence or even find it exciting. I hope to think I am better than that.Now I am not saying that there weren't some really good elements to the movie and it was very well made. But, the film is so thoroughly soaked in violence and human waste that the good is grossly overshadowed. Just because the people De Niro kills at the end are bad guys doesn't mean it is entertaining or less offensive. Regardless, these sort of films are not something I enjoy.",5,5,17,6 July 2018
Shutter Island," I know it's convoluted and slow, but stick with this one...really.
","2010 was very good to Leonardo DiCaprio. Shedding his pretty little boy image, he played in two very gritty and similar films, 'Shutter Island' and 'Inception'. I saw them both and enjoyed them both. And, to buck the tide, I'd have to say I actually liked 'Shutter Island' a little more...really. Now do NOT just rush out to rent this one, as I can't see this film appealing to everyone. It IS confusing. The plot can feel a bit tiresome and slow. But, if you are very patient, it all comes together perfectly--with the last 15 minutes totally enthralling me. I think part of it is because I am a retired psychotherapist and psychology teacher--and the film is a great psychological drama. And, the story actually is consistent psychologically and is actually plausible.Now I could recap the plot, but currently there are something like a bazillion reviews on IMDb for this film. Instead, let's talk about what I liked. First and foremost, the writing was simply great--very intelligent and well-crafted. It really makes you think and doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence. Second, the acting is really good. DiCaprio was excellent, but having Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow REALLY made this a wonderful picture. Watch this one...it's currently on premium cable. And, it's also a film that bear re-watching as there are many layers to the film you won't notice the first time.",9,6,15,8 July 2011
Life of Pi," What's one more review?!
","By the time I got to see this film, the Oscars were long past and there already were a ton of reviews for 'Life of Pi'. On top of that, I have noticed that for big pictures which most everyone likes, I rarely have much to say. After all, I agree with the majority--'Life of Pi' is a very good film. So, my review will be brief.THE reason to watch this film is pretty simple: You cannot say that the movie reminds you of anything you've ever seen before or since. Sure, you could try comparing 'Life of Pi' to 'Avatar'--but that is only because they both used gobs of CGI to create fantastic stories. But the story itself, is so original. In addition, the acting, direction and artistry of the movie is tops. While I would agree with the Oscar folks that 'Argo' was a better film, it wasn't by much. Well worth your time.",8,2,7,11 April 2013
Chak de! India," Extremely formulaic but also quite enjoyable.
","'Chak De India!' is a sports film, and like MOST other sports films, it's nearly 100% predictable. However, while it very closely follows the expected formula and has many of the usual sports films clichés, it manages to be enjoyable and worth while.The film begins with a world championship match between the Indian and Pakistani field hockey teams. Kabir misses what seems like a sure goal and then he is treated abominably by the Indian press and his community--as if he WANTED his team to lose! Seven years pass. Now Kabir wants to redeem himself but not as a player but as a coach for a new Indian WOMEN'S field hockey team. His odds look pretty much impossible except for one important thing--it's a sports film and you pretty much know how it's all going to occur! But, as I said above, the plot does offer a bit more. Some nice performances and a few tiny plot twists help it to be a good film.By the way, although you might expect the usual song and dance numbers like you usually see in Bollywood films, this one has none. My aunt was actually pretty disappointed. She really liked the film but wanted the musical numbers as well!",7,1,1,3 October 2012
Lost in Translation," Amazingly sterile and disconnected
","Bill Murray plays a famous actor named Bob who goes to Japan to do an ad campaign for big bucks. The problem is, he's experiencing a bit of a crisis before he arrived (a sense of disconnection with his wife and kids), and being in a totally alien culture, he is even more lost and alone. Some of the observations about the way that the Japanese do business and behave are pretty interesting, but there aren't enough of them after the first twenty minutes or so. Having a Westerner come to Japan and feel lost and overwhelmed is an interesting starting point for a film. Unfortunately, the film never really seemed to go anywhere after this interesting start. Plus, the characters (especially Bill Murray's) ultimately turned out to be rather selfish, so I really didn't care about them.The main theme of this movie is a sense of disconnectedness. Unfortunately, in making the two leads (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) feel alone and disconnected in Japan, the audience, too, feels pretty much the same way about these leads as well as the movie as a whole. As a result, the movie is extremely somber, sterile and moves at a snail's pace. Both Johansson and especially Murray seem to almost sleepwalk through their roles--showing very little energy or emotion. Overall, it's a sometimes interesting but sleep-inducing experiment that failed. After seeing this and THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, it seems Murray's career is stagnating. While critics might enjoy these films, they are NOT what the average person would enjoy. As for me, I much prefer the funny Bill Murray of WHAT ABOUT BOB? and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE.By the way, if you DO like seeing Murray play a zombie-like character like he did in this film, then I suggest you also watch BROKEN FLOWERS--another recent film where he gives an identical performance with absolutely no emotional range.",3,9,24,1 April 2007
Tangled," wonderful...
","I was frankly quite amazed by this film. After all, last year Pixar brought us 'Up' and this year Dreamworks brought us 'How to Train Your Dragon'—there was no way that anyone could produce a CGI film that is every bit as good, could they?! Yet, surprisingly, I adored 'Tangled' and enjoyed it just as much as these other films—showing that we are in a period of time when amazingly wonderful computer animation has become the norm.'Tangled' is wonderful for two main reasons. Foremost, the animation style is so new and vibrant—and looks so much unlike all the other recent CG I films. I read that Disney deliberately tried to create a computer-generated film that looked a lot like a traditionally animated film—and the exquisitely rendered backgrounds attest to the fact that they achieved this goaland more. The other reason I adored it was because the film had a magnificent sense of humor—making a very simple story much, much more enjoyable. The animal friends (the horse and chameleon) were terrific and the film had me laughing repeatedly—particularly with its surprisingly adorable barbarian hoard (who, incidentally, remind me a lot of the Capital One commercials' Vikings). The final reason I loved the film, though it's not as prominent as the other two reasons, is the wonderful love story. The final scene of self-sacrifice by the male hero is touching—and set my tear ducts flowing.By the way, it turns out the only thing about the film I did NOT love (the similarity of the ending to that of Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast') was NOT the fault of bad writing—it's actually one of the few aspects of the that is from the original fairy tale! This tidbit comes from my amazing older daughter who is a folklore major.The bottom line—watch this film! You'll be glad you did—and it's much better than it appears to be based on the TV commercials and previews.",10,24,27,29 December 2010
Barry Lyndon," Gee,...I feel like such an unsophisticated boob!
","This is a movie that is often hailed as a masterpiece because of its godlike director, Stanley Kubrick. And I know I'm going to get some serious negative reactions out there, but I really didn't like this movie at all and think it's one of the most overrated films of the 1970s.This is a costume drama that looks very pretty on the surface, but down deep it lacks a soul and any trace of warmth or humanity. Ryan O'Neil is inexplicably chosen to play the title character, though why this American was chosen I have no idea--particularly since, at times, he appeared to be half asleep during the film. This movie is just dreadfully dull and uninteresting.I seriously wonder what would have happened if a lesser-known or obscure director had made this film. I'm sure it wouldn't have received all the kudos and people might have recognized that it was a poor film.After noting all the 'not helpful' scores given to the other reviewers who panned this movie on IMDb, I guess I'll just sit back and wait for them to start pouring my way!",3,48,99,8 July 2006
Interstellar," Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?!
","The first 80-90% of 'Interstellar' I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful 'Gravity', it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.",8,16,38,22 February 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Very well made--tough to watch.
","Warning--This movie is NOT for young kids or those who do not wish to see violence and adult content, as it's rather brutal and the language is pretty rough. Now I am not complaining about this, but this is clearly an adult film intended for adults. It's hard to really do this sort of film without making it this intense--just be forewarned. In addition, this is a very tense and unpleasant sort of film--be aware of this before watching.This film has a ton of reviews, so my summarizing the film or going into any sort of in-depth analysis is probably a giant waste of time. And, Bob the Moo has done such a good job of reviewing it, I say you just go read his! In brief, here's what I liked or at least respected in the film: It had a very gritty realism and managed to pull the viewer into it very, very well. The first portion (in boot camp) and the second portion (in Vietnam) were very different but both were very tense and compelling. While it wasn't pretty, it was well done.And, in brief, here's what I didn't like: The constant and clichéd use of rock and pop music. A few decades ago, this would have been innovative. Now, FULL METAL JACKET sounds an awful lot like GOOD MORNING Vietnam and APOCALYPSE NOW and other films. The constant blaring soundtrack was, I suppose, meant to be surreal and illustrate how ludicrous the war was. However, I just thought hearing 'Surfin' Bird' was annoying and a cheap use of music. Apart from that, there isn't anything to say negative about the film.Is this the greatest anti-war film? No. Its message (like the war) was rather mixed at times and lacked the same impact of films like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or WESTFRONT 1918, but it sure did come close.",9,2,2,1 July 2009
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Bits and pieces are wonderful but the whole doesn't add up to a great picture.
","So far, this film has an IMDb rating of 8.3...and this is extraordinarily high. But the film has been in festivals and I am sure the rating will change some when the film is in general release. As for me, I think it's incredibly overrated.The story is about an angry mom, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Her daughter was brutally murdered and raped...and the police haven't been able to do anything with the case. So, in desperation and anger, she rents out three billboards and calls the local Police Chief (Woody Harrelson) to task for this. Surprisingly, most of the town comes down against Mildred...who was just exercising her First Amendment rights. What happens from there...well, just see the film.There were many wonderful scenes and characters in this picture. But, there were also many main characters who were just god-awful and unlikable...including Mildred! In fact, later in the film when she thinks the police department has wronged her, she burns down the building and accidentally flames one of the cops! So, no one who is a main character in the film is nice or likable...making this movie a bit of a hard-sell. Too much cussing (even by 2017 standards), very crude language and overall nastiness prevent this one from being a must- see film.",6,21,44,27 October 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," While a tad too sentimental and not always accurate historically, it's a very impressive and heart-rending film
","This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as 'Ma') was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as 'the Preacher'). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the 'Okies' had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement. See for yourself--it makes interesting reading at: http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm",8,11,19,15 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Un-fun and rather unnecessary.
","I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for 'The Rise of Skywalker', as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.I won't recount the plot here...mostly because the film was non-stop and most plot elements lasted mere minutes. The folks went from one deadly fight to another to another to another...and much of the first portion of the film turned out to be unnecessary.I am NOT a 'Comicbook Guy' who complains that the film isn't true to the original three or other such nonsense. I have gone to all the films and enjoyed them (with the exception of 'Episode 3'...but few enjoyed that movie)...and I really enjoyed some of the more recent ones. But I disliked much of 'Episode IX' because it seems like J.J. Abrams is trying to undo so much of what Rian Johnson did in 'Episode VIII'. Sad...but I liked 'Episode VIII'. Instead of relationships and characters, 'Episode IX' is pretty much only about explosions, near misses and more explosions....as well as long dead characters suddenly coming back to life for no good reason.All in all, a joyless mass of explosions and a film I should have just skipped. The theater also was showing 'Knives Out' (By Johnson) and that film was FUN. 'Star Wars: Episode IX' is simply un-fun.",5,22,32,6 January 2020
Pacific Rim," A mindless must-see.
","I usually don't watch action films. They just aren't my sort of thing. However, my daughter insisted that I watch 'Pacific Rim' and I was feeling absolutely horrible when I watched the film, as I had just gone through some painful surgery that morning. So, to take my mind off my aches, I gave it a try. And, thankfully, it turned out to be exactly the sort of tonic I needed--entertaining and crazy fun. While I didn't see it in the theater (the best way to see this type of movie), I did see it on a very large screen at home and watching it on a small screen is practically a waste of time. For once, I loved that a film has eye- popping visuals, explosions and action--and it manages to deliver an entertaining experience without leaving you feeling dumb for having enjoyed it--a problem too often associated with movie of this style. Well worth your time.",8,5,6,16 January 2015
Empire of the Sun," A misfire....though a nice looking misfire.
","Like so many of Steven Spielberg's films, this one received a butt-load of Oscar nominations--but no wins ('Empire of the Sun' was nominated for six technical awards).The movie begins with a VERY young Christian Bale playing a bratty and rather annoying child of British nationals living very well in war-torn China just before the British and Americans were pulled into this war. Like too many westerners, his family seemed to care very little about the war or the Chinese people so it feels a bit like karma when the war does come and the child is separated from his parents when Shanghai is invaded. For the rest of the film, the child grows up a scrounger--eking out a survival in a Japanese-run internment camp. Life is miserable and the film VERY episodic--as it jumps very quickly from December, 1941 to 1945--with nothing in-between.While the film has many glowing reviews, I couldn't help but feel extremely disconnected from the movie. Part of it, as I mentioned above, is the episodic quality of the film. Part of it is because Christian Bale's character is amazingly tough to like. Initially, he's a really annoying kid. Later, he's not as bad but with the ENTIRE film resting on young Bale's shoulders, it just becomes tedious. In fact, this VERY slow pacing is the biggest problem with the film, as about 30 minutes could have been sliced out of it OR they could have developed more of the adult characters. Regardless, I really couldn't wait for this technically astounding but very dull film to end.",6,8,17,28 December 2011
Glory," One of the very best war movies ever.
","Before I talk specifically about this movie, I was very surprised in 1990 during the Academy Awards ceremony. Denzel Washington got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in 'Glory'--even though I felt that Morgan Freeman did a better job in this film. On top of that, Freeman had also turned in a masterful performance this same year in 'Driving Miss Daisy'. Now I am not putting down Washington's acting--he was fine. But to me, it was more Freeman's film and he stood out furthest among this nice ensemble cast.The biggest reasons I liked the movie so much were because it had a deeper message than just war and because it tried to get things right historically. As far as the message goes, it was about racism and black men proving themselves during the Civil War. This was very uplifting and exciting to watch. It also was lovely because as a history teacher, I so often HATE how historical films get all the facts wrong. Here, while it isn't perfect, it is sure close!! I'd say more, but frankly there are already a ton of reviews for this film--suffice to say as a recently retired history teacher, I couldn't recommend the film more.",10,1,3,11 December 2011
Forrest Gump," 6 Oscars for this?!
","Please understand that despite my summary, I did enjoy this clever film. There was a lot to like. However, little of the film seemed Oscar-worthy and it probably should not be in the IMDb top 250. I think this is a great case of a very good film that has been prematurely elevated to greatness.As far as the plot goes, with zillions of reviews on IMDb for this film, I won't even bother. The acting was very good, the special effects ranged from freakin' amazing (such as digitally removing Lt. Dan's leg--quite an achievement for 1994) to very, very poor (inexplicably, despite Forrest being expertly inserted in many scenes, the one with John Lennon was very sloppy and the seams were very, very obvious on the big screen). The negatives included a few problems with continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by Gump in the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story. Still, it's a very enjoyable film and one you can't help but like. But winning 6 Oscars?! It must have been a very, very slow year.",8,10,32,9 June 2008
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.
","'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' is probably the most famous work of Danish film maker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).Now I must say that although I greatly admired this, there was, at times, a downside. The actress that played Joan (Maria Falconetti) often looked downright crazed--like she was off her medication and reeeaalllly needed it!! While this could actually be true (after all, she was seeing things and having conversations with dead folks), I doubt if Dreyer wanted his audience to think Joan of Arc was nuts--as she so often appeared in the film. This is sad, really, as at other times, Ms. Falconetti did a masterful job--showing great sorrow and crying most convincingly. But, in many cases, after crying and emoting wonderfully, moments later she was staring off into space like she was stoned. I know this film is considered one of the great films of the silent age, but I don't know how this can be based on the truly bizarre and inconsistent characterization of Joan. Yes, I dare question Dreyer's brilliance in this respect. Overall, there's a lot to love and a lot that makes you question the film's 'classic' status. Very good...just not great.",8,7,14,6 April 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Of all the Pixar movies, this is among the very best
","Aside from TOY STORY II (which I loved), this might just be the best film Pixar has released. It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film. If you haven't seen this film, get off you behind and see it--it's great stuff and kids as well as adults will love this film.",9,3,9,10 June 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Exceptional in almost every way...
","I just returned from the midnight opening of 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and I must say that I am a nut to be sitting here writing this review at 3am! But, considering how pumped I felt after seeing the film, I guess this is understandable.When the film began, the history teacher part of me was quite happy. Many films purport to try to replicate WWII and many fail miserably. However, aside from all the anachronisms (many of which were in the original WWII-era Captain America comics), the film got the look right. I think having Joe Johnston direct has a lot to do with this, as his job with 'The Rocketeer' was also excellent in this regard. Getting down the look and style of the time is a big plus. Sure, the special effects were absolutely grand--but the little things such as hairstyles, dress and language all were quite vintage.The next thing I noticed about this film that sets it apart from some of the lesser films based on comics (such as 'Daredevil') was that it had a great sense of fun and, occasionally, a nice sense of humor. While way too old for the role, Tommy Lee Jones had some really great lines--a few of which made me laugh--and shouldn't a superhero film be fun?! The third thing I noticed was that this film really could not have been made until recently. I am not just talking about the 3-D (which was nice but unnecessary as in most films) but the way they got Red Skull to look, the way they shrunk Chris Evans for the first portion of the film and the great giant plane scenes towards the end were all impossibilities until recently and made the film just look fabulous. The last superhero film that managed to look this good was 'Thor'--which, in my opinion, was about the equal to 'Captain America' for overall quality and entertainment.Now despite me enjoying the acting, direction, set designs and practically everything else, there were a few minor things I did not like--and herein come a few spoilers. So, STOP READING unless you don't mind finding out a couple big plot points. Bucky's character seemed underdeveloped in the film and his apparent death came way too quickly. In addition, the big showdown with Red Skull and Captain America was way too brief. After all, Red Skull was also a super-soldier--so why did his demise happen so easily?! And, why didn't they just have him also crash into the ice at the end (allowing his return in subsequent films)? In other words, all this buildup--only to have it all resolved too quickly. But, despite these complaints, the overall film is as good a superhero film as you can find. Well worth seeing. And, like the best recent Marvel films, stay to the very end to see some more cool stuff and look for the cute cameo involving Stan Lee.",9,12,36,22 July 2011
American Hustle," Good but over-hyped.
","While 'American Hustle' has some nice performances, I was very surprised how unexcited I was watching this film. After all, around Oscar time, this was THE film that all the hype seemed to be about and the movie hadn't even debuted yet!! Critics were abuzz and the film got all the major nominations--Best Picture, Best Director, all the acting awards and four other nominations! If I were to create a list of most overrated films of all time, I would include this one simply because of all this hype. No film could be as good as this hype would indicate...and it wasn't.The movie is a HIGHLY fictionalized retelling of the Abscam affair where the FBI caught a lot of politicians on tape taking bribes. The ending, in particular, is pure Hollywood, not fact. But, instead of focusing mostly on the scam, the film tends to glamorize the characters involved in putting over this sting--the confidence people as well as the FBI. So why was I so underwhelmed by the film? The biggest reason is that I didn't like any of the people. And, oddly, the one I liked the most was the mayor (Jeremy Renner) caught up in the scandal. Any film about Abscam, even one as fictional as this one, needs to show bad people-- this didn't bother me. But the film so glamorized them and was all about them--and this left me flat. A few other things bothered me a bit. First, the f-word was not THAT commonly used in the 70s like it is used today. Historically, this is inaccurate, as it was used something like 27102391294 times. Second, while I liked the period music (as well as some new music by Jeff Lynne that sounded period), it was often too invasive--like a music video.In closing, I think if the film had never been hyped, I might have enjoyed it a lot more and scored it higher.",7,6,10,21 March 2014
Top Secret!," a terribly unfunny film
","How could the creators of Airplane and Airplane II follow up these great films with this dud?!? This is a mostly unfunny film. Shortly after I started watching the video, I was inclined to turn it off out of sheer boredom. However, I KNEW it must get better, so I waited, and waited, and waited. It never provided an eventual payoff and I realized I had wasted all this time for nothing.Even for an Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker film, the plot was hard to follow and confusing. This was good in Airplane but in this case the movie just looked like the script had never been completed. And the jokes looked like they had never been tested out to see if they were actually funny (such as skits involving sex with cows and the use of an 'anal intruder'--both very crude but just not funny in any way). My advice? See the Airplane films again or the Hot Shots movies--they provide more laughs in the first 5 minutes than Top Secret had in the entire movie.",2,5,23,11 June 2005
Incendies," A bit confusing, actually...and a great illustration of the phrase 'TMI'
","Whether or not 'Incendies' is a good or bad film, one thing that struck me was that for the longest time I had no idea where the film was taking place or the context for the film. I am sure I am not the only one who felt this way watching the move. I thought that perhaps it was taking place in North Africa or Lebanon--I just wasn't sure. A bit later, it became more obvious--but only because I knew a bit about he history of Lebanon and their long and amazingly destructive civil war. Because of this, it really would behoove the viewer to read up on the war BEFORE watching the movie--then it will be a bit easier to follow.The film begins in the French-speaking portion of Canada. Two young adults are at the reading of their mother's will and are in for some surprises. First, their father, despite what they'd been told, is NOT dead. Second, they have a brother! The rest of the film consists of the daughter going in search of these folks and eventually the brother going to Lebanon in search of his sister--who seems to have just disappeared.From this point, the film bounces back and forth from the past to the present day. This can be a bit confusing--you have to really pay attention to keep track. I know that this sort of yo-yo cinema has become more popular in recent years, but I really wish they'd stop doing this and make films in a much more linear fashion. You do learn that the mother's life was hellacious but you also learn that the two children certainly did NOT need to know about their hidden past! I am pretty darn sure I wouldn't want to learn what they learned about this. And, I also predicted this awful truth well before it was divulged in the movie--making it a bit of an icky anti-climax. I thought the film was interesting but also pretty unpleasant from start to finish.By the way, the film is very, very adult--with many adult themes and lots of bloody violence. Now I am NOT saying it was gratuitous--but it's not a film for kids or anyone who doesn't a realistically violent film. Folks getting burned alive or getting shot in the head at close range are among the things you see and, fortunately, the rapes are underplayed but still make this a super-adult film.",7,6,12,18 September 2011
The Godfather: Part II," My review of this film is pretty unimportant.
","'The Godfather: Part II' is seen, by many, as the greatest sequel in movie history and one of the best films of all time. Some even think it's better than 'The Godfather'. As for me, who am I to argue?! The film IS great--and deserved the Best Picture Award and its placement at #3 on IMDb's Top 100 list! And, since there are over 500 reviews for it on the site, I can't think of why I am even bothering to review it. After all, what's one more review that sings its praises?! The acting, writing, direction and entire production is perfect. What more can you say? If you do see the film (and you MUST), try to watch the version that combines the first two films into one--and adds additional story to make it one huge and perfect epic. You simply can't be a film buff without seeing this picture.",10,2,8,30 March 2013
Fargo," what is all the excitement about?!
","You probably are not reading this--as my review will be one of 160,000 on IMDb for this film. And, because of that, my unusually negative review will remain unnoticed. I understand and I usually do NOT review movies that have many reviews because of this. However, this is another example of an Academy Award Winning (and nominated) film in recent years that disappointed me so much. Other such films would be The Last Emperor and The English Patient (yuck!).So why did I dislike Fargo so much?! Well, first it is a one-note movie. Yup, all the actors do nice Dakota accents. That's cute,...for about 5 minutes--then it gets a little thin to base a movie on this! Plus, I found the movie way too conventional (despite the hype). I really preferred the much stranger and funnier Hudsucker Proxy from these same producer/director team.You know the movie isn't THAT great when one of the funniest(?) scenes involves Steve Buscemi being thrown into a chipper shredder.",3,17,41,16 August 2005
Rush," Quite good.
","I enjoyed 'Rush', as have a ton of other people. As of today, it's #142 on IMDb and it was nominated for Best Picture. While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.I was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films 'Le Mans' and 'Grand Prix'--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly 'Le Mans'). However, both films were a bit light on plot. 'Rush', on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.The acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.PLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids.",7,3,3,12 March 2014
Nightcrawler," He has no conscience...so he's a natural!
","'Nightcrawler' is an incredibly graphic and adult film...so think twice before you watch it. The language, the violence and content is NOT something everybody will want to see...to think twice (I am saying it again just to emphasize this strongly).When the film begins, Louis (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cheap little crook stealing and doing what he can to get by. In the process of doing this, he happens upon a film crew covering a crime scene...and Louis has found his purpose. He soon gets himself a cheap camcorder and police scanner and soon begins spending his evenings driving about LA--looking for mayhem in order to make a buck off it. As the film progresses, Louis' complete lack of ethics and conscience is shocking...especially when he begins manipulating things to make news stories and withholding police evidence in order to get the BIG story!This film is incredibly cynical in the way it shows the news. It shows the newsfolk as mostly a lot of soulless bottom-feeders--and Louis is the king of them all. And, as his videos become more and more horrific, Louis seems to be enjoying it with an almost orgiastic pleasure. I really appreciated in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. His wide-eyed almost insane look really helped his character...as did his weird, gaunt look. And, it helped that the more awful the things were that he was covering, the happier he appeared. Some excellent acting by him. Overall, a cynical, intense and difficult film that is not for everyone...and it's a logical 21st century extension of the sort of exploitative news that thrilled audiences with 'Network'.",9,2,3,16 March 2017
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Very offensive....very funny and perceptive.
","I am not in the target audience for 'Popstar', as I am a guy in my 50s who has no interest in rap or anything written after about 1985. So, the fact that I enjoyed this is something...isn't it?!In many ways, this film is very much like 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' as well as 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'....along with a heaping helping of pop music and rap. Just like Ricky Bobby, Conner (Andy Samberg) goes from the top of the game to total loser very quickly...and only by learning humility and appreciating his friends can he once again be on top. And, like 'Walk Hard', it's a mockumentary about the music industry...and it's very crude at times and has some genitalia. It is NOT a film for kids, that's for sure! Overall, it's a clever an perceptive film...making fun of the stupid antics MANY modern musicians engage in as well as tickling your funny bone in the process. Enjoyable and worth seeing...provided you are an adult and have a relatively high threshold for the offensive.",8,11,15,24 June 2017
The Aviator," A very different and sad look at the life of Howard Hughes.
","Years ago, Tommy Lee Jones made himself famous for playing Howard Hughes in a made for TV movie called 'The Amazing Howard Hughes'. The film clocked in at over three and a half hours and was a wonderful look at the man. Now, about 25 years later, Martin Scorsese has created a new biography of the man--though the film is under three hours long--so naturally things had to be omitted. Considering how complex Hughes was, they easily could have made a mini-series out of his life--but the film STILL is very good and worth seeing despite its brevity (and 170 minutes IS brief given the subject matter). It differs from the Jones film because instead of trying to encompass all of Hughes life, it focuses much more specifically on the psychological decline of the man and really builds a wonderful sense of profound sadness in seeing this decline.While Leonardo DiCaprio didn't look or sound as much like Hughes as Tommy Lee Jones did, he was quite good in this breakout role--and was nominated for Best Actor. However, the one who managed to earn an Academy Award was Cate Blanchette--who was just wonderful as Katharine Hepburn. Her voice and mannerisms were dead on--and she played the role, at times, in a hilarious fashion. Apart from these two, the other stars of the film are the cinematographers, set designers, director and CGI techs (who managed to create an AMAZING plane crash sequence that blew my mind). Overall, a film that is best seen not as a replacement for the earlier film but an enhancement--and I think seeing BOTH would be a great idea. Well made and well worth seeing.By the way, isn't it kind of ironic that Alec Baldwin plays the part of a HUGE airline exec--considering Baldwin's recent relationship with some airlines!",9,4,7,11 March 2013
Léon: The Professional," Good but #27?! I just don't get it.
","I wish I'd never seen that 'Leon: The Professional' was rated #27 on IMDb. With an outrageously high score like this, I get my expectations too high--way too high. Now I am not saying it's a bad film but it's certainly not THAT good. In fact, it's not among writer/director Luc Besson's best ('The Fifth Element' and 'La Femme Nikita' are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? The film stars Jean Reno as a top ninja-like assassin. However, in an odd twist, this lone wolf killer falls in with a girl (Natalie Portman) and he becomes her foster dad. This is hard to believe but even harder to believe is his training her to be a killer as well as he going after the baddie lone wolf style! And, speaking of the baddie, Gary Oldman pretty much plays the same guy he played in 'The Fifth Element'. Saying the film has some ridiculously difficult to believe aspects is certainly an understatement. Now I am not saying it's bad...but it cannot be a great film, in my opinion, if so much of it is difficult to believe. Interesting, yes....top 100...no way.By the way, I think it's safe to assume that Portman was named Mathilda in the film because of her and her family's strong similarity to the characters in the Raold Dahl book 'Matilda'.",7,7,17,29 July 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Something rarely seen in an Oscar winner...a film that the public actually LIKES and ENJOYS!
","Long ago, I tired of the Oscars. Much of it was because too often the films they picked and the performances they praised were ones that simply were unpleasant and box office poison. In the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', however, the film earned nearly a billion dollars at the box office AND managed to win four awards...and one was a major one (Best Actor). What a refeshing breath of fresh air...and what an enhoyable and inspiring film.One thing you should know about me is that I was a history teacher and hate most bio-pics and historical films. This is because too often they play very fast and loose with the facts in order to tell a more cinematic tale. While some of this happens in 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the vast majority of the film seems true and isn't filled with fabrications. Sure, you can find a few examples here and there where the film changes dates and facts to make the story seem more inspirational...but a lot less of this happened than I expected.In addition to generally sticking to the facts, the film had two major things going for it: Rami Malek's amazing performance as well as a strong desire to entertain the audience. The film will definitely get your blood pumping and feet and body moving....and at times it feels like you've been in a time machine and are actually seeing Queen in concert. Overall, exceptionally well done and inspiring.",8,3,4,25 July 2019
Burn After Reading," Well made but it felt incredibly detached.
","This was an odd film--and I don't mean this in a favorable way. That's because unlike most Coen Brothers movies I have seen, I felt almost nothing favorable towards any of the characters and it all just seemed very detached and, at times, uninteresting. While I can respect the intricacy of the plot and the good acting, I just felt like I could not have cared less about the movie and could have just as easily turned it off and not finish it. In fact, had it not been a Coen Brothers film, I probably would have done just that. Fortunately, the movie did get a little better towards the end, but not enough to make the time I invested in it worth the payoff.The biggest problem is that the film didn't seem to know whether it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. And, if it was meant to be a comedy, the very graphic killings later in the film weren't the funny FARGO type but just violent. This much violence and cursing kill the comedy, though I still am not sure that it was meant to be a comedy...even on a dark level.The other problem is that no one in the film is particularly nice or even that interesting. In fact, it's almost as if the film is trying to say that everyone is bad and it's all very meaningless. Perhaps, but I just found this made the film a hard one to relate to or care about, even if the acting was generally good.'Blah'--a word I never would have thought I'd apply to a Coen Brothers film. I've seen all their films and I must say this is the first one that was blah among them. Even their failures are very good and challenging...this one was just blah.",5,2,7,8 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," Good, though it's not the sort of thing I'd want to watch very often.
","I must admit up front that I am a hard sell for films like 'The Bourne Identity'. While it's a very well made film, it's also the sort of genre that I am not drawn towards as I just don't love non-stop action. Many do--so keep this in mind.The film begins very well--and very stylishly. A man is found floating in the Mediterranean--almost dead. A doctor on board the ship examines him and finds VERY bizarre things--two bullet holes in the body as well as a strange device implanted in the man's thigh! Clearly he is no ordinary guy! However, the moribund man awakens--and is clearly a guy not to be trifled with, as he's nearly dead but still a killing machine. But here is the odd part--the machine has no idea who he is, how he got there or where to go next. The film that follows consists of Jason Bourne learning who he is--all the while practically EVERYONE is chasing him and trying to kill him! The film is one chase scene after another--all well done but also a bit tiring for me. Again, you may not feel this way--if you adore non-stop action and suspense, you'll probably like this well-made thriller. As for me, it did not leave me wanting to see any of the sequels--it was good but enough for a lifetime of action/suspense for me. As for me, I just want more story and less mayhem.",7,1,2,31 August 2013
Hot Rod," Familiar but not particularly inspiring.
","'Hot Rod' is a very familiar story, as it's both a reworking of 'Dirty Work' and is very similar to many of the recent loser does good films. However, it's told in a rather pedestrian manner and lacks the fun of other similar films, such as 'Talladega Nights' and 'Waterboy'. The story is a goofy tale about a total loser who manages to somehow achieve a tiny level of success by the end of the film. Andy Samberg is Rod Kimble...a guy who has no job, lives in his parents house and has an obsession with doing stunts....nearly all of which he completely misses achieving. He decides to up his game and do some PAYING stunts in order to afford to give his verbally and physically abusive step- dad a new heart.There are several problems with the film. The first is that it just isn't written all that well. Despite being a lot like 'Dirty Work' and the films I mentioned above, it replicates a VERY familiar pattern but in a completely unimpressive and not particularly funny way. I think the reason I was so unimpressed as well is because I thoroughly LOVED Samberg's 'Pop Star' and know that he's capable of much more given a well written script. Overall, it's a time-passer and nothing more...mostly due to there being little in the characters to like as well as a dearth of humor.",5,1,2,18 November 2017
Baby Driver," I respect this one and it is worth seeing...though I didn't exactly enjoy it.
","'Baby Driver' is an ultra-violent and nihilistic film...one where there really is no one to root for and which is NOT a film for the average viewer. I am warning you....think twice about this one before you decide to see it. The story is about a very strange young man--one unlike any other in the history of film. Based on his behaviors, he seems to be somewhere on the autism spectrum. While he appears pretty normal in some ways, he is ultra-bizarre. When he's out driving getaway cars, he is VERY odd in that he MUST have head phones on and music blaring and unless he has a rhythm, he cannot drive...or so he's come to believe. How he got involved in this sort of life, the film never really explains...though it's odd seeing a boy who looks like an ad for milk hanging with a group of psychotics who commit the most brazen and horrific robberies.And this brings me to the violence....as these folks are psychotics who don't mind killing folks. One in particular seems to LOVE killing people and with absolutely no regard for the consequences. And, the last 1/4 of the movie is pretty much nothing but fast-paced action and horrific violence. Despite the violence (which really turned me off), the film is pretty incredible in many ways. The way the music and action and dialog all work together was amazing....and how the writer/director Edgar Wright did all this is incredible and difficult. Also, the driving stunts are among the greatest you can find on the screen. Finally, I loved that they actually used an honest to goodness deaf person to play a deaf person...and had his friend/caretaker learn very proficient sign language that is much better than you normally see in a movie (I know because my daughter is deaf and we sign in our home). It was obvious Wright really wanted to get all the details right...perhaps obsessively so. Perhaps the obsessions of Baby were inspired by Wright's own obsessiveness?I think this is a film I'd say folks should see it once. You might not like it or you might be horrified by it....but try it unless you know that the violence will be too much...in which case, skip this one.",7,3,9,17 August 2018
The Caine Mutiny," wonderful film BUT very different from the book
","As far as war movies are concerned, this is among the very best because it focuses so well on characterizations. Although Bogart was excellent in the film, I found myself most satisfied with two characters--Jose Ferrer as the prosecutor and especially Fred McMurray as the Mr. Know-it-all who pushes the 2nd in command to mutiny--only to ultimately shows his cowardice and leave the 2nd in command holding the blame. I've known people like McMurray's character and so it was really nice to see this portrayal. As far as characterizations go, about the only film I can think of that gets it better is TWELVE ANGRY MEN.One important note: The book is very different from the movie in that Queeg, though a poor leader, was NOT incapacitated by fear and self-doubt. The crew taking control of the ship was NOT warranted, as it clearly was in the movie. My advice is to read the book and see the movie--they're both exceptional but different.",10,4,7,9 June 2005
Lilo & Stitch," This one is almost strictly for the kids
","This is a nice, pleasant movie and a heck of a lot better than many recent Disney cartoons (such as POCAHONTAS, HUNCHBACK and HERCULES). Most of the reason it's pretty likable is the film's sense of humor and light touch. However, at the same time, this film is targeting kids and perhaps teens and seems to make no attempt to hook adults. While some adults surely liked the film, it's hard to imagine many of them who preferred this to the many other wonderful Disney full-length cartoons. LILO AND STICH is just too inconsequential and light to ever compare to LITTLE MERMAID, BAMBI, PINOCCHIO and especially BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Now this is not meant as serious criticism--just explaining who the intended audience is and who will most likely like the film. My kids (one of which was a teen) loved it and I felt like I was just there for the ride. Inoffensive to adults and full of silly hi-jinx that the kids will no doubt love.",7,3,6,10 June 2007
21," Give this one a chance and see it through to the end
","This is one of three films I saw on a trans-Atlantic flight. None of the three were ones I particularly wanted to see, but I was bored and in hindsight I am thrilled I saw 21.Now I'll admit up front that the first section of the film isn't super-exciting, but I stuck with it. My wife and daughter also tried, but quickly gave up and switched channels (their loss). Stick with it, as the film becomes more complex and intelligently written as it progresses--ending with many nice little plot twists to keep you guessing. Additional pluses in the film are the acting (particularly by Kevin Spacey) and the excellent musical score that really takes chances but works so well.I'd say more about the film, but frankly I'd hate to somehow divulge any of the film's twists. Suffice to say that it's about a brilliant group of card counters who make a killing at Vegas--and then things start to turn ugly in ways they never expected.",9,2,6,3 July 2008
Trouble with the Curve," Quite enjoyable and original
","While this is billed as a Clint Eastwood film, the star of the film seems to be Amy Adams--who seems to get more than her share of screen time. Regardless, it's an enjoyable and original film--and one worth renting.Eastwood plays a cranky old man--much like the guy he played in 'Gran Torino' but without the race prejudice. He's definitely a crusty old guy and has a habit of pushing away those who should be closest to him--particularly his daughter (Adams). However, now that he's in his 80s and his eyesight is failing, he really has no choice but to ask for help--but he's just too darn stubborn to do so. So, his boss (John Goodman) takes it on himself to call her and let her know that he's in need of help--especially if he wants to keep his job as a major league scout for the Atlanta Braves. As for Adams, she's a crazed workaholic who wants to be made a partner at her law firm. But she also KNOWS she should help, so for the first time in years, she takes a bit of vacation time to meet her dad in North Carolina--where he's scouting a new hot prospect. Not surprisingly, the film has a lot to do with family and reconnecting but it also is about learning to slow down and enjoy life--something which Adams doesn't seem to know how to do--particularly when she meets a nice young guy (Justin Timberlake--who is really growing into a good actor) who is interested in her. Where does all this go? See the film.My score of 7 was a tough call and I almost gave it an 8. I think my reason for ultimately deciding on a 7 is that, to me, this seems much more like a rent it than go to the theaters to see it sort of movie. The acting is nice, the story unusual enough to merit watching it and there is a wonderful relaxed quality about it that you often don't find in Hollywood films. On the downside, the ending did seem a bit unreal...but still quite enjoyable.",7,1,2,23 January 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Nice CGI, but otherwise rather unnecessary.
","I loved the movie 'Kung Fu Panda' and gave it a well-earned 9. However, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is like MOST CGI movies these days--an unnecessary sequel that was simply an excuse to bleed just a bit out of the original source material. Frankly, the plethora of sequels just seems very lazy and cynical towards the audience. Sure...'Kung Fu Panda 2' is pretty good, but 'pretty good' is a far cry from the original. I sure would love to see an end to this awful practice.The story once again finds out hero panda filled with uncertainty (though he sure APPEARED to have come into his own in the last film!). This is a problem since an all-new baddie with cannons is on his way (Gary Oldman)--and kung fu doesn't seem to be effective against this super-weapon. However, since this is formula, you know that by the end of the film all will be well once again. However, in the meantime, be prepared for a movie that is almost non-stop action and with a very dark tone--very dark. In fact, it's so dark that the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten one important thing--to make it fun. Overall, watchable and with incredible graphics--but it sure was a lot better in the first installment. I've heard they are making a 'Kung Fu Panda 3'...whoopee.",6,2,4,17 July 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," Sort of like a painful reworking of 'Vacation' and almost the entire family is awful....
","If you thought that the movie 'Vacation' had a lot of moments that embarrassed you and made your skin crawl, then are you in for it if you watch 'Little Miss Sunshine'--especially the ultra-bizarro ending! It features a god-awful family on their bizarre trek from New Mexico to a children's beauty pageant in California--and practically everything that could go wrong goes wrong. There's the brother they must bring along because he's just attempted suicide and cannot be left alone, there's the elective mute teenager who hates EVERYTHING, there's the surly and perverse grandpa, a father who does nothing but spout catch-phrases from his worthless self-help lectures and a completely inept mother. The only one you don't hate is the adorable little girl...and she seems like the most normal one among them! So what's going to happen? See this twisted film and find out for yourself.This is a movie that you're likely to love or hate--depending on what your tolerance is for painful comedy. It is not the sort of film that is subtle or for the easily offended--and has some amazingly adult language and VERY strange situations. But, if you have a high tolerance, it is worth seeing. Not brilliant and a bit like 'Vacation' if it was written by John Waters!",8,1,4,16 August 2015
North by Northwest," Wow...how did I forget to review this great film?!
","While I am sure that there is a lot of debate on this issue, but I'd say that this is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. It combines a marvelously original script with romance and wonderful location shooting to make a truly fabulous film.I love how this film begins. Ordinary New Yorker Cary Grant (or at least as ordinary as any guy looking like that can be) goes out to mail a letter and, through a long string of mistakes, becomes entangled in an assassination plot! The problem is that at first the police don't believe him about some weird plot--then they assume HE is responsible for the killing! The film is chock full of crazy iconic scenes--such as Grant being pursued by an evil crop duster and Grant and Eva Marie Saint scaling down the faces on Mt. Rushmore to escape the killers. Along the way, Hitchcock goes crazy with very, very sexual Freudian imagery (the tunnel scene is a classic) and provides some wonderful moments using wonderful actors. Grant, as always, is great but I also liked Martin Landau's small role as a killer who REALLY likes his job and the rest of the cast is also stellar. This is a must-see film and one of the best films of the decade.By the way, this film, despite being so wonderful also has one of my favorite film mistakes--and I am sure to watch for it every time. In the scene at the UN, pay very, very close attention when Grant tries to talk to the man he is pursuing. Although the man is shot dead unexpectedly right next to Grant, apparently one of the extras (a kid in the foreground) is anticipating the shooting before the gun has even been drawn. Look carefully--the kid is plugging his ears well before the shot occurs!!!",10,3,9,19 October 2010
Hugo," A great film....and Martin Scorsese is now my hero....
","While I have given 'Hugo' a well-deserved 10, I am don't think this film is for everyone. Despite the advertising campaign which made it look like a kids' movie, it is NOT. Now I am NOT saying it had adult content. Despite being directed by Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Goodfellas' and 'Raging Bull'), it is very family-friendly--without cursing, sex or violence. But, I also think younger kids would be totally bored to tears by the film--particularly late in the movie. Don't bring kids younger than about 10--they will most likely feel restless the longer the film progresses.For folks like me, 'Hugo' is an absolute must-see. I adore silent films and of the early silents, Georges Méliès is like a god. I have reviewed at least a hundred and have seen just about every existing film the man made...because they are THAT good. He was a brilliant early filmmaker who introduced lots of camera tricks and made extremely fanciful films. I could try to describe them further, but it's best you just see a few yourself. And, in addition to a plot that eventually turns to a homage of Méliès, it features clips from some of the great silents that I have long loved. In particular, a nice chunk of Harold Lloyd's 'Safety Last' is included...as well as clips and posters from 'The General', 'The Kid', 'Judex', 'Fantome', 'The Great Train Robbery' and many other seminal films any cinephile worth his salt would have seen and loved.Despite EVENTUALLY being all about the wonderful Georges Méliès, you would not know this through at least half the film. I knew--because I know his films and instantly recognized Ben Kingsley as Méliès--the makeup was dead on the mark. Otherwise, it's an intriguing film about a strange orphan--an orphan that literally lives within the ductwork and walls of a train station in Paris! He has a bizarre obsession to complete the restoration of an amazingly complex automaton that was begun by his father--before the man's untimely death. Yet, despite being anchored by a boy, it is NOT a film strictly for the kids. I'd say more about the plot, but frankly you just need to see it for yourself.Why I loved this film is not just because it's a delightful homage to silent films (which, by the way, has made Scorsese practically a god among filmmakers to me). It's also because I have never seen a better use of 3-D and the film just looks exquisite--and it seems to have a lock on the Oscars for cinematography and art direction. Now I am NOT just talking about incorporating wonderful 3-D tricks into the film (like they did so well with 'How to Train Your Dragon' with all the great flying sequences)--but integrating them in a more artistic manner that is not distracting but enhances the film throughout and makes you admire all the wonderful eye candy. I also loved the great use of computers to colorize flashback scenes to make them appear to be a nice homage to the early hand-colored films of Méliès. And, when it's not in flashbacks, the film simply looks like you are in early 1930s Paris.I also loved the film because of the nice performances. Sacha Baron Cohen is more subtle and likable here than usual and I loved the performances by the kids in the film. Ben Kingsly was great--but he's nearly always great.Finally, perhaps the best thing about the film is that it is so different. Watch the film and then try to think of another film that reminds you of 'Hugo'--I seriously doubt if you'll be able to do this--the film is THAT unique!",10,16,26,2 January 2012
The Orphanage," Yikes...I think I'd just move to another house...
","This is a Spanish horror film that manages to transcend the genre. I generally hate horror films, but this one is much deeper and well made than a typical film. And, on top of that, it's more intelligently made and doesn't insult the audience with cheap thrills or manipulation.The film begins at an orphanage back in the 1970s. Then, after the credits roll, it's the present day. A couple and their young adopted son have just moved in to the same building that used to be the orphanage. The little boy is an odd kid and talks about having invisible friends. The problem is that after a while, it looks like he might be right.During a party, the mother sees an odd child wearing a bag over his head--looking a lot like a little scarecrow. This is the same invisible friend her son had talked about and drawn in his pictures. However, when she tries to talk to the bag boy, he attacks her with extraordinary force. She is injured and upon getting up, looks for her son--who has vanished. Months pass and there is still no trace of the kid.The rest of the story is told through odd clues--coming in bits and pieces. As a result, there are LOTS of creepy little images and scenes--that all eventually fill in the pieces to the puzzle. And, it seems that some of these puzzle pieces are being provided by the missing boy, as it's like a game he and his invisible friends used to play together! I could easily say more about the film's plot, but frankly this would ruin the suspense--and with this sort of film, that would be a big mistake. However, rest assured that the film's ending is both satisfying and touching.The film was masterfully directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, but you can also see some of the influence of executive-producer Guillermo del Toro, as the story has many similarities to del Toro's earlier film, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE. Both are set at orphanages and both involve unresolved murders and the undying spirits of the victims. In fact, if you've seen one of these films, you should definitely see the other. Both, by the way, are pretty intense and are probably NOT good films for younger audience members.Also, in a small role in the about the middle of the film is a segment with Geraldine Chaplin (daughter of Charlie). I was surprised at her fluency in Spanish--not realizing she was in real life married to a Spanish man.",9,4,8,16 June 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Very good.
","Apparently, 'Doctor Zhivago' is one of the most successful films in movie history. Although critics weren't particularly impressed, the public sure was and came to the film in droves. Today it's considered by many to be a classic. I've seen it a couple times before and decided to watch it again tonight--since it's been several decades since I last saw it. While I would agree it is a very good film and has a HUGE scope (like so many of David Lean's films), I would hardly suspect while watching it that, adjusted for inflation, it's one of the 10 highest grossing films in history.The film is a sweeping saga of several people during the period of the Russian Revolution--both before and after. I could summarize the film but considering that there are already over 200 reviews, I'll spare you. At three hours and twenty minutes, oddly, not a lot seemed to occur in the film. I am not complaining or saying it was dull, as it was a lovely film--with very nice cinematography and music. It's just that the film is the type that slowly and deliberately unfolds--and the more hyperactive might not find that to their liking. The acting is quite nice but I think the real star is the direction. My only reservation is that with the great romance between Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie)--they both were married and Zhivago's wife (Geraldine Chaplin) was a lovely person. This did make it difficult for me to care about the characters more. Still, it's a lovely spectacle and well worth your time.",9,3,4,31 May 2012
The Shining," Considering there are already a bazillion reviews of this film on IMDb, why not add one more?!
","This film is currently the 48th highest rated movie on IMDb and there are something like a bazillion reviews for it already on this site, so it's not like my review is going to matter very much. Still, I decided to finally see this film for the first time and thought I'd toss my impressions into the HUGE pool of information.Jack Nicholson, like the story's author Stephen King, is a school teacher who has quit in order to become a writer. He arranges an unusual job that will give him LOTS of spare time--he and his wife and son will move to a resort in the mountains and be the caretakers during the off-season. This is problematic for several reasons. First, they are all alone and the snow will keep them alone for months on end. So, if there are any problems, they are screwed. Second, Nicholson plays an alcoholic in recovery--and there's no booze in the place. Third, and probably the biggest one of all, is that the place is evil and begins screwing with the family--particularly their weirdo kid and the father. For the most part, the wife (Shelley Duvall) is there to look scared and be preyed upon! I could tell you more about the film....but won't. I don't want to spoil the suspense.I should also note that this is a very adult film. I am not talking about the violence--though it is violent and scary. But the language and very explicit nude scenes make it something you might want to think about before you watch it or let your kids see it.So what did I like about the film? Well the music was great--and REALLY pulled off the scare-factor!! And, the film is quite tense and exciting. I also liked the cinematography. It's odd, though, that the opening scenes shot by helicopter were GORGEOUS but the VERY Obsessive-Compulsive Kubrick (who was known to make a bazillion retakes of scenes) didn't catch or care that you can actually see a shadow of the 'copter in the opening. Look carefully at the bottom right of the screen and you'll see it.My complaints about the film are few. But, I do think that Nicholson's characterization is something you'll either love or hate. I thought he seriously over-acted and agreed with King's assertion that he ALREADY seemed crazed when the film began. King's notion of the problem being related to alcohol are pretty much minimized in the Kubrick treatment---it's much more a film about insanity and evil spirits.I understand that Stephen King hated this particular adaptation of his novel and later he produced his own mini-series more in line with his vision for the film. But, considering he was not yet a big-name author and the god-like Stanley Kubrick was at the helm (and NO ONE tells him how to make a movie), it was a losing battle from the start. Kubrick helped write the screenplay, produced and directed the film. And, whatever King thought of it, the film WAS immensely successful--at least today when you ask people what they thought about the movie. I'll have to make it a point to see the mini-series as well---even if it currently has a mediocre score of 6.0.So, considering my score of 9, I liked it. Sure, there was some overacting but the basic story is very, very tense and I am sure a lot of viewers were scared half to death watching it. I am not a huge fan of horror films but can sure respect what was accomplished here.By the way, it's interesting that this film is an awful lot like King's later film '1408'--an awful lot. In 'The Shining' you have an evil resort and in '1408' you have an evil hotel room--both which screw with people and cause death and mayhem--at least in the film versions.",9,6,14,17 October 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.Overall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.",10,4,8,26 March 2019
American Beauty," Provocative, unique and well-crafted....but not exactly pleasant viewing.
","'American Beauty' earned five Oscars--including the biggie for Best Picture. However, I can't help but think that it just couldn't live up this hype when I watched it. Perhaps the competition just wasn't that great, but I can think of a lot of films that should have won this many awards but didn't. Perhaps you don't agree...and hey, that's life.The film is about a group of people who 100% screwed up and disaffected in their suburban lives. I am sure that is THE theme--how bankrupt life can be behind the stale walls of suburbia. The father (Kevin Spacey) is having a HUGE mid-life crisis. That's not too abnormal, but his reaction sure is--as he quits his job, buys a muscle car, smokes pot, insults his vacuous wife and begins having sexual urges about one of his daughter's underage friends. The wife (Annette Benning) is a frigid lady whose only interest is money and prestige...until she decides to have an affair. The daughter (Thora Birch) appears to be a disaffected teen--which is normal enough until she falls for a creepy guy and begs him to kill her father! Add to this all their 100% screwed up friends--stalkers, murderers, homophobes and nymphettes. None of them are the least bit likable and for me this was THE big problem I had with the film. You cannot connect with the characters because they are so one-dimensional--like caricatures of what's wrong with the American family.Now, this being said, the film sure is original. And, the acting and direction were all very good. And, it certainly is a provocative film--and it will make you think. And, considering how many hollow and vacuous films there are coming out of Hollywood these days, it does make me appreciate the freshness of the film's plot...even if it's so darn unpleasant and a bit depraved--and a lot like watching a slow-motion train wreck.By the way, most taboos are broken in this film, so it's not one to show kids or mother-in-laws. Pedophilia is just one of the many icky topics covered in this unique film.",8,2,6,11 July 2011
BASEketball," Turn off your brain and enjoy...
","The term 'guilty pleasure' is one that definitely applies to 'BASEketball'. While I'll readily admit that the film is very stupid, juvenile and gross at times, it's also, in a VERY low-brow way, entertaining. So my advice is just turn off your brain and enjoy.The film is set in the very near future. The premise is that pro sports have folded, as the players have become bigger and bigger egomaniacs--so much so that the fans have abandoned the games and the franchises have all folded. Two losers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the guys behind 'South Park'), create a game they play in their driveway. And, against the odds (and all common sense), it soon becomes so popular that pro sports are reborn in the form of BASEketball--a dopey game that defies description. Can these two lovable losers somehow manage to keep this new league from becoming just like the sports of old--commercial and cheap? The film abounds with disgusting an inappropriate material. You'll see Matt Stone shooting milk from his man nipples, animals becoming road kill (don't worry, they are NOT real animals), an amazing nude scene with Parker and Stone and some of the most disgusting and awesome kissing in film history. This is NOT a film for little kids, nuns or your mother!! By the way, pay attention for the very oddly specific music as Parker drives his VW. You'll know what I mean....",7,1,3,12 May 2012
Warrior," A review for people who don't like UFC fighting yet, somehow, end up watching this film.
","Hollywood tends to do things in spurts. When they make one sort of movie, you can pretty much guarantee there will be many more soon after. Back in the 1930s, it was gangster films...one after another. The 1950s and early 60s, it was nothing but westerns. In the late 70s, it was roller skating and CB radio films. Now, in the 2010s, it's fight films. First was 'The Wrestler' and then 'The Fighter' and then 'The Warrior'. So, from this standpoint, 'The Warrior' isn't exactly original--it's one in a string of similar films. Is it any good? Or, is it just derivative? Before I go any further, I have a VERY important confession to make. I don't like UFC fighting and think it's barbaric. As a libertarian sort of guy, I am not for banning it--hey, if they want to kill each other, that's their right...just don't expect me to pay to go see it. So you might wonder why I would watch the film in the first place--a very, very good question. I am a film nut--a total fanatic. Considering that I've reviewed over 15,000 films on IMDb, it's not surprising I'd review 'The Warrior'--simply because of the process of elimination! Additionally, I am trying to see as many of IMDb's Top 250 as I possibly can--and I only have a few more to go. This brings up an important question, then--for whom am I writing this review?! After all, if you love UFC, you'll love this film (hence the very high rating)--and if you don't, you'll almost certainly never watch the film in the first place! So, my review is essentially for about a dozen folks out there--people who are either being forced to watch the film against their wills or who are so nuts about movies that they'll watch anything.'The Warrior' is, for me, a turn off your brain and enjoy it sort of film. You cannot over-analyze this one or you'll likely turn it off. Think about it--two guys who have barely any experience in UFC fighting get to go to the biggest tournament in the universe AND although they have different last names, they are brothers and the rest of the folks in the movie only learns this (cue suspenseful music!!) before the final match that they are brothers!! The problem is that early on in the film you learn they are brothers and you just KNOW it will all come down to this! There is zero suspense in this regard....zero. I really wish they'd just abandoned this plot element.There are other aspects of the film that were much better. The men are also dealing with an alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) and this provides for some interesting moments. The old man wants to reunite with them but he's simply burned too many bridges. Additionally, the school teacher angle for the one brother was pretty interesting. I also appreciated some of the twists that do occur in the final match--and it is quite emotional and touching. Overall, this is a decent enough film that is ultimately very violent and rather predictable. Worth seeing if you're into this sort of thing but otherwise, probably not the film for you. I really wish they'd try making another similar sort of movie but without the predictability--which, unfortunately, is the problem with most fight movies.",6,4,8,31 January 2014
Judgment at Nuremberg," It's currently #160 and has quite a few reviews already...
","'Judgment at Nuremberg' is a great film and its current rank of #160 is indicative of its greatness. And, it has quite a few reviews already, so I don't intend to write an exhaustive review. Bkoganbing from Buffalo has already written a very nice review explaining the background for the movie that I might normally discuss, so in order not to be so repetitive and dull, I'll just be brief.The film is about one particular set of trials that followed the end of WWII. It is not THE trial--just one of many. Unlike the well publicized early trials of the obviously evil (most of which were hanged), many other sets of trials followed. In this case, four jurists who knew better but complied with the Nazis are on trial. To learn about the rest of the trials and the outcomes, do an internet search-- it's out there and I've read about the other trials. But this one is a fictionalization of the actual Nuremberg trials of these jurists and it has a lot to offer.First, the acting is absolutely superb. The film is filled with great actors who were great at seeming natural. Oddly, Maximillian Schell got the Oscar among these other greats and his performance was quite different--extremely florid and loud. I preferred the quieter parts played by Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich*, Burt Lancaster and others. I think Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland were also quite good--mostly because they were emotional wrecks off-screen as well and they seemed to tap into this (particularly Garland). Regardless, you can't find movies with a better cast. Second, Abby Mann's script is exceptional and you can easily see how Mann took home an Oscar. And, the great camera-work and direction made his script seem all the better.Third, the film faces the Nazi atrocities without flinching AND poses a question most films about the Holocaust rarely pose--about guilt of the common man as well as the leaders. Not the obvious leaders like Hitler, Himmler and the like but everyone else.Overall, a very, very impressive film from start to finish.",10,1,3,29 April 2014
Heartbreak Ridge," Sort of like a super-crude modern take on 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'.
","I enjoyed watching 'Heartbreak Ridge' but can also understand why the US Marines disavowed the film. Sure, it was quite jingoistic and patriotic but the language was NOT what the Marines want the public to hear...though in reality that sort of salty and politically incorrect dialog is exactly how the Marines I have known talk!The film centers around an aging and somewhat anachronistic Gunnery Sergeant, Highway (Clint Eastwood). He's pretty much a tough-as- nails stereotype of a career military man....for good and for bad. His new assignment is a group of (unrealistic) Marines who are worthless jerks. He has to whip them into shape...or see them die should they ever go into combat.The best way to describe the film is 'The Sands of Iwo Jima' with a STRONG Rated-R bent. The language is often crude and offensive (especially in this politically correct era) and it is NOT a film for everyone. But it is enjoyable and well made...and Eastwood's character is one you won't soon forget.",7,3,4,26 August 2017
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Very funny but also unnecessarily crude
","I loved John C. Reilly in TALLADEGA NIGHTS, so it isn't surprising that I'd give this film a look. Overall, it's a real mixed bag--with some hilarious comedy, excellent singing by Reilly but also an amazing amount of completely unnecessary crudity that would prevent me from strongly recommending the film. With only a bit of editing, this film could easily have been rated PG-13 and been a good film for teens as well as adults.The first ten minutes of the film are probably the best, as you see a young Dewey Cox and his brother playing together. You just have to see it to believe it--especially the dreaded 'machete incident'. It was obvious that this was NOT a movie that was meant to be taken very seriously. I also loved soon after that when they showed 40-something Reilly as a 14 year-old. It was really stupid and confusing---and I liked these ridiculous aspects of the film. What follows is a decades long saga involving Cox--one of the dumbest, most selfish and self-destructive singers in history. During this journey, the Cox character incorporates bits and pieces of many rock-n-roll lives--with obvious nods to Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Brian Wilson and many, many others. I particularly liked the sequence where Cox hung out with the Beatles in India--the dialog was really goofy.However, despite laughing repeatedly, the film also suffered from occasional lulls but especially from crudeness. Three separate times the film showed a closeup shot of a penis. There really wasn't any reason for this. It wasn't funny and it seemed to be included gratuitously. Additionally, several sex scenes were rather explicit as well. Had the nudity been excised, it wouldn't have noticeably harmed the picture and made it more accessible to teens--who should be a large audience for the film--especially since it does have a decent anti-drug message most of the time (showing what an idiot Cox became each time he used). As a result, I strongly recommend that parents act like adults and not let their kids see this movie. Even for a rated R film, it's amazingly graphic.",7,1,3,12 October 2008
Duck Soup," an exceptionally stupid film
","The above comment is NOT meant to be an insult, as the Marx Brothers set out to make a very dopey and FRENETIC film. Of all their films, this one has by far the highest energy level and so it crams a lot into a relatively short movie. Now, this energy and dopiness of the plot MIGHT alienate many viewers and I've gotta admit that enjoyed this movie more when I was a kid than now--so it's definitely NOT everyone's cup of tea. However, for pure zaniness and originality, it is an amazing film to watch. Plus it has one positive that no other Marx film has--the songs are actually GOOD and add to the plot. These Buzby Berkely-style numbers are silly and overdone and fit the zany mood quite well.So my final verdict is this: for fans of Shakespeare and PBS, don't bother BUT if you have a high tolerance for the stupid and silly give it a try. You certainly WON'T say to yourself 'I've seen another movie like this one'!",8,1,6,6 February 2006
Apocalypse Now," As long as you realize it's FICTION, you're okay...
","My biggest complaint about 'Apocalypse Now' is that many who view it might think this is exactly like the Vietnam War. Instead, it's almost like a non-funny spoof--satirizing it instead of showing an actual view of the war. The film shoves a decade of surreal incidents and some completely fictional ones along with incorporating Joseph Conrad's book 'Heat of Darkness' and the Herzog film 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' into this vision. The results are pretty amazing...just NOT the actual Vietnam War. In other words, there was too much craziness for one movie--but it did make for exciting and compelling viewing nevertheless.The first 2/3 of the film is very much like 'Aguirre', as it shows a group of misfits taking a CIA operative (Martin Sheen) upriver into Cambodia on a secret assassination mission. Along the way, TONS of insane little vignettes are shoved into the movie--some of which are patently ridiculous. Now I must say that when the film was released, some of the more surreal and ridiculous scenes were removed--such as the Playboy bunny scenes which simply make no logical sense. But the reason so much illogic is shoved into the film is that the filmmaker, Francis Ford Coppola, was NOT trying to make a true depiction of the war. I wish some of this craziness had been toned down a bit--after all, I am a retired history teacher and love truly accurate depictions. But this film is highly fictionalized and Coppola surely wasn't trying to make a documentary.The final portion is basically right out of 'Heart of Darkness'--with massive changes here and there (such as the purpose of the visit to Kurtz). Now if you haven't read this book, I do NOT recommend you do so. Believe me, it is one of the more difficult and tedious books I've ever read (yes, English professors, I know you will hit me with lots of 'not helpfuls' because I said this). And, while over the top in many ways, at least it was entertaining--something that could never be said about the book (which, by the way, was not a war story and was set in the Belgian Congo). In fact, an English teacher friend of mine admitted, after I pressured him, that the book was insufferable.So is the film any good? Sure. Very well done. But remember, it's NOT a work of non-fiction. Now I am NOT defending the Vietnam War (it was screwed up in every way and was one of the dumbest moments in US history) but just don't want the gullible to assume it's fact. For at least a closer view of the reality of the war, try watching 'Full Metal Jacket'. But, for a crazy, surreal and mesmerizing view, give 'Apocalypse Now' a look. It's like nothing you've ever seen before...FYI--It should surprise no one that this is a VERY adult movie--especially the 'Redux' release of 2001. Tons of violence, strong language and graphic nudity are in this film, so don't watch it with your mother-in-law or the kids!!",9,3,8,18 October 2011
The Battle of Algiers," very good but oddly filmed
","This is a documentary-like film about the Algerian revolution against the French in the 1950s and 60s--though 95% of the movie is set between 1956 and 1957. At first, it appears to be a documentary-like film about a revolutionary named Ali Le Pointe. It follows him episodically from his teenage years, to his joining the FLA (the Algerian Independence group) and follows many of his terrorist exploits as well as those of his compatriots. However, despite this being the focus, the film then diverges towards other characters and even after Ali's death, the film continues--giving spotty accounts all the way up until their independence in 1962. While the film is greatly admired and it does seem to show both sides of the equation, it looks as if the film was made by two or more directors and then pieced together, as the focus and style of the film changed repeatedly. While this doesn't undermine its overall impact, this keeps it from being a truly great film.Also, and this is definitely a politically charged opinion, I had a bit of a hard time watching this film. While the French (and British and others) were dead wrong to establish colonial empires, the organizations that in many instances replaced these empires scares the life out of any thinking person. Also, no matter how noble the cause, so many innocent people were murdered it makes you wonder if it was all worth it or was it just a chance for nihilists to kill for the sake of killing?",8,3,9,9 July 2006
The Patriot," People lay off the harshness of the rhetoric
","Jeez,...this is JUST a movie people. Judge the movie on its own merits, please. Several comments for this movie are more comments about America versus being reviews of the film.Yes, as an American History teacher I know the film, in some ways, is highly inaccurate. The British are portrayed as devils, of sorts, as they behaved in ways that NEVER would have been condoned by anyone. In this regard, this is a VERY flawed film. But, remember this is Hollywood and the film is meant as entertainment. And, apart from the ridiculous way the British are portrayed, the film is about the most accurate account of the war to date. The style of fighting, excellent acting, beautiful music, location shots and showing the mixed attitudes of the Colonists towards the war earn high marks for the film. This is sort of an Americanized version of Braveheart.",9,4,29,18 January 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Although the ending was awfully formulaic, the overall package is just terrific.
","The Oscars are still a few weeks away, so at this point I have no idea which awards, if any, this film will receive. I also cannot really say which ones it SHOULD receive, as I still have quite a few movies to see that were also nominated for the big awards. But I can say that the two leads were just terrific and I loved how unconventional most of the film was. I seem to have heard a lot more about how great Jennifer Lawrence was in the film--and she was AMAZING. However, I can't understand why I haven't heard at least as much about Bradley Cooper--his performance as a really screwy guy was quite convincing.The movie starts off in a mental hospital. It seems that Cooper's character was forced to go there because of SOMETHING he did--and eventually you learn that he nearly killed his wife and the man with who she was having an affair. And, based on what happened to him, you really COULD understand the man snapping like this. But, he also is mentally ill and desperately in need of professional help. His behaviors are consistent with a Bipolar Disorder with LOTS of Obsessive-Compulsive traits...LOTS. Despite it begin very clear that his marriage is over (the wife not only cheated on him but has a restraining order out on him), he lives in a delusional world where if he only gives it time, everything will work out perfectly. It obviously won't but he's too sick and stubborn to admit it.Into this screwed up little world comes a woman almost as screwy as him. Jennifer Lawrence plays a young lady whose husband was killed tragically--and her coping skills totally suck. She uses sex to deaden her pain and she is also mentally ill. Together, these two screwed up people will somehow work through these issues. I liked this. But what made the movie lose a point was the ending. The subplot involving the bet and the magical way everything worked out at the end seemed to give way to formula--which is a shame, as up until then, the film was great because it was NOT formulaic. Still, the film is terrific from start to finish and I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of the leads wins the award as well as the film taking home top honors. Well worth seeing. And, well worth seeing for Robert De Niro's exciting supporting performance--it showed some depth that you don't normally see from him.",9,34,55,26 January 2013
Van Helsing," The BEST example of what is wrong with many Hollywood pictures today.
","This is probably the very best example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. When people around the world complain that Hollywood is churning out over-budgeted, special effects-laden films with brainless plots, this is the first film that comes to mind. It was as if the studio execs knowingly produced a bad film because they simply knew that marketing and stupid effects would draw the undiscerning teens like flies to a corpse. And, I hate to admit it, but if the bottom line is money, then this film was a success. The fact that it made millions is depressing and further supports the notion that crap sells and quality is irrelevant in a bottom-line world. I found it so offensively dumb that I wanted my money back after seeing it--and it was in a dollar theater!! My teenage daughter felt equally appalled and said 'that's an hour and a half of my life down the drain!'. I am so proud of my girl!So let's talk about why I totally hated this film. Despite tons of money being spent on sets and all, it sounded like the dialog was written by a middle schooler. The worst example was the wretched and cliché-ridden scene where Van Helsing first meets his lady love. He walks into town as countless flying vampire maidens are soaring about--destroying the town and attacking the clichéd 'tough as nails' heroine. Now, at this point, the annoying heroine is getting the crap knocked out of her by these vampires and Van Helsing literally saves her from certain death. So what does she do in the world of dumb dialog--she snaps out that she is doing just fine and she doesn't want his help! This is taking the spunky and petulant babe role to such a stupid extreme that I literally groaned out loud in the theater. And, did I mention is this 100% anachronistic film that Van Helsing helps her with the aid of a machine gun that shoots wooden stakes! Heck, such a gun would be next to impossible to make NOW--let alone back in the 19th century!!! The dialog and action is pretty consistent with this scene throughout the film--one petulant scene after another and one great special effects scene after another. While I appreciate the beauty of the special effects, without a plot and dialog, they are pretty much worthless.Since seeing this wretched film, I have talked to dozens of my high school students and adults about this. With only a few exceptions, the kids liked it with such comments like 'I loved the action' and 'the flying vampire babes were cool'--and no mention of the story or characters. Those who hated it (mostly, but not exclusively adults) described it as 'brainless' or 'just plain dumb'. Just because impressionable kids LIKE this sort of tripe, should we, as responsible parents, let them feed on a constant diet of this brain-rot?! God help us, as these kids are our future!",2,15,29,5 June 2008
Divergent," Diverting... but it doesn't quite hit the mark and it's just too familiar.
","To me, 2014 seems to be the year of the shallow attempt to recapture the financial magic of 'The Hunger Games'. First you had 'Divergent' and then you had 'Maze Runner'---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch 'The Hunger Games' films and be done with it.So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry! My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right.",5,3,5,7 February 2015
Monsters vs. Aliens," An 'A' for CGI and music, otherwise a disappointing 'C'.
","This was a film I really wanted to love. After all, it was shot in beautiful 3-D, the idea sure sounded cute and the film appeared, at least at first, as a homage to my favorite genre, 1950s sci-fi films. However, after a while, it seems that this angle really wasn't all that important and the film degenerated into yet another clichéd and by-the-numbers children's movie. Sad, as the film could have been so much more.The film begins well enough, with Susan being hit by a weird meteorite just before her wedding that transforms her into a 100 foot tall (give or take) lady. She is drugged and taken to a US government facility for monsters, where she meets four others--Bob who is a cute blue blob (the best of the cast), Dr. Cockroach who is quite fun, the Missing Link who is a 50s style aquatic monster and a giant bug who is quite a bit taller even than the newly christened 'Ginormica' (Susan). You can tell at this point that it is yet another buddy film and by the end, they'll all have worked together to save the planet.Now I did like the evil alien, Gallaxhar. His voice was hilarious and he had a lot of personality--sort of like The Great Gazoo ('The Flintstones') mixed with The Brain ('Pinky and the Brain'). He provided some nice comic relief and was a decent villain.What I did not like was how once the characters were all established, the film seemed terribly familiar. You realized that because it was a standard plot (despite the strangeness of the characters), what HAD to happen by the end of the film. I predicted way before it happened that Susan would lose her size and powers--which SHOULD have been an answer to her problems BUT that she would CHOOSE to make herself big again to save humanity and be true to herself. In fact, her entire character was like a textbook example of a combination damsel in distress and spunky female action hero--and nothing like a real person.Overall, it's a decent film for the kids and parents can sit through it without too much discomfort. However, considering that it COULD have been a great parody of 50s sci-fi films and wasn't (it concentrated too much on the dull plot about self-acceptance and all that crap), it is only an okay film with really great CGI, 3-D effects and music in the ending credits. Plus, it has all the look and feel of an upcoming made for TV kids series and not much more.By the way, this is more a commentary about the use of big-name celebrities to do the voices than a comment just on this film. A few years back, I met Rob Paulsen and heard him give a talk. He is the voice of a bazillion cartoon characters (including Yakko Warner, Pinky and one of the Ninja Turtles) and he was lamenting how often the studios use non-voice actors for the full-length movies not because they are talented voice actors but in some attempt to boost ticket sales. While I doubt that it really does increase sales, in many films these voices just aren't that great or necessary. As for MONSTERS VS. ALIENS, Hugh Laurie was great as Dr. Cockroach, Rainn Wilson amazing as Gallaxhar and Stephen Colbert pretty good as the President, but the rest of the voices just weren't all that memorable. I really think in some roles (such as Susan or the General), a professional voice actor could have done the job for a lot less and probably better than hiring big name actors and actresses--especially since my teenage daughter and I had no idea who were doing the voice-overs before we went to see the film. Plus, I just can't imagine a six year-old saying 'Mommy,...we HAVE to go see the film, Reese Witherspoon is one of the voice actresses!'.Finally, the name of the TV station in the film is incorrect. As the station is in California, the call letters should have begun with the letter K, as all American stations west of the Mississippi River have this designation. Despite this, it started with a W. No big deal--just a small mistake.",7,1,3,24 May 2009
Dreamgirls," Oh, my gosh....this is great!
","'Dreamgirls' is a movie based on a musical play that appears to be a thinly veiled story about the Supremes and Berry Gordy. However, many things have been changed here and there--allowing the producers plausible deniability. The film clearly shows the Gordy-like 'Curtis' lie, cheat, manipulate as well as behave selfishly throughout BUT enough changes are in the story that it isn't quite Gordy. And, the same can be said of the Dreamgirls--almost the Supremes...but not quite. And, the same can be said for a James Brown-like character...close, but not quite.The film begins in the early 1960s at a talent contest. Three friends, 'The Dreamgirls', do a marvelous job and end up getting hired as backup vocalists for an established act, a James Brown-like guy played wonderfully by Eddie Murphy. They are promised, repeatedly, by Curtis that sooner or later they'll get their big break--all the time he's romancing the lead singer of this group, Effie (Jennifer Hudson). However, later, when the girls are about to get a big contract and go off on their own, Curtis springs a bombshell--Effie is NOT the lead singer but a backup and one of the backup singers, Deena (Beyoncé) is now the lead. Why? Deena is skinnier and looks better--even though her voice cannot compare to Effie's. Not surprisingly, Effie resents this and slowly this eats away at her like a cancer. When she voices her anger at Curtis, he simply replaces her! What's next? See this wonderful film.If you are wondering how all this differs from real life, the biggest ways are the outcomes. Those in the film who have happy endings in reality DIDN'T and those who died or failed DIDN'T in real life--or at least not at all like they did in the script. But clearly, Curtis is THE villain in the film and he manipulates EVERYONE--and by the end of the movie, everyone hates him! So why did I give this movie a 10? Well, there are two main reasons. I LOVED Jennifer Hudson--she was dynamite in the film and clearly earned her Oscar for her performance. Her acting was wonderful--her singing was like a goddess. And, as I mentioned above, Eddie Murphy shocked me, as he was great--and good enough to earn a nomination for an Oscar! The other main reason was the singing. The songs were fabulous and performed masterfully. While these were all new songs, they sounded much like 60s Motown tunes--and make me wish I'd seen the play, as folks must have been dancing in the aisles to these songs. At home, I couldn't help but get sucked into these exciting pieces--and I am pretty sure you will, too. A fine, fine film and a heck of a lot to like and enjoy. How this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture (let alone win it) is beyond me.",10,0,1,29 November 2012
In the Name of the Father," Well worth seeing...but I'd sure love to see a follow-up
","I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film.The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.",9,2,4,27 August 2013
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Well, it certainly is different.
","After seeing 'The Men Who Stare at Goats', I am really not sure whether or not this movie has a point to it. And, I can't say whether it's a good or bad movie. But, I appreciated how the film was different and it made me smile...a bit.The film is about the US military's creation of a psychic spying unit. While in real life, they REALLY did do some crazy experiments kind of like this (after all, it's only tax money), the story itself is mostly fiction. I would try explaining the plot to you, but it would only confuse you--you need to see it for yourself. The film turns out to be a combination of a buddy film (like 'Ishtar') combined with 'Star Wars'--with a bit of comedy tossed in to boot. My problem, however, is that it never really sustained any of these--making a film where you just wish there was MORE--especially more comedy. Plus, a few characters (especially Kevin Spacey) seemed a bit undeveloped. In fact, undeveloped is probably the best way to describe all the film--like it's still missing something. But, it is different and the final scene is pretty cool. Worth a try if you need something different but I am sure it's a film that will have viewers widely divergent in their appreciation for the movie.Oh, and the film had a lot of nice 80s tunes--at least most of them. Boston, Billy Squier and a few others were the sort of stuff I could enjoy (because, as my daughters tell me, I am old!).",6,2,6,19 October 2011
Dark City," Brilliant--at last a truly original sci-fi film!
","This is one of the more difficult films to describe. Part of this is because I really don't want to ruin the suspense for anyone who has yet to see the film. Part of it is because this sci-fi film is so incredibly 'foreign'--having very little in common with previous sci-fi films. I loved the fact that there were no robots, space battles or a traditional quest and hero. Lovers of adventure-oriented sci-fi may dislike this and many may be put off by the dark tone and colors of the film which give it almost a Film Noir quality. However, if you have longed for something that is not derivative or predictable, then this film is for you! The film starts off in a dark 1940s-like world. In many ways, it looks like post-WWII America--with the fashions, buildings and hair styles. Yet, despite the presence of fedora hats and old time cars, something is not right. You see, this place can't be Earth because it's forever night! And, to top this off, periodically everything stops--everything. And then, seemingly from out of no where, odd looking aliens (who look a lot like Uncle Fester, the guy from HELLRAISER and Nosferatu combined) appear and begin doing strange experiments on the people. Oddly, however, after seemingly doing this for years, one of the subjects does NOT fall asleep when the others do and he realizes that there is something very, very wrong. Much of the rest of the film consists of these nightmarish creatures pursuing him--trying to stop the one guinea pig who is different from the rest.Bizarre and possessing a terrific otherworldliness that no other film can replicate, DARK CITY is amazingly original, tense and worth seeing. However, for those who want cute sci-fi like ET or STAR WARS, you may be disappointed--this film is far from cute and is not a film oriented towards kids.",9,10,15,28 November 2008
Cross of Iron," Über depressing.
","'Cross of Iron' is a seriously depressing war film. And, considering that it's supposed to be set on the Eastern Front during WWII, it SHOULD be an incredibly depressing film! So, although I don't like all the blood and gore, it was appropriate to the time and place. Yes, you will see soldiers with limbs blown off, corpses being run over by tanks and blood, blood, blood. All this can be forgiven, though I have NEVER thought director Peckinpah's slow-motion scenes were particularly good--just indulgent. But, compared to the usually sanitized war films, this one is superior in this sense.The story is about a particularly indestructible German soldier named Steiner (James Coburn). He has just been promoted to sergeant and the infantry men serving with him love him and look to him for leadership. However, quite the opposite is Captain Stransky--a cowardly officer whose only goal is to get himself an Iron Cross. And, it seems to gall him that Steiner has one and he does not. So, in order to 'earn' one, Stransky pretends that he was responsible for a brave act--one he never committed. Now, the only man who can contradict his fake story is Steiner--who knows the Captain was no where to be seen when they were being attacked.While this is the main story, the film only focuses on this a bit, Mostly, it focuses on Steiner and his men as they attempt to make it back to their lines after the troops are overrun by the Russians. It all makes for a very tense and realistic story. Depressing and fatalistic, that's for sure--but very effective in conveying the hell that this war was for both the Germans and Russians. And, it's a rare film in that it is shown from the German point of view. The bottom line is that if you want to see realism and feel really, really depressed, this film is for you.By the way, although the mood of the Front is pretty accurately portrayed, crazed purists will notice a few anachronisms here and there. The worst I noticed were American Corsair fighters dropping bombs on German troops. While the Americans did send a few planes to the Russians, they were all rather obsolete (such as the P-39s). The Corsair, at the time, was possibly the best fighter plane in the world and you NEVER would have seen them in the Soviet Union--only in the Pacific.",8,3,4,11 January 2013
The Intouchables," Very nice acting.
","According to IMDb, 'The Intouchables' set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film.",8,4,8,17 March 2013
Ratatouille," One of Pixar's best
","This film is exactly what Pixar needed to steal the thunder from Dreamworks' latest release, SHREK III. In many ways, this is very ironic, as one of Pixar's best films, MONSTERS INC., was overwhelmed when it was released due to the first SHREK's success. I honestly think if SHREK hadn't been such a wonderful movie, people would have noticed that MONSTERS INC. was an exceptional film. Now, Pixar gets some payback with one of their best, RATATOUILLE.Actually, RATATOUILLE is probably Pixar's best film, though I did enjoy TOY STORY II and THE INCREDIBLES. The reason I was so overwhelmed by this story was that it was so highly original and creative--I simply cannot compare the plot to any other film (something you can do with THE INCREDIBLES and TOY STORY II). Plus, after years of making CG movies, the look is taken to a whole new level in this film--it just looks breathtaking.Now I need to point out that RATATOUILLE is not as much a kid's movie as its predecessors. Sure, it can be enjoyed by the kids, but the story line is a tad darker and covers an adult concept (illegitimate birth) and includes a swear word (though not one the really 'bad' ones, you can be sure). Also, while the rats are kind of cute (and a marketer's dream), most of the rest of the story isn't and there are no catchy kid's tunes. No, instead this film is aimed more at teens and adults in its sensibilities--something that really helped make SHREK a financial gold mine and cursed MONSTERS INC. to be seen (incorrectly) as 'just a kid's movie'.Amazing animation, excellent writing and, the rarest of rare, a completely original and captivating plot make this a winner and film that will be long remembered. I can't wait to see it again.",10,12,18,9 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Had this come out 10 or 15 years ago, I would have loved it...
","I can't take credit for the summary--my oldest daughter said that when we left the theater after seeing 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. That's because with all the many, many super-hero movies out in recent years, this one loses a bit of something--especially since there are clearly better films of its genre (such as 'Iron Man' and 'The Avengers'). It's decent but there are better products out there.First, let's talk about what I loved. The CGI was incredible and for the first time it really looks like Spider-Man is flying. It's very seamless and looks brilliant. Also, the Spider-Man costume and movements are all great.What I thought was lacking in the film. It's ALL CGI and special effects--and nothing much more. The characters and dialog just didn't seem all that important. And because of this, it's spectacular to watch but nothing more....nothing. And, while I think about it, why, oh why didn't they include THE most important line in any Spider-Man film--Uncle Ben's line 'With great power comes great responsibility'?! It is the perfect summation of who the character is and according to Stan Lee it is Spider-Man...so why is it missing?!",6,3,10,25 August 2012
The Lego Movie," It's been out a month and there are over 200 reviews, so I'll keep this one brief.
","A recent hit has been 'The Lego Movie' and so far it's made a ton of money ($224,000,000 in only a month--and that's only in the USA!). Well, I don't find this the least bit surprising. The film already has a nostalgic element that might draw many adults to the movie. Additionally it has something many kids' films don't--it's very, very watchable for the adults who have been drug along to see it! It's often very funny and never takes itself seriously.The film is about a meanie in the Lego world named President Business (the voice of Will Ferrell). He's determined to destroy their world by using his ultimate weapon--a tube of Crazy Glue! But the inhabitants of the world are mostly clueless and think he's a great guy. Later, this turns out to have parallels in the real human world.As I said above, the film often was very funny as it often made nice cultural references or made fun of Lego. It also had the silliest soundtrack I've ever heard--with songs whose lyrics almost sound as if they were written by 7 year-olds! And, interestingly, you'll find yourself humming along with these catchy tunes! Clever and worth seeing, my only worry is that they'll bring out some sort of sequel--and although I really liked the film, I'd hate to see them ruin the franchise as the film seemed very complete and doesn't need followups.",9,2,11,9 March 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," This is NOT a good idea if you're looking for a family film, that's for sure!
","'Dallas Buyers Club' is a very nasty film. I am not referring to the fact that it's a film about AIDS--talking about that is important. No, I am talking about the style and content. The main character, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) plays a repellent sort of character and the film is certainly not one that you'd want to watch in front of your kids or your mother. Ron is a vulgar man--with a language like a sailor, a penchant for strip clubs and skanks and he uses ant-gay slurs repeatedly. Because of this, you may want to think twice before you see the film. Its also very, very unpleasant. I am not being so much critical as passing on information so you can make an informed choice.It's interesting because I did a bit of reading about the real Ron Woodroof. While he was far from a saint, sources I read said he was not this nasty or anti-gay--and this ramped up a lot for the film. Had the film been less vulgar (and truer to the real character), it would have wider appeal. HOWEVER, my complaints withstanding, the film was made for a pittance, earned a lot of money AND won three Oscars--one for McConaughey. So, what do I know?! Just think twice about seeing the film--it's just amazingly nasty and isn't the sort of think I particularly enjoy. So see it if you'd like. The acting is good and McConaughey did an amazing job.",Null,2,8,22 March 2014
The Exorcist," Still powerful after all these years...just not quite as much.
","My review is not perfect, as I never saw this film on the big screen. This, combined with the extreme reactions on the part of the audiences must have really heightened the fear in the theater. I remember reports at the time of people leaving the theaters before the movie finished as well as the furor it caused because it was so scary. Well, tonight I watched in on my computer. Sure, I've got a huge computer screen, so it wasn't a claustrophobic experience but it sure wasn't like being in a theater. Keep this in mind--theater patrons probably were much more scared--especially because the film was extremely terrifying compared to anything previously seen--making ROSEMARY'S BABY look like a Disney film! Now before anyone sees this movie today, I sure wish they'd insert a 'kids: don't try this at home' warning. No, I am not specifically talking about performing exorcisms but following Father Damien's example in how he treated Father Merrin when Merrin's heart stopped. This character, who supposedly had an MD began hitting Merrin on the chest harder and with more intensity than George Foreman could have! Darn it, if the heart attack didn't kill Merrin, those 'Mortal Kombat' style punches sure did. KIDS: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!! As for the film, there are so many, many reviews already that I don't feel like doing an in-depth analysis--especially since there are already so many good ones (as well as a few stupid ones, but I won't go there). The bottom line is that this film was exceptionally well done and the special effects were amazing and ground-breaking--and generally impress even today. As far as how scary the film is, I wasn't so much scared as emotionally impacted--some of the not so scary moments still were hard to watch--such as the impact of Regan's 'illness' on her loving mother. Scary-wise, it is possibly the scariest film of all time, but I still think FREAKS has a certain visceral scariness that beats all other films. Still, THE EXORCIST is a darn scary and exceptionally well made film from start to finish. However, I think the most evil thing about this film isn't the demon, but that they went on to make some god-awful sequels--so bad, even demons would probably avoid the theaters!!One final comment. While the film is exceptional, part of me felt uncomfortable with much of the film as they had a young child saying and doing so many gross and abusive things (masturbating with a crucifix, using VERY colorful language and the like). While an adult can elect to be in a film and say and do these things, in the case of a child it seemed awfully exploitative--even if the parent says it's okay.",9,4,10,8 September 2009
Goon," Very original and very formulaic at the same time.
","'Goon' is an exceptionally crude and formulaic film. I would not recommend it for you unless you can deal with the ridiculously foul language (unnecessarily so) and the fact that at its heart it's EXACTLY like practically all other sports films when it comes to the movie's structure (hence, it's really predictable). Yet, despite all this, the movie still has something worth seeing--a nice guy playing the lead. Now this is really odd, as this nice guy is also a guy hired to play hockey for one reason--because he can beat the crap out of just about anyone! Seann William Scott plays 'Doug'--a 20-something loser who has nothing going for him. However, quite by chance, he attends a hockey game and ends up getting in a fight with one of the players! The crowd loves it, as Doug beats the snot out of the guy. Inexplicably, with this as his ONLY known skill, he's given a tryout by a minor league team. He can barely skate and has no skills but inexplicably gets the job. And soon, he's a fan favorite, as his fists become legendary.Eventually, he does well enough that he's advanced to the next level in hockey--and this is where the film becomes VERY formulaic down deep. The team (not surprisingly) can do nothing but lose but eventually, with Doug's help, they turn it around and are contenders (yawn) for the playoffs. It's really disappointing, as before this plot began, the film was crude but VERY original. Now I am not saying that the film is ruined, but the plot is the same you'll find in 'The Natural', 'Semi-Pro', 'Angels in the Outfield' and a bazillion others--a loser team somehow turns it around and MIGHT just make the playoffs (and they ALWAYS do).So is it worth seeing? Sure...if it's your sort of thing. Although I think for what it is, 'Slapshot' is a superior film--more original, far funnier and (if possible) a bit more family-friendly.",6,1,2,15 July 2012
Now You See Me," Turn your brain off and enjoy...
","At this time, there are already 530 reviews for 'Now You See It', so I'll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you'll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. 'Nuff said.",6,4,6,27 May 2014
Gandhi," superficial and inaccurate, but still a decent (but somewhat dull) overview of his life
","'The Last Emperor', 'The English Patient' and 'Gandi'--three recent movies that won tons of Oscars but were ultimately pretty boring and unappealing to the common people. You may not appreciate me for saying this, but it is a fact that all three films were not exactly box office draws and the average bloke would rather see most anything other than these LONG films. And, I say long not due to their length, but to their slow and plodding pacing. And, of course, they are rewarded for this by the Oscar. So, in recent years Oscar = Dull or overblown film. While I certainly didn't hate the film like many of my students, I could understand their feeling that the whole thing was a bit too long and slow going.This film is a pretty decent general overview of the life of Gandhi. However, as a history teacher, I gotta admit that there were a lot of liberties taken with the truth. While the overall message is true, some details are not and many aspects of Gandhi's strange personal life were omitted (such as his attitudes towards parenting, his sleeping habits, etc.--all VERY odd indeed). While I hate to see films that trash good people and focus on the weird, this film nearly elevates this man to godhood--making him seem super-human, not just a great man. After you see the movie to do an internet search or pick up a biography on the man to get a more 3-dimensional view of this extraordinary character.PS--I know I will be hated for demeaning the name of Gandhi, but I strongly agree with the other posts that preferred or at least recommended the movie UHF because of its parody on GANDHI--'GANDHI II--he's back and he's looking for revenge'! Funny stuff, indeed!",5,30,63,10 May 2006
American History X," exceptionally powerful drama--but not for the kids
","I really appreciated how those associated with this excellent film refused to pull any punches in showing the life of a young skin-head so ably portrayed by Edward Norton. Instead of creating a caricature of a racist, all the vile language and violence is shown. This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS, but for adults it makes a strong impact--like a right cross into the jaw! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?! I applaud the efforts, though I must also admit it can VERY hard to watch--particularly the shooting scene and the intensely graphic language.",9,7,12,15 February 2006
Spirited Away," Exceptional, but perhaps not so much for the casual viewer
","I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please.",9,5,13,11 June 2007
Duck You Sucker," I felt I was watching a film by the other Sergio.
","'Duck, You Sucker' (aka, 'Fistful of Dynamite') is a film directed by Sergio Leone with music by Ennio Morricone--the same team that brought some amazing Italian westerns to the screen--such as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'). However, here the film is very different--and it felt like I was watching a film by the other but less well known 'spaghetti western' director, Sergio Carbucci. That's because most of Carbucci's westerns have a strong revolutionary bent and usually are about Mexico during the time of their revolution against Diaz in the early 20th century. His heroes are revolutionaries--ones with a strong political agenda at the onset or ones who develop ideals through the course of the film. This is EXACTLY what happens in 'Duck, You Sucker'--and it really seemed odd for Leone. Not bad necessarily--just quite odd with its socialist/Marxist tone.The film stars James Coburn as an IRA terrorist who somehow has made it to Mexico--along with all his explosives. It also stars Rod Steiger in an odd role, though Steiger loved doing strange roles that tested his range. Here, he's sort of like a mob leader and family patriarch rolled into one. He is the character who evolves (like Carbucci's heroes) from a common thug to a revolutionary during the film.So, did I like it? Well, not especially--though it's certainly better than the average western. The problem for me is that Leone set the bar so high with 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars More', 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'! These are probably the four greatest Italian westerns--all by one director! But, because these films were so good, 'Duck, You Sucker' can't help but disappoint. Good, but certainly not in the same category as these other films--mostly because the pacing was slow (even compared to the above movies), Steiger's accent (according to IMDb it was dubbed) and odd chemistry make this good but no more.",7,2,4,23 March 2013
Tropic Thunder," Despite appearances, down deep, this film is extremely formulaic
","A group of idiotic spoiled actors are on location in Southeast Asia in order to make a war film. However, the project is running amok and the director has no control over the actors. Finally, in desperation, he takes just the actors, writer and special effects man into the jungle and dumps them--forcing them to act without the entourages, cell phones and the like. However, shortly after he does this, the group wanders into a real war zone and it takes some time for the hapless actors to realize the shooting is real as well as to get out alive.I found much of the first 30 minutes or so of TROPIC THUNDER to be highly offensive but also clever, as the audience gets inside into the behind the scenes aspects of making a film. The language was unbearably crude as the film makers seemed to think that screaming long strings of obscenities was funny, but at least the idea of showing a problem movie being made was reasonably clever. However, after this decent (but crude) setup, the film floundered as it seemed to be pure formula. In other words, despite being set in the jungles of Southeast Asia, the audience knew exactly what would happen because this type of film has been made again and again. They knew that the group of idiot actors would somehow get it together and become a cohesive group--like REMEMBER THE TITANS and so many other films. And, they also knew that despite 100,000 live bullets supposedly being shot at our group, no one would die or even suffer a significant injury!! And, by the end of the film, all the actors will have resolved their life issues in the process--the gay guy coming to grips with being gay, the chameleon-like actor realizing he has no idea who he really is any more and the lousy actor finally getting it together and earning that Oscar. Puh-leeze!! So, really, apart from a few jokes here and there and some interesting interplay between Robert Downey and Ben Stiller as two nutty method actors, this movie offered nothing that wasn't predictable--just film cliché after film cliché. Frankly, when all was said and done, I felt a bit gypped--I wanted a film that took risks and tried to be something more than just another buddy film. Apart from a couple prosthetic arms on Nick Nolte and black-face makeup on Robert Downey, I just felt the film was the same old Hollywood film formula recycled yet again--with a bit of RAMBO II thrown in to boot. Plus, to cap it off, some of the performances (like the one-note film exec ridiculously overplayed by Tom Cruise) were just awful. How could this film have made so much money?! It's got a few good moments but also abounds with clichés.",4,5,15,8 December 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Wildly creative and fun...but probably NOT for all tastes...
","'Scott Pilgrim' is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it's probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you'll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don't worry, they are almost all very nice people! So what, other than originality, did I love about this film? Well, just about everything--and I seriously considered giving the film a 10--I liked it that much. Perhaps the best thing for me was casting of Michael Cera in the lead. Unlike the traditional super-hero, he is by far the geekiest and most likable main character I have seen. Seeing such a wimpy and unassuming guy become, out of no where, like a character from Mortal Combat was a wonderful juxtaposition--you just couldn't help but smile. And, despite his nerdy looks, he was winning as Scott Pilgram...and actually played the music his on-screen band played--now that's talent. Additionally, I loved the film's gentle sense of humor---I laughed harder at this film than any film I've seen in the theater in some time. I could try to describe these moments--you just need to see them for yourself. Odd references to games like DOA, Mortal Combat, Marvel Vs. Capcom and Zelda II were great--I caught on to those due to my own geeky background. And, my familiarity with anime/manga also made me laugh--as the hair, love for girls in school uniforms and style were often straight out of Japanese comics. And, I loved how the film made me love video games and was simply much, much more fun that the original 'Tron' (which I always felt was too dry--perhaps the new version will correct this).Clever, wonderful and strange, this film is the geek's dream come true...and not a film to be missed. However, if you aren't a geek or are perhaps too old to get the pop references, I say take along an interpreter--many comic book nerds and couch potatoes would be glad to go with you and help explain things...provided you pay for the tickets.Among the nearly 9000 reviews I have now done on IMDb, this ranks in the hallowed ranks of a very small group of movies that transcended the pack due to its utter weirdness. It's surreal and weird--and I think this makes it very special. For other films that fall into this category, try 'The Happiness of the Katikuris', 'Delicatessen', 'Yes Nurse, No Nurse', 'Tatie Danielle' and 'Tampopo'--all truly unique, surreal and fabulous films.",9,21,50,13 August 2010
Enchanted," Heart-warming, but probably not for everyone
","I finally saw this film nearly a month after its debut. Because of this, there are oodles of other reviews and many of them encapsulated the plot very well, so I won't even try. Instead, from the standpoint of a middle-aged man, I loved the film. Some of this might also be because I took my teenager with me and since she got such a kick out of the film, I couldn't help but like the film. I thoroughly enjoyed ENCHANTED and am glad I saw it. However, after it was over I thought to myself how would others like the film? After all, I am a real softie and like romantic films--what about teenage boys, guys who only cry at John Wayne flicks or rabid feminists? I seriously doubt these audiences would have appreciated the film nearly as much, say, a group of young girls or people who just love the Disney cartoons it parodies. Still, for the right audience, this is a sweet and magical film that is sure to please.",9,6,8,3 January 2008
The Usual Suspects," Well made...it just isn't the sort of film I particularly enjoy.
","language a bit confusing during boat attack, where were cops? hard to like anyone in film'The Usual Suspects' is a well-made film from start to finish and I do recommend you see it...maybe. Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, 'Good Fellas' and 'The Fight Club' are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like 'The Fight Club' or 'The Crying Game' and so I'll stop with that.The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then 'The Usual Suspects' is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film! Seriously.",8,7,11,21 February 2013
Inside Out," Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney.
","One important note: If you go see 'Inside Out' be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, 'Lava'. It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like 'Inside Out', its audience really is adults, not kids.This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in 'Inside Out', you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex.The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.",9,16,43,18 June 2015
Quantum of Solace," Action-packed...but it has almost no story.
","I am probably not exactly the target audience for 'Quantum of Solace'. After all, my biggest complaint about the James Bond series is that over the years the films have become more and more and more stunt-oriented (which means less and less plot-driven). While the series has always had its stunts, my favorite films are the earlier, less stunt-intensive ones. The latest batch from Daniel Craig have turned the uber-stunt craze of the films into high gear--though I did really enjoy 'Casino Royale'. I can easily understand why he suffered so many injuries during the filming of 'Quantum of SOlace'--the stunts are insane. The best of Craig's three Bond films was the first ('Casino Royale')--the one with the least dramatic stunts and most plot. Perhaps this should tell the studio something. They might save a few dollars and make better films if they considered this.So is there much plot beyond all the action? Well, not really...or at least not much. An organization named 'QUANTUM' plans on cornering the market on oil...or water. And, like SPECTRE, they are a multinational organization dedicated to destabilizing nations and behind the scenes control of the world. Bond doesn't like them and spends the film chasing them. That's really all there is to it.I think of this film like kids who get underwear for Christmas. Their hearts are set for the big day and what did Santa bring? A bike, a new game system or a football? Nope...underwear! That is what it was like having 'Quantum of Solace' following the wonderful Bond film 'Casino Royale'!! Too many dumb stunts, too many disconnected scenes, too little plot and practically no chance for James Craig to act, as he's always running, shooting and avoiding being shot!! A huge disappointment. And, by the way, the opening song sucked! $200,000,000 for all that?!UPDATE: After sending in this review to IMDb, I had to add one more thing. At the end of the film, Bond has captured the guy responsible for EVERYTHING and lets him go to a possible death or not! What the $%** was that?! Who thought this was an appropriate way to end the film?!",5,4,9,12 December 2013
The Dirty Dozen," You can almost smell the testosterone when watching this great war flick
","I have seen a lot of films over the year--meaning, I guess, I need to get a life! However, despite all the hours I have spent on films, I rarely watch a film twice and practically never see a film more than that. It is a tribute to the greatness of this film that I have probably seen it four times over the years and each time I marvel at the film with its wonderful ensemble cast and excitement that just oozes off the screen! There are very, very few war films that are better than this and I almost found myself giving this movie a score of 10. However, since I RARELY give films a '10', I am hesitant to do so here but I mean no disrespect against this nearly perfect film. If you asked me what three features made this film great in particular, I would say the excellent direction, the long but always engaging script and most importantly, Lee Marvin--in his greatest role of his career.Marvin is placed in charge of a group of 12 demented sociopaths who are given the choice to either join him in a suicide mission or have their full sentences enforced (and in many cases, this means the death penalty). While a few of the 12 are naturally just faces in the film, there are so many wonderful standout performances that give the film so much color and depth. Telly Savalas was given perhaps the most exciting and depraved role in the film and he milked it for all its worth. Charles Bronson and Clint Walker both played strong but decent men who seemed to transcend their circumstances. Jim Brown had a great role that seemed to justify his early retirement from football. Donald Sutherland was a freak--and a very lovable and cool freak at that. But the best role of the 12 was that given to John Cassavetes as the malignant jerk, 'Franko'.Apart from these 12 twisted men, Marvin was given TONS of support from some terrific character actors--Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Richard Jaekel, Ralph Meeker, Robert Ryan and Robert Webber. With all these wonderful actors gathered together, it's natural that you'd have an excellent film. What was amazing is that with all this talent, Marvin STILL managed to upstage them all with his tough as nails role as the group's commander! As for the plot, it's so very long and complicated I'd rather not get into it, since it's already listed on IMDb. However, when I say long, this is NOT a complaint. I love long movies provided the script is tight and merits the extreme length and complexity. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and GONE WITH THE WIND both fall in this category, while THE English PATIENT seems like one of the longest movies ever because it is so dull and needed to be desperately shortened.The bottom line is that this is an exciting film from start to finish thanks to every aspect of the film working perfectly together. I also appreciated some parts of the script that were risks--injecting humor into such a gritty film as well as the horrific way the film ended. Both aspects of the film worked but could have easily fallen flat with the audience.A great film and a must-see for any serious fan of cinema.By the way, many years later, a follow-up to THE DIRTY DOZEN was made for TV. It was totally unnecessary and is very skipable. As the old expression goes, 'you can never go back'.",9,3,6,29 June 2007
Gone with the Wind," About as good as it gets in 1930s Hollywood
","I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time.",10,9,16,5 August 2006
No Country for Old Men," It's funny how the best Coen Brothers movies never win the Oscars!
","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a very good movie, however, like FARGO, it received tons of attention from the Oscars even though I don't think either rank among the Coen Brothers' best films. I know this sounds very radical, but I have seen all of their films and don't think either film is as good or creative as OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? or THE HUDSUCKER PROXY or RAISING ARIZONA or THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. Now OH BROTHER did at least some attention from the Oscars, but not nearly as much as the first two mentioned--even though OH BROTHER is amazing and a very easy film to see multiple times.As far as acting goes, it was very good all the way around. Josh Brolin was just fine, Javier Bardem was even scarier than the Biker of the Apocalypse in RAISING ARIZONA and Tommy Lee Jones really came off best of the three in a very subdued but likable role.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is not a comedy, so people expecting laughs will sure be in for a surprise when they see this film. Instead, it's a very bloody, tense and occasionally difficult to watch suspense film that pays off in most every way except for a very unsatisfying ending. Even though I dislike violent films, I must admit that NO COUNTRY sure handled it amazingly well and kept my attention. It certainly was directed exceptionally well. I just hope its success doesn't encourage the Coen's to abandon comedy--which, I think, is much more their forte.Well, considering this film has 50000002 reviews so far, I think I'll stop here. Suffice to say it's a very good film but certainly NOT a film to let your kids see due to its very, very graphic violence.",8,9,15,18 October 2008
The Love Guru," One of the main characters is named 'Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande'---I think this says all you need to know about this lovely and incredibly subtle film...
","Didn't someone during the entire production process stop to realize that it just wasn't funny?! I mean, it's pretty obvious from all the many, many lame jokes that fall flat that there is something seriously wrong with this film. Instead of being funny, it all comes off as incredibly self-indulgent and sad--especially since you see so much of Mike Myers. You see Myers singing and dancing, pulling floss out of his butt, a long segment featuring a child with Myers' head superimposed on him, Myers' CONSTANT mugging as if he is saying 'Wow...ain't I cute?!' and a constant barrage of Myers in every single season! After a very short time, it becomes very, very tiresome--like an Austin Powers movie without a single joke.As far as the plot goes, it's all about Myers trying to reconcile a hockey player with his estranged wife....if anyone really cares. And, due to a huge number of Razzie awards and poor box office returns, no one did. Don't waste your time unless you are 100% obsessed with Mike Myers and want to watch nothing but what look like outtakes. How could a movie with this big a budget and this many guest appearances be this bad?! Crap.",1,13,24,23 June 2010
District 9," This is mind-blowing!
","This is such an incredibly weird movie that I am not even sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll try. The film is, through the first half, a mockumentary about a problematic alien problem that will supposedly be happening in the near future. In 2010, an alien ship appears over Johannesburg and just hovers there. When humans eventually decide to cut through the hull, they find the ship packed with over a million aliens--aliens that are starving and look like giant bugs. Well, there seems to be no one in charge and they all are apparently workers who have no real purpose other than to work. When the UN decides to finally do something about it, the aliens are herded into a giant ghetto like those used during apartheid. And, for the most part, they are reviled or exploited--and kept as a permanent underclass.The film mostly centers around a rather dim civil servant, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). He is the leader of an organization sent in to move the bugs to a new facility that also totally sucks--but is away from the humans--who have come to totally distrust and hate them. But, in the process he accidentally infects himself...and where this goes next is just amazingly weird! And, once infected, the film stops being a mockumentary and follows his new life as a wanted man. Why is he wanted, who wants him and what this is all about is just too much for this short review--really.So let's talk about the film. I used to think that movies like 'Happiness of the Katakuris', 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World' and 'Delicatessen' were weird films, but 'District 9' clearly sets a new standard for weird and creative. You simply cannot find anything like it--and it's wonderful to find a film that is this unique. Plus, like good sci-fi, this one is a great allegory with deeper contemporary meaning--with a lot to say about us screwed up humans! By the way, this movie is rated-R and it clearly deserves this. The language is very, very rough but the film is also very gross--with lots of blood, guys, vomiting and the like. It is NOT for a person with a weak stomach or children...seriously...do NOT let the kids see this one! Because of this, although I loved this film and was blown away by it, I also cannot see it as a perfect film--hence my not giving it a 10. It's just unnecessarily adult when it could have been a great film for a much wider audience.",9,8,16,13 August 2010
Mamma Mia!," Excellent music--so good that even these folks couldn't mess it up completely.
","My daughter is right...it's probably better to just pop in an ABBA album than watch this film. However, despite cringing at a few of the songs (one of Pierce Brosnan's solos made my ears bleed and Julie Walter's 'Take a Chance' made me attempt suicide--twice) and blanching at the dopey plot, I couldn't help but still enjoy the film on a totally brainless level because no matter who sings the songs (even Pierce), you can't help but tap your feet and enjoy the songs of ABBA...even if it's being sung by boobs. Like most people who saw this film, it brought me back to my younger days when the group was still around...however, my love for ABBA does NOT mean that I am so blinded as to ignore the many dumb moments in this film.Here are the dumb points to this film:1. The film is basically BUONA SERA MRS. CAMPBELL set to ABBA music. Come on, folks--try something new. 2.Clichés, clichés, clichés!!! Some of the worst and most amateur writing and dialog I've heard in years.3. You make a musical and you choose people who can either sing adequately (Streep) or barely at all. Brosnan actually wasn't always horrible in the film (his third solo song was nice) but when he was bad, he was bad....really bad. Worse than Satan bad!4. It's a great message for the kids here--a heart-warming family film about a single mom who turns out to be a super-slut. And, despite risking STDs and having a kid to raise all alone, everything works out perfectly in the end (14 year-olds take note).5. Garish production numbers and a case of too much, too often when it comes to the songs. It often took the place of plot and made the film look, at times, like a giant music video. A musical is not the same as a two hour long music video.So, while it's obvious that I didn't like the movie technically (uggh), it STILL is worth seeing just because ABBA is just amazing. Instead, however, I'd have just preferred they kidnapped Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Frida and made them perform once last time on film--now THAT would have been worth seeing! Oh, and while I am thinking of it, all you oldsters out there (like me), you might want to think twice about seeing this film around your kids unless they already love ABBA---otherwise you'll never get them to like or listen to ABBA again after hearing their songs sung so poorly.By the way, read over Leandro Dubost's review for a laugh. I really enjoyed the Hitler comment--not at all politically correct, but it made me laugh",3,4,11,27 July 2009
Remember the Titans," A bit 'Hollywoodized' but who cares?!
","Generally speaking, I am a pretty jaded reviewer on IMDb. I am not known for being overly generous to films and I must admit that I am often very critical. It is in light of my very critical nature that my loving this film is so amazing. I have seen it several times and although it occasionally changes a few minor details of the real-life football team to make the film more poignant, the overall film is truthful and uplifting. If you are curious about these inaccuracies, read through the list on IMDb, though this didn't lessen my appreciation for the film when I read them. That's because despite these changes, the acting still was great, the direction and writing wonderful and highly manipulative (in a positive way). This is a film for anyone--child, teen or adult. And the part about this I like the best is that I have shown this film to teens and those who hate football still have loved the movie. Marvelous entertainment that anyone but the most jaded can enjoy.",9,6,11,10 June 2007
Toy Story 4," Going to the well yet another time...enough already!
","I know that 'Toy Story' is a beloved franchise...I get that. But at the same time, it's a movie that's spawned three sequels AND countless shorts. Despite a complete lack of originality, however, folks still love the films and the Academy keeps awarding Pixar with Oscars for the movies. As for me, I've had enough and would really love to see the studio focus on something new and original.The story is about a new toy, 'Forky' the spork--a toy that Bonnie made at kindergarten out of some trash. Forky is trash and doesn't get the concept of being a toy....and constantly is trying to throw himself away despite Woody's best efforts to keep him with Bonnie. In the process, Woody ends up getting separated from Bonnie at Great Basin National Park (on the Nevada/Utah border). Can he find his way back to Bonnie? And, what about Forky?Although the film lacks originality, I hate to admit that it is gorgeous....with about the nicest looking CGI I can recall having seen. It is lovely to look at and the characters are more fluid and lovely to look at than ever before. Perhaps this is why it got an Oscar....it certainly wasn't for any other conceivable reason.
After all, it's yet another film where the toys try to find their way back home....just like in all the other films. Overall, an enjoyable film that is nice to watch and with a few enjoyable moments...but nothing more. It's essentially 'Toy Story', 'Toy Story 2' and 'Toy Story 3' all over again.By the way, like other Toy Story movies, the creepy characters in this one are the Vincent marionettes. And, they are mega-creepy nightmare fuel.",5,1,5,11 February 2020
Batman Begins," A vast improvement over the Batman films of the 1990s
","I enjoyed the film BATMAN from Tim Burton, though I'll be the first to admit that it was very, very dark and disturbing. I'd also agree that the Batman role in this and subsequent films was a bit one-dimensional--with a much greater emphasis on the villains and amazing cartoon-like scenes. However, despite enjoying the first film, the subsequent films were a disappointment to me as they just seemed overloaded with special effects and were a bit light on character development.In light of this, I really appreciated how the Batman character was hashed out and given much greater depth in BATMAN BEGINS--especially because it explains the long evolution of Bruce Wayne to caped crusader. Christian Bale was very good in the leading role and the story was very unusual but enjoyable to a point--though the plot did get awfully convoluted towards the end. In fact, I would say that the least interesting part of the film was the final conflict at the end, as this seemed a lot like previous Batman films--full of special effects but that's about all.Now my quibbles with BATMAN BEGINS are quite minor and I can't fault the movie too much because it doesn't pretend to be Shakespeare or a contender for a Sundance award! It is just old fashioned entertainment. Not especially deep, but entertaining.By the way, when I saw this film I was amazed at the high-priced talent organized for this film--Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman. In particular, Freeman and Caine were terrific in the film.",7,7,14,3 July 2008
Wreck-It Ralph," A lot to like--a lot to annoy---it's a real mixed bag here.
","'Wreck-It Ralph' is incredibly inventive and enjoyable--or at least MOST of the film. Up until the movie neared the end, I would have scored this one an 8--it was that good. But, the ending managed to annoy me and create a lot of ill-will in me.The film worked very, very well in several ways. Seeing the arcade characters on their 'time off from work' at the end of the day was GREAT. In fact, I wish I'd seen more of this--especially the homages to classic arcade games like Sonic and Q-Bert. It also had amazing graphics. But, it also seemed to have too much story--way too much story. And, at the end, just about every cliché known to Disney (even including the Disney Princess notion!) was tossed in--and destroying much of the momentum in the movie. Then, all the inventiveness was gone--and it a by-the-numbers film that just stopped being fun when the whole race plot began. Overall, a very mixed bag. I loved most of it but cannot heartily recommend it. My advice? See it once. Or, if you are a little kid and can watch formulaic Disney fare again and again, then by all means watch it until your brain drips out your ears. This should have been a lot better--it's as if Disney was more concerned about marketing than providing a top-notch film.",6,2,12,1 March 2013
Meet the Fockers," Watchable and often funny...and often cringe-worthy and amazingly low-brow.
","This is the sort of movie it's best to watch exactly the way I watched it. I did NOT see it in theaters, on DVD or through Netflix but on TV...during an evening where I was frankly too sick to see what else is on the tube. Now this isn't saying it's a bad film--it just isn't something I'd rush out to watch...unless I was on crack! 'Meet the Fockers' picks up after the previous film 'Meet the Parents'. In this installment of the series, Greg and his fiancé have somehow agreed to accompany her parents to meet his in Miami. The dad (Robert De Niro) is his usual very uptight and over-controlling self and mostly everyone in the family stands back and watches him run roughshod over everyone--until they meet Ben Stiller's parents. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are nearly the complete opposites of their counterparts. Instead of being uptight, they are very, very open...TOO OPEN. And this brings some of most embarrassing and often tacky moments of the film--moments that make you want to turn off the film. But, as I was sick, I left it. And, overall, I wasn't that dissatisfied. No, it's not really good--but it's a time-killer and at least made me forget some of my pain....and experience all new forms of pain! Generally watchable but stupid.",5,0,1,20 May 2011
Zulu," I wasn't sure who to root for in this one...
","There was a strange tradition in the US for Hollywood to feature British colonialism in a VERY positive light--especially during the 1930s and 40s. Brits were clearly the heroes in many classic films of the era. Yet, looking at it through 21st century lenses, you wonder why we rooted for them. After all, the locals were fighting them in order to gain their independence--just like we Americans did in 1776. So you'd THINK we'd be rooting for the Zulus in 'Zulu' thought this film, too, seems to portray the natives as somewhat savage (though well organized and tough in this case) and the Brits as good--though not quite as heroic and good as they'd appear in the 30s-40s. As this was made in the 60s, some folks like Hook (the malingerer) and the missionaries are less than noble--a bit of a change from the old pattern at least.The story is based on the defense of a tiny fort in South Africa during 1879--in the Natal region (in the Northeastern part of the country). This makes for a VERY tense and intense film. At times, you sit there anticipating the inevitable and at others it's non-stop frenetic slaughter. It's exceptionally well made throughout and gives you a real feel for what it must have been like.By the way, according to IMDb this film is historically inaccurate in that in this fight with the Zulus, only 17 British soldiers were killed. I lost track at 157239238 killed (give or take) during the course of the film!! Although it's NOT the ideal film for this, I watched this movie because I am headed to South Africa in the next few weeks. In addition, I've gotten a hold of a few other films about the country and am watching them to get me in the mood--though, aside from 'Invictus', I can't think of any films about modern post-apartheid South Africa. If you can think of any appropriate films, drop me a line.",9,5,7,22 January 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Pretty much what you'd expect in any sequel
","The best thing about 'How to Train Your Dragon' was its originality. While 'Toy Story 3' won the Oscar (hardly an original film), I much preferred the dragon movie. The second best thing were the eye- popping CGI graphics. The sequel, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' at least features one of these things and is worth seeing despite being completely unoriginal and, in some ways, a step back for the franchise.The film features most of what you'd expect--a formulaic baddie, characters growing into themselves and the great flight scenes. What I did NOT expect was the unnecessary and confusing introduction of Hiccup's mother--something that NEVER made much sense and made her seem like a horrible person. The tribe didn't understand her and her love of dragons...so she left her husband and newborn baby!! Huh?! To make it even more confusing is that Hiccup, his dad and everyone else accepted her back with open arms. Call me odd, but I thought this entire plot line made no sense and was very poorly realized. Yet, despite all these defects, the film is entertaining and nice to look at...but nothing more.",7,3,7,28 May 2015
The Chorus," an excellent family film
","This film is, at times, a bit predictable. However, considering how wonderful the journey is and how well executed everything is, the occasional predictability is NOT a detriment--in fact, it's nice that the film works out the way you hope.The film is about a teacher at a residential school for troubled boys in 1949. The kids are angry and the atmosphere of the school oppressive. The new guy doesn't have all the answers, but he is decent and the kids slowly respond to this. In addition, he adores music and decides to channel the kids' energy into a chorus. Unfortunately, throughout his stay at the school, the headmaster does a lot to try to undo the good that is done and he seems to genuinely hate the children. Despite this, the teacher and the kids seem to overcome this atmosphere of tension through their music. The music, by the way, is exquisite. Even if you don't understand French, it is marvelous to hear and greatly adds to the overall feeling of the film. Wonderful and heart-felt throughout--but somehow manages not to be sickeningly sweet or contrived.",9,2,3,8 May 2006
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Strange and pretty much impossible to describe.
","Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' worth seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you'll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won't be exactly sure why!",8,8,13,15 June 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Very clever--and I am amazed they could sustain the film's momentum throughout.
","I am amazed that folks from the studio that made this had no idea how to market it and actually shelved it for several years. It SHOULD have done extremely well in the theaters, as it's an exceptionally made and very quirky little film. It's a parody of slasher films and manages to enchant the viewer throughout.The film begins with a group of annoying college kids heading off for the clichéd camping trip in the woods. Soon they see some local hillbillies who the kids have convinced themselves might just be killers such as you'd see in a slasher film or 'Deliverance'. However, two of these locals, Tucker and Dale, are very sweet and peaceful guys despite their appearance. But, every time they appear, the idiots think the pair are killers and they overreact. It's all rather funny--but the fun is yet to come.Later, when the pair are out fishing at night, the young idiots who are camping nearby go swimming. When one of them sees the two, she assumes they have come to kill her and she falls into the water--hitting her head on the way down to the water. She'll drown but Dale jumps into the water and saves her. But, her friends THINK the pair have killed Allison and they run in terror. Not knowing what to do, they take her back to their cabin and Dale makes her pancakes. No big deal, right? WRONG!! The idiot young folks assume Allison is dead and they decide to attack--and a long and crazy chain of events takes place that only serves to convince them more and more that Dale and Tucker were serial killers! There's more....but I don't want to spoil the sick fun.The plot idea for this film would make a great 20-30 minute movie. I wondered how they could sustain it for 90 minutes--but they did. How? Well, the key is that they made Dale and Tucker (particularly Dale) so gosh-darn likable as well as complex. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that this film will become a cult favorite, as it has a lot going for it. Great acting, writing and direction--I sure can't wait to see more from these folks. What a fine movie.While it might not surprise you, this IS a very, very bloody film. My wife and I laughed at the blood and gore and you probably will, too. But I would NOT let kids see this one, that's for sure.Also, during the scene with the crazy guy firing the revolver, note how the gun fires 10-12 bullets without reloading. I don't' think this is a mistake--more just an inside joke, as such a gun would run out of bullets long before this.",9,5,9,3 December 2011
Foxcatcher," Bereft of energy, I wanted to like this film like most others but couldn't.
","When 'Foxcatcher' debuted, there was a lot of talk about it being an Oscar-contender--for both best picture as well as acting awards. However, after finally getting to see it, I was shocked. Was this the same great film? It certainly didn't seem great. It seemed, amazingly, rather boring--and it's hard to imagine this considering what actually occurred.First I will talk about what I liked in the film. The wrestling looked really good. I wrestled for several years and would know if they wrestling sequences were crap--they weren't and I appreciate the shape the actors got in to do the film.Now, what I didn't like. I have rarely seen a film more bereft of energy than this one. Heck, compared to this an Ingmar Bergman film looks like a Disney picture!! Stark music, stark cinematography and actors who are practically mute make this a very hard film to energize the audience. Plus, often events in the film seemed incomplete--as if you were supposed to know exactly what happened to Mark Schultz in the 1988 Olympics or what motivated Du Pont to commit murder. Instead, it's all a very bland cipher. Additionally, the historical accuracy of the film and timeline are often wrong and could have been better.Overall, a huge disappointment--much of which is because of all the hoopla about the film but also because it was so lifeless and dull and didn't need to be.",5,1,5,27 July 2015
City of God," a horrible movie that I strongly recommend
","When I say 'horrible' I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there's an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It's really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class. But, the sight of a room full of naked teens with their penises a-dangling changed my mind!",9,12,22,13 November 2005
Cars," The film made a ton of money, it's been merchandised like no other Disney film and it's got a sequel....but I still was not bowled over by this one.
","By now, 'Cars' is an old film--and I am FINALLY getting around to reviewing it. So much for staying ahead of the curve! But because there are already a ton of reviews, I'll keep this short.So what did I like about the film? Well, the animation is just unreal-- it's gorgeous from start to finish. It's obvious that John Lasseter is insane for cars and put a ton of effort into this one. GORGEOUS! As for the rest of the film, it's quite good, though I wasn't quite as bowled over by it as some. After all, it now has a sequel, a semi-sequel ('Planes') and some spin-off 'Mater shorts. I don't think the film was THAT good. But it was clearly enjoyable and pleasant throughout. Well worth seeing though I wish that Pixar would stop emphasizing sequels and started work on more originality. I understand why they don't, as it's all about marketing--and they marketed the crap out of this film.",8,2,4,8 May 2014
The Little Mermaid," Aside from a 'parents are stupid' m, a wonderful film.
","I love 'The Little Mermaid' and it's a brilliantly made film. It also represents the rebirth of Disney Studio--a film that firmly announced that they were once again a great producer of family full-length cartoons. This being said, I have one very minor quibble about the movie--very minor. The meta-message seems to be that parents are a bit stupid and kids should be encouraged to make their own choices. While this is sometimes true, it's a message too often found in films of the 1980s. Now I am NOT attacking Disney for this--too often Steven Spielberg and others promoted this message during this time, so why shouldn't the studio hop on the bandwagon? This is the sole reason the film only gets a 9 from me, not a 10. And, this is why I adored their followup film, 'Beauty and the Beast', as it had a marvelous message from start to finish. Still, 'Little Mermaid' has GREAT music, a fun story and some wonderful animation--and only a real curmudgeon could hate it.",9,6,8,13 October 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I didn't understand all the excitement
","Before I begin, I must point out that I like samurai and martial arts movies. So I didn't watch this film with a negative mind set.This movie is neither good nor bad--it has some of each aspect. First the bad. While MANY loved the bizarre and over-the-top action sequences (complete with wall walking and flying across the trees), I didn't. It only served to obscure the good writing, photography and acting. Many praised it, but it just seemed a little dopey--sort of like combining a kung fu movie with a Sylvester Stalone or Disney pic. Second, few films can match the hype surrounding it. By the time I saw it, my expectations were too high. I do like some of the old-time Hong Kong kung fu movies--in these films with cheesy special effects and over-the-top action, such excesses are to be expected. In a big-budget and more Western-oriented film, it all just seems out of place.Now the good. It was a visually stunning movie and generally kept my interest. That's really about it. Maybe you'll like it, but I was left feeling amazingly flat and unimpressed.",7,10,21,25 May 2005
Beasts of No Nation," About as unpleasant as any film can be.
","I have seen several documentaries about the insane fighting throughout Africa, such as in the Congo. Rebel forces often consist of little more than private armies of mere children brainwashed into committing the worst atrocities. And, they long ago lost track of their goals of freedom or power--and are simply bend on destruction and death. The Netflix film 'Beasts of No Nation' is a dramatization of such an army but the exact countries involved are never mentioned...and it could be one of several across the continent.The film centers on a boy who appears to be about 8-10 years old, Agu. When the film begins, he's living in a zone controlled by the UN, though true to form the UN troops soon leave and the village is destroyed by government forces. Agu runs into the bush and eventually comes into contact with the rebel group, the NDF. This group is run by the Commandant (Idris Elba)--an awful combination of father, prophet, guru, rapist and the Devil. The process by which Agu is brainwashed and turned into a killing machine makes up the most of this film.So is this any good? Yes and no. The film is very well made and compelling. But, it is also hellish and awful--so awful I cannot imagine anyone WANTING to see it. Viewing the film is more an endurance contest than anything else. In other words, can the viewer even watch it to the end since it's thoroughly unpleasant...so unpleasant that it makes 'Hotel Rwanda' seem like a Disney film by comparison!! Pedophilia, rape, brutal murders and death...this is 'Beasts of No Nation' in a nutshell. Documentaries on the same subject are easier to watch and just as informative.",6,5,12,28 February 2016
Gone Girl," 880 reviews and counting....
","I just saw 'Gone Girl' tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I'd rate it. It's good...but I can't see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like 'journalist', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film 'Leave Her to Heaven'. But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.",7,2,7,24 February 2015
Django Unchained," Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.
","My biggest complaints about 'Django Unchained' are ones that really won't matter to most people who see this film. After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.The film is, in some ways, like an Italian western. I loved that much of the music was done by Ennio Merricone--the same guy who did music for such classic spaghetti westerns as 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. It was a major plus. I also liked seeing that one of the many wonderful cameos was by Franco Nero--the original Django. But, if you think that this is a modern Hollywood version of an Italian western, you are mistaken. PARTS of it are--most is not. In fact, despite the western clothing on so many of the characters (anachronistic, actually), the film is mostly set in the American South just before the Civil War. People just didn't dress that way at that time and in that place. The film is, at times, sort of like a blaxspoitation western in style as well.What did I like about the film? Well, it was never, ever dull. The film never really gives you a chance--even though it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Second, as I mentioned above, there were a lot of cool cameos--and some were real surprises, such as Tom Wopat and Bruce Dern! Third, although it was vile, the language was dead on--no politically corrected phraseology in this one! Nasty and blunt, that's for sure. Fourth, although it was really violent and gross, I will admit that there is something very satisfying in seeing all these racist jerks killed so violently. It appeals to the lowest instinct in us...but on a primal level is IS appealing. Finally, the acting was quite good.What didn't I like? Well, even for a Tarantino film it was violent---very violent. Also, I definitely agree that the first hour or so of the film was MUCH better. It was better paced, less indulgent and more enjoyable. The film did become a bit of a free-for-all blood-fest near the end and the 'mandingo fighting scene' was unnecessarily nasty. Still, if you have the stomach for it, 'Django Unchained' is a heck of an enjoyable film.By the way, I did a little research and there appears to be no such thing as 'mandingo fighting'. This was made up for this film.",8,6,15,26 January 2013
Drive," Amazingly violent....so beware.
","I should point out at the onset that this really isn't the sort of film I like--so keep this in mind. I decided to watch 'Drive' because it received a lot of critical attention but was ignored at the Oscars. And, since I'd heard so much good stuff about it, I decided to rent it.'Drive' is a SUPER-violent film. While the number of deaths isn't as extreme as some films, the deaths that do occur are among the bloodiest and closeup you will ever see in a movie. You see a person get their head blown apart at close range with a shotgun, you see a man stomped to death (complete with lots of squishy sound effects) and a guy stabbed in the eye and then in the throat! Do NOT let kids see this film and think twice about seeing it yourself. It is brutal...very, very brutal--and this might be why it didn't get any major Oscar nominations.The film begins very well. I really liked the music and thought it quite fitting. Ryan Gosling plays a guy who is a spectacularly talented driver--so much that he does stunts for films and also drives getaway for crooks. I know the film makers were trying to make him super-cool by having him show ZERO emotion and talk rarely. I just thought this was too underplayed for my taste. As for the mobsters in the film, they are quite the opposite. Albert Brooks (yes, THAT Albert Brooks) plays a maniac killer--a guy who loves to use knives and razors on his victims. Ron Perlman isn't much nicer! Bryan Cranston is also on hand but never gets around to killing anyone.When Gosling meets a nice lady (Cary Mulligan) and befriends her and her son, he learns she has a husband who is in jail. Instead of trying to steal her, he actually helps the guy when he gets out of jail. It seems that the mob is going to make the husband perform one last robbery--then they'll let him and his family live--and Gosling agrees to drive the getaway car. But it all blows up in their face--it's all a setup and it looks like EVERYONE will eventually die. Can the almost zombie-like Gosling manage to take on the gang and survive?I personally respect the film but thought it was way too over-mannered and way too artsy for my taste--as well as WAY too bloody. If this if your thing, fine. I just didn't enjoy this sort of thing though it's well made.",7,7,12,4 February 2012
Bolt," Slight but very charming
","The plot concerns a dog (Bolt) who doesn't realize that his entire life is just a TV show. So, when he accidentally gets lost in the real world, he cannot understand why his super-powers have disappeared. And so, until he meets a wise and worldly cat, he flounders--unable to figure out how he got there or how to get back to the little girl he loves.This is not the deepest story I have ever seen for a computer animated movie, but it was quite charming and fun--something that many other family movies could emulate. In fact, compared to previous Disney-produced CGI movies (other than those from the separate Pixar unit), BOLT is a significant improvement--both in story and in animation quality. If you don't believe this, just try watching CHICKEN LITTLE some time--it lacks the charm and universal appeal of BOLT. In other words, CHICKEN LITTLE was purely for very little kids--adults would mostly be bored by the film. MEET THE ROBINSONS was a bit of an improvement, but with BOLT I could finally enjoy the movie along with my kids.Fun, well-animated and different. While not exactly a must-see, this is a very good film.",8,3,4,26 September 2009
Frozen," I like it, but apparently not as much as most folks.
","Currently, 'Frozen' has a very high IMDb score of 8.1. I was actually surprised by this, as I did enjoy the film but though it had some plot problems that prevented it from being among Disney's best in recent years. Apparently, other folks don't agree with me.The film is supposedly based on Han Christian Andersen's story 'The Snow Queen', however little of the finished film seems to be related to this story...very little. This isn't really a criticism--I am just trying to clarify the film a bit.The story is about two sisters--one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. However, the Queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel), has a huge problem that is never really explained in the film--she has magical powers to make things frozen as well as to create snow. While this seems great, it's also a dangerous power and one she cannot fully control--and she COULD accidentally kill someone. Once she becomes queen, the power is exposed--and she disappears into the mountains to live life apart from others.The younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), decides to do what any responsible lady would do in this situation--abandon her kingdom and give control of it to an almost complete stranger! Why she didn't just send some of her people out to find Elsa is beyond me. Regardless, along the way she meets a guy who is to become an obvious love interest and together they seek out Elsa and try to bring her back to the kingdom. After all, since Elsa's departure, the place has been bathed in perpetual winter! The film is glorious to watch--particularly on the big screen. The CGI is absolutely lovely as are the character designs. However, it's a film that looks great but whose story is less than stellar. Part of it is because the characters sometimes do inexplicable things (mentioned above), part of it is because parts of the plot are missing (such as explaining how everyone LOVED the interim leader yet hated him later--after he'd actually done a good job in regard to the people as well as why everyone suddenly hated the guy from Weaseltown) and part of it is because there were too many distractions when the main thrust SHOULD have been the relationship between the sisters (the reindeer and guys got in the way). Still, it is worth seeing--especially if you don't spend too much time thinking through the plot. Plus, many might enjoy the more Broadway style of the music, as Idina Menzel really pours it on when she sings (as do the rest, though she clearly overshadows them with her magnificent singing).",7,91,147,9 January 2014
The Lives of Others," An amazing film since the director had never directed another full-length film before this!
","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck directed this film and it's amazing that he'd never directed a full-length movie before this! And, it went on to win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film and now is the 50th highest rated film on IMDb! The film is set mostly in East Germany in 1984. The film is about the Stasi (German secret police) and their investigation of a playwright. It is interesting because through the course of their investigation, the man in charge starts to relate to the folks he's listening to and eventually abandons his determination to work for the regime. In fact, over time he slowly begins to cover up much of the writer's anti-government activities and tries very hard to save the guy.There is much more to the movie and it it hadn't been reviewed so many times already, I would give a much more detailed review. Suffice to say that the film has terrific acting, nice direction and a wonderful script. Well worth seeing.",9,4,7,14 March 2015
Good Will Hunting," As long as you realize there are LOTS of errors in the movie, it is entertaining
","This movie got lots of kudos when it came out and most of them were deserved. The acting is exceptional and in some ways the writing is fine as well. However, given my background as an individual therapist, the movie is a mess psychologically speaking. First, although I generally like Robin Williams in the movie, his physical attack on the main character (though deserved) would result in him losing his license. I have felt like hitting many clients--particularly sociopaths like Will but it just can't occur in real life--particularly since a guy like Will would also be the type to make sure the police and licensing board found out ASAP! Second, given that Will is a sociopath (he has all the signs of an Antisocial Personality), he would not be cured by the end of the flick. Many therapists feel that antisocials cannot be successfully treated while those who DO feel treatment will help would never think about doing short-term therapy with such a vicious powder keg. The movie is pretty good but the sappy Hollywood ending ruins the movie and gives the general public very unrealistic expectations about therapy.",5,8,25,5 June 2005
The Incredibles," Exceptional fare for the entire family
","While I wasn't quite as fond of this C.G. film as I was of TOY STORY II , it was one of the better computer generated films I've seen. Much of this is because like all the better movies of this type, it is marketed and designed for both kids and adults. My brother and his wife have no kids and yet they called me to plead with me to see the film after they'd seen it--and that is why this is such an appealing film. The animation is lovely, the characters pretty exciting and interesting and the story is pretty good as well. Oddly, however, what I remember most was NOT the movie but one of the extras on the DVD called 'Jack-Jack Attack'. For those of you who have not seen the DVD or only watched the feature film, please go back NOW and see this extra as it greatly enhanced the film and provided a nice infusion of humor that the movie sometimes needed. Overall, a terrific film and well worth your time.",9,2,5,10 June 2007
The Mist," Two hours of torment and misery...which is, I guess, what folks expect.
","There are a few important warnings I have about this film. It's incredibly violent and at times pretty gross...so exercise caution before watching it. Additionally, the character Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) will likely offend many religious people. The story is set in a New England town. A weird mist descends on the village and a group of people are trapped inside a grocery store. When a teen tries running from the store to get help, he's torn apart by a multi-tentacled monster....but only a few people see this happen. A Some of the rest of them don't believe the story about the tentacle monster in the mist and make a run for it...and disappear. Soon, regardless of whether the rest of them believe or not, they believe SOMETHING god-awful has occurred....and gigantic evil bugs begin attacking. And, it only gets worse...thanks to human nature which takes an awful situation and makes it so much worse....including a weirdo religious nut who VERY quickly (too quickly) develops a cult-like following. What's next? It only gets much worser!I like the angle about human nature tearing the group of people apart...this is the best aspect of the movie in my opinion. However, a few of the characters (particularly the amazingly unsubtle Mrs. Carmody) are ridiculous and over-the-top. Subtle, it sure isn't! Additionally, after a while I simply got tired of seeing the violence and ugliness...especially since it goes on for more than two hours. I must admit, this is NOT the sort of picture I normally watch....and it's very likely others might enjoy (?) the film more than I did. Thoroughly unpleasant, albeit a bit thought-provoking when it comes to folks reactions to the menaces.",4,4,6,24 April 2018
I Am Legend," Watchable but unnecessary
","The book 'I am Legend' has supposedly been made into a film three times (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, THE OMEGA MAN as well as I AM LEGEND). However, all three are quite different from the story and in most ways they are inferior (ultimately missing the point of the book in the process). Had this Will Smith film actually stuck with the original story, it would have been well worth making. However, in many ways it was much closer to OMEGA MAN than the book. Now, considering that OMEGA MAN was a really cool sci-fi film AND the newest film didn't stick all that close to the book, you wonder why it was made in the first place. Oh, wait...it starred Smith, had a huge budget AND lots of special effects--that's apparently the only reason many films are made by Hollywood these days!! According to IMDb, they didn't even have a finished script before they began filming--and this just shows the contempt they had for the source material.Now I am not saying that this is a bad film. It's very watchable and exciting--particularly if you have never seen OMEGA MAN. And, for people who care far more for special effects than plot, it is a pretty film. The scenes of the bridges leading out of Manhattan and the rest of the ruined city are incredibly realistic--too bad the story was actually supposed to take place in Los Angeles! And, speaking of changes, he film also takes a lot of liberties including: making the plague victims more like mindless zombies than vampires, adding a dog to the story, completely changing the ending so as to make a point that is the opposite of the novel as well as attributing the plague to an accidental creation due to come cancer drug. Now granted, most of these mistakes (minus the dog) are in the other films--they were flawed as well. But, why keep distorting an excellent story and why make a film that looks better than the previous films BUT is essentially no better?! My advice? Read the book and watch OMEGA MAN. Sure, OMEGA MAN is so unlike the original but it had a major cool factor. Perhaps it's because I am older, but seeing a crazed Charlton Heston machine gunning the zombies (led by the great Anthony Zerbe--a wonderful villain) is just more exciting than seeing Smith talking to his dog.",6,8,11,3 May 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," Very gritty and realistic
","I think that this film is a bit overrated (I would never place this within the top 250 films ever made and I know it is a critical favorite), though it still is a very good film. That's because it gives such a gritty and realistic portrait of a bank robbery gone bad and is totally unlike any cops and robbers film made before or sense. Part of this gritty realism is the amazingly 'colorful' dialog. You'd never expect to hear this many f-words used in a film back in 1975. I didn't love this, but understand that real criminals in such a situation would probably not worry about offending people with their use of expletives--so I can't fault this either.While I often give longer reviews, there are frankly so many good reviews for this film already as well as synopses of the film--so I won't bore you with these details. Instead, I will point out that this largely improvised film worked well due to excellent direction and acting. I have no complaints at all but also didn't see the film as THAT exceptional. Sure, it was a very, very good film but not one that I would put in the category of MUST SEE.If you haven't guessed, this is NOT a movie for kids but for mature adults who can handle the subject matter and aren't turned off by the realism, then it's an excellent and worthwhile film.",8,3,7,14 April 2009
Amadeus," Grrr...the history teacher within cannot allow me to completely enjoy this film.
","Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as 'Pocahontas') with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While 'Amadeus' is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in 'Amadeus', facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F. Murray Abraham is great as the conniving Salieri--even though he's very fictional. Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom. Without this laugh, he would have been MUCH better.Why couldn't they have just created a story about FICTIONAL characters instead of fictionalizing real peoples' lives? If this had been done, the film would have been exceptional in every way. As it is, it's a severe irritant to anyone wanting to know about the real life characters portrayed so badly in this film. And that laugh...that HORRIBLE laugh has got to go!",7,7,15,11 March 2012
The Game," I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one.
","Sean Penn is not the most popular celebrity and has created a few enemies over the years. However, this does not make his performance nor the film 'The Game' something to avoid...and considering I am no fan of him as a person, the fact I loved the movie so much says a lot. THE GAME is exceptional...and you'd be doing yourself a favor by watching it. THE GAME is one heck of a great film, as I give it a well-deserved score of 9 because it's so well written and entertaining. It is one of the most exciting and riveting films of recent memory. You've got to see this film! I'll say no more because I don't want to spoil it.",9,4,5,6 November 2018
Kick-Ass," A laundry list of things your parents DON'T want you to do...
","'Kick-Ass' is a film that looks as if the film makers wanted to put everything into a film that parents would be horrified to have their kids see or do...and then they marketed it directly to these kids. Socially irresponsible? Sure...but also quite entertaining. Here is a brief listing of the things horrified parents will see in the film: profuse use of the f-word, lots of intense violence, super-heroes who brutally kill their prey, masturbatory references, brutality that surprised me, teens having hot and sweaty sex, severed limbs, etc.--all things kids are clearly told NOT to do and not to see. Yet much of the time, it IS being done by kids who are teens or even younger. Seeing an 11 year-old using such strong language and eviscerating villains with reckless abandon IS something you don't see every day! While I could analyze the movie or describe its plot, I won't, as there are 16 bazillion reviews for this film already. Instead, I want to direct this review to parents. While kids really DO talk the way they do in this movie (as a high school teacher, I know) and the film makers captured this well, even if you ignore the hard-core language I don't think you should let younger viewers see this film. My 20 year-old watched it and loved it, but I didn't let my soon to be 16 year-old--she is just not as mature as some kids her age. The violence is just something I think too many teens already are too comfortable with--and this film will only make this worse. Now if you have an older teen, then I say let them see it--or, the fact is, they might be old enough that it really doesn't matter what you say. Just be fore-warned--this is NOT a kids movie or even one for the average teen--it's just too full of stuff they are probably not mature enough to handle. Heck, I'm not even sure if I am!Coincidentally, last night I saw a Japanese film that was HIGHLY reminiscent of 'Kick-Ass'. 'Lady Snowblood' is a tale of revenge concerning a baby who is raised to exact revenge for her parents--one of the same themes in 'Kick-Ass'--and the film is about equally violent and bloody. If you liked 'Kick-Ass', then give this other film a look--it turned out to be Taratino's inspiration for the 'Kill Bill' series.",7,7,13,5 August 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," A rousing adventure tale
","This is a cool movie. The film begins with a filthy and decrepit beggar stopping Rudyard Kipling and telling him his true tale of adventure. He (Michael Caine) and his buddy (Sean Connery) were soldiers in the British army but got badly separated from the rest of the troops. They wandered and wandered until they came upon an odd civilization that had never been exposed to the outside world. The two men's oddly colored skin and dress frightened the people and it looked like the two might be killed. However, Connery is able to convince them that he is a god and the people actually believe him! And, as a god, he is able to rule over the people and have his pick of any woman he wants. Suddenly, life is very good for the two men.However, I said that Caine was reduced to looking like a decrepit beggar. How this all came about and what happened in this magical land is just something you'll have to discover for yourself.The film has wonderful acting from the two leads, as well as terrific writing and locations. They just don't make adventure movies like this any more and that's a real shame!",9,5,11,13 July 2006
Gran Torino," Like morphing Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry...this one is full of surprises.
","The movie begins with Clint Eastwood's wife dying. You can immediately see that he's a nasty old man who has little, if any, connection with his kids and grandkids (some of which ARE pretty unlikable). He also lives in a community that is now filled with Asians and Chicanos (and gangs) and he hates them—and they don't particularly like him either. At this point, it's hard to like the crusty old guy. He's nasty to the well-meaning priest that's trying to help him cope with the wife's death and he just wants everyone to leave him alone.Later, despite Eastwood's character wanting his privacy, he is forced to get involved—though it's NOT for altruistic reasons. An Asian gang is trying to force a neighbor kid to join themby kidnapping him. Unfortunately for Eastwood, the gang is loud and come on his property and he responds by holding them at gunpoint---telling them to leave or die! Unexpectedly, the next day, his Asian neighbors begins bringing him food, flowers and other gifts. Why? Because they, too, have been terrorized by the gangs and they wanted to thank him. In addition, the teen he saved from kidnapping thanks him.and admits that he'd tried to steal Eastwood's prize old car (a Gran Torino in mint condition) the prior night. Eastwood graciously responds that if he ever sees the kid again on his property, he'll 'blow his head off'! This Eastwood character talks a lot like Archie Bunker combined with Dirty Harry---and he just wants to be left alone!! Where the film goes next is somewhat predictable, but how it all ends is simply amazing--and practically impossible to predict. I'd say more, but I really don't want to spoil the film.The film excels with its witty and very gritty dialog. However, be forewarned that the film has very, very rough language. Not only is there a lot of cursing, but the film has tons of racial epithets--so many that the strongly politically correct out there might just have a stroke if they watch it! While it is vulgar and gross, it was fitting for the story--as gang life is not pretty and sanitizing it too much would have severely impacted the film's realism.Overall, a great film with expert direction, story and acting. It's clearly one of the best films I've seen of the last decade.",10,5,13,8 January 2010
Hero," not exactly my cup of tea
","I like Asian movies--especially Samurai movies. However, this movie and others like it (such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) are NOT exactly my cup of tea. Although the MOST famous aspects of these movies are the matrix-like fight scenes, I can't stand them and think that they really detract from the overall pacing and focus of the film. In other words, if you took away the flying through midair and dancing on the surface of the water scenes, the movie would have scored at least an 8 or maybe a 9 with me. I'm sure that puts me in a distinct minority, but I sure would have enjoyed this movie more if it had stayed with a much more realistic portrayal of the Qin dynasty. If this silly and over-the-top style continues in movies, what's next--lasers and space ships in 5th century BC China?!",6,2,6,13 August 2005
The Hurt Locker," I was on the edge of my seat...
","Before I get to the meat of the review, I should point out that I rarely give movies scores of 10. This one came very close and I was about to give it a 9. However, although I am very hesitant to give such a lofty score, considering the film's modest budget and mostly unknown actors, I can't help but be impressed. I also can't really say whether or not it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, as the only other film I've yet seen among the nominees were 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'Precious'. 'Precious' was perhaps as good, but so different it's impossible for me to say which of the two is best--plus is this even necessary? Now that I mentioned 'Precious', it and 'Hurt Locker' are great for completely different reasons. The big strength of 'Precious' are the actors and the script. The actors emote heavily and the film is about, in many ways, a catharsis, or letting go, of secrets and pain. 'Hurt Locker' on the other hand, is much more an action pick. And, while the acting and script are very good, the point seems to be on the suppression of pain and emotions--quite the contrast, now that you think about it.The film begins with the team leader of a bomb disposal unit being killed on the job. His new replacement is a sergeant who is quite different. He does NOT do things by the book and seems to take many often unnecessary risks. In some ways, he seems like a man with a death wish. However, over time, his character becomes so much more. He is a complex man...he just struggles to suppress this.The interactions of the three men on the team, the almost non-stop edge of your seat tension and excitement and the amazing direction make for an exceptional film that you really should see. However, I'll forewarn you--the language (like that of many military men) is a bit rough and the film is bloody and is NOT for the squeamish. Oddly, despite this, I was surprised by the audience at the theater--they were mostly post-70 years old--I was, at 45, a comparative baby! One final thing I should point out which is, perhaps, the greatest strength of the film. No matter if you are on the left or right on the political spectrum, you will probably enjoy this film--unless you absolutely demand that a film takes a strong political position (this was obviously true for a few of the reviewers). The film never really says that the war is good or bad, just or unjust--it just portrays the lives of some extraordinarily talented and brave men. Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal did a good job in keeping the film focused on these men and it sure made me feel a lot of respect for anyone who could do such an awful job.",10,26,49,13 March 2010
No Man's Land," The UN does what the UN usually does....
","'No Man's Land' was the Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Language Picture back in 2002. Although it won this award and it has a rather high rating on IMDb, I avoided watching it because the description of the film seemed pretty depressing and miserable. However, after seeing it, I advise you consider watching the film despite the tough subject matter, as it really has a lot to say and is well worth your time.The film is set in Bosnia-Herzegovina during their horrible war in the 1990s. Two soldiers take refuge in a small encampment in no-man's land- -not realizing that an enemy soldier is hiding there as well. As the enemy watches, one of the soldiers shows the other how to booby-trap a body belonging to an enemy soldier. In other words, when his own countrymen later come to bury him, when they pick him up it will detonate a mine! Well, the hiding soldier is enraged when he hears this and opens fire on the two soldiers--killing one and wounding the other. Soon, however, she shooter realizes that the booby-trapped man is actually still alive! Now there are three guys stuck in no-man's land and it looks very doubtful that they'll make it out alive.This is pretty much the description I'd read about the film--and it didn't interest me very much. Fortunately, the movie doesn't end with this--there is much more to the film. Soon, the United Nations forces get pulled into this and the film becomes a searing indictment of the pathetic record of this 'peace-loving body'! The ending is darkly funny and sad--and is something you really should see.The film is a wonderful microcosm of the entire Yugoslavian civil war. Summed up in these three soldiers is a story that pretty much explains the nihilistic nature of these wars. Writer/director Danis Tanovic did a wonderful job of creating an engaging and extremely intelligent film-- and I can see why it took home this prestigious award. Too bad, however, that the film really didn't matter all that much, as the war had long been over and the damage had been done...and the UN performed it's usual cracker jack job of remedying the situation!",9,1,2,9 July 2014
The Longest Day," Visually impressive, it still reminds me of THE MUPPET MOVIE and all its shortcomings!
","Ha--I thought the summary would get your attention!!! Let me explain why I said that the film reminds me of the Muppet Movie. Both films have tremendous production values and are very well made BUT both suffered from a massive overdose of 'celebrity walk-on fever'--this insane notion that the film should be spiced up with celebrity cameos. And, unfortunately, the opposite usually occurred--the whole tempo of the film was disrupted and too much money and time was spent following these stars in their brief roles. Apparently, THE LONGEST DAY originated this idea--which came into its own on the many Irwin Allen movies (particularly THE TOWERING INFERNO)--one #@^#&#!&^$!! celebrity after another parading across the screen at the expense of the plot.And this is really a shame, as at heart, THE LONGEST DAY is a very, very good film. Its production values illustrate how this was a real labor of love for producer and studio head Darryl F. Zanuck. I really think that without all the 'guest shots' and a little more focus on the action instead of bouncing about so much, the film would have gotten a score of 9.",7,4,15,13 July 2006
Slap Shot," Fun...but you ought to be embarrassed for watching $&% like this!
","'Slap Shot' is a very, very adult sports film. It features LOTS of profanity, lots of politically incorrect language, references to masturbation, nudity and LOTS and LOTS of violence. Even by today's standards (which, admittedly are pretty low), it's a very adult film. But, it also is very funny and, like a terrible traffic accident, it's something you may not want to watch...but you keep on watching! The Charlestown Chiefs are a lousy minor league hockey team in a lousy city. Their fans don't care and the team seems imminently in danger of either being sold or folding completely. However, the player-manager of the club (Paul Newman) is a bit crazy and has come up with a plan to POSSIBLY save the team and his career--get his players to play as dirty as possible to create fan spirit. And, after playing like a squad of nothing but goons, the team starts to win and fans come pouring into the stadium. And, to further excite his team, he begins spreading false rumors about a buyer for the team. It all culminates in an incredibly stupid finale at the championship game. Unfortunately, it's no longer a sport--just a punch of thugs hittin' folks!The bottom line is that 'Slap Shot' is a funny and distasteful film. My wife even enjoyed it--and she normally doesn't like sports films. It's also pretty wild seeing Newman and some of the other actors on skates--as well as those Hanson brothers...who are kind of like Napoleon Dynamite combined with three Tasmanian Devils! Crazy fun.",8,1,2,3 February 2013
Patton," Ignore the goofs and concentrate on Scott's brilliant portrayal.
","I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making 'Pocahontas', 'The Sound of Music' and 'Midway' (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, 'Patton' is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!",10,4,7,30 March 2013
La Grande Illusion," It got better with a second viewing
","I saw this film a few years back--before I really appreciated French cinema. I liked the film but didn't think all that much about it and probably would have given the film a score of 6 or 7 had IMDb been available. However, after having seen a huge number of older French films that are available here in the States, I have really come to appreciate the films more and more--especially since they offer a slightly different style from the typical fare from Hollywood at the time. Neither is necessarily better--just different. And after having watched a ton of films, I really appreciate the difference. Now, I couldn't imagine scoring the film with anything lower than a 9, as it was truly an exceptionally made film with tremendous acting, writing and direction.In many ways, this film is like a pacifist version of Stalag 17 without the comedy. Like J'ACCUSE, it is a decidedly anti-war French film that probably did a lot to convince the French that war wasn't glorious and was in fact often pointless. In hindsight, this was a great message but was delivered at the absolute worst time. The view of this film that the Germans and French weren't so different in WWI and they really had no reason to kill each other is very true--it was a stupid and wasteful war. But, given the evilness of the Nazis, who were poised to take over Europe, the message left the French ill-prepared to fight a war that needed to be fought and fought to win. Talk about bad timing! However, despite the timing, this was a marvelous film as instead of the usual jingoistic view of war, the characters were like real men and the Germans weren't mindless monsters. This full and realistic view of the war was echoed in other exceptional films such as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK and ACE OF ACES. And, the ending of the film really summed up the war and the futility of meaningless death and carnage.Beautiful, interesting and thoughtful--a terrific war film that is timeless despite its age. Watch it twice, if need be, and you'll no doubt be impressed.",9,4,7,13 September 2006
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," The film is very good BUT the writing was not especially inspired.
","'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' is an enjoyable film, though I have to admit that the story is awfully silly and make this a rather silly Shah Rukh Khan outing.When the story begins, Surinder (Khan) has just gotten married through a traditional arranged marriage. The problem is that his wife, Taani (Anushka Sharma) is much, much younger and Surinder is a bit of a dork. So, instead of celebrating their marriage and both being happy, the marriage is in trouble. Surinder sees his wife as perfect and unapproachable and Taani seems to give very little emotionally to the marriage. In fact, I wanted to slap Taani repeatedly and yell at her 'He's your husband...love him with all you have!'. Later in the film, Taani decides to take a dance class. While there may be dance classes like this in India, it took me by surprise, as they seemed to be dancing much like you'd expect in a Bollywood film. However, her new partner is an odd guy...brash, full of life and conceited. Well, this Raj is actually Surinder in disguise...and Taani believes these are two different guys. When this happened, the film lost me and I almost turned it off. After all, aside from shaving off the mustache and blow drying the hair and changing clothes, they BOTH looked exactly like Shah Rukh Khan!! I assume the Indian audiences just suspended disbelief...but I kept thinking Taani was really stupid for not seeing that they were the same guy!!! And later, when Surinder works hard (finally) to win her over, she is pretty awful about this.Despite my MANY reservations, the film does work overall for three reasons. First, the acting is quite nice...and you cannot blame the actors for the dopey story elements. Second, the music is great. Third, the ending is so sweet that I ALMOST forgot how dopey the story had been! Worth seeing but inconsequential as well.",7,1,1,3 September 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Sort of like 'Forrest Gump' run in reverse and without the laughs.
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' sure got a lot of attention when it came out in 2008. It got so much attention that it received three Oscars and is ranked in the IMDb Top 250--currently at #247. And, as a result, when I finally got around to seeing it, my expectations were way, way too high. I was expecting too much, I am sure, as it's hard for a film to live up to all this hoopla. Now if I look at the film and try to ignore all these ridiculously high expectations, I see that it is indeed an exceptional film...but perhaps not quite the 'must-see' that I thought it was. I can't put my finger on it...it just didn't seem like a film a cinema freak must watch...though it was a nice, gentle viewing experience. And, after seeing this and 'Slumdog Millionaire', I can see why 'Benjamin Button' didn't capture the Best Picture Oscar.Probably the best way to describe this film is like 'Forrest Gump' run in reverse...and without the laughs or meetings with presidents and all the celebrity status. That's because although Benjamin SHOULD be world famous for being the only person to ever live life backwards, curiously he isn't and people seem to almost take it in stride. In addition, and this part DID bother me, everyone's performance seemed way, way, way too restrained. There were very, very few emotional highs in the film--and even those were curiously subdued. To me, that's what's curious about this 'Curious Case'---why such an excellent film pulled its emotional punches throughout the film. As a result, when it should have been exciting, it wasn't...or not nearly enough. Still, it's well worth seeing...it has some lovely romantic elements and is a sweet film.",8,2,4,10 August 2010
Men in Black II," An enjoyable time-passer.
","I enjoyed 'Men in Black' and, like most films I enjoy, I did not look forward to any sequels. I just don't like most sequels and my expectations were very low for 'Men in Black II'. Fortunately, I was wrong. While the film was far from a must-see...it was a decent and enjoyable time-passer.When the film began, I was a bit confused. At the end of the original film, Jay's new partner was apparently Laurel (Linda Fiorentino)....but here Jay (Will Smith) is partner-less as he keeps firing partners. It's obvious he would love Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) to return to the MIB force....and soon, it' becomes necessary as an evil alien has taken over the joint and threatens to destroy or rule the Earth. What's next? See the film.The bottom line is that the film is fun. Not 100% original, that's for sure...but fun. The actors do their best and the story is fine....not great but fine.",6,1,2,19 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Appropriately inspiring.
","'Hidden Figures' came out several months ago and there are already quite a few reviews for it. Because of this, I don't plan on saying a lot.The film is the story of some inspiring black women who worked in the space program during an era when black women were highly marginalized. The acting is terrific and the production all around is well made and enjoyable. Not surprisingly, the movie did well in the box office and no doubt you'll have a nice time if you see the film.Do I have any quibbles? Well, a few details here and there were changed to make the story more cinematic...which is the norm for Hollywood films and something I can look past since the story is essentially true.",8,4,8,29 December 2017
Coco," What's not to like?!
","I am very glad I saw 'Coco' and understand exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as it's terrifically entertaining, fun to watch...and quite touching as well.The story is set around Día de Muertos, the Mexican Day of the Dead. Miguel is a nice little boy whose family, inexplicably, HATE music and insist he never can grow up to become a musician. And, wouldn't you know it, but that's EXACTLY what the boy wants to become one day. But after destroying his homemade guitar, he is unable to enter a music contest...so he decides to take one from the local cemetery. Not surprisingly, this creates all sorts of problems...and Miguel is transported to the land of the dead. What's next? Just see the film!The CGI for this film is simply the best you'll currently find...putting it well above the quality of competing studios, such as Universal and Fox. In addition, the scope of the images is just breathtaking....and a treat to see on the big screen. Additionally, the songs, story and characters are all lovely. One warning, however, is that this film will very likely start you crying now and again...be sure to have some tissues nearby, just in case. A must-see film.",10,4,10,31 October 2018
1917," Reasonably accurate in showing the hell that is war.
","I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched '1917' because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned.",9,1,8,10 April 2020
Lincoln," Perhaps the film should have been called 'Abe Lincoln and the 13th Amendment'.
","When 'Lincoln' began, I was very, very surprised. I had assumed the film was a traditional biography of the man, but instead it started late in the Civil War--only months before Abe Lincoln's assassination. That's because despite the title, the film really is about Lincoln and his attempts to push the 13th Amendment through the House of Representatives. Apparently, its passage was very, very difficult--even with a Congress made up exclusively of states that were not part of the Confederacy. The film shows, step-by-step, how the behind the scenes machinations (some of which were of dubious legality--such as offering bribes) led to its passage.So is this a good film and who is the audience? Well, it's actually an exceptional film in many ways. The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful but more wonderful is the care to historical details. The film shows, for the first time, that Lincoln was a very human man--very astute and tricky in politics, prone to depression and anger and not the saint-like guy you usually see in films. It also shows that, at least for the North, that the war was NOT about slavery--and even when the war was all but won, many still would have had no problem allowing slavery to continue. These are very important as they help give a truer picture of the man and the times. The only thing that didn't ring particularly true was the little speech Mary Todd Lincoln made late in the film. The comment about how the future will view her seems ridiculous, as people just don't talk that way. And, whether she was clinically insane or not, she did have serious problems with depression, erratic behavior and all around nastiness! I don't know why the film tried so hard to clean up her image. Still, from the standpoint of an ex-American history teacher, it was a delight. Unfortunately, I really am not sure how much the average non-history buff would view the film--as it is slow and lacks a lot of action. Still, it is a really exceptional film.By the way, I really loved seeing Secretary Stanton freak out when Lincoln was about to tell another one of his stories! Watch the film--you'll see what I mean.",9,8,13,22 July 2013
Pi," Although difficult to watch, a wild and amazingly unique independent film.
","'Pi' is an amazing independent films. Darren Aronofsky had never made a feature film and was barely able to scrape together the $60,000 needed to make this film. Despite this pitifully small budget, he managed to make a remarkably watchable film AND it caught the eyes of the 'big boys'--and soon he was given $1,000,000 for his film! While not quite as insanely successful as 'The Blair Witch Project' (which came out the following year), unlike the filmmakers of this other project, Aronofsky has gone on to greater things--including the wildly successful and critically acclaimed 'Black Swan' as well as 'The Wrestler'.Describing the look of the film is VERY difficult. Sure, it's cheap but Aronofsky managed to get past this by using black & white and deliberately making the print very grainy--giving it a wonderfully surreal look. I am not exactly sure how he did this but it worked well. And, because he wasn't able to use top equipment, it has a bit of a homemade look--which I was able to look past. Much of this was because the plot was so wild and surreal as well as very stylish.Describing the plot...well that's even MORE difficult! It's a strange tale about a man who is on the edge of losing his mind. He is convinced that everything in nature and life can be quantified and explained through mathematics. And, given that you can find the correct mathematical formula, you can predict and understand EVERYTHING. So Maximillian spends nearly every second of his waking day devoted to this all-encompassing task. He avoids relationships, is very unkempt and is a miserable excuse for a human being. And, eventually it all begins to take its toll as he begins to hallucinate and experiencing excruciating pain in his body and brain. What's next for this incredibly strange man with his seemingly impossible task? See the film! This is a very, very difficult film to rate. It gets very high marks for originality and it is entertaining. However, it's NOT a film for the mainstream. The average Joe would probably find it all just too weird and too confusing. But, if you want something different and are patient, it's well worth seeing.",8,8,11,18 January 2014
Kelly's Heroes," Anachronistic but enjoyable.
","An anachronism is something that does not belong in a given time period, as it really belongs sometime in the future. For example, if you see a viking film where the vikings all ride about on Skeedoos--that would be an anachronism. Or, if at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Confederates used nuclear weapons--again a major anachronism. Now this movie does not any mistakes THAT obvious, but it is filled with anachronisms--the sort that make history teachers like myself a bit crazy. While the film was very, very enjoyable, I just couldn't get past the character played by Donald Sutherland. I am sure many thought he was the best part of the film, but he also played a beatnik circa 1958 (or later) even though the film was set around 1944. When he and his men played loud music to announce their attack, it looked great in the film--but made absolutely no sense! And, for that matter, the American soldiers' general lack of patriotism is anachronistic--though the story IS based on a real robbery perpetrated by a few American and Germans. The problem is SO MANY soldiers in this film couldn't give a darn about the war or their country--and soldiers at that time were NOT like that--they would have been the rare exception. The attitudes towards war ARE typical, though, of many soldiers in Vietnam in 1970. So, the film takes contemporary sensibilities (and songs, for that matter) and pumps them into a WWII film. In many ways, this infusion of modern sensibilities into a war film is highly reminiscent of the film M*A*S*H--another film that people enjoyed, but really was filled with mistakes and Vietnam-era attitudes.Now if you can ignore all that (and I could, but with great difficulty), the rest of the film is quite enjoyable though a bit too long. I like long movies, but this one seemed about 15 minutes longer than it should have been--reducing its impact. Still, on a mindless level, it's quite enjoyable and the film is packed full of familiar faces.",6,3,11,12 March 2010
Million Dollar Baby," This film made me think...
","The SPOILER from 'Million Dollar Baby' is perhaps one of the least best-kept secrets in movie history. Most people know what the big twist is in the film, but in case you are one of the few who doesn't know what it is, I have marked this review as 'contains spoiler'--just in case! This film was directed by Clint Eastwood and he also directs--and he has an incredibly great track record over the past couple decades in these capacities--such as 'Unforgiven' and 'Gran Torino'--so I knew I had to see this film. I am very glad I did...though I must admit it tore me up emotionally watching the movie. This is not a criticism, but actually a complement. That's right. Too often, movies have nothing to say and don't take any risks--and this film clearly takes risks and has a lot to say. So, when a film like this gets me crying, it's not at all a bad thing.The first 2/3 of the film is a boxing film. Yes, it's well-acted with Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood at their best. But, it's still only a boxing film--a feel-good boxing movie. However, the up and coming boxer (Swank) is unexpectedly paralyzed in the ring-and from then on the film really is at its best and darkest. It asks the poignant questions 'is assisted suicide okay?' and 'do we have an innate right to die?'--especially in cases where there is no apparent quality of life. It's an important moral and ethical question that most people avoid and films almost never address--and I am glad they created a scenario where you feel very torn. It's hard to just categorically say that taking a life in such a situation is immoral--and this moral ambiguity made the film for me. Because of this, unlike most film, it has staying power. I can imagine that thousands or millions of viewers had their beliefs challenged and many were spurred on by this film to have discussions with friends and loved ones about this debate. Few films will provoke you like 'Million Dollar Baby'--this, combined with a great script and great acting, make this one of the best films of the decade and I can easily see how it won the Best Picture Oscar.By the way, it's not at all a huge criticism, but I felt that the fight scene with the spinal injury could have been handled a bit better. Having the opponent being even more vicious than Clubber Lang from 'Rocky III' was a bit silly, as she would have been disqualified about 30 seconds into a real boxing match. It was a bit over the top. But, considering how perfect the film is otherwise, this should be overlooked...except for cinema freaks like myself!",10,2,5,3 August 2011
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Beautiful and weird
","Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film with incredible stop motion camera-work AND a really stylish atmosphere. The characters are really captivating and just plain 'cool'. Halloween Town is also a visual delight. In almost every way I consider this a wonderful film. However, for people like me who are not particularly enamored with musicals, the music is definitely the low-point. It's not that the songs are bad, but that there are so many of them. The dialog is mostly sung and I found it detracted, slightly, from my viewing experience. However, considering that almost all the high school students I teach LOVE this movie, I certainly seem to have the minority opinion. So, for those who are not into musicals, still watch it--you'll enjoy it. But, like me you may also wish they'd done a few less numbers! PS--On the DVD, you also get FRANKENWEENIE (a half hour short) and VINCENT (also a short and the seeming inspiration for NBC). They make this a MUST-HAVE DVD.",9,3,6,24 October 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Exceptional...and an important history lesson.
","Good use of video
smoking
'Good Night, and Good Luck' is an exceptional film and much of it is because we too often forget our history...and as a result don't learn from it. It's an excellent history lesson. My only complaint is that the context for the Red Scare and McCarthyism is missing...and I would have appreciated it had it been included or even mentioned. While nearly everyone attacked for communist sympathies during this era were decent people, there were some things that gave reason for the concerns about communism. Stalin was behaving very threatening...decided to keep all of Eastern Europe following WWII and developing his own atomic bomb. But, and this is important, this does not in any way justify folks losing due process and their constitutional rights because of these fears...and the 1950s were a time of intense fear of the USSR. For folks unfamiliar with the era, this missing context might make the film a bit confusing. Despite this, the movie is a very important lesson..though the context might have been appreciated by retired history teachers, like myself!As far as the plot goes, the film is ABOUT Senator Joseph McCarthy but instead of focusing directly on him, you only see stock footage of him making his anti-communism tirades in Congress. Instead, the film centers on Edward R. Murrow and CBS's investigation of McCarthy and his methods...an interesting choice and one that makes the film quite clever.
David Strathairn is excellent as Murrow and the director/writer/actor George Clooney did a nice job in capturing the feel of the time. Everyone is smoking heavily...which is what folks did back then. Heck, that's what ended up killing Murrow...a three-pack a day man himself! It was also smart to make the picture in black & white--as it not only captured the look of the time (when most everything was in black & white) but helped to make the McCarthy clips seem more real and less jarring. Overall, an exceptionally well made film...one well worth your time.",9,1,1,23 March 2018
Big Hero 6," Terrific.
","I am not a huge fan of CGI films. Now I am not saying I dislike them, but I do feel that sometimes there are too many and too many mediocre computer generated cartoons. However, I think that 'Big Hero 6' is definitely a welcome film to the genre. Why? Because the film is absolutely beautiful, as the graphics are just amazing. Additionally, while I also think there have been way too many superhero movies, this one is different enough to make it worth seeing.The film is about a brilliant young man named Hiro. Hiro, though incredibly bright when it comes to robotics, is directionless until his older brother introduces him to his research facility at the local university. To win a scholarship to the place, Hiro creates an amazing robotic system--one so amazing that someone is willing to kill to get it. And, once they've stolen it, Hiro uses his brother's medical robot, Baymax, to help punish the baddie and restore justice and niceness to the world.While the film DOES feature the usual sort of finale (the weakest part of the film--though I do understand why it's there), so much of what leads up to it is nice. I liked the characters, the back story and the writing. It's really very clever in places--such as their wonderful use of Stan Lee in his cameos since this one is so unusual AND he appears twice in the film (so stay and watch ALL the film or you'll miss it). Well worth seeing.",9,27,42,2 January 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Incredibly stupid and crude...but also, at times, pretty funny.
","'Dumb and Dumber' is a film that was fabulously successful. Although it cost $17,000,000, it ended up grossing $247,000,000!! Talk about a huge payoff for the Farrelly Brothers!The story is about Lloyd and Harold (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels)--two complete idiots who are roommates. When a passenger in Lloyd's limo leaves a briefcase behind, he vows to return it to her. There are two huge problems with this. First, this occurred in Rhode Island and she now is in Aspen! Second, although Lloyd thought she left it by accident, it was ransom money...and now he and Harold have it and mobsters are after them!Much of the humor was stupid--the sort of stuff middle school kids would love. However, I must admit that although much of the humor was awful, sometime is still made me laugh. Plus, the film ended well. So, I do recommend it BUT must point out that it is NOT for anyone wanting cleverness. Nope...crude humor, bad jokes and embarrassing moments...that's what you'll find and you, too, might laugh a bit like I did.By the way, for the love of God, do NOT watch the sequel 'Dumb and Dumberer'. None of the original writers, directors or actors are in it and it is a total bomb....and currently is on IMDB's notorious Bottom 100 list.",6,1,5,23 August 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Super-depressing, but an exceptional film
","Had I been able to see this film in Japanese subtitles, I might have scored it higher. The version shown on TCM was dubbed and I think the dubbing detracted from the film because the characters didn't seem the least bit Japanese. While this may not matter as much with some full-length Anime movies, this one was based on real people living through the final months of WWII with all its privations on the Japanese people. So, to me, it just didn't seem appropriate having the characters sounding like Americans--this seemed a bit tacky. This is all pretty sad, as the film itself is a marvelous film featuring some of the better animation I have ever seen and exceptional production values.The story is about two siblings whose mother is killed early in the film during a fire bombing. The movie is spent trying to survive on their own and deal with starvation.The film is apparently based on the writer's own experiences and is extremely important for adults and older kids, as it gives a side of war that is seldom mentioned in films. Although it will probably depress your older kids, it would be a good film to watch with them provided you take the time to discuss the film and process what they see as it is a disturbing episode in history.I do NOT recommend this to younger or less mature kids. Oddly, when the film was released, it was combined with MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO as a double-feature!!! This was so wrong--combining a sweet movie targeted for the youngest kids in the audience with this realistic and heart-wrenching film about death and starvation! What were they thinking?! I do recommend you see the film, but if possible, try to find the Japanese language version with subtitles.",8,7,11,12 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Pretty much what the fans probably want....
","I think the easiest way to sum up this movie is to call it 'The Empire Strikes Back II'. In many, many ways, it's a bridge movie between the last film and the next and, if you think about it, nothing is really resolved in the film. Now this is NOT saying it's a bad film. Heck, it's exactly what most fans probably want--tons of action, lots of heroism and a lot of the familiar. The plot is basically this. The Rebels* are about to be wiped out and the film consists of the new Empire (which looks pretty much like the old Empire) is intent on wiping them out. In the meantime, Rey goes of on a desperate mission to try to get Luke Skywalker to STOP sulking (which, apparently he's been doing for the last 40 years) and help! Along for the fun are some nice newer characters and one who seemed a bit annoying (and that would be you,Poe...Mr. Know-it-all). Overall, it's a lot of fun, there are a lot of explosions and it has a lot to offer unless you stop and realize it is, essentially, a bridge movie. A well made bridge movie but still a bridge film.*Yes, I know the Rebels won a few films back.",8,30,110,16 December 2017
Brave," The CGI was incredible!
","While I must admit that 'Brave' is not among my favorite Pixar films, I was totally blown away by the computer graphics. To some extent this is to be expected--as years pass, the CGI is bound to get better and better. But it's more than that--the textures, colors and depth were all incredible and I was in love with the animation throughout.As far as the story goes, it was a mixed bag. While I was thrilled to see a Pixar film with female leads AND featuring a mother-daughter relationship, the story itself seemed a bit shallow and flat. It wasn't bad, but never hit that emotional spot within that you'd find in 'Up' or 'Toy Story 3'. Now this isn't to say it's bad---it just isn't among the very best of the studio and is STILL well worth seeing. It's especially nice to see a FEMALE protagonist--and one who does NOT need to be rescued by a prince! Incidentally, my daughter and her friend loved the film--and my bet is that girls would generally prefer this film but it's a lot of fun for everyone.By the way, there is a cute inside joke in the film in which they mention someone being out of town at the 'Wicker Man' ceremony! This could be a reference to the wonderful 1970s film (see this one--not the remake) or to the actual ancient ceremony. I actually had no idea that this was a real event until dlwagner sent me an email informing me of this--but I certainly did NOT expect to hear them talking about it in 'Brave'.",7,14,25,21 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Worth seeing...but #37?
","Currently, about a week after its debut, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is ranked #37 on IMDb. I assume that by the time you read my review it will have dropped in the rankings--mostly because the most rabid fans were probably the first to see and review it and the rest of us folks will be getting to it a bit later. This is often the case with big blockbuster films--though with an overall score of about 8.7, it's bound to stay well within IMDb's top 250. As for me, I really enjoyed the movie but cannot agree that the film is THAT good. Excellent yes....#37...nah.The best thing going for 'Guardians' is that with the huge glut of super-hero films during the last decade or so, this one manages to stand apart--something that cannot be said of most of the films. There is just a certain sameness that make me less than thrilled with all the comic book hero films. But a few, like this film and 'Scott Pilgrim' manage to seem different enough to merit your rushing to see them. So, of course, rush to see this oneSo how is it different? Well, there are MANY ways. Chris Pratt (Peter Quill) is NOT your typical super-hero. He is NOT a disaffected millionaire or guy bitten by a spider or a super-being from outer space- -he's actually pretty ordinary in most ways. But, like his character on 'Parks and Recreation', Pratt is a bit of a goof-ball--a dopey but likable guy who manages to do well despite himself. This is kind of cute--but fortunately the film is NOT just about a dopey goof-ball but he's assisted by a strange group of new-found friends with strange abilities. Another way this is VERY different is that almost the entire film takes place in outer space. While 'Thor' and 'Superman' have their brief moments in space, 'Guardians' is almost completely there--and as such has a HUGE reliance on special effects and CGI. It is a SUPER- expensive film because of this and its all-star cast--coming in at about $170,000,000--which is greater than the gross national product of many nations!!! So, although the film has earned over $100,000,000. it has a long way to go to earn back its costs--though I am pretty sure this will soon be the case. As for these special effects, they are beautiful and the film has such an other-worldly look as it jumps from one weird planet to another. So, the film is absolutely jam-packed with eye candy. Finally, the dialog (mostly from Pratt but also due a lot to his new friend, a VERY sentient raccoon) is amazingly strange. Often crude, it sounds much like the dialog was spiced up a bit here and there by 13 year-olds. While I usually don't like this, it DOES make the film very different.So what's not to like? Well, not much. However, because the story has so much action and CGI, you do sacrifice a bit when it comes to plot, back story of many of the characters and you might just feel a bit overwhelmed. Still, it's the sort of overwhelmed I don't mind feeling from time to time.By the way, if you do see the film, you'll certainly enjoy the obligatory Stan Lee cameo--it's one of the better ones I can recall.",8,10,17,11 August 2014
Caddyshack," worth seeing for just a few funny parts
","As I sit here thinking about this movie, I am realizing that this is one of the few comedies I wouldn't mind if it were heavily edited first. In other words, if all the funny moments (i.e., all the stuff with Rodney Dangerfield) were shown and the rest of the film pitched in the trash, I DON'T think that would be so bad. That's because despite it's achieving 'cult status', this isn't all that good a film--with sloppy direction, an annoying performance by Bill Murray (who is capable of so much better), a worthless story about some teenagers (and I HATE most teenager movies from the 70s and 80s) and a rather wooden performance by Chevy Chase. Hmmm,...now that I think about it, apart from Rodney Dangerfield and, perhaps the cute groundhog, there isn't a whole lot I loved about the film. A sub-par film saved by genuinely funny dialog between Dangerfield and Ted Knight.",5,3,11,20 April 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I don't think this would be mistaken for a Disney flick!
","WARNING: No one who doesn't want to see billions of gallons of blood, severed limbs and super-duper graphic violence should ever see this movie...period. It is the most violent film I have ever seen and find it amazing it didn't get an NC-17 rating. I guess you can't show nudity in American films but bloody graphic violence is okay! What a world. This isn't a complaint against Tarantino--but one about the current insane rating system.This film is not for everyone. In addition to the graphic violence, the film is an Americanized marital arts film with overtones of Italian westerns. If these sort of genres are not something you'd want to see, then once again the film is not one you'd appreciate. As for me, I am a huge fan of martial arts films and Spaghetti westerns, so it was right up my alley--even though I am not a fan of ultra-bloody films. And, because I have loved the films of Sonny Chiba and Shaw Brothers martial arts films, this movie is an absolute must as it is a loving tribute to the genre. So many references to these films are buried within the film, it's best you look through IMDb's trivia section before or after you see the film--then you'll REALLY appreciate the film! In addition to the martial arts angle, the film happens to be perhaps the coolest movie ever made. And, the coolest part of the film, to me, is the music. The soundtrack is simply brilliant and bizarre--from the haunting music of Zamfir to the quirky Japanese all-girl surfer band, the 5, 6, 7, 8s! Almost as cool are the costumes and characters. The 88s, the insane school girl assassin and the rest are really ridiculous but so, so cool. And, the film gets super-high points also for its strange style--ranging from an anime film within the film, a black & white segment and action scenes that go on practically forever! There is a lot more I could say about this film, but considering that it was released seven years ago and there are a zillion reviews for it already, I'll cut this short. While the film is intensely violent, for what it is you simply can't find any better. It is, in the action department, as good as it gets.By the way, this is not a criticism of the film, but have you ever wondered why folks in films of the genre NEVER use guns to stop the hero? You'd think at least ONE of the 88s would have been carrying a gun in the huge fight scene in Japan!!",10,3,9,5 February 2010
Ip Man," This ain't what your daddy watched back in the 1960s and 70s!
","I have seen and enjoyed many, many martial arts film. However, I am not blind to the problems that have often plagued the genre. For every exceptional film (such as most of the Shaw Brothers films or the better films of Sonny Chiba) there are the god-awful ones--movies that are embarrassingly bad. In these bad films, you see horrible martial arts where blows barely come near their opponents or kicks that look like my grandmother was fighting! Heck, I even remember one film with gorillas doing kung fu--and they obviously were two guys wearing VERY cheap Halloween costumes! Because of the many bad films, it's a pleasure to see 'Ip Man'--a film where the fighting is the most realistic you'll ever see. There is no 'wire fu' here--just fast and amazingly talented people making it look authentic.The film covers only a portion of Master Ip Man's life--mostly the 1930s--both before and during the Japanese occupation of his homeland. I read that MUCH liberty was taken with his life in the film--and I doubt if the guy really did half the things they show the actor (Donny Yen) playing him did! But, it is constantly entertaining and even uplifting. I am very sure that in China this film must have been a great source of pride--seeing Ip Man standing up to the murderous Japanese occupiers. A simply terrific film--and I challenge you to find one better! Because it is so good, I couldn't help but give this one a well-earned 10.",10,1,2,30 January 2014
The Last Emperor," I can't believe more people didn't find this film dull!
","This film is a wonderful example of the 'Best Picture syndrome'. A dull film receives many Oscars (including Best Picture) and suddenly it's considered a 'masterpiece'. My theory is that the year the movie premiered, it must have been a very bad year in general OR it confirms that many on the Oscar committee LOVE to vote for giant epic films that are visually stunning (but unwatchably dull). I also wonder if many who voted never actually saw the film--if they had, many would have died of boredom and couldn't have voted for the film!My biggest problems with the movie are the turgid pacing as well as the general unlikability of the main character. When the Communists imprisoned this deposed emperor, I could sympathize with the revolutionaries and was shocked they didn't put him to death! His life was lived in complete self-indulgence and he didn't seem to care one bit for 'his people'. So, for the only time in history, I found myself rooting for the Chinese Communists! If you DID actually enjoy this film, I can suggest several other epics that are dreadfully dull and overrated: The English Patient, Gandhi, and Ryan's Daughter.This is NOT to say that I hate epics or long movies--just not ones where you could care less for the characters (with the exception of Gandhi) and where the pacing is so slow. If you are not a glutton for punishment, try watching The Big Country (one of our greatest Westerns), Ben Hur (wow), Dances with Wolves, Chariots of Fire, The Best Years of Our Lives, etc. Make them LONG and BIG but give them characters you care about and pace them better!!!!!!",3,11,42,25 May 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Aside from a bizarre ending, this film is great and sticks pretty close to the book
","I liked the old WILLY WONKA film and when I heard they were going to do a remake, I was very skeptical--especially when knuckleheads on the internet kept started circulating rumors that Marilyn Manson was going to play the lead!! Fortunately, this was only a dopey rumor and I am pleased to say that I am glad they remade this film, since it sticks much closer to the book by Roald Dahl and because I liked the dark Tim Burton style. Unlike the original, this isn't as much of a musical and it has a wicked sense of humor. However, oddly, while being very dark, unlike WILLY WONKA, the film showed that the bad children were alright by the end of the film. If you never read the books, when you watch the original movie you might just think the brats died! Most of the reason the film is better is the clever script, though it didn't hurt that they were able to use modern special effects that were light-years ahead of the 1971 film. Additionally, while I liked Gene Wilder as Willy, the dark and twisted and possibly crazy Willy played by Johnny Depp was a hoot to watch. I also loved the new version of Oompa-loompas--so creepy and cool compared to the annoying orange freaks from the older film.I liked just about everything about the new film. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the tacked on epilogue which starred Christopher Lee. While I love seeing Lee in films (except when he was in the Star Wars movies--this is best forgotten), none of this was in the book and just seemed out of place--though also a bit fun. Purists (like myself) may not like this, but most out there probably won't mind at all with this addition.Finally, I should point out that this is definitely a more adult version of the story. Young children probably should NOT watch the film--especially if they are impressionable of really, really young. However, for older kids, teen and adults, this remake is the better bet because it's funnier and quite clever and NEVER cloying or schmaltzy.",9,6,11,20 May 2008
A Bug's Life," While aimed mostly at kids, it's a pretty sweet little film
","This isn't a great film, but it does stand above the crowd of the many computer generated films. The quality of the film from start to finish is excellent and as far as insect films go, it's a lot better than ANTZ because it's much more family friendly and endearing. ANTZ was often rather dark in tone and also featured some very inappropriate voices for a kids' film. Whose bright idea was it to have Woody Allen do the main voice in a film where you would be creeped out if you actually saw him in the audience?! Would you let your kids sit next to him during the show? I would hope not, unless your kids are teens and looking to replace Soon-Yi.My overall impression of A BUG'S LIFE is that it is squarely marketed to kids and the studio threw in a few bits and pieces here and there for the parents. As a result, if your kids want to watch it with you, you won't be bored. However, if you don't have kids, I really doubt if there's enough here to merit your watching it--though it still is a lovely and well-made film.",8,2,5,10 June 2007
Hotel Transylvania," This one took me by surprise...and in a very good way.
","These days, CGI films have become very, very common--so common that they seem to zip in and out of theaters with little notice. There are, of course, some exceptions (such as the Pixar films), but when 'Hotel Transylvania' came to theaters, it came and went without a huge amount of notice. Now that I finally saw it, I really wish the film had received much more attention, as it's far superior to most CGI family films.This film is a funny look at monsters from their point of view. To them, the humans are the enemy and see them as blood-thirsty beasts. The monsters are afraid of them and are actually amazingly gentle and likable. The main character, Dracula (Adam Sandler) is a very overprotective father and won't let his daughter (Selena Gomez) leave their prison-like castle--afraid that those horrible humans will kill her! However, accidentally, a human shows up when Dracula is throwing a HUGE birthday celebration for his daughter! In order to prevent widespread panic, Drac convinces the young man (Andy Samberg) to dress like a monster and blend in...but the plan works too well, and Drac's daughter falls in love with this horrible human! 'Hotel Transylvania' is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky--a newcomer to CGI, but a veteran of lots of excellent Cartoon Network shows, such as 'The Powerpuff Girls' and 'Dexter's Lab'. I think he did an excellent job and think this, along with great writing, made this film fun for all ages--with lots of laughs for adults and kids alike--just like his TV shows. In fact, this is the strength of the film. It had wonderful characters, terrific dialog and a nice sense of humor. The CGI ranges from fantastic (particularly the backgrounds) to average.So why, if I liked the film so much, did I give the film an 8 and not a higher score? Well, the movie had one area where it was deficient--the songs. Each time a song occurred, it slowed down the film tremendously. On top of that, the ending (which was one HUGE song and dance number) was really weak. It's a shame, but a problem you can easily overlook. Overall, a fine family film that will interest adults just as much as it will appeal to kids--and that is something all too rare.",8,1,3,2 June 2013
The Insider," Well made but where is the surprise?!
","'The Insider' details the back story about a segment that '60 Minutes' aired back in the early 1990s. A fired vice president of the Brown and Williamson tobacco company talked with CBS--even though he was forbidden by a confidentiality agreement to talk about the company to anyone. His conscience was bothered by some of the unscrupulous and dangerous things the cigarette industry was covertly doing that made cigarettes even more dangerous. The film stars several Hollywood heavyweights--Al Pacino (the head of '60 Minutes, Russell Crowe (the whistle-blower) and Christopher Plummer (as Mike Wallace) and is a rather straight forward version of the story.I agree with most of the reviews--'The Insider' is a very well-crafted film. However, it's also a case where the story, no matter how well made, is seriously flawed--at least to me. The theme of the film is how evil the tobacco companies are and how they knew that they were killing folks with their product. And, how this industry did its best to stop this story from being released by '60 Minutes'. This is about as surprising as learning that pirates love booty, Nazis are evil or crack addicts love crack. Where is the story and where is the surprise?! Of course tobacco companies have been minimizing and denying that tobacco kills...DUH!!! They sell a product that kills people and they've been making it seem fun and glamorous for as long as they've been selling the product!! To me it's a no-brainer and frankly not that interesting. Plus, anyone who does choose to smoke is amazingly stupid--as we've known that cigarettes kill for many decades. So, while I respect the film for its quality, the story did nothing for me.",7,3,6,10 March 2014
The Dark Knight," Amazing non-stop action and eye-popping skyscraper scenes!
","I first need to point out that I generally hate action films--they just aren't a genre I generally would go to see. However, my teenage daughter saw the film and DEMANDED that we immediately go to an IMAX-equipped theater and see it as soon as possible. Had I not agreed, I think she would have threatened force or threaten to leave home, so I reluctantly agreed. I'm pointing all this out up front so you'll understand that if I didn't give this movie a 10 and found a few minor problems with the plot, it's probably because of my bias. However, for me to give an action film a 9 is very, very unusual--it was a terrific film and almost earns a 10.As far as action goes, it was nearly non-stop and there were more eye-popping stunts in it than nearly any film you could see. Plus, I truly recommend that if you do have an IMAX theater nearby that is showing it you go there and not to a regular theater. The sounds, the sights and the action are just amazing on this huge screen--and in hindsight I probably should have taken my hearing aids out before the film began--I DIDN'T need them! For many, this will make the film a must-see, though I admit that it was was a bit tiring after a while--for an old fogy like myself, maybe there was a bit too much action--though teens and action fans will adore it.The characters were excellent--with the possible exception of Batman. He was fine, but I wish he'd have stopped mumbling in his deep voice. This made him a lot less interesting and perhaps less likable than the villains!! As for the villains, the Joker was great and very, very sadistic and I liked Harvey Dent as well (especially after his cool makeup job late in the film). Oddly, perhaps my favorite character was a guy who was only a bit character--Tommy 'Tiny' Lister who played one of the scariest prisoners I have ever seen in film. His bit part on the ferry boat was really exceptional.Overall, this film is better than any superhero film I have ever seen and much better than the earlier Batman films. My only serious problem was the ending--what Gordon and Batman agree to do made no sense at all and wasn't necessary. Still, with such amazing eye-candy, who am I to complain? A wonderful ride and a must-see movie for action and superhero fans. HOWEVER, it is a very violent film intended for adults--I would not take kids or even some teens to the film--it's THAT dark and intense.As of today (7/26/08), this is by far the highest rated film on IMDb. If these numbers can be believed, this film is better than THE GODFATHER, CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and 12 ANGRY MEN! Let's have a bit of perspective here--it's a very, very good film but the cult members out there need to get a grip.",9,16,42,24 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Must love golf...otherwise it's just a well made about stuff you really don't care about in the first place.
","I have a confession. I hate golf and see no purpose in playing golf and would rather watch a blank television screen than a golf tournament. So it's a very hard sell trying to get me to like a film about the topic. The only reason I rented the picture from Netflix was because it was included in Leonard Maltin's book '151 Best Movies You've Never Seen' and I am trying to watch all 151 films. Plus, it IS possible I might enjoy the film despite myself.I dare say that I am NOT unusual in not liking golf. In fact, most movie viewers don't like golf. So it makes me wonder why Disney Studios made the film in the first place. And, despite being a well made movie, it didn't do particularly well at the box office.The movie was directed by Bill Paxton, the late actor who only directed a few projects. This is surprising, because the film is well made all around and doesn't look like the work of a relative newbie. Technically speaking, it is well crafted...with some lovely acting, gorgeous camerawork and some odd but innovative CGI. I liked the look and feel of the film a lot. But there also were a few problems. Although the story of Francis Ouimet is compelling, the filmmakers chose to change some of the details...changes that seemed unnecessary. The biggest was making the match as close as they did in the film when Ouimet actually destroyed his two competitors in the tie-breaker. A few things also felt a bit like chiches--the father who hated his son playing the game THAT much, the fact that the 10 year-old caddy was THAT cute and precocious, the amount of class warfare in the story and a bit more. Much of this just felt like cinematic plot devices meant to inspire the audience more...when the story itself, warts and all, was more than enough already.Overall, this is a film golf lovers would die to see...and for good reason. But as for the rest of us, even if well made...who really wants to see a golf picture?",6,1,3,28 May 2018
Into the Wild," A most unique...but not entirely pleasant viewing experience.
","There is a certain irony to the story from 'Into the Wild', as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!The story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were.
Ultimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.I think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this.
Overall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend.",7,1,3,6 February 2020
Annie Hall," some amazingly funny moments, but,...
","I think the worst thing that ever happened to Woody Allen's career was the Oscar he won for Annie Hall. While it is a very funny in spots, it just encouraged him to make his movies more and more polished as well as more self-exploratory. I'm sorry, but I much prefer the earlier 'stupid' films he did--where self-exploration was limited and they were just funny. Now, with Annie Hall and most of his subsequent films, he was trying to 'say something'. Yeah, maybe like 'I'm finished with good films and now I'll make essentially the same film again and again and again because it's a great adjunct to all my psychoanalysis'. I don't want to explore Woody's psyche, thank you very much--just entertain me and make me laugh.Okay, to the film. Woody plays himself of sorts in the film. He goes to parties, meets famous people, has relationship problems and schmoozes. That's nice. About the only part of this film I loved was the scene where he and Diane Keaton are waiting in line to see a movie. During this wait, a pseudo-intellectual idiot keeps pontificating about the film and its symbolism. At which point, Woody begins talking to the camera--telling everyone what an idiot this guy is! Then, the blow-hard begins addressing the camera as well! Finally, Woody announces he has the author with him (standing behind a fake tree in the lobby). Then, the author tells the blow-hard that he is indeed stupid and totally misunderstood him! This is great--but there are not enough moments like this in the film. Considering how highly rated the film is, it looks like I am indeed in the minority.",7,5,14,22 March 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," What,......????
","Why is this movie so overrated? It almost always is listed among the greatest movies ever made and I once again ask WHY? First, I need to point out that I am a bright, well-read and highly educated person. So, yes, I did understand the imagery and 'hidden significance' of the movie. Despite this, I still MUST point out that the first 9 hours (yes, I know it WASN'T that long--but it seemed like it was) of people dancing around in primordial human/ape costumes was awful and the end was an artsty-fartsy mess (one minute Keir Dullea was flying through space, the next he was an old man in a sterile room and the next he was a giant embryo--wow, how stupid can you get?).Despite my warnings, I seem to be one of only a few voices who hated the movie (though it does get 5 stars for SOME of the music and great special effects). I don't understand everyone's fascination with Stanley Kubrick. Yes, Paths of Glory was excellent as were Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove, but movies like 2001 as well as Barry Lyndon (STERILE, LONG and DULL) and Clockwork Orange (over-indulgent and sick as it portrays rapes and violence) make me think about the story of the Emporer's New Clothes. In essence, people fall over themselves praising his 'artistic genius', while the average person finds some of his films often give them headaches!The only positive about the film that make it a possible must-see is that it helped to raise the genre of sci-fi to a new and more artistic level--but it certainly DIDN'T make sci-fi fun or interesting!",5,32,94,25 May 2005
The Graduate," Amazing in the 60s, today it seems awfully overrated
","THE GRADUATE is well into the top 250 Best Films on IMDb, yet I think it is highly overrated. That's because I think it scores so highly due to its impact when it was released and innovation, though today the movie seems, to me, flawed but interesting.Dustin Hoffman stars in one of his earliest films as a young college graduate who is extremely insecure and adrift emotionally. Into this aimlessness comes the very seductive friend of the family, Mrs. Robinson, who does practically everything a woman can do to seduce him. Eventually, Hoffman takes the 'forbidden fruit' and begins an affair that is based only on sex. Heck, even after they become intimate, he continues calling her 'Mrs. Robinson' and this continues for several months.Later, when the Robinsons' daughter (played by Katharine Ross) comes home from college to visit her parents, Hoffman is encouraged by all (except, of course, Mrs. Robinson) to date Ross. Despite only going on one date, Hoffman falls hopelessly in love and naturally chaos ensues when the truth is revealed.The film is very creative in many ways, such as with its sexual imagery and creative film shots. Examples are the creative cutting of scenes as well as images of the womb and several phallic references--all done in a rather subtle manner. I really liked how Hoffman's mother was deliberately made up to look like Mrs. Robinson--what a great Freudian device. Audiences of the day were obviously very shocked yet intrigued by all this sexual innuendo and blatant disregard for traditional values. Because its very amoral message was such a huge slap in the face of traditions during the same time that society was questioning itself in the 60s, it certainly doesn't seem surprising that the film was one of the biggest hits in film history. However, some creative shots, a very unusual script and the moral questions alone don't make for a movie that deserves to be rated so highly--that is unless the rating is simply for movies that have a huge impact on the film world (which this obviously did).What bothered me was not just that the message was morally questionable (at best) but that some of the movie was actually pretty poor and deserves a re-examination. First, much of the film was filmed like a music video and was perhaps the first film to do this. So, instead of a lot of speaking, often huge portions of the movie were dialog-free and consisted of very loud Simon & Garfunkle songs as montages filled the screen. A little of this went a long way, but the film used this technique repeatedly. Second, and this is by far me biggest complaint, is that the script really has some holes (though considering the film made a bazillion dollars, no one seemed to mind). Hoffman only dates Ross one time and decides to tell about his affair with the mother. While this is hard to believe, when he then stalks Ross incessantly and she finally agrees to marry Hoffman, it just strained believability to the breaking point. After all, she already was engaged to a man she knew very well AND this particular fiancé hadn't had sex with Mrs. Robinson!! Yet we are expected to believe that somehow it all works out in the end?! Overall, a very good and innovative film that comes with a really lousy and completely unbelievable ending. On top of all that (great choice of words), the film is very offensive to many out there--not just because of the sexuality but the way religion seems to be mocked at the end of the film as well as all the swearing. For me, a real mixed bag. I wanted to like it and there was some real creativity here, but 41 years later it really hasn't aged well.",6,9,17,7 October 2008
Pride & Prejudice," There's a lot to like but the film has one distinct disadvantage.
","Back in 1995, the definitive version of 'Pride and Prejudice' was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn't bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it's long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I've seen is just too rushed--and it's hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it's quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It's a shame, actually, as there's so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)! My advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film--it's really very lovely. But then do yourself a favor--find the 1995 version. You'll be thankful, believe me.",8,2,4,27 October 2012
Singin' in the Rain," As long as Anne Marie is no where about, you'll enjoy this lovely film.
","Tonight was my second time watching 'Singing in the Rain' and I am actually surprised that I ever saw it again. Now it is not because it's a bad film--it just holds an annoying memory. You see, when I saw the film, an annoying person named Anne Marie was also watching it....and yelled out what would happen in the finale BEFORE it happened. So, after years of therapy, I have finally decided to watch this again. And, in light of the annoying Anne Marie, I WON'T spoil the film by announcing spoilers in my review! 'Singing in the Rain' is set at the time period in which silent pictures were being replaced with sound (about 1927). Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen play two established stars who are beloved by the public. Sound isn't a bad thing for Gene, as he can sing and dance. But Jean, uggh, she has a voice like a Brooklyn parrot and her career is doomed (and she great in this role). That is, until they get the idea of dubbing her with sweet Debbie Reynolds. But as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Jean is a devil and Debbie is amazing--and Gene is head over heels for her. What's to become of them?The film does something interesting for a musical. Almost all the music is actually recycled from earlier MGM musicals (often from this late 20s time period). While this might seem cheesy, it worked very well because the songs were period and because the production values (the dancing, Technicolor and singing) were so nice it really breathed life into them. In fact, several of the musical numbers are among the best ever filmed--such as 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Make 'em Laugh'. Unfortunately, and I know this will sound like sacrilege, but I think the film had too many numbers, as some of the more garish dance numbers ('Gotta Dance') detracted from those that were sublime. Still, it has a very, very memorable score, a lot of energy and fun make this a musical to watch...provided Anne Marie is no where in sight. I wonder what ever became of her....perhaps some other film viewers killed her (we can only hope).",9,3,7,18 July 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Different.
","Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play young lovers who eventually have a falling out and their relationship ends. A bit later, Carrey sees her and she has no recollection of him--how could this be?! Later, Carrey learns that there is an organization that can wipe out specific memories and he realizes she's done this. And so, he decides to do the same. However, it's not that easy--Carrey really does love her down deep. Later, when they meet again, the story becomes VERY interesting and ends on a sweet romantic note.I read one review which said that 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was incredibly original. Well, while it's original in some ways, the basic plot idea is actually recycled from an old movie from 1939, 'Remember?'. 'Remember?' had a novel idea but the execution left a bit to be desired. In that film, Robert Taylor and Greer Garson marry and eventually grow to hate each other. They are offered a new experimental drug so they will forget each other completely--and they end up falling in love all over again! Well, if you take this idea and update it--this is, essentially, 'Eternal Sunshine'....though this recent film is much better and ends well.Now I am not saying 'Eternal Sunshine' is a great film. While it's rated extremely highly on IMDb, I disliked the style of the film at times. Lots of handycam shots and indie music made the film seem a tad pretentious at times. Plus, I was disappointed about the rough language in the film as it made it a rated-R film and the movie could have easily been a PG or PG-13 film--one that anyone could watch. But, if you can look past this, there is a sweetness about it that makes it worth your time.",8,2,5,9 February 2012
Once Upon a Time in America," I noticed several compared this to 'The Godfather'....though I think this is a bit of hyperbole.
","Before I get to talking about the film overall, I think I should point out to anyone who wants to see 'Once Upon a Time in America' that it is a very graphic movie. While it's rated R, it's a 'hard R'--and I could almost see it getting an NC-17 if shown today--especially when much more benign films like 'A Dirty Shame' was recently given the NC-17 distinction. In the film, you'll see closeups of a guy peeing, lots of blood, a kid on toilet, lots of teen sex, a very, very explicit rape, and a closeup of a guy getting shot in the eye. This is not necessarily meant as a criticism (after all, this is a gangster film) but you cannot ignore this when you discuss the film.This film is a long and VERY deliberately paced epic film about a small group of men in the Jewish mob. I say deliberately paced, as the famed director, Sergio Leone, took a very, very slow approach to the film. To me, this was a good and bad thing. On one hand, it was beautiful-- the camera-work was great and the look of the film was striking. On the other, the film was nearly four hours long YET most of the characters seemed underdeveloped and vague. In many ways, this makes it reminiscent of Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'--but I think 'West' had a tighter story and more clearly understood characters. The film also was much like this earlier Leone film due to its musical score by Ennio Morricone--though the extensive use of Zamfir's panpipes did set the film apart. For me, I loved and disliked the film at the same time. I sure can respect it--but also was depressed that the film never seemed to completely gel.One aspect of the film I would like to talk about and that is the rape scene. If you see the film, you'll know exactly which scene I am talking about. Part of me liked it because it tended to say that although DiNero's character seemed nice compared to the other thugs, he STILL was a vile thug down deep. And, making the rape so intensely realistic further clarified that this was NOT a sex act or sexy--it was violent and vile. On the other hand, I sure felt uneasy seeing such a super-violent scene begin portrayed THIS vividly--it could easily shake you up or cause strong reactions in rape victims viewing the film.By the way, early in the film, Jennifer Connelly says 'Pesach'. This is the Jewish word for 'Passover'.Also by the way, the makeup was often brilliant. DiNero was aged magnificently by the makeup artists. On the other hand, Elizabeth McGovern's makeup late in the film was pathetic--especially when they slapped on harlequin-like makeup to try to hide the fact that she STILL looked very young. This was sad--especially because in this same scene, DiNero looked 30 years older than her.Overall, I think there's a lot to like and a bit not to like about the film. I think that it is a bit overrated--and reviewers that say it's just as good or better than 'The Godfather' should maybe back off a bit on the hyperbole. It is NOT another 'Godfather'....and the only film that MIGHT get away with that claim is 'The Godfather II'. 'Once Upon a Time in America' is worth seeing but is also very flawed--and a bit confusing, most likely due to the studio hacking out major portions of the film.",7,6,14,29 August 2011
This Is Spinal Tap," This is a great film because of what it ushered in as opposed to its actual content...
","I am a huge fan of the improvised mockumentaries and whatever you think of 'This is Spinal Tap', you must acknowledge that it laid the groundwork for future projects with many of these same people. In other words, if it hadn't been for 'Spinal Tap', you never would have had 'Waiting for Guffman', 'Best in Show' or 'A Mighty Wind'....or even mockumentaries done by entirely different casts, such as 'And God Spoke'.Oddly, however, I must say that although this was a seminal film, I am not a huge fan of it. I am not saying it's a bad film--it's just that their later projects were stronger (though I must acknowledge that they never gained cult status like 'Spinal Tap'). One of the biggest reasons is that I think that they honed their improvisational skills with subsequent projects (aside from 'For Your Consideration'--a film that simply stank). Less of the jokes fell flat in these later films--and many in 'Spinal Tap' did. It's well worth seeing...but I think that with its huge reputation I was expecting a bit too much. Worth seeing but not among the best of the genre.",7,1,6,26 February 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Not particularly enjoyable, but I can respect what they accomplished.
","I've gotta admit up front that I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan and frankly think I've seen enough of him for some time. Now I am not saying he isn't talented—he certainly is. But so often his films have 'mega-hit' written all over them and the public throngs to his films like lemmings—and I just think I've seen enough. So why did I finally get around to watching 'Alice in Wonderland'? Well, I am currently on a Disney Cruise and the ship is equipped with an amazing 3-D theaterand this film just happened to be playing. And, given that my family is exhausted after a day of exploring Martinique, I thought I'd take in this film. After all, even a bad 3-D film could be a nice diversionespecially when I have to pay nothing extra to see it.Well, after seeing this film I am a bit stumped. On one hand, I didn't particularly enjoy the film—it has a particularly joyless thing—not at all fun to watch. But on the other, I can't just discount the good things about the film. Despite the plot doing almost nothing for me, I at least enjoyed the following: The 3-D will sneak up on you. Much of the early portion of the film (in the normal world) could have just as easily been done in traditional 2-D, once things got moving in Neverland the 3-D was lovely—and very immersive.The music was very nice. There must be a law that says that in addition to Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, Danny Elfman MUST write music for every Tim Burton epic. The music was great and well done.I enjoyed seeing and hearing some old favorites. The voices of some were recognizable—such as Christopher Lee as the Jaberwock, but Michael Gough (who appeared in lots of old Hammer films and must be 134 years-old) and Stephen Fry provided their voices as well. While Crispen Glover has had a very mercurial career, here he is rather mainstream (like he was in the 'Back to the Future' films) and it's nice to see him again. Matt Lucas was lovely in a non-'Little Britain' role as well. Plus who cannot enjoy Alan Rickman's wonderfully disdainful voice?!Now to provide equal time, here is what I didn't like:Alice in the real world was one giant anachronism. Women did not act like her.ever. The ending in particular was very politically correct and timelybut not for the mid-19th century. As a result of this and the way her character was generally written, she was really impossible to like or care for in any way—she was simply a caricature. And, speaking of caricatures, what was up with Depp's Mad Hatter?! Break dancing?! Bizarre makeup that looked way too whacked out and bizarre for a Rocky Horror reunion?! Plus, like Alice, he seemed to have nothing in the way of personality—he was just goofy .As for the story, as I said above, it was joyless. Too dark, too intense, too violent and way too gross---all the fun of the Red Queen from the cartoon was replaced by a homicidal maniac and heads being lopped aplenty. For a kids' film, this was surprisingly gloomy and un-fun. ThereI think I hit on the BIG problem.the movie simply was not fun to watch. Spectacular and cool, but rarely fun.",5,6,10,29 December 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," For a little film, it's quite engaging
","This is not the sort of film you'd expect from Anthony Hopkins. First, the aging British actors plays a New Zealander and second, he's a fearless speed demon with his heavily modified motorcycle! This is about as far from REMAINS OF THE DAY or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as you can get and it was nice to see Hopkins (who was pushing 70) try such an unusual role in an independent picture.Despite the title, the movie is not about people from India or American Indians--or even people from Indiana or Indianapolis! The 'Indian' in the title is a reference to the defunct Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant and its cycles of the first half of the twentieth century.The story is a basically true story (with a few changes and omissions) of how New Zealander Burt Munro was able to get his heavily modified motorcycle to the Bonneville Salt Flats and set land speed records for a 1000cc motorcycle--even though by this point he was in his 60s.The story unfolds very slowly--something that might annoy younger and action-oriented audiences. Instead of focusing just on the record-breaking attempt, much of the movie is a 'road film'--as Hopkins comes to America and slowly makes his way to Utah. Along the way, he meets a lot of odd characters, though the oddest one is probably Munro himself! In many ways, its reminiscent of THE STRAIGHT STORY and other slice of life films--one where characters and their quirks are more the story than their actual deeds. As a result of the style, it almost feels as if you are a passenger on Munro's journey as opposed to you seeing a movie.By the way, like almost every bio-pic, this one twists the real story just a bit--consolidating some events, omitting many (Munro was a father and grandfather--while in the movie, he seems to be all alone) and intensifying the drama. For a brief recap of the real Munro story, try www.indianmotorbikes.com/features/munro/munro.htm .",8,0,0,25 December 2007
Avatar," Gorgeous and 100% otherworldly--but the story is a bit simplistic in some ways.
","As of today, there are 2675 reviews for 'Avatar'--many of them excellent and by reviewers I respect and enjoy. Because this film has been reviewed so many times and I am so late in seeing it, I will make review VERY quick, as there isn't a whole lot more I can say that hasn't already been said.Although I have almost 10000 reviews to my credit (making me a real nut-case!), I rarely ever see blockbuster films. Heck, I've never seen 'Jurassic Park' and I mostly only go to theaters to see movies my daughters want to see or the Oscar-nominated shorts that are shown each winter. So the fact that I never saw 'Avatar' in the theaters isn't very surprising. Any why, then, did I see the film? Well, Netflix (or more likely the Post Office) made a mistake!! I was supposed to watch an Ealing Studios comedy (just the sort of thing a film snob would adore) but the package was ripped open--and 'Avatar' was inside! While I should have seen it in 3-D on a huge screen, I fortunately at least saw it on a 58' TV---the best I could hope for instead of the theater. In fact, I would say that if you only have a small TV, don't even bother as the graphics are the big reason to see the film--not the story. Additionally, James Cameron achieved something never achieved before (and hopefully which can now be achieved again thanks to CGI)--he's made sci-fi no longer the realm of humans or human-like beings. So much of the world in this film is 100% alien--something common in books but NEVER on TV or in films. Because of these factors, the film MUST be seen--even if the story, unfortunately, is a bit simplistic with its 'people are stupid and lack TRUE insight' plot. I would have liked the aliens teaching the humans much (like they did in the film) but less of the 'noble savage' idea that people have nothing to offer in exchange. While I do agree people are sometimes stupid, it just seemed a bit too black & white in its thinking and, as a result, lacks depth when it comes to the otherwise fascinating story. For example, the boss-man in charge of the operation comes off as a walking stereotype--like G.I. Joe on steroids and not a real person.Excellent...but flawed. Next time (and the director has announced there will be at least two follow-up films), I sure hope they spend some more of the one hundred bazillion dollar budget on better writing--as the characters were too often one-dimensional and the macho fight at the end just seemed...well...stupid and clichéd. More well-rounded and real and I would have given this film a 10--perhaps the next ones will earn this distinction.",9,8,20,21 November 2010
Toy Story 2," The best Pixar film (so far) and a good bit better than the original
","I liked TOY STORY but didn't love it. It had some wonderful moments (I liked the creepy and destructive kid next door), but it seemed marketed almost exclusively to young boys. In light of this, I was absolutely thrilled when I saw TOY STORY II, as it's a wonderful film for the entire family. For the boys, you have the familiar characters of Woody and Buzz, for the girls you have a new girl toy (Jessie) and for the adult, you have some great characters as well (Stinky Pete and the guy in the chicken costume). Plus, the writing is so amazingly clever and engaging you can't help but love the film. I particularly loved the showdown with Emperor Zurg, Barbie's guest appearance and all the cute little touches as well as homages to toys of yesteryear. And, for once in my jaded career as a reviewer, I have absolutely nothing negative or critical to mention--I enjoyed every minute of this delightful film.",10,8,11,10 June 2007
Chariots of Fire," one of the very best films of the 1980s
","This film probably won't appeal to everyone. Some kids and teens and those with short attention-spans will dislike the film's deliberate and sometimes leisurely pace or dislike that the historical context for the film is non-existent unless you are familiar with or care about 20th century history. In other words, those who love Friday 13th part XLV or anything made by Pauley Shore will be bored to death and should avoid this film like the plague (as they might accidentally learn something).Now, this does not mean this movie is for elitist snobs. Nope--you can be an average bloke and still become mesmerized by the terrific and incredibly realistic acting, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful costumes, brilliant script and lovely music by Vangelis.The movie is a generally true story about two parallel lives--Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams. Both were destined to win the gold medal at the 1924 Olympics but the actual journey there and the lives they led were so different. How they were woven together to form one beautiful tapestry is why this movie is great. See this film and don't worry that it won the Oscar for Best Picture--this is one of the few over the past several decades that both deserved it AND was entertaining (something the Oscar people usually do not consider).",10,6,12,10 May 2006
Victory," What nitwit thought this script idea made any sense at all?!
","Okay, the film gets an automatic 3 points for the soccer, I mean 'football' scenes--especially since they got Pelé for the film. But, aside from some nifty play during the big match, the film is about as realistic and inspiring as an episode of HOGAN'S HEROES. I mean, who would have ever thought to do a movie where the prisoners in a German POW camp play a German team in front of a crowd of 100,000,015 French and German fans would be a good idea?! Especially, since the Germans were a little bit preoccupied with other things to undertake such a meaningless match (such as taking over Europe, conducting the Holocaust, hiding from Allied bombings, etc.). What a brainless idea and a sick way of dismissing the evil that was WWII. I wasn't surprised that Sylvester Stallone did such a movie (after all, he made OVER THE TOP and RHINESTONE), but Michael Caine, Pelé and Max Von Sydow all agreed to make this mess?! Surely their agents agreed to do the film before anyone actually read the script!",3,6,17,16 July 2006
Frank," Quirky is the best way to describe this one...
","'Frank' is NOT a film for everyone, as it is totally bizarre and makes very little sense at times. However, it DID make me laugh and even smile a bit. It has a quirky strangeness that I liked and I am glad I saw it, though it think it would be a hard film to sell on the average person--mostly because it makes little attempt to be conventional.The film begins with Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) in Scotland. He's an apparently talentless young man (who looks a lot like Rupert Grint-- the guy who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films) who somehow is still quite happy. One day, he meets a guy from a band who needs a keyboard player and Jon tells him he can play--and he's in the band with no try-out! Well, he turns out to be horrible and can barely play the keyboard at all--which would be a SERIOUS problem with 99.99% of the bands in the world. However, this one is very avant-garde--more like a combination of a New Wave band and performance art. The bottom line is that NONE of them seem to have much musical talent at all and their 'music' is not good. The most talented of the band's members is Frank--a seriously mentally ill man who wears a giant Jack-in-the Box style head! In fact, he NEVER removes the head and sings in it, sleeps in it and even drinks nutrients through a straw in it! He's odd...but the rest of the band is pretty weird as well and apparently Frank and another band member met while institutionalized. Despite these folks being ultra- weird, perhaps the most misplaced of all is some ways is Jon, as he does not appear to have any talent whatsoever. Yet, oddly, he is able to somehow fit in with this group of misfits. And, by the end of the film they somehow manage to become a sensation. The bottom line is that the film is apparently never intended for a huge audience--it's more of a quirky niche film. Because of this and the bizarreness of the characters, it's definitely an acquired taste. In many ways, this reminds me of 'Napoleon Dynamite'--a film many folks love and many hate because they think it just doesn't make any sense. It is NOT a film for everyone--mostly just for folks who don't mind a meandering plot, a lot of stuff that makes no sense as well as many strange, almost nonsensical characters. As for me...I actually enjoyed it.By the way, if you think that the idea of a severely mentally ill guy becoming a sensation as a lead singer and songwriter sounds impossible, watch the film 'The Devil and Daniel Johnston'. Johnston, a real artist and musician, despite a severe Bipolar Disorder and a history of ultra- bizarreness is both a huge hit within certain circles. I wonder if his life was in any way the inspiration for Frank.UPDATE: Rex Reed picked this film as one of the worst of 2014. Considering all the interesting and quirky parts, I wouldn't agree but I could see someone objecting to the film overall as it certainly is strange. I like strange but not everyone wants that in a movie.",7,1,2,12 October 2014
The Artist," A very good film but I wish it hadn't received so much praise.
","'The Artist' is a great example of a very good film that was over-hyped by critics. Again and again, I heard how the film was a prime Oscar-contender. So, as a result, I had EXTREMELY high hopes--too high, actually. If I'd heard nothing about the film, I would have left the theater VERY satisfied.Oddly, this film is the second homage to silent films that's been released in the last few months. 'HUGO' was simply brilliant (and my hope is that it gets the Best Picture nod) and 'The Artist' is fortunately very good but quite different in style. It is, aside from one song with lyrics and the end of the film, silent with only some incidental music and occasional sound effects. It's a reworking of the myth about TONS of silent stars losing their careers because of their inability to adapt to talking pictures (popularized by the film 'Singing in the Rain'). I say 'myth' because actually very few major actors really lost their careers due to the coming of talking pictures. Two frequent examples often cited, Clara Bow and John Gilbert, really weren't lost in talkies completely because of their voices. Sure, Bow had a thick New York accent--but her odd-screen antics (she was the Lindsay Lohan of her day) and fragile mental health really did a lot more to push her out of films. But Gilbert did some amazingly good talkies and his losing his career had a lot more to do with Louis B. Mayer hating him--as well as Gilbert's heavy drinking--and nothing to do with his fine voice. But,...back to the story.Jean Dujardin plays a huge silent film star--one very similar to Douglas Fairbanks. Along the way, he helps an aspiring actress (Bérénice Bejo) and soon she, too, becomes a star. However, when talking pictures come, she becomes a mega-star and Dujardin becomes a has-been. The plot is quite a bit like a reworking of 'A Star is Born'--and is clever enough and new enough not to be repetitive. However, to me, the star of the film was actually Uggie--the wonderful dog (actually three different ones according to IMDb) who co-starred in Dujardin's silent films.So why am I only giving the film a very respectable 8 when critics are going crazy talking about it? Well, the story is originally but it's also VERY simple. It is also, unfortunately, a tad predictable...though quite satisfying as well. Not a bad film--in fact, a very good one--with nice cinematography and music as well. But probably not among the very best films of the year.FYI--Dujardin and Bejo have played together before--such as in the very funny James Bond-type comedy 'OSS 117'--which is also very well worth seeing.",8,18,30,11 January 2012
Invictus," Very inspiring but no surprises
","While I am a history teacher and know much more about South African history than the average American, but as an American I am still woefully ignorant of this far away country's history. Most everyone here knows almost nothing about Mandela and South Africa---so we are usually unable to critically examine 'Invictus'--only to enjoy it. So I have no idea if Nelson Mandela is as wonderfully kind and wise as he is in the film or more just an ordinary man. In other words, is this an accurate biography or is it hero worship...I just don't know. And this movie gets me to thinking that perhaps it is time I do get to know more about the man and the nation--especially as I am planning on visiting there in 2013. I mention all this because usually when I review films I am VERY critical of the historical accuracy of a movie but in this case I am just not the best person to be doing this. It also makes me feel bad that I just don't know more about the country--especially since our news stories pretty much stopped on South Africa following the collapse of Apartheid.'Invictus' is an interesting film because it's like a biography and history lesson combined. At times, it focuses on Mandela as President of the new South Africa and others it focuses on the divided nation--and bounces back and forth between this. This is NOT a bad thing, as using the metaphor of rugby to represent the nation is a clever way to tell the story. The only problem is that although it's quite inspiring and well made, the viewer is never surprised--not even once. What you think will happen, happens. And, oddly, there isn't even a plot device to bring in any tension or make the viewer doubt the outcome in the least. As a result, it's easy to see why 'Hurt Locker' beat out 'Invictus' for the Best Picture Oscar and I think other nominees I've seen (such as 'Precious' and 'Avatar') were better films. However, I COULD see how 'Invictus' won acting Oscars, as this was top-notch. Oddly, however, Morgan Freeman played a much smaller man (Mandela) and the opposite is true of Matt Damon playing a much bigger man than he really is.While it's almost completely unlikely to ever happen, I'd sure love to be able to watch this film with a mixed group of South Africans--to listen to their insights and comments on what is occurring. I did not see this on DVD, so perhaps the DVD has some similar sort of commentary--it would be most enlightening if there is such an option.",8,0,3,1 March 2011
Mission: Impossible," I have no idea why my first review was removed.
","I wrote a review about why I hated this film some time ago. My Italian friend, Angelo, recently informed me it was removed. I have had this happen a few times...and each time it seemed to be because I hated a movie everyone else liked. I used no offensive language nor gave spoilers without warnings....and IMDB never explains WHY they remove some reviews. Perhaps they'll just remove this one as well.So why did I hate this film so much? Because if you loved the original series, this movie pretty much spits on these fans. They make the hero of the original, Jim Phelps, the villain. This is like doing a Barney movie and making him evil! So, no matter how good the stunts and action are (and they are actually utterly ridiculous at times in this movie), I simply was angry because they took a beloved character and destroyed him.",1,16,23,2 February 2019
La La Land," A nice experiment...though I wasn't exactly captivated by it.
","'La La Land' made quite a splash after it debuted. It's now on IMDB's Top 250 and received 6 Oscars! But, with all that publicity, it might just leave you feeling like me...that's it is a decent film, but hardly a great film.The story is of two struggling artists...one an actress (Emma Stone) and another a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling). Each appears ready to give up their beloved craft after years of disappointments and bills....and that is when they both meet and fall in love. Ultimately, however, their careers DO take off and this leads you to wonder if they can make it TOGETHER. After all, being a famous actress or musician isn't exactly part-time work!In many ways, this film reminds me of the ending in 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'. This sort of downbeat ending didn't really bother me...it was realistic. But somehow 'La La Land' muddled it all up...and left you with a confusing ending that PROBABLY was like 'Umbrellas'...but maybe wasn't. I found this to be a huge problem. Aside from this, I also was not a huge fan of the characters...though I must admit it DID leave me misty-eyed more than a few times. Well worth seeing...but a film that isn't perfect...and you'd expect a six Oscar film to be absolutely perfect.",7,1,6,11 November 2018
3 Idiots," Wonderfully entertaining.
","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since '3 Idiots' is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.",10,264,313,2 June 2011
Life Is Beautiful," funny and disturbing
","Before I watched this film, I was a bit hesitant because the basic premise sounds so ridiculous--a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! I mean, how can this movie be funny? Is this another 'Hogan's Heroes' or what, I thought.Well, first, most of the humor in the film occurs BEFORE the internment. This makes sense and allows the movie to be in good taste. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions with the silly buffoonery of Benigni as he tries to capture the heart of a woman he keeps 'bumping into'. These moments also abound with charm and seem rather reminiscent of the work of Chaplin--lots of physical humor and charm.The second half of the movie does indeed take place in a prison camp. Occasionally, there were some mildly humorous moments but the goal was not a cheap laugh but were desperate attempts to convince the child that he should not give up hope. Despite the ludicrousness of the plot at this point (hiding a little boy in a men's dormitory in a prison camp), the way they explain it works out perfectly and should not offend or diminish from the horrors that were the holocaust.This film, though VERY cleverly written, was carried by Benigni's marvelous acting. He rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor for all his charm, enthusiasm and magnetism.",10,4,9,19 July 2005
Up," A delight...plus it's in 3-D!!
","As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...'touched'. This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best.",10,10,19,29 May 2009
A Clockwork Orange," I've reconsidered my previous review...
","WARNING: ONLY AN INSANE AND IRRESPONSIBLE PARENT WOULD LET THEIR KIDS SEE THIS FILM!! SERIOUSLY! I originally gave this film a very low score but have reconsidered it after having read the Anthony Burgess novel and then seen the movie again. The Burgess novel is brilliant but necessarily violent given the subject matter. I still think that Stanley Kubrick really lost his way in this film because he increased the level of violence and especially nudity--making the film, at time, almost like a sex film. This was just gratuitous and seemed highly reminiscent of NATURAL BORN KILLERS--a film that was just too graphic and needlessly trivialized violence. However, despite Kubrick's overindulgence, the film is pretty good and reasonably close to the novel--and I appreciated this greatly. Plus, I liked Malcolm McDowell's nice performance.First, let's talk about the overindulgence that keep me from seeing this as a brilliant film (despite popular opinion--after all, it's #49 on the IMDb top 250). The book never had such graphic rape scenes and that much sex. In Kubrick's vision, the story is more about sex than violence much of the time--completely missing the point of Burgess' novel. Adding rapes and making many of the scenes so very graphic just seemed unnecessary and make this an adults-only film that easily earned the X rating (today it clearly would be an NC-17 film). Plus, Kubrick's need for over-indulgence made the film seem more like a Ken Russell film--just unnecessarily crude with statues of Jesus with an erect penis, the character Alex beating to death a woman with a giant penis and testicles statue (the original way she dies in the book was much better--funny and ironic) and many, many scenes of graphic non-violent nudity that were not even in the book. Oddly, despite the many depravities, Kubrick chose not to include an attempt by one of Alex's roommates to sexually abuse him--an odd omission considering everything else.Now if you can manage to watch the film and ignore how over the top it is compared to the book, you will be happy that most of the scenes in the book are still there (though, as I think, with a few unnecessary additions). Plus, much of the spirit of Burgess' excellent novel is present--along with Alex's clever narration. On the very positive side, the movie is based on the American version of the novel not the original British one (which is odd, as Kubrick loved the UK and didn't think much of his home country according to most reports). In the British version, there was a final unnecessary chapter in which, by Alex was in his early 20s and he was essentially cured--wanting to become a productive citizen practically overnight. While a redemption is possible, having it happen so young and so quickly with such a hard-core sociopath didn't make any sense at all and undid most of the book. Leaving Alex an unrepentant and vile individual had much greater impact.By the way, it's never really said but I thought it was implied in both the book and film that after Alex's attempted suicide, doctors de-programmed him--possibly by employing psychosurgery or more conditioning techniques. I spoke to a friend who never noticed this--yet he LOVED the book. What did you think about Alex's transformation following this attempt? Overall, a very good version of the Burgess book but also way too sexually explicit--limiting the movie's audience and possibly encouraging rape and violence instead of being a tale about totalitarianism and behavioral conditioning.",7,3,15,7 December 2008
Where Eagles Dare," A good film but how good seems to diminish with repeated viewing.
","Years ago, I saw 'Where Eagles Dare' and loved it. Now, quite a few years later, I watched it again and was less impressed. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film but it suffers from two huge problems. First, the plot itself is very convoluted and difficult, at times, to follow. According to IMDb, co-star Clint Eastwood was NOT happy about the script...and I can see why this was most likely the case. Second, the ease at which the two heroes kill off Germans is almost cartoonish. The Germans miss again and again and again and the heroes (Richard Burton and Eastwood) are practically impossible to kill. Bomb blasts narrowly miss them and the worst they incur is a slightly wounded hand that NEVER impairs Burton's character in the least! And, they both manage to kill about 100 well trained German soldiers! It reminded me a bit of 'Hot Shots Part Deux'...and that is NOT meant as a complement.Now if you can ignore all this, the film is a good escapist war film. Not as good as the same author's 'Guns of Navarone'--where some of the heroes DID manage to die and the same insane ratio of killed isn't quite as bad! Enjoyable and worth seeing...but flawed when you see it twice and realize its shortcomings.",7,2,6,13 March 2017
The Fly," Nauseating and unnecessary
","The original movie, The Fly, was a lovely little horror film. Was it great? No, but it was effective and fun to watch. Did it need to be remade? Possibly, but only if the integrity of the original story remained and it was given better special effects. BUT, NOT LIKE THIS!! Gone is the silly fun of the original. In its place is a viscerally disturbing (nauseating actually) mess with a rather mean spirit. It's simply unfun and unappealing.You don't believe me? Well, look at the sick makeup job on Jeff Goldbloom. Accident victims are easier to look at for extended periods. And, the ultimate gross-out of having him vomit up white slime on people in order to digest them!!! What were they thinking? If they want to gross us out so much, why not go on a tour of the morgue and film that!? It would be as gross and as pointless.",1,11,64,9 June 2005
Groundhog Day," What's not to like about this film?!
","While GROUNDHOG DAY is not my favorite Bill Murray comedy, it is one of three brilliant comedies he made during the early 90s and all three are absolute must-sees. And, interestingly enough, while the film is very funny, it also has some wonderful and poignant moments--something I usually hate in comedies.The plot is pretty simple. Murray plays a jerk or a TV weather man who is sent against his will to cover the annual festivities concerning America's second favorite rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, as he tells us whether or not we'll have a long, hard winter (a very stupid tradition if you ask me). Naturally after having done this repeated times he's less than thrilled, but there's more to it than that--Murray is a nasty jerk and he delights in looking down on all the locals that take such pride in this event. Apparently, the fate is not happy with Murray, as he is oddly punished and made to repeat this same day again and again and again. Why exactly is unknown but his reactions to this exact same day are priceless--ranging from insanely funny to weird to touching.In addition to Murray's excellent performance, Andi McDowell does a good job in support and the film makers really did a wonderful job of capturing the wacky essence of small town America as well as creating a wonderful and quirky script.This film is terrific--you must see this film...now!",9,2,6,30 May 2008
National Treasure," I didn't like this movie, but I can understand why it was so popular
","This film is hard to sum up with a single rating. I really wish I could give it three scores: One for how much I personally liked it, how good the film is historically and how entertaining the film is.For me, the film was a 3 or 4--mostly because I just don't like this type of film. Action films often bore me because I like characters with depth and the characters in NATIONAL TREASURE are cartoon-like and one-dimensional with little to make me connect with them. Now this isn't to say that I dislike all action films, but this one just seemed like a long string of plot devices and gimmicks strung together. The logical leaps they used to solve each riddle were just silly. And, again and again, I found myself guessing correctly what was coming next--the script was amazingly predictable and poor given that so much money was spent on special effects and high-priced actors.As far as the historical value, I'm going to need to bite my tongue a bit. I am an American History teacher and need to keep reminding myself that I must suspend disbelief--after all, Disney did not intend this as a real history lesson. Sadly, however, when I talked to my students about the film, it was amazing how many thought the film DID have an actual historical basis!! Well, I can't blame Disney for the fact that kids don't know their history (well, I guess I could launch into an attack on the historical errors in POCAHONTAS but I need to keep on topic). At least the film gets people thinking about history, so that's something, so I'll give it a 5--though all the mumbo-jumbo about the Masons, secret codes, etc. was all a lot of hooey.As far as entertainment for the masses go, the film is fun, slick and well-crafted (aside from the writing, that is). The film looks great and has a bigger than life feel that is at times reminiscent of INDIANA JONES and other action films. For an undemanding audience, it's going to keep their attention. In this regard, it deserves a 7 or 8. It looks pretty and is nice escapism.So overall, I'd say the film deserves a 5. While I hated much of the film and would rather eat glass than see it again because of the style of film and clichéd writing, I also realize I am a very picky person and there's nothing wrong with some mindless entertainment now and again. For kids and anyone who tends to not look for plot problems, this could be a very entertaining film. For smug guys like me, you would probably do better with an independent or foreign film, documentary or silent film--you know, the kinds of film NORMAL people don't like.",5,5,9,8 January 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Warning: This film is NOT for everyone...even though it is brilliant.
","It's hard to imagine that anyone has NOT heard that 'Reservoir Dogs' is an ultra-violent film, but just in case you haven't, please understand that this is a super-duper ultra-violent film--and a film that many, many out there will find too difficult to watch or will traumatize you. I am not kidding...think twice before you decide to watch it and for heaven's sake, DON'T LET KIDS SEE THIS FILM.Now, despite this intense warning, I greatly respect the film--especially since it was made for next to nothing and without the big studio money. Despite its violence, the film is very smartly written, directed and acted. Quentin Tarantino was able to assemble a rather amazing cast of bad-boy actors--and in many, many ways is a modern version of film noir. And, to give the film that cache, he managed to get a great noir character actor, Lawrence Tierney (in real life a total nut) to give the film an air of menace and class.Because so much on IMDb has already been written about this film and because it's in the IMDb Top 250, there just isn't a great need to discuss the film at length. Suffice to say that it is bloody, full of obscenities and extreme violence (though, to his credit, Tarantino did on many occasions make the actual violence occur off-camera). And, it's brilliant--with a great ending (full of vagueness and a noir-like downbeat ending) and is sure to please the right audience.",9,1,7,28 March 2010
Love & Mercy," Sad and rather creepy...
","This film is about Brian Wilson of 'Beach Boy' fame and focuses, in particular, on his mental health struggle and his sick relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy. While the film doesn't say it, it does imply that Wilson's long struggle with debilitating mental illness was the combination of his sick childhood (with an emotionally abusive father), psychedelic drugs, real organic mental illness AND, most importantly, the abusive treatment and over-prescription of pills by the man who was SUPPOSED to be making him better but who used and abused him. It all makes for a very moving and sad tale, as the leading character played in the movie didn't seem malevolent but was more like a lost child looking for a sense of direction and love.To do this story, the filmmakers did a couple things that were unusual. First, the story is completely non-linear and bounces back and forth from a young Brian to a much older Brian. I assume this bounciness was used to emphasize how Brian's thinking was erratic and disjoint. Secondly, and this was really odd, two different actors played Brian! Young Brian was played by Paul Dano--and he really looked a lot like the actual singer. Older Brian was played capably by John Cusack--a guy who, to me, seemed very unlike Wilson. While it all was very unusual, it worked very well and you could tell that the folks making this movie saw it as a labor of love-- such as getting the look and sound of the Beach Boys down pat.This is a very interesting and amazingly sad film. The only complaint I have is that so much of the story is missing--such as HOW he finally got away from Dr. Landy as well as Landy's life following his being (only briefly) stripped of his license. Some is alluded to in an epilogue which is pasted on the screen at the end. Sadly, Landy soon began practicing again and continued until his death a few years ago.One thing I REALLY liked about the film was during the final credits they showed the actual Brian Wilson singing one of his new songs. WOW did he look great--a HUGE improvement over a decade or two ago when he just looked crazy and depressed. It's good to see the improvement and I wish him the best. As for Landy, if everything in the film is true, I hope he's burning in Hell.Finally, if you do watch this film, you might want to have some tissues handy. As the film ended I found myself crying...crying because of the wasted years for Wilson. It's all so very sad but, fortunately, a story with a happy ending.By the way, if you get the DVD, take a look at a couple of the special features. I loved hearing the costume and set designers and all the subtle things they did to heighten the story. I also really agree when the director said that there was so much material that it could have been a mini-series (and this would explain the way then ended the film). Really neat stuff!",9,3,4,17 September 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," It's so good it boggles the mind!
","When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's 'Up'! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!UPDATE: I saw this on a huge home television. While the wonderful 3-D was missing, the film still had the nicest CGI and was nearly as entertaining as it was in the theater.",10,4,11,30 April 2010
Total Recall," cool to watch but really stupid if you think about it
","Okay, this isn't exactly Shakespeare. And, some parts of the movie just need you to suspend disbelief (especially the ending as Arnold and his main squeeze are rolling around the surface of Mars gasping for air and the part when Arnold pulls that HUGE thing out of his nose). However, sometimes I just like to watch a movie for entertainment value and don't mind if it's not the greatest or most uplifting film ever made. Yup,...this film is just plain cool. The extremely special effects-laden script is pretty interesting and the stunts are amazing for its time. Plus, sure it's low-brow, but Arnold's line 'consider this a divorce' is really neat on a purely emotional level.",7,2,15,1 June 2006
Rocky," The film cost a million and grossed over 100,000,000 domestically.....'nuff said.
","I am not a huge boxing film fan. Well, that's not exactly true. I am not a fan of films that glamorize boxing. Movies like 'The Harder They Fall', 'Requiem For a Heavyweight' and 'Champion' and 'The Set-Up' are all wonderful films about the brutality and vicious nature of the 'sport' and are great indictments about what a terrible thing boxing is--and I heartily recommend them. However, 'Rocky' is a rare film that glamorizes boxing (for the most part) and manages to deliver a film that you can't help but admire. Think about it. It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement. It is a great film and it's amazing that it was made by folks who no one really heard about up until then. Plus, when you read about how quickly Stallone penned the script, you can't help but admire it. A terrific film.",10,3,7,30 March 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," I know this makes me a heretic, but this film should have had at least half an hour trimmed.
","It's amazing that a film this long and drawn out would actually leave so much unsaid and unclear. What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.I must stop to make a horrible confession. Despite having now done over 9000 reviews for IMDb, I have very, very mixed feelings about Kubrick's films and the following are my insane opinions about many of his more famous films. Some are masterpieces--such as 'Dr. Strangelove', 'Paths of Glory' and 'The Killing'. Others, exceptional but flawed--'Spartacus' went on too long and should have ended at the 'I am Spartacus' scene (then it would have been perfect). Others, way, way, way overrated--'2001' is is definitely so. And others are so long and dull it boggles the mind--'Barry Lyndon' made we want to scream it moved so slowly.As for 'Eyes Wide Shut', it is far from Kubrick's best work and it is painfully slow...but it does merit watching. The basic story idea is, at times, intriguing. There is a lot to like. But, the film shows a certain painfully obsessive quality--a need to show EVERYTHING--every emotion, every grimace...almost every breath! Considering that Mr. Kubrick was well-known for his OCD-like qualities (often shooting scenes again and again and again as well as going months or years past deadlines), this isn't too surprising. Plus, by the time he made the film he was a bit of a film guru--and adored so much that no one would dare question why this movie clocks in at almost 168 minutes--whereas another director might complete the film in less than 120.There is also one thing that boggled my mind about the movie. Although the film should have received an NC-17 rating (again, I assume this was withheld because it was a Kubrick film), even with gobs of full-frontal nudity, it managed to make sex boring! The way some of the sex scenes were so over-choreographed (especially at the party at the mansion where Cruise was the interloper) made me wish that despite the gorgeous women that they'd just cut much of it. As a result, while it's not a film I'd rush to show a teenager, it's almost sanitary enough that you could.As far as the performances go, the best in the film was by Sidney Pollack. Unlike most everyone else in the film, he actually had some energy--like he was the only one awake among a half-asleep cast. I sure wanted to see more acting like this--and perhaps, in a way, Pollack was directing himself a bit.So far, it really sounds like I disliked the film, though this isn't exactly true--I mostly just disliked the way it was directed (ahhh....I must be a heretic). As for the extremely sexy story, some of it was great. I liked how the film explored what might happen if couples are too open about their sexual fantasies and the irreparable harm it can cause. I liked the idea of a secret society made up of the rich and powerful. I liked the way that you never knew exactly whether or not Cruise might die. But, I also think I've seen much of this done better in John Frankenheimer's 'Seconds'. I know that Frankenheimer is a very, very well-respected director but know few would say he was better than Kubrick--but in this particular case I think he did a better job mostly because his film was more direct, less self-indulgent and lacked the occasionally annoying soundtrack. The bottom line is that I liked the film but far from loved it. And, for the most part, that was the reaction to the film when it debuted. Aside from the Kubrick worshipers, most seem to feel it was one of his lesser films.Worth seeing but think three or four times about having your kids watch it!",7,4,16,10 August 2010
Beauty and the Beast," A visual masterpiece that you MUST see....
","I have to admit it...I was dead wrong about 'Beauty and the Beast'. I had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don't score this one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.So why am I so positive about this movie? Well, to me it's simply the most visually stunning and artistic film I have ever seen...and I have reviewed thousands and thousands of films. I went to the theater fully expecting to hate the picture...but soon found it took my breath away...not just once but again and again...it's that beautiful. And, what I also really appreciate is that the film is the best looking CGI/live action combination I have ever seen and the 3D effects are much, much better than usual. With most live action films made in 3D, I generally leave with a feeling that I could have enjoyed the movie just as much in 2D as 3. And, all but a few scenes seem as if they were not even shot with 3D in mind. But not Beauty and the Beast. The filmmakers obviously thought out every possible aspect of the movie and each scene used the multidimensionality to its fullest. Because of that, I strongly recommend you not only see the film on the big screen but pay the extra money and see it in 3D. Really, you must see it on the big screen and in 3D. I have no desire to ever see the film on DVD or cable television...it is truly a big and impressive film you must experience in person. You can thank my wife later.By the way, a side note: I know there's been a lot of hubbub about the character Le Fou in this film because he's gay. I think if Disney hadn't said anything about this before the film was released, most folks would not have really cared one way or the other and many simply wouldn't have noticed. It doesn't smash you over the head and I don't see this movie as some 'gay agenda picture'...and I see it much like I see 'Some Like it Hot'. It's a shame, as I am sure a lot of people who were angered by this gay character probably wouldn't be so angry if they just saw the film and let themselves enjoy it.",9,5,11,27 March 2017
Departures," An oddly beautiful film about death....
","I doubt that 'Departures' would appeal to a mass audience. That's because while it is a beautiful and artistic film, it's also about death--a topic most folks are very hesitant to think about...let alone go to a theater to see. But, I strongly advise you to stick with the film--it's well worth seeing and I can see why this film received the 2009 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.Daigo is a nice man. But, the orchestra in which he plays has been disbanded and he needs a job. He answers an ad in the newspaper for a job he THINKS has to do with a travel agency--not realizing that the job entails doing funeral rituals. Now this part of the film requires a bit of explaining, as such jobs are completely unknown in the USA. Instead of the mortician just picking up a dead body for burial (or cremation in most cases, as that is the Shinto tradition), there are people whose job it is to ritually prepare the corpse in front of the family--a strange way to handle a wake by Western standards. Now I am NOT being critical of this service--in the film, it had an odd sort of beauty and artistry about it. It's just very different from how death is handled in this and western countries. To understand exactly what I mean and what this process is, the film shows several such preparations by Daigo and his very likable boss. What happens next? See it for yourself.Now HOW can this turn into a good film? Well, the movie found a way to balance all this--with respect for the dead, not making the film too graphic and maintaining a healthy respect for the characters. And, the final thing is the most important--as you really like and respect the characters. And, the film is chock full of wonderful supporting characters. Overall, it's a very sweet and gentle film--one you really have to make yourself watch. After all, death is just a natural part of life--and the film handles the topic wonderfully.",9,5,7,1 January 2012
Pretty Woman," About as romantic as a case of the clap! DON'T LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS ONE!!
","WARNING--ADULT LANGUAGE. However, considering NO CHILD SHOULD SEE THIS FILM, the use of the 'V-word' should be excused.Okay, I am about to insult millions of people AND this review will probably never be read by anyone because there are already 1249983882348378 reviews for this movie. But, because I HATE this movie so much and find it so offensive and damaging to our culture, here goes nothing! This movie is a totally brainless piece of excrement that the American public ate up and proclaimed it to be a 'feel good romance'. Hmmmm,...when I think 'romance', I usually do NOT think about prostitutes. What I DO think of when I think of prostitutes are STDs, body lice, crack pipes, early death and ladies whose nether-regions (a polite way of saying 'vaginas') are so polluted and skanky that the word 'romance' hardly seems appropriate!!!. Whoever thought of this mess and created this film should be ashamed of themselves, but at least they got rich--and I assume that is the ONLY reason this sleazy film was made.As a school teacher and parent, I am horrified that Disney or any other studio would make such patently disgusting garbage and pass it off as a 'modern fairy tale'. A wretched, sick and twisted view of romance that should be avoided, lest it pollute your mind and make you believe in this bilge!!!I would have LOVED this film if instead of a beautiful Julia Roberts playing this über-sanitized hooker they'd taken a real prostitute (herpes sores on the lips and all) and had her played the part! Imagine, romanticizing such a sad and degrading way of life!",1,19,47,19 July 2006
Some Like It Hot," A lot of fun and one of the best final lines in film history...
","This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon stumble upon a mob hit. And, since mobsters really DON'T like witnesses, they know they'd better hide--and quick. So they hit upon the idea of hiding in an all-ladies' band, as they, too, are musicians. There, Tony falls in love with Marilyn Monroe--and it's hard for him to balance his female persona with the bookish guy he also pretends to be to impress her. As for Jack, he becomes the focus of a rich older man's attentions (Joe E. Brown). So how do they both balance these relationships with a strong desire NOT to be killed by the mob? The film has some nice supporting acting by George Raft and Pat O'Brien-and it's nice to see them return to films. As for the acting, it's generally very good, though I think Curtis' acting is a bit broad at times--but oddly charming as well.Overall, there's a lot to enjoy and it's fun throughout.",8,6,9,22 March 2010
Hoosiers," Formulaic...but in a good way.
","The film begins with the hiring of a new high school basketball coach (Gene Hackman) in a rural Indiana town in 1951. Despite the townsfolk loving basketball (after all, it IS Indiana), the people really aren't that friendly. They try to tell him how to coach and some of his players have major attitudes as well. It's easy to say that it's a downright unfriendly place for outsiders. However, being a movie, you figure things must change...otherwise it wouldn't make for an interesting film! Into this enjoyable but predictable formula, fortunately, you have a lot of great characters. There is the nice but sick Principal, the teacher who initially hates the coach (Barbara Hershey) and, the most interesting of all, an alcoholic who is actually hired to be the coach's assistant (Dennis Hopper). All of these, along with lovely writing and a strong attention to 1950s details, make this an inspiring and impressive film.I wish all basketball players were forced to watch this game today. It has a lot to say about the game, self-discipline, self-respect and teamwork. So, even thought today's players are probably a lot better than those back in the old days (they are a lot bigger and stronger, that's for sure), they still have a lot to learn.As you watch the film, you need to keep reminding yourself that basketball was MUCH different back in the 50s. There was no shot clock and games OFTEN had total scores below 60...or even 40! So, the Coach's insistence on passing, passing, passing is pretty consistent with the way the game was played at the time--sort of like playing keep-away with occasional shots. So, actually, while the game seems kind of slow in this film, it's really a lot faster than they usually played it back then. They also seemed to have a lot more fights in the film than they probably had in real life.Recently another film was made that was clearly patterned on 'Hoosiers' ('The Winning Season'). However, this newer clearly ignored the positive lessons of 'Hoosiers' and is a funny film...though I clearly would NOT want to have a real coach be THAT awful! Well worth seeing...sort of an 'Anti-Hoosiers'!One of the best films of the genre.",8,1,2,19 March 2012
Pulp Fiction," Brilliantly constructed.
","'Pulp Fiction' is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.",10,7,16,13 March 2010
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A lot like 'Snatch' but with fewer laughs.
","Considering that this film was written and directed by Guy Ritchie, it's certainly not very surprising that it is strongly reminiscent of 'Snatch'--another one of Ritchie's film. Obviously, he did well with 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and decided to repeat the formula for his next film. Both have very dark and dry senses of humor, a lot of bad guys (nothing but bad guys), bad language and crude material all wrapped up in an incredibly stylish package. You like one film, you'll like the other. You hate one, you'll hate the other.This film is about several groups of idiot criminals who all converge. There are the incredibly stupid and burn-out drug dealers, the tough guys who plan to rob them AND a third group that plans to rob the second group once they've committed the robbery. In addition, you have some super-scary baddies--super-scary indeed. Who will survive with all these guns, knives and swords being wielded? And, speaking of guns, two of the shotguns used in the robbery MIGHT just be worth more than all the stuff they steal--but the dummies don't even realize it.This film is, above all else, very stylish and weird. The criminals DEFINITELY have odd and quirky personalities but more importantly, the camera-work and edits are very well done--very innovative and they get your attention. It's all very well worth seeing but it's also NOT a film for everyone. Of course, you shouldn't let your kids, your mother or Father Jenkins watch it. But to enjoy it yourself you need a very high threshold for this sort of thing. It certainly AIN'T rated G! However, despite the very harsh language and very adult subject matter, Richie actually doesn't show that much of the violence. It happens--but mostly off-camera.By the way, of the two similar films, I slightly prefer 'Snatch' simply because it tried harder to be overtly funny--though the nihilistic ending in 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' was priceless. Also, as I watched the film and heard a bazillion bullets being discharged, it's interesting that no police EVER responded to any of the locations!",9,2,4,30 January 2014
Les Misérables," It's good....the play is just better.
","The movie version of 'Les Misérables' is a hard sell to me, as I was simply blown away when I saw the play in London. I sat in the second row, center, and it just doesn't get any better than that. To this day, it's one of the best plays I have seen--and I have been to Broadway on quite a few occasions and seen many top plays. I am pretty sure that your reaction will depend, in part, on whether you've seen the play. It also didn't help with me that I've seen about a half dozen non-musical versions of the story--including the excellent 1930s French picture.Apart from it simply being better in person, this style musical (without traditional lyrics and choruses you will find yourself singing later), is a hard sell to the public in general. It just doesn't work as well on film, as it loses the spectacle and emotional impact. So am I saying the film is bad? Nah. It just isn't as good--despite some very good acting, decent singing (while some reported that Russell Crowe was weak, I thought his voice just fine), lovely sets and some eye-popping cinematography. It IS a good film. I particularly liked Sacha Baron Cohen's song and dance number (get a load of the cat's tail!) but everyone seemed to try quite hard to make this film well.While I could say more, I noticed that there are almost 700 reviews for this film, so I'll wrap it up and recommend the film mildly.",8,4,9,21 April 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The first half was terrific...the last half, not so much!
","At this point, this film has made nearly $400,000,000 domestically and had nearly 800 reviews. Needless to say, it's a hit and my review sure ain't gonna change that! But, I did just see the film and with my compulsive need to be IMDb's most prolific reviewer, I decided to contribute yet another review.The fist portion of 'Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2' impressed me. In particular, I found myself laughing very often at Drax (Dave Bautista), as he was hilarious and often said the most horrible and inappropriate things. He was, to me, the best thing about the film. As for the rest, it was just fine until about midway through the movie. Then, the plot and what happened after that didn't make a lot of sense (such as multiple baddies suddenly becoming good guys/gals) and instead the picture solely focused on insanely big and explosive special effects. It's as if they were telling you to turn off your brain and enjoy the rest of the film on a very primal level. As for me, I didn't wanna turn off my brain and thought the second half of the film was a HUGE disappointment. The first portion, I'd give an 8 or 9...I really liked it. The second, I'd give a 2 or 3....I really hated it. Overall, 6 seems fair.",6,1,7,10 October 2017
Titanic," My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!
","'Titanic' won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, 'Avatar'. Well worth seeing once.",9,3,7,30 March 2013
Thor," It will blow you away.....unless you are dead!
","I had very low expectations for this movie when my daughter dragged me to the 12:01am showing of 'Thor' on opening night here in the States. After all, I've never read the comic and there didn't seem to be all that much publicity concerning this film--and I just thought it would be one of Marvel's lesser films. However, when the film began I was absolutely blown away. It had to be the most beautiful and mind-blowing superhero film ever--with gorgeous visuals of other worlds that even sci-fi films haven't come close to matching. And, combined with nice 3-D effects and an exceptional score, you just turn off your brain and absorb it all--like some sort of mind-altering drug! And speaking of the score, while the 'Iron Man' soundtracks were great (with LOTS of great AC/DC tunes among others), 'Thor' chose instead to mostly use original compositions--and they were gorgeous.Fortunately, in addition to the gorgeous visuals and music, the film had a very good story, nice acting and great direction--by none other than Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh). I also admire the script--it had a lot of excitement and occasional humor that made the film more than just an action film crammed with amazing stunts. Well done--and hopefully the film will catch on--it deserves to do very, very well. I'd say this one was about on par with 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight' in quality and entertainment value--proving that even film snobs like me can enjoy some good escapist entertainment now and again.By the way, I did have one complaint about the film. It had among the most obvious and annoying product placement I've ever seen. I got absolutely sick of seeing 7-11, Southwest Airline and Kashi crammed onto the screen. Could Paramount Studio do any worse to whore out this film?! For shame, as the film was terrific but was cheapened a bit by this crass corporate decision. Oh well, at least they weren't paid to place laxatives or hemorrhoid creams in the film!",8,2,8,5 May 2011
Three Colors: Blue," despite its being depressing, hang on--it does have a good payoff at the conclusion
","I think in general my tolerance for super-depressing films is less than some film connoisseurs. I have found that some films (such as some of Bergman's) are too depressing to merit the high praise they receive. It's almost like to be considered a sophisticated, you have to love depressing and occasionally pointless films. I began to feel this way towards this film early on--thinking to myself 'oh, no,...another dreadfully depressing art film'. However, I was VERY pleased when despite the incredibly somber pacing, music and plot, the movie did not remained mired in misery and showed growth and change--and NOT in an overly idealistic or Hollywood way, either. Instead, the depression and existence of the lead, Binoche, seemed very real and I think this is the best of her films I have seen. In fact, I was a bit hesitant to watch the movie, as I was NOT a fan of two of her most famous films, The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. These two films were also quite depressing and cold, but the movie Blue seemed to engage me more--perhaps because I could easily see myself or someone I love in Binoche's position following the deaths of her family.At first, she decides the best way to cope is complete denial and repression--forget about the past by extinguishing all memories--including selling all her possessions and running from her past life. However, despite her best efforts, she finds herself unable to completely keep out the past and is forced to deal with her husband's legacy (though the movie makes a mistake not to really address the death of Binoche's child very well).For psychology students, this movie is an excellent example of defense mechanisms (Freud) or the grieving process (Elizabeth Kübler-Ross).",8,7,13,13 July 2005
Castle in the Sky," Amazing quality animation, a very unusual story and a whole lotta fun
","This is a really interesting movie that bears some resemblance to another great Miyazaki film, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Like KIKI, the action takes place on some Earth-like world--so much like Earth but different because it had the weirdest flying machines and sky pirates! It was also rather reminiscent of the Dreamcast video game, The Skies of Arcadia. and the X-Box's Crimson Skies. Strange but also pretty intriguing--that's for sure. For fans of airplanes and vintage aviation, this is an especially appealing film.Well, in this world of sky pirates and bizarre flying machines comes the rumor of a floating castle in the sky. And, of course, our intrepid heroes are bent on finding it and unlocking its secrets.The film has amazing animation, a unique style and is very engaging. While kids will enjoy it immensely, unlike some Miyazaki films, I really think that in some cases adults might like this even more than kids. Good stuff well worth a look.",8,4,5,11 June 2007
The Shape of Water," Cat lovers probably wanna skip this one!
","'The Shape of Water' is a film that is not for everyone. First, I must warn any die-hard cat lovers NOT to watch the movie, as there's a very explicit scene where a cat has its head bitten off! Second, if nudity bothers you, please find another picture to watch, as there is significant nudity...much of it full frontal nudity...and more than you'd typically see in a rate-R picture. This is not so much a complaint...more something the viewer should be aware of before they try watching the story.The story itself is a very dark and rather nasty tale about an amphibious creature who has somehow been captured by the US government. Instead of trying to communicate with it, the guy in charge mostly tortures it and plans on having it dissected. At the same time, Soviet spies want to kill it because somehow they think he's a potential weapon to be used against them(??). However, a mute and sexually frustrated cleaning lady falls for the creature and decides, with the help of her gay friend, to rescue the 'thing'.So did I like it? Not especially. Although I love how unusual and creative the film was, so much of it was filled with nasty and awful characters (something Guillermo Del Toro loves, I know)...but too nasty for my taste. In other words, the guy playing the boss was almost cartoonish in the way he was written....and instead of seeing him as a villain, he seemed a bit more like Boris from 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'! Strange but not especially enjoyable...and I am feeling a bit tired of the director's overwhelming need to show such extreme and realistic violence. And so, as is too often the case, I wonder how a movie in recent years received the Best Picture Oscar when it's not enjoyable to watch.
FYI--A decent Florida Key Lime Pie is NOT fluorescent green like it was in the movie. I assume the director used this color as a commentary on the era and the way colored dyes were more the norm...especially since he also chose to have green Jello in another scene.Also, while the lead was played by a woman who was hearing and learned a few signs in order to communicate in the movie, it seems like a lost opportunity not to have a deaf actress play the part. It's odd that Hollywood often talks about causes and inclusion but also often misses opportunities like this.",6,13,32,8 April 2018
The Untouchables," fun to watch but fatally flawed
","This movie was exciting and I could easily see the average viewer being impressed by it. Provided you only view it as ENTERTAINMENT and not history, you'll be fine. For its value as history, it is far less realistic than an episode of Mr. Peabody and Sherman (as he uses his WayBack Machine on the Bullwinkle Show to visit the past). Although Elliot Ness was a fine person, he was NOT responsible for the arrest or conviction of Al Capone. Sorry, it just didn't happen that way. Also, although it DID provide some realistic violence, the baseball bat scene with Capone was incredibly brutal and cannot be corroborated. Plus, some kids seeing this might just need an extensive round of therapy as a result. I guess this isn't a surprise, though, coming from the ultra-violent Brian DePalma. He is, apparently, a great genius as a director, though I am incredibly concerned what sort of spiritual cancer he has planted within all of us with his insistence on horrific violence. He and others like him will defend their right to free speech, but I can't help but feel a little dirty after watching his films.",5,9,24,17 August 2005
The Disaster Artist," A one-joke film.
","Back in 1994, Tim Burton made one of his very best movies....'Ed Wood'. Wood was a bio-pic about one of the worst film directors in movie history...and the film was terrific. Now, 23 years later, James Franco has made another film about a bad movie auteur, Tommy Wiseau...the writer, director and star of 'The Room'. 'The Room' is such a terrible film that it's become a bit of a cult hit and theaters have shown it on and off for years. However, 'The Disaster Artist' is not the same sort of film 'Ed Wood' was for one very important reason....Wiseau seems to be a complete narcissist with antisocial tendencies and Ed Wood was a nice guy.'The Disaster Artist' is mostly about Wiseau's work in creating 'The Room' and is less a bio-pic. Through the course of the film, you see that Wiseau is 100% clueless about everything...a man who is painfully lacking self-awareness. He's a complete narcissist who thinks his ability is limitless...and folks around him really don't matter as it's all about him. As a result, you naturally dislike Wiseau...which makes the film much tougher to enjoy than 'Ed Wood'. And, a movie about an untalented guy who is unlikable is tough to watch after a while, as it's pretty much a one-joke film. It's not bad....but I don't think it lived up to the hype because of Wiseau. As for James Franco, he did a great job in playing Wiseau....and I can respect this and the work he put into making 'The Disaster Artist'.By the way, Wiseau's cluelessness was pretty obvious at the Golden Globes when he charged up to the stage...as if he was a great filmmaker and not the butt of most folks' jokes. I am still not sure if he realizes that 'The Disaster Artist' is NOT a positive portrait of this very strange man.",6,5,10,28 March 2018
Mystic River," Unpleasant to watch...but with some amazing acting.
","The film begins many years ago and shows three friends, Dave, Jimmy and Sean outside their homes in Boston. Some pedophiles arrive and pretend to be cops and they kidnap and rape Dave...who, fortunately, is able to eventually escape.Years pass and the three men are grown. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a family man whose youngest is about to take her first communion. However, he and the family don't realize that his oldest has been brutally murdered. When he learns of this, he vows revenge.At about the same time, Dave (Tim Robbins) returns home very late. He's bloody and cut...and his story about attacking a mugger seems contrived. There also is a boyfriend of the dead girl...and he has some 'splaining to do. And, there are a couple detectives who are investigating all this and one of them is Sean (Kevin Bacon). What really did happen? Who really is at fault? And, will the police get to them before Jimmy and his thug friends?'Mystic River' is occasionally tough to watch, as it deals with child sexual abuse, murder and extreme violence. It's also quite grim. Because of this, you should consider all this before watching the film. This being said, it is a very good film and features some amazing acting...so if you're up to it, by all means give the film a look. I appreciate not only the acting but all the false leads and clues...and the viewer will not so easily piece it all together.",9,3,4,30 August 2017
Zombieland," The epitome of 'turn off your brain and enjoy'.
","This is NOT a film that will be up for any awards this year (except for maybe those from Fangoria), as it is not an art or prestige movie--nor is it something you'll likely see in the Criterion Collection! No, this film is about as far from this sort of movie as you can get, as it's a 'turn off your brain and enjoy' film--one you can't think too much about but there is still something about it you'll probably like. I say PROBABLY because if you can't stand gore or profuse swearing, then go no further--this is clearly a film to avoid. But, provided you have a relatively high tolerance for this sort of thing, it's a good bet to see--in particular if you've seen and enjoyed 'Sean of the Dead'. While 'Sean' is a better film, it's roughly along the same lines--an irreverent comedy about zombie-killers!What is particularly good about this film is the dialog and characters as they seem very out of place and just plain strange. One (the narrator) is a total geek, one a maniac who, on some level, actually seems to be ENJOYING the zombie outbreak (Woody Harrelson)! These two later stumble upon the most unlikely pair of girls--an 18-or so year old and her 12 year-old sister. I say unlikely because they repeatedly get the upper hand on the two men and prove that brains, not just brawn and a desire to kill, are what counts. As for the rest of the film, it's mostly mindless violence, action and laughs. Now there is a very special moment around the middle of the film when the quartet meet a new friend. This is GREAT but I don't want to say more as it would spoil the surprise.Mindless, crazy and worth seeing. This is a great one to rent or watch on cable, but it probably isn't good enough to merit adding it to your DVD collection--but you be the judge of that. Surprisingly good.",8,3,7,4 July 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Very good and very overrated
","This is a very good movie. Period. A 'classic', I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.",8,12,31,26 May 2005
Enemy at the Gates," smart, gritty and fascinating
","I had never heard about this movie when I first saw it on television, so I really had no idea what to expect. If the movie hadn't captured my interest, I'm sure I would have changed the channel after just a few minutes. However, the sheer intensity of the opening segment where hundreds of Russian soldiers were literally thrown into the German lines practically unarmed (and with 'political officers' behind them threatening to shoot them if they slowed at all in their advance) fascinated me. In fact, I remember barely breathing and feeling VERY tense during this segment--now that's great film making! The scene slows after nearly all these Russian troops are needlessly wasted. Remaining alive in a bunker is a political officer (Joseph Fiennes--the KGB man who enforces Stalin's mad directives and insures proper communist thinking among the soldiers) and a common soldier (Jude Law). They are pinned down and seemingly about to die. Fiennes is about to take a chance at attacking a group of five Germans--hoping to take them by surprise. He's obviously nervous and, as a political officer, probably useless when it comes to actual fighting. He asks Law if he can shot. 'A little' is his reply--and he takes the gun. Then, like a shadow, he methodically kills all five Germans--timing his shots with incoming artillery rounds to cover the gunshots. Fiennes is absolutely amazed with the marksmanship and from then on, makes Law's character a hero of the Great Patriotic Struggle.All this occurs in the first half hour of the film. Where it goes from there and the showdown with Law and Ed Harris is something not to be missed. This is probably the most tension-filled and realistic war film I have ever seen. Great job done by all.",10,3,6,4 July 2005
A Beautiful Mind," Moving but overrated...
","'A Beautiful Mind' is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash's mental illness--something he's struggled with for many years.I enjoyed 'A Beautiful Mind'. It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it's SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man's life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe's accent. I don't know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.",8,9,13,11 July 2011
The Departed," It could make a psychiatrist's head explode!
","I realize that 'The Departed' won four Oscars (one for Best Picture and one for Best Director and one for writing). I know that it has a HUGE overall rating on IMDb. I know it's a very popular movie. BUT, the film simply didn't do its homework when it comes to some of the characters. And, because of this, I was not especially impressed by the film. Now before you slam my review with another NOT HELPFUL, hear me out....Had the writers cared about consistency and believability, they would have cared about the only major female character in the film. However, she was a caricature--a lady with zero believability...NONE. While it's true that films often get psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors wrong, this is among the very worst cases. While she's described as a counselor, she prescribes medications (that's illegal by the way--only an MD can do that). And, personal boundaries mean absolutely nothing to her...nothing. Here we have yet another case where a supposed professional begins sleeping with one of her patients--and one of the most screwed up ones at that! There is no reason to believe this relationship--there is no chemistry and he clearly is a mess...so she sleeps with him!! Why can't a film show a mental health worker who isn't crazy? Does some Tom Cruise write all the roles for psychotherapists in movies?! How can anyone believe her character in any way?! How does this bad writing get rewarded with all these Oscars? To me, an Oscar implies perfection...or at least near perfection...and this is not it.By the way, since I am on a tirade, I am also irritated that the main baddie is called 'Frank Costello' (Jack Nicholson). Why pick this name since the real life Costello was a HUGE figure in the underworld and bore little semblance to the guy in the film (who is more like Whitey Bulger, by the way)? What not give him some totally fictional name? Why, if he's so much like Bulger, does his fate have nothing to do with Bulger's? I don't get it.Now I am NOT saying it's a terrible film or I hate it. It's just flawed. So, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful performance and a taut script, it is a film that didn't really seem good enough to have received all these accolades.",7,7,15,15 March 2012
Rosemary's Baby," One of the great chilling films of the 1960s
","When I was a very young child (probably 4 or 5), my parents took my brother and me to the drive-in to see this film! Looking back, this was NOT a good plan, as ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most chilling films of the 1960s and probably warped me for life! Many years later, I finally got to see the entire film. That's because when I was a kid, I hid my face during so much of the film--especially when they talked about a child of Satan--just the sort of thing to freak out a little boy or girl!! And WOW was I glad I finally got to see this one, as it wasn't nearly as scary as I'd thought and it was also an exceptionally well-written and chilling film.Mia farrow and her husband, John Cassavetes, move into a strange apartment building due to the oddball residents. Some are quite welcoming and sweet and others seem like extras from the movie ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST! The more weirdness that occurs, the more Rosemary worries about staying there. A bit later, she has a weird but super-realistic dream where she's raped. Oddly, a short time later, Rosemary discovers she's pregnant! From here on, it's one wild and scary ride--with some wonderful twists and surprises that kept me on the edge of my seat.Usually, I avoid devil movies. Partly this could be because of my Baptist upbringing and partly because I think many of these films are just silly. However, this one is far from silly--being exceptionally well-written, suspenseful and designed for intelligent viewers instead of dull-witted thrill-seekers. Great direction, music, acting, etc.--this film has them all.",10,4,15,1 March 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," A very good film but oddly it didn't really hold my interest.
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is a very funny film. This is because the far Hollywood left condemned it for condoning torture and the far right (and CIA) condemned it because it seemed to indicate torture was often used when it wasn't--and odd case where both extremes seemed, in an odd way, to be in agreement! As for me, I wanted to see it simply because Asner and others DIDN'T want me to see the film and the more they complained, the more I felt it would be worth while. That, and the fact that it was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar guaranteed that sooner or later I'd see 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Despite this, however, I really wasn't all that anxious to watch the picture and didn't love watching it. Why? Because I know in general what happened and none of it really came as a surprise--and so it was all very anticlimactic.Despite not adoring the film, it was pretty much what I expected from director Kathryn Bigelow--a very competently made film that seems almost documentary-like and with many lesser-known actors. She did a great job with 'Hurt Locker' and once again she did a fine job with this movie. I would say more but frankly by this time (well after the Oscars), there have already been a bazillion reviews and I doubt if I would add more.By the way, did any of you feel a bit odd seeing Chris Pratt (Andy from 'Parks and Recreation') in the film? After seeing him in this other role, seeing him with the Seal Team was odd to say the least!",8,3,8,1 May 2013
Crazy Heart," Bridges is THE movie.
","This movie is similar in many ways to 'Tender Mercies' and it is interesting that Robert Duvall appears in each. However, in 'Crazy Heart', Jeff Bridges plays the lead and unlike Duvall's character in 'Tender Mercies', Bridges character is an alcoholic in the midst of a long decline--not a man trying to pick up the pieces like Duvall did in this earlier performance. So, in some ways, it's like looking at Duvall's character a bit before the story begins in 'Tender Mercies'. Both characters are alcoholic country singers and both leave behind a lot of messed up lives and hope to somehow rebuild theirs. But Bridges isn't yet ready to give up the booze and smoking--and it's slowly killing him. Can Bridges see the light and get his career and private like back--or is it too late? Jeff Bridges received the Oscar for Best Actor for this performance and I can see why. Part of it is because he sang his own music--it wasn't dubbed. And, it sounded a lot like Waylon Jennings--quite good in a raspy sort of way. Part of it was because Bridges just did a darn good job playing a likable but pathetic drunk. The following year, he also went on to a nice performance in the remake of 'True Grit'--showing that in his older years, Bridges is actually doing some of his very best work. Well worth seeing--an excellent character study in every respect.By the way, I really, really liked the way this film ended. Instead of going for the easy, clichéd Hollywood ending, they chose to wrap it up extremely well and realistically. See the film--see what I mean.",9,3,4,15 January 2012
Hercules," It all depends on your perspective,...
","Whether or not you like this movie really depends on your perspective. For the casual viewer, it's an entertaining film, though few would place it among Disney's best. For obsessive history teachers like myself, the film is so problematic that enjoying the film is next to impossible, as the film bears very little similarity to the Hercules myths. In fact, when the film debuted, I remember hearing about protests in Greece because many felt that Disney's 'fast and loose' attitude towards the source material was cultural offensive. I can understand and appreciate this, though frankly, sometimes I wish I weren't as well-versed with history and could just turn off my brain and enjoy the film from a completely mindless perspective. Sorry, but if historical accuracy means anything stay away,...but at least the films are better than the Steve Reeves films or the god-awful Trans-lux cartoons of the 1960s!",6,1,5,10 June 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," Probably the greatest war film ever made
","The film begins in a classroom. Outside, martial music is blaring and the professor inside the room is lecturing the boys about their duty to the Fatherland and encouraging them all to as a group in the German army at the outbreak of WWI. The film is exceptional in how it captures the enthusiasm and naiveté of the boys--as they imagine glory awaiting them after they enlist! Even in boot camp, the mood is light and the new recruits are excited about seeing their first action. This perfectly sets the stage for the actual war--not the sanitized or 'fun' war of many films but the hellish and pointless mess that was WWI. The rest of the film is brutally honest and harsh and shows how the students die off one-by-one and the remaining students become more and more jaded and emotionally dead due to the fighting.I love this film and strongly recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a film buff. Part of my love of the film is because it was made relatively shortly after the war and the uniforms, trucks, etc. all appear correct for the period. Many years later, a made for TV version of this film appeared with Ernest Borgnine and Richard Thomas. It, too, was excellent but also was perhaps a bit too polished and pretty--lacking some of the grit of the original. Great acting, direction and production all made this original THE best of the anti-war films of the 1920s and 30s.Other similar great movies I strongly recommend are J'ACCUSE (French), WESTFRONT 1918 (German), THE BIG PARADE (USA--silent) and THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK (USA). All excel at portraying war in a truthful and non-glamorized manner--it's just a shame that their impact of the world as a whole was negligible--particularly in Germany--where Fascism would soon replace the anti-war sentiment of the book ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In fact, his books and this film were banned once the Nazis came to power just a few years later.",10,33,39,7 February 2007
Love Actually," This is a great film to watch with a box of Kleenex
","This film is an odd one in my household. Although my wife is a rather famous romance writer, for once I actually liked a romantic film more than her. I think the reason for our divergent views is that in most romance novels, all the nice people get the love of their lives by the end of the film. However, in LOVE ACTUALLY, some do but others do not. So, if you need to have a romance where everything works out perfectly, this is NOT the film for you. However, if you are like me and don't mind a bit of ambiguity about the characters, then you are sure to love this film.This story is a complicated film where there are many different stories occurring at the same time just before Christmas. What ties this all together is that the various stories all relate to each other somehow. In other words, this film is about people and their friends also have separate stories that diverge. I rarely have seen this type of film work so well.I could spend a lot of time talking about all the plots but I won't bother. Part of this is because there isn't enough space here to adequately do it and part of it is because there are tons and tons of very thorough reviews already on IMDb for this film, so I don't want to plow familiar ground. Read these longer reviews if you are interested in a play-by-play analysis.Instead, understand that some of the romances work out perfectly, others are uncertain and others are heart-breakers--just like in real life. In fact, that's the beauty of this film. While you really can't believe all the plots (some are very, very far-fetched and silly), all the people talk like real people. And the romances are just so adorable and sweet you can't watch this film and keep a dry eye. Plus, in the cases where the romance fails, I liked them as well because they all had wonderful object lessons for us all.Amazingly acted, directed and written--this is one case where a popular film actually deserves all the hoopla. In the UK it's sold like a bazillion DVDs and I can see why.By the way, there were only two things about the film I did not particularly like. First, the Prime Minister's love interest (Natalie) was a lovely woman but repeatedly throughout the film they made fat jokes about her. This made no sense, as she was gorgeous and the comments tended to reinforce the stereotype that a beautiful woman must be stick-thin--like Keira Knightley. Even if she was overweight, which she wasn't, this is gross to say and the film made it seem cute or funny to do so (not just with her but with a Portuguese lady as well). She was curvy and even if these gross comments were true, women are supposed to have curves and not be anorexic!! Second, the scene where the little boy runs through security really, really annoyed me. In reality, the kid would have either been shot or arrested and the airport would have been shut down--yet the movie shows no consequences for this insanely stupid and selfish behavior. Neither problem ruined the film but they did detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant movie.",8,1,6,21 December 2008
12 Years a Slave," Among the better films of 2013
","'12 Years a Slave' is an unusual story about slavery and its evils because unlike most films, this one is based on the true story of a black man who was free but was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the early-mid 19th century. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was a happy man--with a wife and kids. However, once kidnapped, as the title suggests, he disappeared for 12 years and was treated brutally. The film shows his MANY trials--including beatings, attempted hangings and witnessing rapes and other atrocities.The Oscar winners will be announced tomorrow and there is a lot of buzz for '12 Years a Slave' as well as 'Gravity'. I saw both in the last two days and would easily pick 'Gravity'. Now this is NOT because I think '12 Years a Slave' is a bad film. No, it's quite good. However, it's also a rather straight-forward narrative punctuated by many scenes of brutality--and not all that different from films such as 'The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman', 'Roots' or 'Amistad'. It's all very sad but doesn't really break much new ground. Whereas the entire production of 'Gravity' is unlike anything ever made before--and has a completely unique and breathtaking space adventure that looks and feels as if you are there. To me, this makes 'Gravity' my pick--though both are very good films.By the way, I mentioned the brutality in '12 Years a Slave'. All of it was very appropriate to include in the film but it's simply too rough for kids. Think twice before you allow younger viewers to watch it or, better yet, watch it with them.",8,6,18,1 March 2014
There Will Be Blood," The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is superb.
","Before I began watching this film, I read through the IMDb trivia for 'There Will Be Blood'. It mentioned that Daniel Day-Lewis got inspiration for his role by listening to recordings of John Huston's voice. Well, it's pretty amazing, as his voice DID sound just like him--and it's a bit weird. His acting throughout the film is exceptional--and I can see why he earned an Oscar for this performance.Despite this and despite this being a quality film, it's also an incredibly oppressive and dark film---and I am sure it will NOT appeal to everyone. The plot is just unrelentingly nasty and the final portion where the film appears to have a strongly anti-religious bent will alienate people. However, at the same time, it impressed many--and is currently a very highly rated film on IMDb.Day-Lewis plays a misanthropic jerk--one of the cruelest and nastiest in film history. He makes Ebenezer Scrooge look like a pussycat--and late in the film it becomes apparent that he not only hates everyone and is evil but he's also a sociopathic killer. This ending appears to come from out of no where...and once again is bound to alienate more than a few people.Overall, the film is a masterful performance by Day-Lewis and the film has many fine moments. I was also impressed that the latter portions of the film actually used real deaf folks using real sign language (this is not always the case in films)--and they were quite easy to understand if you know the language. Oddly, however, when I watched this movie on cable, it was NOT closed captioned!! I assume the DVD did have captions. Turnoffs would include pretty much the entire last 10 minutes of the movie. It just seemed too foul--too dark. And, I felt a bit cheated, as I'd spent so much time on the film and had enjoyed it up until then.",7,7,15,18 November 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," Hmmm,...what hasn't already been said about this film?
","While occasionally my reviews go on and on and on, this one simply doesn't need to be exhaustive, as so much has already been said about this film and it has received so many accolades. Most everyone knows that this film is a classic and it deserves a fine reputation--particularly for the fine acting and writing as well as its social impact.Peck plays a small town lawyer who has been assigned to defend a Black man who has been accused of raping a White woman--a pretty tough subject for an American film of the era. The defense of this man and the town's prejudice is all seen through the eyes his children--making this film an excellent one to show children, though its appeal is universal (unless you are an avowed racist, I guess).Peck was one of the greatest actors of his age and perhaps apart from 12 O'CLOCK HIGH and possibly the underrated BIG COUNTRY, this was his greatest film role. See this and see him at his best.",10,1,6,6 July 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," an exceptional war film with only one minor flaw
","I saw this film as a kid and wasn't particularly impressed. Considering just how long it had been, I decided to give it another chance. And, fortunately, I was rewarded by finding the film far better than I remembered.The movie is apparently based on real-life characters, though exactly how close to the real ones I am real uncertain. And this brings me to a problem with the film. Sessue Hayakawa played an incredibly reasonable Japanese prison commandant. Apparently the real Colonel he played was indeed an atypical man--most Japanese officers in a similar situation would have most likely just killed Alec Guinness and the other officers who refused his orders. I could, begrudgingly, accept this. But, when this tough Japanese soldier is seen CRYING in his hut, this just seemed ridiculous and almost impossible to believe.Okay, now apart from that, the movie was great. William Holden was essentially the same character he played in Stalag 17--almost like a close in fact of the same opportunistic 'hero'. I liked this as a counter-point to the usual tough-guy hero in movies.As for Guinness, he plays an excellent, but very odd British officer who is a great example of an Obsessive-Compulsive nut! He is so bent on maintaining self-control and a 'stiff upper lip' that he completely loses sight of the war and the fact that the Japanese are the enemy! He and Holden both are amazing psychological portraits.Other than the acting, the cinematography and music were excellent. A very odd and atypical war film that is worth your time.",9,6,14,12 April 2006
A Hard Day's Night," Well, it's certainly no 'Give My Regards to Broad Street'...thank God!
","In the 1980s, Paul McCartney made a film that was obviously inspired by 'A Hard Day's Night'. However similar in structure, 'Give My Regards to Broad Street' was clearly NOT the same quality movie. So, if you saw this much later film and assumed 'A Hard Day's Night' is also a boring, bloated and enormously long-winded music video, think twice! Despite having practically no plot and TONS of Beatles songs strung together instead of a story, there is something likable about 'A Hard Day's Night' and it gives you the next best thing to a backstage pass to meet them--albeit heavily scripted and plasticized.The plot, for what it is, is a visit to the hectic life of the Beatles--making it not much of a stretch for the boys. And they essentially play the public roles each played--Paul was the sweet and nice one, John the clever smart-aleck, George the quiet one and Ringo the goofy one. Whether this is exactly as they really were is pretty doubtful, but they did play the parts the public expected and loved. The film includes them being chased by fans (A LOT), riding trains, making eyes at girls, cracking jokes and singing. Along for the ride is the somewhat irrelevant 'grandfather' of Paul--who was actually actor Wilfrid Brambell from 'Steptoe and Son' (a precursor to 'Sanford and Son' in America). He mostly just sits there and looks serious or chases young women. In the MANY times when the film breaks into seemingly spontaneous music videos, he mostly sits there and looks bewildered. I am sure back in 1964, anyone in the theater older than, say, 35, looked pretty much the same way!! As I said, the plot is VERY thin and mostly it's just a chance to pretend to see the Beatles as they are in real life (sure) and hear a lot of their songs...LOTS. In fact, it seems like the songs often take the place of plot. Now this would suck if it was, say, the Bay City Rollers,The Ohio Express or The Starland Vocal Band. But, considering almost every song is among the group's best, it's hard to hate the lack of plot--unless you are a crazy young whippersnapper who hates the Fab Four! As for me, I found the film very forgettable but fun...with nice tunes. I did NOT see it as brilliant cinema and cannot understand all the votes of 10--which, to me, seem more like votes on how much they like the Beatles instead of the overall merits of a film. That's because it just didn't seem like a movie--more like an extended advertisement for the group in order to satisfy their insanely devoted fans and convert others to the cult! And, in that sense, it is a successful film---but oddness in style and the group not taking themselves too seriously don't, to me, make it a great film. Many of their jokes fall flat, the songs seem about as spontaneous as a moon landing and the lack of structure make it a niche film. A must-see? Well, if you love the Beatles, yes. Otherwise, just a strange and occasionally humorous 'anti-film' that tries hard NOT to be a movie.By the way, not matter how kooky the Beatles may or may not have been, who wears a hat and underwear in the bathtub, shaves a mirror or draws on TV monitors?! Also, watch Ringo when he plays the drums. Often his motions aren't even close to him really playing the drums and the sticks often don't come close to touching the drums!",6,3,6,15 June 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A wonderful film
","Before I discuss this exceptional film, I need to point out that there is a lot of truth to this film if you are looking for what it was like in psychiatric hospitals in the 1950s and into the 60s. The hellish practices and dehumanization was definitely true of many facilities during this era. However, today, many of the horrific abuses are no longer relevant. So, while some will point to this film as proof that psychiatry in general is evil personified (such as the Scientologists), for the most part, this isn't the case today. Shock treatment is rarely done today and when it is, it's nothing like it is portrayed in the film and it actually has therapeutic value when all else fails. Lobotomies are also thankfully a thing of the past. So, while debating the pros and cons of hospitalization and medications is reasonable today, don't assume the film is in any way like psychiatric institutions today--many of which have been closed or severely reduced in size as well as the length of stay of the average patient.The film begins with a cocky sociopathic criminal, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), being sent to a psychiatric hospital from prison. It seems McMurphy thinks that by 'playing crazy' he'll have an easier time and shorter stay in a hospital instead of prison. However, over time, he comes to see that a mental hospital is a pretty sick place--particularly when it comes to the crazy staff who run the place. McMurphy responds to this system by constantly fighting it and trying to subvert their needless rules and control. Some of this is very funny (such as the fishing trip) and you can understand why he would fight the oppressive ways of the hospital. In the end, however, the system ultimately crushes him like so many others. The conclusion is certainly something you won't forget!Although Jack Nicholson was great in the film as were the rest of the ensemble cast, the star in the film was Louise Fletcher. She played the coldest and most awful nurse in the history of film. Her tough performance truly made the film. Otherwise, if she hadn't been so utterly devoid of humanity, the film just wouldn't have worked. Oddly, the film's producers had a hard time accepting her for the job--and she was the last one cast in the film.Exceptional in every way--the writing, acting and direction. The only reservation I have regards the misuse of the film by anti-psychiatry groups. However, I am glad the film was made as the abuses of the industry need to be understood and not forgotten.",10,13,21,6 March 2009
Pitch Perfect 2," 'This is what happens when you send girls to college....'
","I was quite shocked when I saw and enjoyed 'Pitch Perfect'. After all, I am in my 50s and not exactly the demographic they were going for in the film. So, because of this, I then decided to try 'Pitch Perfect II'...and I did enjoy the film, though not quite as much as the first film. Much of it was due to Jessica Kendrick's character...who just didn't seem anything like the sweet lady from the first movie.The film begins with the a capella group at the very top of the world. They are performing on television at the Kennedy Center for the President! However, due to a horrific wardrobe malfunction, the group goes from the darlings of America to hated jerks. The film is about how the girls somehow manage to overcome this AND take on the dreaded German group, DSM at the international championship in Copenhagen.The best thing about the film was also a big plus in the first movie--the inane commentary by the two announcers (Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgens)...especially Higgens. As for Banks, it wasn't like she was a slouch, as she also directed and co-produced the movie! I also enjoyed seeing many of the familiar characters from the other films...aside from Kendricks', who seemed inexplicably self-centered and grouchy. For this reason alone, I think the original is a tad better....but they are both still very watchable.",6,0,1,20 June 2017
Downfall," Very important historically but not for the faint of heart
","This film is based on the experiences of Hitler's secretary as well as other survivors of the bunker during the final days of Nazi Germany. It follows these people (with a strong emphasis on Hitler through the first 80% of the film) and excels at its historical accuracy. Unlike some of the other Hitler biopics (such as the ones starring Richard Basehart and Alec Guinness), this one shows an odd and 3-dimensional man--screaming and irrational one moment yet rather kind and likable the next. If Hitler had ONLY been a screaming madman (as he's generally shown) no one would have followed him and he never would have led Nazi Germany. Here he is much more believable and the writer, director and actor (Bruno Ganz) all created the best screen Hitler to date. The film is a history teacher's dream come true, as the film sure makes you THINK it's being filmed in Berlin during the final days. The look of the bombed out and burned out city is amazing, the bunker sure looks like what the real bunker would have looked like, the uniforms, weapons, cars, etc. all look as they should.I have only one reservation about this incredibly well made film and that is although the film often sanitized the violence here and there, other times it's up close and personal and overwhelming. For example, many times folks blow their brains out with pistols. You often only hear it and you might see a brief look at the corpse. But, other times, with little warning, someone whips out their pistol and blows a hole through their head...and you see all of it. And, the death of the Goebbels children is heart-wrenching to watch. There also are the scenes involving amputations that are hard to watch. So, while I applaud the film for accuracy, it it NOT for small children or anyone who isn't prepared to see exactly how it was...blood and all. Overall, incredibly compelling and a film that's among the best the Germans have ever made. Ironically, Ganz played Hitler in this one and his other super-famous film was WINGS OF DESIRE in which he played an angel!!",10,3,7,13 March 2015
Whiplash," This is review #572....so is there really any need to say more?!
","'Whiplash' is a terrific film...no doubt about that. Normally, I'd spend several paragraphs talking about how great it is except that I am the 572nd review and many people have already gone on and on about what a terrific film it is....so what can I add?! It's the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all! J.K. Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film, he dominated every moment he was on the screen. Was he a likable guy? No way..but he was mesmerizing. Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film. It's among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega-million dollar special effects--it just had terrific acting, writing and direction. See this film and see how a quality film is crafted. 'Nuff said...",9,4,10,18 July 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Super crude and nasty....so is it worth watching?
","Back when 'THe Wolf of Wall Street' debuted, I had very little interest in watching it. After all, it was infamous for being crude and nasty. Well, tonight I have to stay awake and I found nothing else on demand I wanted to see...so I gave it a try. After seeing it, it WAS indeed sleazy, crude and nasty from start to finish and it seemed typical of many of Martin Scorsese's films. And, like his films, it's was well made. But for me, it was relentlessly awful and unappealing. Sure, it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars...but despite this I found myself turned off by such a downbeat and unlikable story. Considering that there are over 1200 revews for this one, I really have nothing more to add other than I just didn't enjoy it and, in hindsight, wish I hadn't bothered.",5,3,6,4 August 2019
The Last King of Scotland," While far from a perfect film it is quite mesmerizing and you can't stop watching
","THE LAST KING OF Scotland came on HBO last night and I had no intention in watching it then--just recording it to watch later. After all, it was late and the movie wouldn't be over until well after 2am. But, on a lark, I decided to at least watch the first 15 or 20 minutes. Over two hours later, I was watching the final credits--so much for 'just watching a bit'! The reason I kept watching is because the film was very well constructed--especially in the first portion of the film. You KNOW had things are going to happen, but you find yourself seduced by Idi Amin's charm. So, just like the fictional doctor, you are carried along by the promise of a newer and better Uganda.While I wasn't thrilled with basing the film around a fictitious man, perhaps this was best because many of the people around Amin at the beginning are dead and perhaps there weren't any real people that could have been an interesting anchor for the film. However, what I really didn't like was the plot involving this doctor becoming sexually involved with one of Amin's wives. It just seemed ridiculous that any couple would be THAT horny when it's obvious that Amin is a violent and unforgiving man. It made no sense at all and seemed like it was added in order to 'sex up the film'. It also took too much focus off Amin's madness and resulted in a bizarre scene near the end reminiscent of A MAN CALLED HORSE that also seemed unnecessary.However, these concerns, though important, were not so bad as to seriously impact the film. Forrest Whitaker's performance was exceptional and the film was certainly exciting throughout. I highly recommend the film despite my few complaints, however I also highly recommend this film NOT be seen by kids or teens. It is a very hard R-rated film--with lots of unavoidable violence and lots of gratuitous nudity.",8,1,3,6 September 2008
August Rush," Not a remake of 'Oliver Twist' but an odd new reworking of the classic tale with a supernatural twist.
","'August Rush' is a modern fairy tale that is based on 'Oliver Twist'. However, while it shares many story elements, the film diverges from the novel in many ways...so much so that it truly is a unique viewing experience.When the film begins, two young musicians meet, have a one-night stand and are soon separated by her father. This father turns out to be a very manipulative person, because when he discovers his daughter is pregnant, he arranges for her to believe the child died at birth....though he instead put the child up for adoption and forged her name to the surrender papers.Years pass and now the boy, Evan, is living in a miserable orphan asylum. He is ridiculed by the other kids because Evan has a strange gift....a musical talent that makes him more than just a prodigy...more like a savant with super-human musical skills.Eventually, Evan escapes from this facility and ends up in New York City. At the same time, inexplicable forces draw his mother (who JUST learned her baby was not dead) and his father to the city as well. While the viewer knows what will eventually happen, there is still much film to go...during which you see Evan's amazing talents burst forth AND an evil manipulator, 'the Wizard' (Robin Williams, sees the boy's potential and takes him in and puts him to work. However, the Wizard is no humanitarian....he's pretty much like Fagan from 'Oliver Twist'...a man who keeps a hoard of runaways and uses them as buskers to make himself rich. How will Evan escape the clutches of this evil man? And, how will he locate his parents?
This film is very magical in style....with wonderful music and so much to like. Yes, it IS predictable...but it's also lovely in how it gets to where you think it should go. Well worth seeing and a nice family film.",9,4,4,7 July 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Very deliberately paced and lovely to watch.
","The story begins in London in 1946. Now that the war is over, Juliet Ashton is a best-selling author and she should be happy now that she's become engaged to a rich and handsome American soldier. But she seems a bit lost despite her success. One thing that piques her interest is a letter she's received from Guernsey (one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France). It's from a man who is looking for a book and who is part of the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society...a book club consisting of about a half dozen members. Instead of just sending the man the book, she decides to go to Guernsey and meet this book club. However, although they loved hosting her, there is some sort of secret about this group...a secret that Juliet is determined to find out for herself.The biggest praise in this film probably goes to the director, as the story is simple but Mike Newell manages to make the most of it. Some lovely performances, great pacing and a lovely script all work together to tell a story that really hook you...and if you like romances, you're sure to enjoy this movie.By the way, one of the best parts about story is its setting. Few Americans know anything about Guernsey and I enjoyed learning about the German occupation of the island during the war. Very interesting.",8,1,4,2 January 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not a film for the average viewer.
","I was very surprised how quickly 'Hail, Caesar' was in and out of the theaters...but now after seeing the film, I can completely understand why. It was as if the Coen Brothers simply said 'let's do a film for ourselves...who cares whether or not the public enjoys it or not!'. I appreciated it myself...but I am also not the average film-goer. As for the average viewer, the film makes allusions to many events in the history of Hollywood...but if you aren't aware of these events or rumors, you'll not understand or appreciate much of the film.The story is based SLIGHT on the life of Eddie Mannix--a motion picture exec who was known as a 'fixer'--a guy who knew how to make bad problems do away...and with the bad behavior of many of the stars, this was an exhausting job. The story seems to be just a slice out of Eddie's life--possibly not the worst time as a fixer but a busy one. Through the course of the film, several problems arise--such as a pregnant single starlet and an actor of dabbles in communism. In each case, Mannix has to get to work to be sure the public never knows...and you see how exhausting this job is.If you are looking for big laughs, you won't see them. There are a few small ones...just a few. Instead, it's more like a time machine trip to the early 1950s and you are that fly on the wall watching these Hollywood types as they go about their lives and doing stupid things. I do NOT strongly recommend the film but only mildly...and only if you are a real fan of the films of yesteryear AND are aware of the misbehaviors of some of our stars...or alleged misbehaviors.",7,34,43,6 August 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," It's got a few laughs but don't expect a whole lot more
","To me, the Ron Burgundy story feels a lot like a Saturday Night Live sketch that lasts a bit too long--though it certainly has its funny moments. If you are expecting a film as hilarious as TALLADEGA NIGHTS, this one just isn't up to it, but it is an amiable time-passer.Will Farrell stars as the title character--a very popular fictional anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. Ron is consistently #1 in the ratings and on top of his game when a new female reporter (Christina Applegate) arrives at the station. She is competent and pretty but in the sexist 70s world of this film, that just isn't enough. Ron and the rest of the staff just want to sleep with her and won't give her a chance at any serious news stories. With all the double-entendres and sexist remarks, this aspect of the story seemed to go on forever--plus the relationship between the two characters just seemed flat and unconvincing--even for such a slight comedy. Their interactions or the sexist remarks might have been really funny one or two or even three times, but after a while it was all like beating the proverbial dead horse--it just stopped being funny. What were funny, though, were the strange random little plot twists here and there not related to the relationship between Farrell and Applegate. I loved the fight scene between the various reporters from the local stations as well as the scenes with the dog--they were so weird and funny that they made the film worth seeing. So in other words, when the plot was ignored, the film soared!Overall, a reasonably funny but not especially inspired comedy that is about the same quality level as SEMI-PRO--both decent Will Farrell comedies, but certainly not as memorable as TALLADEGA NIGHTS or STRANGER THAN FICTION. This was mostly because the jokes fell pretty flat after a while and there wasn't enough to sustain an entire full-length film.",6,1,1,7 December 2008
The Mission," A little slow, but also sad and moving.
","'The Mission' is based on real events--though the ending is highly fictionalized. When the story begins, a lone Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), treks through the jungle in South America to try to establish a mission where one had previously failed. However, he is very successful and soon the place is filled with eager native Christians. Additionally, Father Gabriel recruits a vicious slave trader, Mendoza (Robert De Niro) to join him at the mission--and soon Mendoza is converted and becomes a member of the order. All seems great...until a treaty is suggested which will move this mission from Spanish to Portuguese territory--and the Portuguese plan of dismantling the Missions. What's next? See this film.The film is extremely beautiful and was filmed in the jungles of South America using Colombian indigenous peoples. The music, though sometimes a bit repetitive, is also quite beautiful. The only complaint I had with this very compelling film was the ending. It made it appear as if the priests stayed behind and died with the Indians when they ultimately attacked, though they didn't. They were pretty much abandoned to their fate. Very sad, very thought-provoking and well worth seeing. Just be aware that the film (especially near the beginning) is very slow and if you are looking for a nice, happy ending then you should keep looking!",8,3,3,16 January 2014
Stranger Than Fiction," Very good and very unexpected
","I have been very surprised recently that I have actually enjoyed several Will Ferrell movies. Why surprised? Well, to put it bluntly, most films made by ex-Saturday Night Live performers have been pretty wretched (though there are some exceptions) and I usually avoid them like the plague. With films like DR. DETROIT, NEIGHBORS, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, FUNNY FARM, BEST DEFENSE, HERE'S PAT, etc., it's easy to understand my misgivings. However, despite my strong bias, I must admit I really enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS as well as STRANGER THAN FICTION--though they are both very, very different movies.While TALLADEGA NIGHTS is extremely silly and a great parody, STRANGER THAN FICTION is not exactly a comedy, though it has some nice comedic moments. Instead, it's a fantasy, comedy and romance all rolled into one and it was nice to see Ferrell finally underplay a role. His character was extremely obsessive-compulsive and emotionally constricted--yet this was NOT played for laughs--an excellent decision.The film initially seems a lot like the old skits on 'The Carol Burnett Show' which featured a writer typing a story and you saw actors playing it out as if they were real. However, the simple story idea was drawn out but didn't seem padded and offered some lovely insights into deeper philosophical issues. It was NOT a film for dopey teens or an undemanding audience, but a thoughtful and intelligently constructed film that caught my interest.If you are looking for screwball comedy or lots of laughs, then you will no doubt be disappointed. However, if you watch the film with few preconceptions and expectations and have an open mind, I am sure you'll enjoy the film. It's nice to see that I was wrong about the film and the 'SNL curse' did not seem to apply.",8,3,4,18 April 2008
The Reader," The most morally neutral film I can ever recall having seen.
","This is a very strange movie in that there are MANY moral dilemmas and situations that clearly are unsavory--yet the film takes a completely neutral stance in presenting the plot. I am sure this offended some but it did make for a very memorable film. As for me, I am still not sure what I think about this strange style of film making.The movie begins with a 16 year-old boy being seduced by a much older woman. The morality of this and their subsequent affair never seems to matter---it just is. During this time, the older woman (Kate Winslet) was often quite moody and the boy's welfare really didn't seem that important. Also, she would force him to read to him before they had sex. Why is an important part of the film--and frankly, though it was apparently supposed to be a twist, I figure this out immediately. However, this didn't spoil the film.One day, Winslet disappears. Exactly why you really don't know. The boy grows and is now in law school. As part of one of his seminar classes, he and the class go to court to observe. The case involves some Nazi war criminals--and it turns out Winslet is among the defendants. And, the fact that she had other 'readers' finally makes the young man realize why. Winslet (this is NOT much of a spoiler) is illiterate. Yet, she is so ashamed of this, she is willing to accept a much longer sentence to hide her illiteracy. And, during her long incarceration, the ex-lover (now played by Ralph Fiennes) makes it his life duty to record book after book for her to enjoy while incarcerated. There's a bit more to the film than this, but I'll leave it up to you to see for yourself.The movie has some excellent acting, though I did wonder why the leads were played by non-Germans--while some other major characters were German-speaking actors (like the Swiss-born Bruno Ganz). I wonder why they didn't just have Germans in all the roles. Perhaps they thought it was more bankable with Fiennes and Winslet. The moody music and direction were perhaps the best part of the film, however---very evocative and well done.As for the plot, I cannot completely reconcile myself with the fact that the film appeared to possibly condone or was indifferent to evil. Sexual exploitation of a teen and the holocaust are BAD....REEEEAAAL bad! And that made me a bit uneasy, as I enjoyed the film and the odd plot. Also, I felt that it was a shame there was so much nudity, as I would love for teens to see the film--it would be great to show them to instigate discussions and provoke exploration.A weird and unique film. Hard to really describe and one you may enjoy but also one that may prove too challenging--as I could really see this causing some viewers to become angry, depressed or too emotionally taxing.By the way, was it just me or am I right that it seems that Fiennes' character wasted his life? And, interestingly, Fiennes also starred in the excruciatingly dull 'The English Patient'--another VERY morally ambiguous film about the Nazis and moral choices.",9,5,5,24 June 2011
The Wrestler," Painful to watch...
","This film is, at times, very painful to watch. The wrestling scenes are brutally violent and bloody--with some of the action real and hard to see. Reportedly, the staples and several other body-scarring scenes were real! You can't say that Mickey Rourke wasn't willing to suffer for his art! Plus, when you see the post-match Rourke barely able to move or function, it's hard to watch--and you want to avert your eyes. It's definitely a no holds barred sort of movie.Rourke plays an aging wrestler who has gained some fame but also is working in the second-tier of the profession. In other words, the job is violent but doesn't even pay well--and plays in lesser venues. You get the impression that he was a big-name star at one point, but by now time has taken its toll and he's seen better days. His body is covered in scars, he's reduced to needing a hearing aid and he has just suffered a heart attack. Now that his career is about over, he is looking to make a few changes--to get a real job and try to reacquaint himself with his estranged daughter. It's interesting because although the violence is very hard to watch, seeing him try to make a new life is often more painful and the film pulls no punches in this warts and all treatment. As his character says 'I'm just an old broken down piece of meat...all alone...and I deserve to be alone...'. This sort of tough dialog, very good acting and an unrelenting script make this one a memorable film....but such a painful one that many might want to think twice about watching.By the way, in addition to being a very bloody and violent film, there is quite a bit of nudity. I was surprised to see Marisa Tomei doing all the nude scenes--usually with an Oscar-winning actress they do not do such work. For a woman in her mid-40s, she sure had nothing to be ashamed of when it came to her figure--but just be forewarned that you'll see a lot of her.",8,3,7,14 August 2010
Kingpin," Stupid fun
","This is an odd concept for a film--a movie all about bowling! Who would have thought you could make a decent comedy about bowling and who would have thought it would actually be funny? In many ways, the weirdness and irreverent style are very similar to the much later film, TALLADEGA NIGHTS--another 'sport' that takes well to parody.Was this a brilliant film--probably not. But, in a very low-brow way, it does make you laugh and that is enough some times. It gets very high marks for bizarreness (such as the fake hand and the whole Quaker angle) but also loses marks for, unfortunately, losing steam from time to time with needless plot. When the film tried to be meaningful or didn't go for laughs, it fell a bit flat.",6,2,7,30 May 2008
Hitch," An amiable if not believable romantic-comedy
","This is a very good date movie, as it's engaging and fun to watch--and Will Smith did a nice job as a man whose job is helping nice but shy people meet and win the person of their dreams. I particularly liked the parts of the film that also include casting Kevin James ('King of Queens') as he provided excellent support to Smith in playing a dumpy but very likable guy who wants to win the hand of a media star. While this seems like a very tall order for Smith, their work together is cute and the romance between James and Amber Valletta is fun to watch unfold (though it is pretty tough to believe). There are also several other people along the way that romantic coach Smith also helps, but the vast majority of time in this film is devoted to James--as well as to a budding romance between Smith and Eva Mendes--both who are commitment phobic! Through a series of misunderstandings both relationships hit the skids. And since this IS a romantic-comedy, the viewer will no doubt know the outcome of both. I didn't mind this formulaic approach at all--as I like a good romance. However, there WAS a problem in how the Smith-Mendes relationship was played out, as at times Mendes seemed pretty unlikable and reacted in ways that seemed difficult to believe. Still, if you are looking for a nice date movie, this is it. Guys and ladies should both enjoy this slight but amiable film.",7,0,0,17 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally---a Star Wars film designed just for kids and dumb people!
","Well, at the outset, this film already lost a point or two from me since it, once again, features that nauseating character 'Jar-Jar'. While some of my friends pointed out that he wasn't in this film as much as in the previous two, having him in the film at all makes me hate the movie. Why George Lucas dogmatically refused to admit that this character was a HUGE marketing mistake AND that he even went back to the earlier films to add him into irrelevant scenes for the DVD release is beyond me. Obviously, he is NOT a person who can admit he was wrong! All the unpurchased Jar-Jar merchandise sitting on store shelves as well as all the 'I hate Jar-Jar' web sites SHOULD be an indication that he is less than loved by the public!Now apart from that, the film is very lovely to look at--with great special effects and tons of eye candy for the viewer. You can't fault the action. However, I also think this film was designed for dumb people, as literate and non-cerebrally impaired people will notice that the dialog is simply one cliché after another. I know this may sound arrogant, but George Lucas wrote horrid dialog. When it comes to logic, this is also often missing from the film. I felt like screaming during at the scene where Vader is battling in a volcano--yet he doesn't break a sweat and only is injured when he eventually falls into the molten goo. He and his nemesis would have been vaporized long before touching the stuff and also would have choked to death on noxious fumes. Apparently this volcano only releases oxygen and is only hot to the touch! Additionally, while little kids loved it, when Yoda does his ninja-Jedi fighting scene, I was horrified at its stupidity. It was simply intended to entertain the lowest common denominator in the theater and was completely out of character. Many adults, I assume, cringed during these awful scenes.When I compare this film to the earlier films, I am left saddened. Couldn't they have found a better script or at least edited it before filming began? Or perhaps gotten a professional script writer. What a disappointment.",4,12,32,28 November 2007
Ray," Mostly accurate and brutal--but also a bit of a white-wash
","'Ray' is an excellent movie. Jamie Foxx did a great job in the film and earned the Oscar for Best Actor--and he was excellent in the title role. The film also showed many of the warts in Ray Charles' life--such as affairs and drug abuse. However, as a history teacher, I should also point out that the film ignores just how dark and nasty a person Ray Charles was. In the film you hear about one failed marriage and one illegitimate child, but the truth was much darker--with 12 children by 9 different mothers and an additional marriage. I really think talking about this would have improved the film--showing the extreme contrast between a man who could sing songs that delight millions and yet, personally, he was a mess. It also would have been more truthful--a serious problem with most bio-pics. But I should at least admire that the film is not a total white-wash but addresses some of his dark past. Plus, the production values were great and the film was never dull. Excellent and well worth seeing.By the way, you'll probably notice that my review is pretty short considering how big a hit the film was and what an epic film it was. Well, there are already TONS of reviews for the movie and so I chose just to focus on the historical aspects of the film.",8,2,3,27 March 2013
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," An amazing breakthrough for animation, though it hasn't aged as well as some other classic cartoons.
","'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is a breakthrough film. It's the first full-length cartoon and a HUGE achievement for Disney. As such, it opened up new ground, established some of the formulas we still see today in animated films and is still darned entertaining. Had there been an IMDb back in 1937, I surely would have scored this one a 10--no doubt about that. However, despite being one of my favorite and sweetest Disney films, I also have to admit that the film, though wonderful, does suffer a bit on two accounts. First, Snow White's voice and singing is hellishly awful. What was wonderful for 1937 is just cringe-worthy today. Second, the ending is very abrupt and lacks depth. Still, the animation is wonderful, the story terrific and the film is easy to love. If you don't love this one, then you must be insane or just plain evil!",9,3,5,22 May 2015
The Lion King," A lovely but completely unoriginal film.
","Aside from the folks at Disney, anyone else my age who saw both the Japanese series 'Kimba' and 'The Lion King' could easily see that the Disney film was based almost completely on the earlier Japanese cartoon. Now I am no lover of 'Kimba'--its American version was rather insipid. But the plot was clearly 'borrowed' by Disney to make 'The Lion King'. And, there are so many similarities that I cannot rate this wonderful film any higher than an 8--as it lacks originality. Sure, I loved Ed and felt my heart tugged by the film and loved the music--but it was a ripoff, ur....I mean 'very similar'. Not a bad film at all, but I recommend you try seeing the Japanese show if you can find a copy. Even the main character's names are practically the same!",8,3,13,13 October 2012
Inception," Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.
","This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in 'Titanic'--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from 'Third Rock' suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.",8,17,36,2 December 2010
The Waterboy," Sometimes you just need a stupid film like this to make you laugh
","Although I love a good foreign or independent film, sometimes I am in the mood for a good old stupid film like THE WATERBOY. This is not meant as an insult, as the makers of this film intended for it to be very dumb and in the process the film is also quite entertaining. There are many times I could just use some mindless fun and I am thankful that films like the Bill and Ted films, UHF, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and THE WATERBOY are there when I am in the mood for goofiness.Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher--a guy so socially inept people assume he is an idiot. His sole desire in life when he film begins is to be a water boy for a football team--even though he's in his 30s! When he shows up at South Central Louisiana State University looking for this job, the coach (Henry Winkler) lets him do it---provided he doesn't have to pay Boucher! Oddly, Boucher looks at his job as if it were a science and he takes amazing pride in such a menial and worthless job. In the process, he looks like a total geek and the players make fun of him constantly. Eventually, all the needling reminds him of all the many, many, many times others have made fun of him over the years and he reacts by knocking one of the players off his feet. Not realizing it, Boucher was able to channel his 31 years of rage into tackling. Winkler realizes Boucher's potential and gets him to agree to play football--even though Boucher's mama (Kathy Bates) thinks 'foosball is of the Devil!'. This is accomplished by pretending that he's just the team's water boy. I loved when he came home bruised up after a game and explained that it was because he was beaten up by an escaped gorilla....and she believed it!! However, when Mama finally learns the truth, she slips into an unknown illness and Waterboy is unable to bring himself to play in the super-important Bourbon Bowl!The film abounds with stupid moments--the sort that make kids laugh and adult often pretend aren't funny. I believe that most sophisticated adults WILL like the film but should probably only watch it when the kids are asleep--otherwise the children will realize that their parents are capable of laughing at Adam Sandler.Clever writing, lots of silly gags (such as his run-in with 'Colonel Sanders') and a part that works well for Sandler, this is one of his better films. I also recommend you try watching THE WEDDING SINGER. And, because I care about you, I advise you to avoid LITTLE NICKY like the plague, as its juvenile humor is something only the most seriously brain damaged can appreciate. It's just not funny.By the way, the plot of THE WATERBOY is in many ways a variation on Stephen King's CARRIE. Carrie's mother IS Bobby Boucher's mother in many different ways. And, instead of cool telekinesis, Bobby's 'magic power' is his ability to tackle. Think about it.",8,4,5,1 March 2009
The Secret Life of Pets," Starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum

The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires.

WALL·E," Wow, do I feel out of step!
","WALL-E is a very popular Oscar-winning film, so my giving it a 6 must seem like sacrilege. However, I don't do this just to buck convention or be a jerk---I just thought it didn't have a particularly good plot. As for the animation, not surprisingly, it's absolutely beautiful--probably the prettiest CGI film to date.The story begins on a desolate Earth. Everywhere is garbage and the crumbling bits of a long-dead city are the home of WALL-E the robot. Apparently, his job is to help clean up the mess and it's obvious he has been doing it for centuries. You see no other robots, so you assume that they have long since ceased functioning. This portion of the movie lasts quite a while--with no dialog and not much story.A bit later, a probe lands on the Earth and WALL-E is thrilled because he apparently is lonely. The other robot seemed rather reticent to engage with WALL-E, but WALL-E follows 'Eve' like a stalker. Eventually, Eve finds a lone plant and pulls it inside its shell. Then she seems to shut down. However, a ship soon arrives and brings her back to a huge space cruiser filled with weeble-like humans. It seems that Eve's purpose was to seek out evidence of life on Earth so that the humans can return after a 700 year absence. It seems that they made the planet pretty uninhabitable in the 2100s and now, perhaps, it's time to go home. However, there is an unexpected glitch that may prevent the ship from returning.My problems with the story have to do with anthropomorphizing the robots. They are NOT human and they cannot possess feelings--yet in this Disney world they do. Well, this is hard to believe, but even if this is so, the robots only have a bit of a personality. They are not so lovable and they have very limited vocabularies. Because of that, the first 39 minutes are pretty dull, as there isn't much to do other than watch WALL-E (for the first 15 or so minutes) or Eve and WALL-E for the next 24 minutes. Once the humans are involved, it gets a bit better--but only just a bit. Most of this final segment of the film seems to be chase scenes and the humans are given practically no personality as well. I don't see how kids sat still during the movie and I assume this is a film that critics loved but I can't imagine younger kids loving with the same fervor as TOY STORY or MONSTERS, INC..Overall, a lovely film to look at so I give it a 7 just for the amazing artistry, but a rather unexpectedly dull story keeps it from a higher score. I know that puts me in a small minority, but this seems like Pixar's most overrated film. Heck, the short film that preceded WALL-E (PRESTO) was much better than the film that followed.",7,8,26,7 March 2009
Finding Dory," More of the same....
","'Finding Dory' is more of the same...which will no doubt thrill children and audiences of the original, 'Finding Nemo'. But, for folks like me who are NOT big fans of sequels, there also is more of the same.The film is set before, during and mostly after the adventures that Nemo and his father went through in the previous film. Oddly, while Dory has no attention span and not real memory, she inexplicably kinda remembers her early life and goes off in search of her parents. Nemo and Dad go along to help and a bunch of new friends help Dory to achieve her dream.The film is a lazy product...a sequel which is enjoyable but introduces nothing substantially new. There's nothing offensive about it at all but I cannot understand folks being excited about it because the film is mostly by the numbers and takes few chances. Worth seeing if you want to see a CGI film (and the 3D looks nice) and don't mind an incredibly familiar cast.",7,9,23,22 June 2016
Stalag 17," A wonderful war film that dares to be different
","This is one of Billy Wilder's best films and still stands up very well today. Unlike the concentration camps of the Holocaust, prison camps for Allied prisoners were actually not all that bad in comparison (except for how the Russian prisoners were treated--they were often just shot). So, the prisoners enjoyed a little more freedom and were constantly trying to deal with the incredible boredom of being locked up with very little to do. As a result, films about these camps (such as this one and THE GREAT ESCAPE) are few and far between--they would just be too dull to merit a movie. However, in the case of this film, the monotony is disrupted because there apparently is a snitch within the prisoners' ranks--some rat is tipping off the Commandant (director Otto Preminger--in one of his few acting roles) about escape attempts, major rule infractions and who the actual perpetrator of a major act of sabotage was.Naturally, prisoners begin to think that William Holden is the snitch. After all, he is living incredibly well compared to all the other Allied prisoners in the camp due to all his money-making schemes and black market activities. In addition, he is so cynical and apparently unpatriotic that he has no desire to escape--he's more than willing to sit tight until the war is over since he is safe and happy! In this role, Holden's character is VERY similar to the one he played in BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI--where he is also a schemer and mostly focused on saving his own sorry butt! However, the problem of the snitch isn't so simply solved and much of the film is about how Holden proves he was NOT the spy for the Germans.The movie is odd in that it is a combination of both drama and comedy--with alternating moods throughout the film. Some of the ways the bored prisoners create their own fun are incredibly funny (especially the 'MEIN KAMPF' scene) and some of the moments are poignant and exciting (such as the escape at the end of the film). All this comes together wonderfully in the marvelous ending of the film. The movie features exceptional acting, writing and direction and is one of the best WWII films ever made. See it--it's well worth your time.",9,30,37,15 November 2006
Arrival," Good...but also very slow and NOT the sort of film that pleases the masses.
","When you look at the reviews for 'Arrival' on IMDB, you might notice that there is a huge disparity among them. Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films. The reason, I think, is because this sci-fi film is very cerebral....and not a bit like 'Star Wars' and more traditional science fiction.In this story, 12 enormous space craft suddenly appear all over the world. Not surprisingly, folks are scared and people want answers. Soon, a representative from the military shows up and requests that Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) join with a team of researchers in the American west....as they want her with her impressive linguistic skills to try to communicate with the vessel and the creatures within...if there are any. What follows is a long, slow and mend-bending film...one that is interesting and appears very realistic...but also is cerebral.The acting, special effects and all were very nice. I have no complaints about that at all. As for the story, I generally enjoyed it but felt that the whole concept of time being cyclical a bit strange....not bad, just odd. Overall, a good film but one that doubtless leaves many confused and bored.",7,4,8,2 June 2019
The Blind Side," Inspiring and sweet
","This is a can't-miss family movie. After all, EVERYONE seems to like inspiring family films--especially when it's based on real people. And, not surprisingly, I had a thoroughly good time watching it--though I do recommend you see it with a box of Kleenex nearby.The film is about a young man named Michael Oher--an extremely large black teenager who has bounced from home to home in the foster care system. Currently, he's in a new school and no one realizes that he has no place to live. Yet in spite of having a crack-addicted mother, a father who was killed in prison and every other reason to be an angry powder keg, he's a very gentle and sad soul---who is also enormous and has amazing potential to play football.A nosy but very nice lady (Sandra Bullock) convinces her husband (Tim McGraw) to bring Michael home...at least for the night. But this one night turns into a permanent living situation and he becomes an important part of the family. However, despite this new living arrangement working out well, Michael is so far behind in school and his GPA so low that he hasn't a prayer to play football in college. That's because although many schools are now offering him athletic scholarships, his GPA is too low to allow him to accept these offers. So, with his new family's help, perhaps he can pull up those grades and have a future.This film is super-inspirational and sweet--mostly because it's true. I am sure that some poetic license was taken when making the film (I especially wonder if the little brother could be THIS precocious and adorable), but overall they did a good job of sticking reasonably close the facts. While I loved Sandra Bullock's performance (she's great as usual), I was a bit surprised that she received Oscar for it--I did see a few performances in other films that year that I thought were a bit better (such as the leading young lady in 'Precious'). Also, Tim McGraw, while a lesser role in the film, did a surprisingly good job--especially as he's really known as a country singer, not an actor. All around, a very good film and one that is meant to inspire.",8,0,1,29 March 2011
Parasite," I loved the first 90%....but the last might be very tough for some viewers.
","I was able to see 'Parasite' a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn't that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person's head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it's still a good film but one I really wish I hadn't seen.",6,14,68,22 October 2019
Rango," Annoying.....
","I've gotta admit up front that I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan and frankly think I've seen enough of him for some time. Now I am not saying he isn't talented—he certainly is. But so often his films have 'mega-hit' written all over them and the public throngs to his films like lemmings—and I just think I've seen enough. Plus, he's in practically EVERYTHING these days and I just wish he'd take a break. This is especially true in 'Rango' as if you love Depp, great...but if you don't, you'll probably REALLY hate the film. That's because Depp's character talks practically non-stop--and is about as subtle as Ebola. And, frankly, so many of the characters and the music to this film is just LOUD, LOUD and LOUD!!! I just kept wishing the film hadn't tried so hard. In my daughter's words, 'there doesn't seem to be any plot...just Johnny Depp screaming a lot'. Ditto.This is all a big shame, as apart from being a loud and obnoxious film, the CGI is AMAZING--and among the best I've seen so far. It's a quality production but annoying--and the rottenness of the Best Animated Film category was terrible for 2012 if this film ended up winning! In my opinion, they should have just not given an award instead of rewarding such a film.",3,0,4,13 May 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Good parts, but the film is too familiar and seems quite overrated.
","At this time, 'Birdman' has a phenomenal IMDb score of 8.7 and has been talked about a lot in regards to the Oscars. Whether the film does get the nominations (particularly for Michael Keaton) is something we'll know in the next few weeks. As for me, however, I really do think the film is quite overrated--and the biggest reason is that so much of it I've seen before--such as in Fellini's '8 1/2' and a few films that have copied this, such as Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories'. The movie, at least to crazed film buffs like me, just lacks the originality to be a great film and it seems overrated.As for the film, it's about a down and out actor who USED to be a big star back when he starred in superhero movies (like Keaton in real life). Now, decades later, he's attempting a comeback-- starring and directing in a Broadway play. The film is, generally, a behind the scenes look at what it's like during a production. But, it is also punctuated with very strange, surreal fantasy scenes--VERY reminiscent of Marcello Mastroianni's little fantasies in '8 1/2'. In fact, there are so many that it's difficult to know what REALLY is happening at times.I loved parts of the film. Many little bits and pieces made me smile or connected with me. But, at the same time, I struggled with liking the film because so many of the characters were either completely unlikable or were underdeveloped. This, combined with the unevenness of the script and familiarity of the style, the film didn't do much for me. Did I enjoy seeing it? Not especially, but I am glad I did see it-- and assume folks not familiar with '8 1/2' would probably like the film much more than me.",6,18,34,2 January 2015
The Big Short," Good...but best to be watched with an economics professor.
","'The Big Short' is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble's burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn't possibly afford these homes)....but that's about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it's sure to confuse more than entertain. What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I've seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss. The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost. Enjoyable but best watched with an economics professor sitting in the room to explain it all in detail.",8,54,69,21 September 2016
Platoon," Thoroughly unpleasant viewing...
","This is a very, very hard film for me to review. I was too young to be in Vietnam (thank God) and I have no idea what the real Vietnam War was like. Was it like John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS? I am sure it was not! But, was it like PLATOON? I just don't know. Did the soldiers in the war do drugs, kill civilians and run amok? Yes, but whether or not it was the norm (like it was shown in this film), I just can't say. Some Vietnam vets I've spoken with say this film is accurate, others say it over-emphasizes isolated incidents because it has an agenda. I just don't know, especially since director Oliver Stone does have problems, at least in some films, with fictionalizing events (such as in JFK and Alexander). Regardless, it is a very powerful film.Unlike FULL METAL JACKET, this Vietnam War film begins in Vietnam. The film opens with Barber's 'Adagio for Strings' providing an appropriately somber and dirge-like musical introduction--newbie Charlie Sheen arrives as body bags are being loaded into a plane. This is the perfect music for the intro, though I must admit that later in the film it is overused just a bit--losing some of its impact.The film revolves around young Sheen and the men serving with him--soldiers on the front lines and in the middle of the action. Over time, the whole reason for them being their and their humanity all comes into question. This struggle is epitomized in the two sergeants. One, Tom Berenger, is a bit nuts. He's willing to break the rules, kill civilians and become an animal. The other, Willem Defoe, is an equally skilled soldier but cannot allow himself to give in to his darker side. This all comes to a head when Berenger and several others viciously kill several villagers--villagers who could easily have been completely innocent and certainly did not deserve this. When Defoe swears to file a report about this, you know that eventually there will be a serious confrontation between these two men. However, it's Sheen who eventually finds himself in the middle--and you are pretty sure that it will be him or Berenger that must die. Yet, there is STILL almost an hour left in the film! The final hour is one of the most harrowing in film history. It consists of one hellacious firefight after another--culminating in a battle along the Cambodian border that ultimately kills off most of the men in the platoon--and further dehumanizes the survivors. For sheer violence and terror, I can't think of another war film that can even come close. It's practically non-stop and will keep you on the edge of your seat.So what did I think about the film? Well, watching it was certainly among the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had! The extreme violence, the pointlessness, the horrible language and the drugs were all pretty awful and didn't make this a film for little kids, that's for sure! But, you certainly must admire it for the intensity and realism you lack in many films--traditional war films that make war seem fun or manly. You certainly can't watch this film enjoy it--and that really is a good thing when you think about it.So, for a film that shows war in all its awfulness, you can't find one quite like PLATOON. Once again, I can't attest to the voracity of the portrait of the war, but for a vision of what war can be like, it can't fail to have a huge emotional impact. My only quibble, and it is minor, is that Charlie Sheen seemed a tad young in his role--so much so that I had a hard time accepting him as a soldier among all these men.",10,9,12,9 January 2010
Wonder Woman," A review from an older guy who is not a huge fan of superhero films.
","Whether or not you'll love 'Wonder Woman' no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it's setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn't read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!The story is pretty different from my concept for 'Wonder Woman'. This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn't much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won't bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist's mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse.",7,146,273,4 June 2017
Paths of Glory," A marvelous film about the STUPIDIST war in history with a dynamic performance by Douglas
","This is a wonderful film and for those who are looking to see a Stanley Kubrick film that the average person can relate to, this is a great initiation to the director's work. Some of his films are a bit hard to understand or frankly make my head hurt (2001 is a great example), but this one is much more straight-forward and conventional than most of his other films while still being a great film.The movie is based on a real incident in WWI. When a squad of French soldiers were ordered 'over the top' (i.e., to crawl out of the trenches and charge across the battlefield while being shot down like dogs--the standard way of fighting on the Western Front), the men were so sick of the pointless fighting that they refused. As a result, the officers (who are shown sitting many miles behind the lines sipping sherry and living a life of opulence) order that some soldiers randomly be taken out of the group to be executed as an example to the others! The complete unfairness of the punishment, the futility of the war and the fact that the leaders were a group of soul-less fiends were the focus of this intensely interesting film.The lead was played by Kirk Douglas. His job was to defend these poor men, but it soon becomes obvious that the trial is a show trial--the men are doomed from the outset. In some films, Douglas' style of acting is not very appropriate, but his bigger than life acting style and the way he ultimately explodes at his superiors is a wonderful addition to the film. He single-handedly acts like the conscience of the nation--something that was clearly lacking. A wonderful and intense performance on his part--perhaps only surpassed by his lead in the film LUST FOR LIFE.This is a wonderful film about this war--a wonderful film to be seen along with ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. Any true fan of film should see this movie.",10,5,9,15 November 2006
Despicable Me," Despite being rather predictable, I had a great time watching this film.
","I should note that I did NOT see this film in 3-D but at a non-3-D equipped theater. I am not sure that this impacted my viewing experience very much as most 3-D films I have seen really didn't benefit much from this technology--the most notable exception being 'How To Train Your Dragon'--a film that fully utilized 3-D and was amazing to see in all its glory.I should also point out that I knew exactly where this film was going long before it got there--and I am sure most adult viewers and kids probably felt the same way. Heck, just by watching the preview for the film a few months back, I knew exactly where the film would go. But despite being a formulaic film where the big curmudgeon has his heart melted by some adorable orphans, I still had a wonderful time watching the movie. Why? Because it did something that many family movies forget--it was fun!! And, on top of that, it was super-cute--but not in a cloying manner. Unless you are Genghis Khan, you WILL find the countless little yellow minions to be completely adorable and funny--a real high point for the film. Heck, a couple months before the film was released, I was at Universal Studios in Florida and just HAD to have my picture taken with one of these characters as it roamed the park--it was just so freaking cute! And, I even liked the adorable little orphans--something I usually hate in films. They had a good balance between cute, sassy and endearing.Overall, this is a wonderful 3-D movie because parents can enjoy it. I loved the characters and thought the French animators did a terrific job--with artistry that stacks up very well against the older and more established CGI studios, Pixar and Dreamworks. A pleasant treat that won't change your life...but who cares if it's so entertaining?! By the way, the plot for this film sure looks a lot like 'Megamind' that was released just a few weeks later. I have yet to see 'Megamind' and plan on doing so soon, so I'll update this review to reflect which of the two films I preferred. I just can't imagine how 'Megamind' could be that much better!",8,4,6,30 November 2010
Carrie," Not a particularly deep story, but executed very, very well
","I cannot compare this movie to the Stephen King novel, since I haven't read it. So keep this in mind when you read my review.Carrie is a very socially awkward teenager who was made this way my an insanely religious and deeply disturbed mother. While students laughed at her, they didn't realize how hellish her existence was at home. Sadly, when Carrie does open up to those around her and finally tries to fit in, the kids at her school proved at the prom that they were truly evil and deserved to die...and then they did! The film is very well done and I think much of the credit is due to Sissy Spacek for her incredibly gutsy performance. Not only did she do some incredibly rough nude scenes, show a wide range of feeling but also put herself out incredibly far in order to get the best performance (read the trivia section carefully to see what I mean). The film succeeded more for her performance than the other supporting ones--as it's a lot easier to play a jerk than to play the full range of Carrie's emotions.As far as the direction by Brian De Palma goes, I must point out that I am NOT a fan of his style. De Palma NEVER leaves anything to the imagination and seems to usually believe that more is best (see SCARFACE). I would have preferred a few moments had been played more subtly and the film been less crude (for a 70s film, this movie had amazingly rough language). But, on the other hand, there was a lot of very creative camera-work and the ending (done in slow-motion much of the time) worked very well.Overall, it's an exceptional film but too bad there's so much nudity and foul language--as it was intended as a teen film. I do think that it's okay for most teens to see it, but parents should beware that the film does cross the line from time to time--making it a better choice for adults even though the message is one most kids should see.By the way, the statue in the closet is Saint Sebastian who was supposedly martyred with arrows. In a neat but not particularly subtle moment, this is recreated at the end of the film. Also, if you haven't noticed, Carrie and her mother are VERY similar to Waterboy and his mother...think about it.",8,1,13,25 July 2009
Marriage Story," Incredibly depressing...but with some AMAZING performances and a great script.
","If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching 'Marriage Story'. I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way...and one of the better movies of 2019.",9,330,444,3 November 2019
The Queen," I'd sure love to know how close this is to the truth.
","As a history teacher, I found 'The Queen' to be very interesting but also a bit frustrating. You get a behind the scenes look at a very trying period for the royal family and you get to see them with their guard down. However, just how true is this? Who are the sources? How closely to the actual story is it and where does it diverge? I just don't know and I suspect very few do.'The Queen' is about a very brief period of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Specifically it covers the death of Diana Spencer and the subsequent unprecedented reaction from the public. The film specifically focuses on the Queen and Tony Blair but you also get some insights into Prince Charles (mostly very positive) and Prince Philip (mostly horrendous).I appreciated the acting of Helen Mirren and I wasn't at all surprised to see that she received the Oscar for her performance. She was excellent--though the film was full of excellent all around. Wonderful acting and production values make this a must-see for film buffs. I also appreciated seeing these folks humanized--such as the Queen driving herself and using the word 'bugger'!",9,3,4,12 November 2013
Raging Bull," Like a train wreck you just can't stop watching...
","Wow. This is an incredibly unpleasant film about a particularly unpleasant man. However, as the main character (boxer Jake LaMotta) is SO unpleasant and awful, the film is hard to stop watching--like some sort of train wreck that lasts 129 minutes! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't well made--it's very well crafted and there a lot of things to admire about it....but the characters (particularly Jake) are so awful that you just marvel at them.The film is the life story of Jake LaMotta and it covers from his early days as a professional boxer in 1941 through his early post-boxing years. However, there are many things that make it quite different from films like 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' and 'Rocky'--and not just the bubbling hostility of Jake outside the ring. In addition, those around him are incredibly harsh and unpleasant. It's funny, but the mobsters around him are NICER than the LaMottas (Jake and his almost as vicious brother, Joey) and you see them as the gentlemen in the film! Also, unlike these other boxer films, this one shows the brutality in the ring to a degree only approximated in one other film--Kirk Douglas' 'Champion'--though 'Raging Bull' manages to go a few steps further in the brutality department. A few of the boxing scenes, in particular, are amazingly graphic--with broken noses and squirting blood galore. Now I know I might sound crazy saying this, but this Martin Scorsese film is probably one of the best indictments AGAINST boxing because it IS so bloody and brutal. I'd place it among films like 'Requium For a Heavyweight' and 'The Harder They Fall' as the best in anti-boxing films! So let's talk about the technical aspects of the film. When it comes to the boxing sequences, this is an amazing film. As I said above, the brutality of the scenes is stomach-turning. And, instead of quickly filming the matches, the director chose to choreograph them so maximize the emotional impact--with loud thuds, great lighting and amazing effects to simulate the gallons of blood spilled in the fights. My only complaint about the fights is that the boxers simply threw too many punches. No boxing match (even the lightweight ones) has THAT much punching in rapid succession. If they did, they'd never go more than three rounds, as the fighters would collapse from exhaustion! But, this exaggeration did make the scenes more intense, so I saw it as a case of artistic license. As for making the film in black & white, I think this also worked well.The acting was pretty amazing. A lot has been said about Robert DiNero's commitment to the role--and how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta. In addition, the intense physical training he underwent to become the character was amazing. You have to admire his willingness to give his all for the part! When I looked for pictures of Jake, Joey and Mrs. LaMotta, I was also amazed that the actors (DiNero, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty) really did look a lot like the actual people they portrayed--a nice touch. Overall, an exceptional film in most every way, though it's NOT a film for everyone. The unpleasantness of the film make it something that many simply don't want to endure--and I can certainly understand this--it is bloody and vicious throughout.",9,7,16,7 March 2010
Mary and Max," After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...
","Having already watched several of Adam Elliot's other films ('Harvey Krumpet', 'Brother', 'Cousin' and 'Uncle'), I felt a strong compulsion to watch 'Mary and Max'. After all, these other films were wonderful and very original and you find yourself hooked when you watch them--though you probably won't know why. Now, with Elliot's latest film, I have a chance to finally watch a feature-length version of his wonderful and very strange work.The film begins in Australia and concerns a very lonely girl named Mary. Her parents are completely inept at parenting and mostly she entertains herself. One day, on a lark, she rips a name out of an American phone book and writes to a 'M. Horowitz'--telling him about herself as well as asking him where babies come from in America. As Max Horowitz is a socially inept odd-ball, his response to her strange letter is amusing to say the least. And, through their ensuing letters to each other they become friends--an 8 year-old girl and a 40+ year-old man and the film consists of showing each writing and narrating their letters. Where this bizarre business goes, you'll just need to see for yourself. However, without spoiling the film, I can safely say that I never, ever could predict where the film would go next!! Like all of Adam Elliot films, the film is just plain odd--with a delightful strangeness you can't help but like. And, even more than his shorter films, you can't believe how much time and effort he took to make this movie. It's amazing....really. And, fortunately, his work is totally unique and inventive. Aside from his previous shorts, I've never seen anything like it--and I am pretty sure you'll feel the same way if you try this delightfully strange film. Just don't try to understand or make sense of it...it might just make your brain explode. Oh, and do NOT watch it if you are feeling depressed. Although it's got lots of funny moments, the film is VERY, VERY dark--so much so that you should think twice before watching it. And, although the film looks like a kids movie, I would probably think twice before showing it to young kids.",10,6,10,1 January 2011
Shrek," Groundbreaking.
","For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of 'Shrek' on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I'll just end it here!",9,3,3,21 June 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Well made but yecch.
","I should probably mention right up front that I am not a huge fan of thrillers and, in particular, I don't care for violent or gory films. Because of this, I have waited a very long time to finally getting around to seeing this film. The idea of a film about serial killers just doesn't appeal to me. However, there is also an obsessive part of me--the part of me that wants to see all the Best Picture Oscar winners. Apart from this film, there are maybe two others I need to complete this...until next year! And, my daughter assured me that the movie wasn't too gory. So, this film review is best appreciated by others who just aren't into gore, serial killings and cannibalism--though, oddly, a very high percentage of viewers DO like such plots.First, the bad news. I sure as heck thought it was a gory film...a very gory film. You see people with huge chunks of skin ripped off, a guy's face ripped off and lots of blood. I don't know how my daughter would think this isn't gory! Second, the not so bad news. Although I really didn't like the film very much, it was interesting and different. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job playing a psycho murder--though I also felt this performance was anything but subtle--but it was entertaining. So did the film change my mind about the genre or this film in particular? No. But, apparently I am in the minority here.UPDATE: I recently began watching the TV show, 'Hannibal', and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy.",7,6,16,17 August 2012
X-Men: First Class," While not the best of the Marvel films, it's highly entertaining and fun.
","I am not a comic book fan. I like films based on the characters but unlike my oldest daughter and many in the audience, I was not looking to see if this movie is exactly like the X-Men comics. So, if you are such a fan, I might not be the best reviewer to read. However, I did notice that this movie pretty much ignored this hard-core audience. Unlike practically every Marvel film for the bast decade or two, there was no cameo by Stan Lee--none. And, unlike the typical Marvel film, Fox chose not to include any special extras scene at the end of this film (though there was a cute cameo with Wolverine part-way through the film). Because of this, I felt bad for the audience, as I saw it at the midnight show on opening night--and could see and hear the hard-core fans' disappointment--in particular because there was no appearance by Lee. According to my insanely devoted daughter, she read Lee's tweets and apparently he was never even asked to do a cameo for 'X-Men: First Class'! Sadly, the film seems only intended for the casual viewer when just a tiny bone would have pleased the fan base.Now as for the film itself, it was great. The script was highly imaginative and managed to incorporate real-life events into the X-Man universe. Little did I realize that the Cuban Missile Crisis was actually instigated by the Xs!! In addition to a dandy script (where, incidentally, it sure looked like there was a love connection brewing between Xavier and Magneto), I liked the acting, action and pace. At well over two hours, I was happy as there were no obvious lags.However, being a natural born complainer, there was one other big thing that bothered me. There was a great black X-Man character but he was handled horribly--and I could see the black audience feeling alienated by some DUMB decisions in the film. First, in one scene, the word 'slave' is used--and the camera pans directly on the black character! Second, only minutes later, the black guy was DEAD!!!! This is an offensive cliché---and although I am NOT a politically correct nut, it was obvious and ticked me off, as it was totally unnecessary. Could this have been handled better...heck, yeah!! A minor thing that bothered me (I am a retired history teacher) is that many of the characters' hair styles were from 1962 but many were also straight from 2011. Another minor one is the use of songs that didn't yet exist--such as WWII soldiers listening to Edith Piaf's 'La Via En Rose'--a song that came out in 1946--a year after the war. These were a bit sloppy but were minor mistakse. Still, it is a good film--well worth seeing and fun--just a few mistakes short of perfect.",8,3,8,3 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!
","I never had any intention of watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey'...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now 'Fifty Shades' is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of 'The Last Airbender') in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says 'If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week'. In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole 'Fifty Shades' phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",3,3,9,25 September 2018
Win Win," Stick with this one.....it does get better the longer you watch.
","'Win Win' is an unusual film because it starts out VERY slowly and I even considered turning it off--and yet I am glad I didn't. The further the film progressed, the better it got. Part of the reason it went so slowly is that I had a very hard time relating to the leading character (played by Paul Giamatti)---and it's hard staying focused on such a jerky guy. But, it also was just very slow. The film managed to soften this guy a tad but more importantly it brought in other characters and situations that made you care--and want to see how it all works out by the end.Giamatti plays a lawyer whose practice is on the rocks. To earn some extra money, he does something unethical--he gets the court to appoint him guardian for an elderly client with the promise that he would not have the old guy (Burt Young) committed to a nursing facility but keep him home. But, instead he quickly puts the guy in an old folks home and collects a monthly stipend for being the guardian. Nice guy, huh? On the side, Giamatti works as a wrestling coach for a high school team that is just terrible. However, out of the blue, Young's grandson shows up and has no place to live--so the Coach takes him home. He and his wife soon learn that this teen has no place to live because his mom is an addict. The coach also learns, to his surprise, that the boy is a marvel at wrestling--so good, he might be good enough to get a scholarship to college! Things are looking great despite Giamatti's deception...but when the boy's mother shows up looking for money, all that they are working for appears in jeopardy.Overall, despite the spicy language (which is a #$&@! shame since it would be great for teens to see this film and some parents might balk at this), this was an excellent film. It also shows you can like a film even if the leading man is very difficult (at first) to like. It is because you really do care for the kid and his relationships (such as with Giamatti's wife and best friend) are touching. I also liked it because of my insights into some of the film--I wrestled for several years and was a social worker who worked with families just like the one in the film--and it felt honest. The filmmakers did their homework and portrayed both very, very well. Well worth your time.",8,1,1,22 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Dark....incredibly dark.
","I am not a huge comic book-based movie fan, though I see most all of them. That's because my daughter is nuts for comic book movies and we always seem to see them. Some I have loved ('Scott Pilgrim', 'The Dark Knight' and 'Captain America' come to mind) and some I didn't ('Daredevil')--but mostly I do enjoy them. While I am sure I am bucking the tide here, I was NOT especially thrilled with 'The Dark Knight Rises'. This doesn't mean I disliked it--it just left me a bit flat. Now the problem was NOT the movie's length--I like longer films and my butt didn't fall asleep during the film (which is a very good sign)! My problems were more about the incredibly dark tone of the film. Unlike 'The Dark Knight', 'The Dark Knight Rises' really lacked fun and was 100% devoid of any humor to break up the dark mood. In fact, I kept hoping Tony Stark ('Ironman') would do a crossover from the Marvel films and lighten the mood! Stark (Robert Downey) managed to do a Bruce Wayne-like character but infuse him with energy and likability--Christian Bale just seemed tired and limp and humorless. This was more obvious in this film as opposed to the last because there was no Joker-like villain to provide comic relief (albeit darkly comic). The closest they got was Catwoman (Anne Hathaway)--who was a GREAT character but who wasn't really necessary for the plot. As for Bane and his friends, they were scary and nasty...and nothing more. When the film was over, I realized I had a reasonably good time but nothing more. If some other director and actor pick up the franchise, my advise is work more on the characters--make them more likable and interesting--even the villains.",7,10,21,28 July 2012
Iron Man," Considering I am not much of a fan of superhero movies, this one is a success
","I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character 'Pepper Potts' appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term 'Pepperpot' to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged 'ladies'.UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.",9,2,6,12 April 2009
Tombstone," While it still promotes some of the old west myths, it's far more accurate than most westerns.
","In movie westerns, there were shootouts all the time, Indian attacks and chaos. Well, this is true...in films. But in reality, the west was not so lawless and things like the shootout at the OK Corral were the exception rather than the rule. So, when you watch 'Tombstone' understand that in many ways it is more historically accurate than most westerns but it still presents an image of western life that isn't really true....at least not for the average person living out west back in the day. So, when you watch the movie, just understand that it represents an exception...not the rule. And, while this might surprise you, the famed shootout wasn't even seen as anything that important when it happened...and it was only because of Wyatt Earp's publicizing it so much in the 1920s and 30s that we think it was some big to do today.The film is a modern and more adult version of a western. There is a LOT of realistic blood and gore...which there would have been in shootouts (WHEN and IF they occurred). It's certainly NOT a film for kids and is one I recommend but only for adults who know what they're getting into...it's unrelentingly tough and violent. This is much unlike other versions of the story (such as 'My Darling Clementine' and 'Gunfight at the OK Corral')...and for added realism, Doc Holliday looks awful...which he should have looked like since he was dying from Tuberculosis. Overall, very unpleasant but very well made.",8,1,2,12 February 2020
The Emperor's New Groove," A nice time-passer worth your time
","Okay, it's a fact that not every Disney full-length cartoon can be as magical and transcendent as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, BAMBI or LITTLE MERMAID. So because some other full-length Disney films such as LILO AND STITCH and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE are a bit of a let-down isn't a bad thing nor does it mean they are bad films--it's just that these other films are so perfect that you can't help but make comparisons. Fortunately, the intended audience for this film (kids) don't usually make this comparison and I was just happy that the movie didn't make the history teacher within me scream like it did when I saw POCAHONTAS! The movie is about a selfish Incan leader. While anachronisms and historical inaccuracies might have been a problem, Disney wisely made the time period very vague and it's pure fantasy. Sure, witches like the one played by Eartha Kitt did not exist in ancient Peru, but it was obvious to everyone watching that this was not meant to be a history lesson--just silly fun with a decent central message. Just sit back and enjoy this cute little time-passer.",7,1,3,10 June 2007
Blade Runner," I just don't get it....
","I admit right up front that I am perplexed by this film and my review will no doubt annoy a lot of fans of this film. Let's face it, 'Blade Runner' is a cult film--and those who like it usually don't just like it--they adore it. I've known several people who insist rather rabidly that it's one of the greatest films of all time. And, when I tell them that I don't particularly like the film, they are confused---'how could anyone not love the film?' often say. In one case, the film lover insisted that I borrow his Director's Cut (one of about 17 different Director's Cuts or Special Editions, I think) because I must have been mistaken. Well, after my second viewing, I did enjoy and appreciate the film a bit more. But I still didn't get the devotion to this film it often receives.Here is what I liked and didn't like about the film. It had great sets and was VERY other-worldly. While I think the print was a bit too dark, I understand this was done to fit the very dark mood of the film. However, I just felt the film was too dark--oppressively dark...even sadistically dark (such as the eye gouging scene). It completely depressed me--so much so that I found I just didn't like or care about anyone. And, to top it off, the film ended very badly. The director's original ending (where you learn that Harrison Ford's character is also a replicant) would have been so much better. So, this is one case where the Director's Cut is definitely better, as this original ending has been restored. Overall, the film looks impressive and is original--but these alone were not enough for me to give it a glowing endorsement. It's good but that is all.",6,10,26,2 January 2012
Bruce Almighty," An agreeable time-passer for those who usually hate Jim Carey's over-acting
","Okay, I won't keep it a secret. I am not a fan of Jim Carey and think most of his films are designed for a very undiscerning audience (especially teens). Subtle, they are NOT! However, I did mildly like BRUCE ALMIGHTY--mostly because Carey's usual ranting and raving is under some control. This still isn't Masterpiece Theater, but it's a far cry from DUMB AND DUMBER or ACE VENTURA!! I think what I liked best about the film (other than restraining Carey) was that this film had an actual plot and a message--and surprisingly enough, one that probably WON'T offend most religious people despite its premise. Bruce is a self-centered jerk who tends to blame God for his problems instead of looking at his own contributions to his predicaments. Again and again, he says it's all God's fault that his life is a mess. Apparently, God has a sense of humor and approaches Bruce with a proposition--'if you can do better then the job is yours!' As an almighty deity, Bruce does not do that many funny things that you probably didn't see in the film's previews a few years back. But, he does learn a valuable lesson and the film is pretty entertaining, though slight in its aspirations. A very good time-passer, but not as interesting or having lasting appeal like THE TRUMAN SHOW.",7,1,3,25 November 2006
The Greatest Showman," I know a lot of folks loved this film....but it just didn't work for me. For me, it was an assault on my senses and painful to watch.
","'The Greatest Showman' is a highly fictionalized, colorful and loud bio-pic about P.T. Barnum, the 19th century showman who helped create the circus experience we're all familiar with today. I know some people who absolutely adored 'The Greatest Showman' and it has a very respectable score on IMDB of 7.7....yet, surprisingly, I hated the film...so much I eventually turned it off. Perhaps it's due to my age...perhaps I am a curmudgeon...all I know is that the film was too intense, too brash and too loud for me. Now it's NOT because I dislike musicals...far from it. But this one is so in your face and abrasive that you'll likely either find yourself pulled into it OR you'll feel like screaming because it's an assault on all your senses....I am in that second group. The film simply had too few quieter moments and was more like a rock concert by musicians on crack than an enjoyable movie. It looks great...but induces headaches because of the film's intensity. A horrid viewing experience for me and my lovely wife.",2,37,72,14 July 2018
Monsters University," I guess that for once I was easy to please!
","' Monsters University' is a new film from Pixar that is a prequel to their film 'Monsters Inc.'. In addition to the two main characters, a whole lot of new characters are introduced at the college that Mike and Sully attended. The plot involves Mike trying to become a 'scaring major'—something quite unthinkable since he isn't the least bit scary. There's a lot more to the film than this, but I won't spoil it by saying more about the plot.My daughter was lucky enough to go to the debut of 'Monsters University'. She liked it but also felt the story was disappointing since it lacked original characters and the story reminded her of too many college films (like 'Revenge of the Nerds' and 'Animal House'). My wife saw it with me and she said that the film put her to sleep! This is all very odd, as I am usually the most difficult to please in the family when it comes to films—yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film and nearly gave it a 9. While I would agree it lacks originality, it did make me smile. It was a nice, gentle film—one that I didn't mind just watching without picking it apart (like I usually do). Much of this is because the CGI was simply gorgeous and It was a pleasure watching such a beautiful filmas well as such a nice and enjoyable film.",8,67,85,23 June 2013
Ben-Hur," If you're going to watch one Biblical epic, this is the one
","It's odd, but during the 1950s, Hollywood made a huge number of Biblical epics--most of which were pretty wretched films. SAMSON AND DELILAH and David AND BATHSHEBA quickly come to mind, but even the more respected TEN COMMANDMENTS was, despite all the hype, a pretty lousy film--with cardboard characters and silly writing. Even QUO VADIS was a pretty uninspired film, despite the violent nature of the film. So, in light of this, I am so happy to say that a Biblical epic CAN be exceptional and worth seeing! What makes BEN-HUR so worth while? Well, of course the film does contain some of the very greatest (if not the greatest) action scenes of all-time. You just can't do better than the unbelievable chariot race sequence for excitement and spectacle. Even the naval battle scene is great despite it being filmed with large models--it's state of the art for the time it was made. In addition to the spectacle, it also handles the religious aspects of the film in a less heavy-handed manner than most of its contemporaries. You do see Jesus from behind throughout the film and you do not hear him speak--instead, the film focuses on Jesus' teachings on others. And, while they do not show the resurrection, you are not left with the impression that he stayed dead like the 1925 version--a definite No-No for a Biblical film! Now as for the acting, it was generally exceptional--especially from Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith. I also liked Charlton Heston in the title role, but I could see how some might see this performance as a bit more wooden. Also, there are times (especially at the very beginning and end) where the pacing is just too slow. However, given the exceptional nature of the film on every other level, this can easily be forgiven and the film is a truly magnificent work--not to be missed by any true fan of film.",10,7,14,28 December 2006
Casino Royale," Perfect? Of course not, but it's the closest I've seen to Ian Fleming's novels
","For many years, I have longed to see a James Bond series actually based on the books. While some of the Bond films have been a lot of fun, most have practically nothing to do with the great Ian Fleming novels. Sadly, in a few cases (such as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE), about the only similarity between the books and the movies were the titles! In fact, the original CASINO ROYALE was a horrid film in practically every way except for the music. While some of the characters were retained, the movie was an abysmal mess--a very high budget and confusing mess. It was purported to be a comedy, though practically none of the film was funny and like YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the plot was impossible to follow and bore no similarity to the book. Fans of Ian Fleming usually twitch with disgust at even hearing the title of this god-awful film--thank goodness someone FINALLY wanted to do the Fleming novel some justice!In the books, Bond was a bourbon drinking, chain-smoking assassin. CASINO ROYALE was the first book and Bond was his most human in it. In the book, Bond struggled with guilt over the many people he'd killed--and they were NOT killed in crazy and exotic ways like they were in most of the movies. Most were either shot or killed with his bare hands. Bond was, above all else, a killer--not quite as sexy or sophisticated as he was in the films. While Craig isn't quite the same as Fleming's Bond (he's missing the scar down his cheek), he's much closer to the novels than any prior Bond incarnation. I miss that Bond and am glad that, in part, the new CASINO ROYALE finally features much of this cold-blooded and flawed character.Now I do understand that EON Productions couldn't repeat the novel completely--heck, it was set in the early 1950s and many allowances needed to be made for current events. And as far as the updates went, they generally were in the same spirit as the original movie and the cat and mouse game between Le Chiffre and Bond is essentially that of the novel.All this does NOT mean that the movie will only appeal to those who read the books. There are still many exciting chase scenes and stunts like you'd expect to see in a Bond film but fortunately Bond didn't seem so invincible. Daniel Craig's version of Bond could apparently do what the prior Bonds could do, but you'll notice throughout the film that he's cut and bruised--not exactly a man of steel. I loved this and it did tend to make the unrealness of the stunts seem a tad more believable. Plus, again, Fleming would be thrilled as several stories he wrote talked about the toll on Bond's body.The film was well-constructed, stunt heavy but not enough to alienate purists like myself and intelligently written. About the only people who will strongly dislike this film are those who are looking for a reincarnation of Sean Connery or Roger Moore. Craig certainly doesn't look or act like either of these two guys. While I could easily imagine Connery's or Moore's characters sipping martinis while engaged in gay banter with their arch-enemies, Craig is more the type you'd expect to beat the enemies to death with his bare hands--like a REAL government assassin. Wow, do I like the change!PS--The Aston Martin DBS V12 in this movie is a gorgeous car and it should be with a base price of $265,000. In the film, it is destroyed and I truly hope this was a model or something other than one of these great sports cars--it would be tragic if they really did in this car!",9,13,22,6 April 2008
Toy Story 3," Technically brilliant and enjoyable but it still left me a bit flat.
","You should by all means see this film--it is quite enjoyable and Pixar should be proud. And, a week after its debut, the film has earned $2138123413713471035 dollars (more or less)--so it's obviously a huge hit. And, I did enjoy the film....BUT. There's that nagging 'but'...a certain odd something that I felt was lacking in the film. Personally, I STILL prefer 'Toy Story 2' and 'Up'. I also am a bit concerned whether this is the best film for the youngest members of the audience.Technically speaking, this is probably the best looking CG movie made to this point--though I am sure in the next few years they'll manage to exceed this one--that's the nature of things. There are so many scenes where you just marvel at all the elements--there is just so much to see and your eyes just delight in this. One of the examples are the amazing daycare scenes--with so many toys, kids and knick-knacks about the rooms, you can't believe the Pixar folks could do it! The other is is the scene at Bonnie's yard at the end of the film--the colors, textures and depth were just mind-blowing. It was first-rate in just about every way technically, though the 3-D aspects were very good but not great. Yes, they looked nice but they weren't 100% necessary to the film and didn't seem to use e 3-D to its fullest (like they did in 'How To Train Your Dragon'--a film that did manage to use the 3-D as more than just a nice novelty).As for the plot, I really don't want to recapitulate what's in the film. There have already been a ton of IMDb reviews that have done a very good job of detailing the plot. Instead, let's talk about I think this was actually a bit weak. Sure, the old characters were mostly back and I loved a few of the new ones (Ken was great), but the film had a dark and slightly unsavory element to it that bothered me. A lot of families would naturally bring kids to see it--kids too young not to be terrified. While another recent CG movie was terrifying ('Coraline'), as least it was not rated G and did not have the family-friendly aura about it. In this films, the problems were not like they were in 'Toy Story 2'--whether or not the toys could make it home. Here in '3', they not only struggled with this but also were often in jeopardy of being completely destroyed--either shredded or incinerated!! Also, while they didn't bother me at all, a couple of the new characters were downright creepy--such as the baby and the crazed monkey! Yikes--imagining a 3 or 4 year-old seeing this makes my skin crawl! Aside from these concerns, I have to hand it to the film. It was highly manipulative and will make you shed a tear--even if they are only toys! And, it certainly was lovely--real eye-candy!UPDATE: This film just won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. In addition, it's now #31 on IMDb's Top 250. Considering it's a sequel, I just don't get this....",8,7,11,26 June 2010
Trainspotting," Well made but thoroughly unpleasant.
","'Trainspotting' is currently #154 on IMDb's Top 250 list. As an insane film buff, I have been trying to watch as many of the movies from the list as possible and have seen about 235 of them However, now the ones I have left to watch are mostly films I normally would have no interest in seeing--so at the outset, I am not the most favorably disposed person towards this film. After all, I don't have a lot of interest in seeing a film about a bunch of loser heroin addicts--and that is the theme of 'Trainspotting'.Some who watched this film felt it was a comedy--I noticed this when reading through the reviews. However, I really didn't find this film funny nor do I think most would think it funny. I guess my definition of funny isn't watching people injecting heroin, babies dying of neglect and people crapping themselves. You'll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film. While director Danny Boyle did a good job of making it all seem realistic, the film was so repellent that I can't understand its popular appeal. And now that I finished watching it, I am thinking twice about my crazy notion of seeing all 250. Gross and unappealing.",3,7,26,31 January 2014
Space Jam," It's okay...but I am not the target audience.
","A group of brightly colored slug-like animated creatures want to take all the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet. However, Bugs convinces them to give them an opportunity to win their freedom and so he challenges them to a basketball game...not knowing that the slugs were not averse to a lot of cheating. After stealing the talents from some of the best NBA players, it's just the Looney Tunes characters AND Michael Jordan against the super-nasty slugs.A friend of mine, Angelo, insisted that I should watch 'Space Jam', as it's apparently a movie he loves. Well, on his insistence I watched the movie and found it mildly enjoyable and not much more. On the other hand, I am NOT the target audience, as I am not a basketball fan and I like my Looney Tunes cartoons like they were long ago...without all the modern sensibilities and CGI. This really is NOT a slam against the film...I am sure a lot of younger folks would enjoy it and the film made a lot of money (especially abroad). For me, it just didn't resonate and if I want to see a film that integrates cartoons with real life, I'd rather see 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.",6,2,4,8 November 2019
La Vie En Rose," An excellent performance but that's all that really hooked me about this film
","This film is a biography of the late French singer and actress Edith Piaf. While not known very well in the US, she was a huge star in France and throughout Europe in the 1940s and 50s. The film explores much of her life, though oddly, it seems to miss a few details which might have been interesting--such as the entire second world war and what Miss Piaf did during a 10 year stretch from about 1938-1948.The leading lady in this film, Marion Cotillard, did an amazing job and deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as Edith Piaf. Oddly, however, is that although this was a very good performance, the film itself wasn't particularly involving. It's a testament to Ms. Cotillard's performance that she won the Best Actress award given that she was in a film that was only slightly above average as I have probably seen hundreds of better French films. Now I am sure that there are many Edith Piaf fans out there that may be enraged by my saying this, but the film lacks one very important quality I like to see in any bio-pic--and that is likability. From what I could see, although the film helped us to understand why Ms. Piaf became who she was, it didn't encourage me to care one bit about the rather obnoxious and unlikable lady. Sure, she was a French institution and lovely singer, but the film makes her seem like a shallow and self-indulgent fool--treating those around her horribly, having an affair with a married man and using alcohol and drugs with reckless abandon. Because of these problems and the great length of the film, I found myself wanting for the character to just die so I could stop watching the movie. I would probably feel much the same way about a film about Billie Holiday or Judy Garland--two great American singers who led similarly self-destructive lives.",7,0,2,17 May 2008
Pitch Perfect 3," Beyond just jumping the shark!
","I am not the sort of person who you'd expect to watch any of the 'Pitch Perfect' films. However, my daughter begged me to try and I actually did enjoy 1 and 2. They were fun and non-demanding films....a nice change of pace from the often serious foreign films I often watch. So, it's not surprising that this 50-something guy decided to see the third movie in the franchise.My biggest feeling while seeing 'Pitch Perfect 3' was that they've 'jumped the shark'. If you aren't familiar with the phrase, it's a reference to the TV show 'Happy Days' and refers to when it (and other shows or franchises) have peaked and they are desperately trying to keep your attention by doing awful things with the characters, such as introducing Cousin Oliver on 'The Brady Bunch' or having Fonzie jump a pool full of sharks in his motorcycle. Instead of the semi-believable plots like there were in 1 and 2, the writers had obviously run out of ideas and were grasping at straws here. After all, what else would explain Amy having a super-villain father who kidnaps the A Capella group?? And, this is made worse with plot elements like bee attacks, more crude language and a strong emphasis on making the group sort of like hiphop stars! 
Overall, this is a very badly written and even embarrassing film...one that seems cynical and has little regard to the fans who embraced and enjoyed the series.",2,1,4,18 April 2018
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A more fact-based follow-up to 'Elizabeth'
","'Elizabeth' is an enjoyable film, though much of it was supposition and fiction. The intrigues and personal lives of folks of that time are really unknown in many ways and so the filmmakers too liberties with history--embellishing it here and there to make it seem more exciting. Here with the follow-up film, however, 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is less about intrigues and persons and more about grand events--and as such is much more factual and better history.This film has three main plot themes. First is the ultimate execution of Mary Queen of Scots. This is covered superficially--perhaps because the film was about her cousin, Elizabeth. Regardless, what sort of woman she was isn't really alluded to (she was a rather awful person). Second, her relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh. Exactly how close it was is open to conjecture, but the film sure got it right that the Queen did not respond well to his secret marriage to another. Third, the climactic battle with the Spanish Armada. This is very grand, though exactly how the Spanish lost and how the weather did far more damage than the English navy isn't really discussed. Of course, me being a retired history teacher, I look for these things and assume the average viewer will not.The film is beautiful to look at, is a bit sterile when it comes to much of the acting and is engaging--though I assume not to a large percentage of the folks out there. If you like historical bio-pics, you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, you might find it a bit confusing and occasionally ponderous. As for me, I slightly preferred it to the prequel.",7,1,2,11 December 2013
The Deer Hunter," An exceptional film...and with some indications of Cimino's later undoing...
","THE DEER HUNTER is an extraordinary film--there's no denying that. However, I looked at this film from a slightly different perspective than many, as I first had a chance to watch director Cimino's mega-epic, HEAVEN'S GATE (one of Hollywood's biggest money-losers ever). I am glad I saw this later film first, as it forced me to look for the seeds of the director's downfall--even in his greatest triumph, the five-time Oscar winner, THE DEER HUNTER. Despite THE DEER HUNTER being considered a classic and one of the great films of the 1970s, it was not without minor faults--faults that would become much, much more apparent later in HEAVEN'S GATE.The biggest problem was pacing and editing but the film was so good that you could excuse it. Some parts of the film were long and brilliantly done. The scenes in Vietnam were, if anything, too short--but very, very compelling. The scenes leading up to Vietnam (such as the wedding), however, went on way too long--seeming to place about equal emphasis on this rather banal and unimportant part of the film as the later and much more important part. Editing down the first hour a bit and perhaps even adding some more footage of Vietnam (or leaving it as it was) instead would have been a good thing. Additionally, having the characters act LESS like obnoxious jerks at the beginning would have helped as well--the characters didn't grab you right out of the gate. Both problems were significantly worse in HEAVEN'S GATE--the prologue went on for what seems like days and the characters were even more obnoxious! And, while THE DEER HUNTER comes in at a hefty 182 minutes, this long and slow pacing became interminably long in the followup film--clocking in at an astronomical 219 minutes!! In other words, Cimino only followed his own pattern from THE DEER HUNTER in the next film but expanded it even further--probably the result of his own success he felt he was onto something. However, these complaints do NOT say I am knocking THE DEER HUNTER--I am just saying that these tiny complaints became serious problems in HEAVEN'S GATE.As far as the good in the THE DEER HUNTER goes, the acting is amazing, the direction (though slow) was very good, the music terrific and moving and the film grabs your attention. While I was not quite as bowled over by it as some, you cannot reasonably deny it is a standout film--even with pacing issues and any complaints about the ubiquity of Russian Roulette in Vietnam (geez...what are the chances of TWO games like this or a Russian Roulette league--especially since many doubt that such goings on ever happened in the first place) or there being an elk in Pennsylvania (which, by the way, looks like the Rocky Mountains--which it actually is and 2500 miles from where the hunt in the film was supposed to be). A must-see for anyone who considers themselves to be a film aficionado. Just be aware that the violence is intense and disturbing and the language is amazingly spicy for a 1970s film.",9,4,8,8 December 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," While not exactly true, it is a smashingly good film.
","Before I go any further in my review, I must point out that the film is NOT a 100% accurate portrait of P.L. Travers or the work they needed to bring Mary Poppins to the screen. It is NOT historically accurate in several instances* but overall it is still a very, very good film. Had the film been a bit closer to the truth, I would have scored it higher, as the retired history teacher within me bristles with the notion of changing a few facts in order to tell a better story.The film is about the rather difficult time the Disney people had in getting the film 'Mary Poppins' made. This is because the author was VERY protective of her character and insisted on having full control over just about everything. In some instances this was good but often it seemed that P.L. Travers just wanted to 'win'--such her insistence that the color red not appear in the film! Unreasonable, abrasive and fussy--the film shows the process from start to finish as Walt and his team worked with a very difficult woman to get a classic film made. And, ultimately, it appeared as if the Disney folks just did what they wanted despite her many, many objections (though this is downplayed a bit in the film).The movie is a wonderful character study and seeing Emma Thompson playing such a strange and emotionally damaged person was fascinating. As for Tom Hanks playing Walt, while his part might seem a lot easier to play (since he was by most accounts human unlike Travers), I appreciated how Disney did NOT make him 100% perfect and sanitized (like many of the books they've produced about the man). In this, he is a bit of a schemer and smokes---making him much more approachable to the average viewer.In addition, while the film isn't 100% true, it's mostly true and really, really manipulates the viewer (in a positive way). The film, as a result, is quite draining and often sad. My recommendation is that you indeed watch it but have a few Kleenex on hand just in case.*A few of the 'creative changes' done to the story that differed from reality would include Travers' trip to Disneyland with Walt (which never occurred), Walt's trip to England to persuade her to agree to terms (which never occurred) and Travers loving the film in the end (she STILL hated it and did cry when she saw it at the premier because she hated it so much!!). I know of a few other instances of creative changes but you kind of get the idea. However, overall, the spirit of the film is still pretty close to the true story.",8,1,3,9 January 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Well made...but either enough to make it funny nor enough to make it a serious drama.
","I love Taika Waititi's work...so it's not too surprising that I'd want to see 'Jojo Rabbit'...his latest and strangest film project. His previous work, such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and 'What We Do in the Shadows', really impressed me. In light of this, it's very sad that I wasn't particularly impressed with 'Jojo'....though I must admit it was well crafted.The problem for me is that the film really ISN'T a drama nor a comedy. A few things, such as Sam Rockwell's outfit near the end of the film, simply are surreal and senseless. If you're looking for a hilarious movie, well, with all the death and Hitler in it, it's not the least bit funny. If you want a serious drama about the final months of the Third Reich, well, the film is often too light and carefree....an unusual case where the movie fails on both accounts with me. This being said, the reviews for this film are incredibly positive and you may well enjoy it....but for me, it's STILL too soon to be making Hitler-fied films like this one...especially since, unlike 'The Producers', it really isn't funny.",5,4,7,9 April 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I think my enjoyment of the film was damaged by all the hype....
","When 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' debuted, there was a lot of hubbub about it. People were abuzz about it at Cannes and people talked about it at Oscar time. So, naturally, I assumed it must have been a heck of a good film--not a slightly better than average film with some slightly creepy characters. Yes, I say slightly creepy because the stop-motion characters look quite a bit like dead stuffed animals. Plus there simply have been so many animated films that looked more technically advanced. This one seemed more like a cast-off from the old days of stop-motion--which isn't all bad, as it IS interesting if old fashioned.The story is about a thrill-seeking fox who loves to take chances--though he seems to forget that he has a family back home. At the same time, there's an inspiring plot (or at least that's what the formula dictates) about the wimpy son of this fox needing to prove himself. Both these plot come together when three local entrepreneurs get sick of Mr. Fox stealing from them again and again. Much of the final half of the film involves the foxes and other animals all trying to avoid getting killed by these men--and the young fox (not unexpectedly) proving his worth.Really, there's nothing too extraordinary about this film--the animation or the story. The only outstanding things are the expensive actors that were employed to provide the voices. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable film for older kids and adults alike--though I do think it's a bit too dark for younger audiences.By the way, you might think I am crazy for making this comparison, but right after seeing the much-praised 'Fantastic Mr. Fox', I watched a film with no real distribution at all (Disney basically killed the film and released it straight to video) that had no critical acclaim (1996's 'The Wind in the Willows') and found I much preferred the lower budget latter film. It was simply more fun...something I felt was missing at times from 'Fox'.",7,4,6,17 October 2010
Amélie," Just plain weird...and I mean that in a good way.
","Considering that there are a bazillion reviews for this film already, I really don't think it's that important that I do an in-depth review of this film. It is already well in the top 100 films on IMDb, so it's obviously a very good film.Instead of the usual view of the film, I'll talk about it from a psychological perspective. Amélie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an Avoidant Personality. This means that she's so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from them--particularly anyone who could become intimate. In other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperation--hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. So, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help others--but always at a distance and anonymously. Most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strange--but ultimately very helpful and kind. In one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passive-aggressive actions. Fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also Avoidant (his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others)...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?! Aside from the psychological aspects of the film, I really appreciated the look of the film. The odd 1930s style of Amélie's clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors (with lots of sepia tones), the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks (such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life) all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget.Overall, a delight. Oddly, however, despite the very high rating, I think that Audrey Tautou mas made better films, such as HE LOVES ME...HE LOVES ME NOT and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT.",9,5,13,7 June 2009
Moonrise Kingdom," Aside from a few minor quibbles, an amazingly original film that's worth your time.
","My daughter went to see 'Moonrise Kingdom' some time back and she said she felt out of sync with the hype for the film. While she liked it, she didn't think it was as brilliant or wonderful and reviews would indicate. Too often this is the case with very good films. The reviews are SO glowing that you feel let down when you finally see it ('The Artist' was such a film for me). My experience was a bit difference. Now that I heard how she thought the film was overrated, I expected less from the film--and perhaps this helped me like it more. Now this is not to say I adored the film--it had a few minor problems. Sometimes the incredibly overly restrained acting annoyed me--as I know this was very deliberate but it also occasionally frustrated me--especially with Bill Murray whose one style of acting in recent films has been to pretend he's a zombie. Otherwise, though, this is a must-see picture. Even with its overly mannered style (the singing, the flatness of affect, etc.), the story is so wildly original that it is still very captivating. I wanted to see more when it ended--and that's a good sign.",9,3,9,11 November 2012
The Sixth Sense," Brilliantly crafted and well worth seeing....unless some idiot told you THE secret!
","I am making 100% sure I don't in any way reveal the surprise twist in this film--too many have and I think those people are evil. So, if you know THE twist, you'll probably not enjoy the film nearly as much when you first see it. But, if you haven't, it's a heck of an enjoyable film.Haley Joel Osment delivers a truly amazing performance considering his age. He is THE reason the film works as well as it does and I wish the Oscar folks had given him some sort of special award to honor his great work. And, in addition, I can't believe I am saying this, but Bruce Willis and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, were at the top of their game as well. The other huge star here is the writing--and it was superb because it was so original, creative and the story bears many repeated viewings as each one reveals yet another layer of complexity.By the way, while nominated for six Oscars, the movie somehow won none. Instead, the darkly cynical 'American Beauty' carried off five of the trophies--though I really didn't think this winner was nearly as good a movie. Good, yes...but not great like 'The Sixth Sense'....provided some moron didn't tell you THE secret.",10,2,6,11 July 2011
The Producers," A nearly flawless comedy
","This is Mel Brooks' first and best film. It combined great writing, outlandish sensibilities and top-notch acting. Everything just worked together flawlessly.As far as acting goes, this was the first of several brilliant movies for Gene Wilder (followed up by Young Frankenstein, Start the Revolution Without Me and Willie Wonka), though the movie was really the showpiece for Zero Mostel! Mostel plays Max Bialystock, a washed up Broadway producer who seduces VERY old ladies to finance his long series of flops. Wilder is his assistant who helps him plan the ultimate caper---to deliberately produce the world's WORST play and sell 25,000% of it (since it will fail--who needs to pay off the elderly backers?). Unfortunately, despite their finding the worst play imaginable ('Springtime for Hitler'), the worst director and worst actor, it is taken by the audiences as great camp and the play becomes an unexpected success!! And then, the fun begins! This movie is simply great. It is unconventional, but not quite as much as some of my other favorites (such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Strange Brew), so MOST viewers (if they give it a chance) will enjoy this.",10,1,3,29 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A slightly more adult Star Wars that shows Lucas was right to let go of the series.
","I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON'T want to talk about the plot of 'The Force Awakens'-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don't think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.",10,69,203,18 December 2015
Cinderella," I think they made the most considering the subject matter.
","'Cinderella' is among my wife's favorite Disney films and there is a lot to like about it. Although Cinderella herself is among the dullest characters (a problem with too many Disney princesses), the supporting characters are great. The step-mother is wickedly wonderful and Cinderella's friends, the mice, are delightful. It also is nicely animated and has some great songs that have lasted for many decades. But it also is not nearly as lovely to look at some of the earlier Disney films such as 'Bambi' and 'Pinocchio' and lacks their artistry. Additionally, my biggest complaint is that the subject matter is way, way too familiar. EVERYONE knows the story and there is little in the way of surprises. It's very good and is probably close to as good as anyone could do with the material.",8,4,6,31 December 2014
RED," It's not at all the type of film I normally watch, but I liked it.
","I some ways, I am not the best person to watch this film. While I have reviewed over 12500 movies so far, practically none of them were action films. It's one of my least favorite genres and to me, a lot of them look the same. I don't particularly care about explosions, machismo and the like. So why did I watch it? My uncle was in town and he wanted to see the film again...and I went on to be a good sport. Well, although the film didn't completely win me over to the genre, it was enjoyable and the sort of film a non-fan could enjoy.The film begins in a rather mundane way. Bruce Willis is living in his suburban home--talking on the phone to a customer service lady. It seems they talk a lot and you can tell he really likes her--and he tells her he's coming to her town soon. However, it occurs MUCH sooner than either expected--as men in black attack Willis' home and try to kill him! He dispatches them quickly--leading you to believe it ain't just an ordinary guy!! And, from here on, he and his lady friend embark on a crazy adventure with LOTS of secret agents trying to kill them! Why? See the film for yourself.'Red' works because the plot has some clever twists but more importantly because of some of the supporting characters--in particular the crazy guy played by John Malkovich. The film never takes itself all that seriously and has some clever moments--but, unfortunately, like too many films in the genre, a few too many explosions and gunfire exchanges (and practically NO ONE seems to die when 28408234012319 shots are fired). Not great but very good.",7,2,4,11 June 2012
Unbroken," Good, but the spiritual aspects of Zamperini's life seemed like they were de-emphasized.
","This film came out a few months ago, so by now there are quite a few reviews--so I'll try to make my comments brief. The film is a biography of the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini--as well as a few flashbacks to his life before the war. Zamperini was famous both for being an Olympic athlete as well as his being a prisoner of war in Japan--all of which he later wrote about in his biography. In it, he also talks about his difficulties coping with PTSD and anger towards his Japanese tormentors--as well as, with the help of God, he was able to let go of the anger and life a normal life. In many ways, this is extremely similar to another recent film, 'The Railway Man'--a film which, to me, is better and makes a much stronger emotional impact. What what did I like and dislike about the film? The aerial sequences were pretty amazing--particularly how they used wonderful CGI to make it appear as if Mitsubishi Zeros were attacking a formation of B-24 Liberator bombers. The story also was very interesting. But the film also seemed to be missing the spiritual and emotional side--and mostly only talked about this in the epilogue which was written only. In many ways, interesting but curiously uninvolving at times.",7,13,20,26 April 2015
Kagemusha," incredibly BIG and beautiful but also very sterile
","I have seen nearly all of Akira Kurosawa's films, so my opinion shouldn't be completely ignored. Although I am in the distinct minority, I didn't particularly like KAGEMUSHA. Yes, it was big and beautiful and had great scope but it was also emotionally sterile and bore little resemblance to Kurosawa's earlier, more famous works. The same, by the way, can be said about RAN. Both films had relatively HUGE budgets but the dialog and connectedness between the characters was lacking. As a result, I felt pretty bored when I watched both of them--especially this film. So, if you compare these two movies with THE 7 SAMURAI or YOJIMBO, for example, they seem VERY different. These older films, though not filmed in color, had a greater sense of humanity about them--great importance was placed on the INTERRELATIONSHIPS between the characters AND the camera work was very different, with more closeups and a more intimate feel. So, while RAN and KAGEMUSHA were pretty to look at, I felt much more detached from them and cared much less about the characters. I really think the problem with these two movies, and the reason I like them less than the average Kurosawa film, was that the big budget in these later films actually HURT them, as too much emphasis was placed on effects and dialog was purely secondary.So, in summary, I am the odd-ball that didn't love this film. You will probably disagree and might be tempted to mark my review as 'not helpful', as the reviews on IMDb are generally glowing. But having seen many Japanese films, I can't help but feel there are better films out there waiting to be seen. Most any other Kurosawa film, and films by other great directors (such as THE SAMURAI TRILOGY, the films of Yasujiro Ozu) are more appealing to me. I think the popularity of this film is in part due to its having been seen in theaters by more Westerners than any other of Kurosawa's films--SEEK OUT HIS EARLIER AND MID-CAREER FILMS--they are better and far more emotionally involving.",6,84,130,16 February 2006
Rear Window," yep--it's a good film,...but #14 on IMDb???
","This is a very good film--definitely one of Hitchcock's best films and very suspenseful. But when I noticed on IMDb that it is ranked #16I was shocked. I just can't accept that this is the 16th best movie out there. If you thought about it, I'm sure most everyone reading this would be able to pick more than 16 better films with little problem. Jimmy Stewart, the star of this film, himself probably did a hand full of other films that should be ranked higher than this movie (such as MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE MORTAL STORM, ANATOMY OF A MURDER and several others come to mind). Now my rant about it being over-rated is NOT to say this is a bad film. As far as suspense films go, it's one of the better ones and the only Hitchcock film I like more is NORTH BY NORTHWEST--and only by a shade. The acting is just fine, the script is excellent and the scares are intense. It's also amazingly innovative the way an entire New York neighborhood was recreated in a sound stage! Truly original and a must-see for suspense film buffs.",9,4,17,19 May 2006
Pitch Perfect," Turn off your brain and just enjoy....
","The most important thing you might wanna know about this review is that I am certainly NOT in the target demographic group for this film. As a 53 year-old man, I am not the type to ever watch 'Pitch Perfect' in the first place and did so only because my daughter insisted that it was a good film and I would enjoy it. And, fortunately, I did enjoy it quite a bit. Now I am NOT saying I think it's a great film, it certainly has its faults, but it is fun and entertaining.The film is about a capella singing....certainly not the sort of thing most of us enjoy or even care about...though the film manages to infuse the subject with enthusiasm. And, you'll soon find yourself moving along with the singing...and much of it is very infectious. And, the film is about most every stereotype I could think of when it comes to young adult films---you have the bossy and nasty leader of the group, the lesbian, the fat girl who is funny and the rest of the clichés (such as the final big number where not only do ALL the ladies know the lyrics BUT also the choreography of a song they NEVER practiced). But, it manages to make it enjoyable because it SAYS that these are stereotypes at times and the music is pretty cool. I could have done without all the vomit, however. Overall, this is a very watchable and enjoyable picture.",7,6,7,18 June 2017
The Truman Show," A good film for those who think they hate Jim Carey.
","I have never liked Jim Carey's humor. I have found it to very broad and boorish. However, I was very happy that I saw 'The Truman Show' and am surprised I did considering my feelings about his earlier 'comedies'. Thankfully, Carey showed he could act and NOT ham it up--a tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer. With a weak director, Carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways. Here, however, it's straight and quite endearing. I could talk about the plot, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one. The bottom line is that don't assume because you don't like 'Dumb and Dumber' or 'Ace Ventura' you won't love this film. And, I really loved 'The Truman Show' and think it's a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imagination.By the way, I would say the same things about Will Farrell and Adam Sandler. Despite disliking some of there very broad films, there serious films (such as 'Reign Over Me' or 'Stranger Than Fiction') are exceptional. Additionally, I gotta admit that I did enjoy a few of their 'stupid' films such as 'Water Boy' and 'Talladega Nights'. So don't assume that just because you may not like a few of their films means they all are not your cup of tea.",9,4,6,16 February 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," If you loved the first one, you'll love this one...
","When I went to see 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire', the audience's reaction was very strange. They were angry--angry that the film ended because they really, really wanted more! The film picks up soon after Katniss and Peeta successfully survive the games. Now, they are to be wined and dined and trotted out from one publicity appearance to another. However, the President (Donald Sutherland) is angry and exactly why, Katniss doesn't understand. All she knows is that he insists that she act happier, act like she is in love with Peeta and do NOTHING to make waves...or people she loves will die! What she doesn't know at first is that throughout the world, discontent has broken out since her victory in the games--and folks see her as a person to rally about, as she is a symbol of hope. So what do you do when you have a symbol of hope? You destroy it--and the President orders a NEW game to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the games...and this game will return Katniss and Peeta to the arena to compete against 22 other Hunger Games winners! It sure seems like certain death! By the time I saw this film, a zillion other people already did. So I won't discuss the plot any further nor will I offer than in-depth a review. Suffice to say it's a very high quality film just like the first. So, even with a different director, it carries on perfectly from the last. Excellent acting, action and a wonderful plot make this one worth seeing.By the way, if you are older, you might notice that there is a huge similarity between this film and the original 'Rollerball'. Both present a world where the leaders want to destroy hope--and in both cases, a hero arises who somehow manages to overcome this nihilistic and fatalistic fate. See them both and you'll see what I mean.",9,4,22,6 March 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Don't discount this movie simply because it's stupid!
","Most of you are probably familiar with the plot. It's about two dopey teens who are assisted by a time traveler to do a history project and get an A in their class. Otherwise, if they fail, the future will be irreparably damaged. In other words, their passing this class is THE pivotal point for mankind--if the boys blow it, the future will suck but if they pass it, it will usher in a new age for the human race!While it's all very hard to believe (given that Bill and Ted are idiots), you don't spend much time thinking about the impossibility of the situation because the movie is so fast-paced. The film literally jumps all over the place in time and eventually they meet up with a ton of famous people ranging from Lincoln to Joan of Arc to Billy the Kid to Freud!! And, in a completely improbable twist, all these characters agree to come to California in 1989 to help our unlikely heroes!Sometimes some people are too uptight and look down on films that are totally silly and mindless. Such comedies aren't sophisticated enough for them and the humor seems 'low' and possibly beneath them. As for the major critics, many often dismiss such a film or gave it a mediocre review without considering one very important factor--does it make you laugh? In other words, you can't just discount a film for being childish or dumb if it makes you laugh out loud. This is exactly the case with BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE. Sure, it is often pretty immature and silly...but it makes you laugh out loud--hard and often. And, as for most of us, there really are times we NEED to laugh and let go. I know that when my wife and I saw this film, our lives were pretty tough. We NEEDED a film like this to make us laugh and forget about our troubles. Watching a romance, drama or an Ingmar Bergman movie would not have done this! So before you sell this cute movie short or think I am an idiot for giving it a 9, just remember--it WILL make you laugh...again and again and again!",9,7,13,26 April 2009
The Matrix," Too much action, too many stunts...yet still an interesting story idea.
","There are currently almost 2800 reviews on IMDB for this film....and so what I have to say about the movie really isn't all that important. It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And, so much has been said about the film, I think I'll be rather brief.The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future, machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action, violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me, that left me rather tired when the film was over. I liked it...but I also didn't want any more and can't see me watching any of the sequels.",7,5,9,22 February 2018
Heat," Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?
","I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like 'Heat'. However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It's almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro's oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There's very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino's character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it's just me....Overall, if you don't mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.",9,3,5,23 April 2011
50_50," Joseph Gordon-Levitt has really come into his own....
","Considering that I am a guy who went through cancer treatment when I was 26, this film naturally hit close to home. On top of that, I could see a lot in the film that worked--stuff that really connect with what it's like to go through this hell (such as the horribly detached way the doctor broke the news to the guy about his illness). It sure helped that the writer, Will Reiser, had gone through this himself.Joseph Gordon-Levitt did not even register in most folks' minds until recently. He was just THAT kid from '3rd Rock'--a rather inconsequential series at that. However, recently he's blown a lot of people away given his breakout performances in 'Inception'. He's shown here in '50/50' that he can do well now as a star. This is quite a jump from his TV days as a scrawny kid.The film, as many people know, is about a guy who finds out he has cancer. The film is not the deepest thing--just one guy's experiences with the disease as well as the experiences of those around him. In some cases, people really come through for them and in others, folks show their inadequacy--just as in real life--and just like what happened when I was ill. I liked this and I also liked how the character was NOT noble--he was just a guy. Well worth seeing, that's for sure.Now I do have a few minor reservations in this excellent film. First, while I liked Rogan quite a bit (such as his using his friend's cancer to help him score with women as well as the way he reacted to THE breakup), he is VERY crude. Funny, yes....but VERY crude. Parents might want to think about this Secondly, the psychotherapist character (Anna Kendrick) is possibly the worst therapist in movie history. She apparently has no boundaries, no training and is a sweet idiot. Hopefully folks WON'T think that any of her behaviors are acceptable!! And, I cannot imagine ANY college allowing anyone that dippy to go near patients!! I used to be a psychotherapist many years ago--and I actually trained young counselors to do therapy. Even the dumbest and most inept grad student I ever met was light-years better than this goof-ball! Enjoyable but 100% unrealistic and the character should have been rewritten a bit to at least make her a bit more believable.",8,0,0,27 January 2012
What We Do in the Shadows," Weird, wacky and fun!
","A few months ago, thanks in part to a Kickstarter campaign, What We Do in the Shadows arrived in film festivals all over the world...and audiences were stunned! Why? Because it's one weird, very weird movie! The film is a marvelous mockumentary that makes fun of the current reality television fad. In many ways, it's like an MTV series like 'The Real World' or 'Jersey Shore'....meets 'Twilight'!! Somehow, a film crew gained access to a strange home where four vampires lived. And, it's in tiny Wellington, New Zealand of all places! According to the film, this unlikely place is actually a hotbed of vampires, werewolves, zombies and more...and these four undead guys are allowing some humans to come into their previously hidden lives. The residents of this home are a motley and mostly lovable group of loser vampires ranging from the rather likable Viago to the incredibly scary and Nosferatu-like Petyr and you follow them through the course of their evenings over a period of many months.While this idea is crazy and a bit silly, the joke could have worn thin very quickly--and it probably would have with lesser filmmakers and actors. Instead, the film maintains a wonderful tongue-in-cheek mood throughout and constantly delivers laughs...and, oddly, a lot of charm (well, that is when the guys aren't feeding off Wellingtonians). It also really helps that you like these folks! The bottom line is that this film is completely unique and fun...and if you see it with your friends, they won't believe what they're watching! And, they'll thank you for suggesting it.By the way, I happened to have actually been in Wellington last September and I don't recall having seen any zombies, witches, werewolves or vampires. Of course, I didn't happen to be there at night....",9,2,4,31 December 2015
Deadpool," I am NOT the target audience for this one...please keep this in mind as you read.
","I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for 'Deadpool' is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while 'Deadpool' deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.",7,1,4,16 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," It's one of the most unique films I've ever seen.
","At nearly three hours long AND with a strange and difficult to comprehend plot, I can see exactly why 'Cloud Atlas' lost a ton of money. In the States, it only brought in about $27,000,000---yet cost $100,000,000 to make. Much of the high cost is undoubtedly due to the cast--as the film boasts some famous and high-paid actors (including Tom Hanks and Halle Berry). It's a shame really, as the film does have some nice thing to offer...though overall, it was a problematic film to watch.The film consists of many different stories that all occur many different times in history (both in the past and very distant future). And, instead of being told in sequence, they are interlaced throughout the film. Why and what these plots all have to do with each other is something the audience is left to discover or create within themselves. However, many will get frustrated because for some time, the film doesn't give you a lot of clues at to what it all means. Despite being confusing and hard to grasp, the film has several things I loved. The stars of the film all play multiple roles and you'll see many of them in many stories. This provides the actors a chance to show off their talents--especially because many times they need to effect accents and/or play the opposite gender!! Yes, most of the main cast members play men AND women. Now this never would have worked if the acting was bad and the makeup was bad--but they really shine in this film. I was blown away by the makeup and thought several of the female characters were women when they weren't--it was that convincing. Additionally, while I was a bit cold about the overall film, I did appreciate how novel the movie was--very, very unique. So how might I have wanted the movie to be instead? Well, the many stories frustrated me because some of them were really, really compelling--and seeing only bits and pieces of them was annoying. I really wanted to see the whole story of many of the stories and could have seen the filmmakers making four or five films instead of just one. I particularly liked the stories about the replicant as well as the one where Hanks played a thug author (his acting was really nice here). My advice is that this film demands a viewer who is very, very patient, content with ambiguity and who wants to see a nice experimental film-- warts and all. Worth seeing but odd to say the least.NOTE: Parents, this film is NOT appropriate for kids. It clearly earns its R rating for some extremely graphic violence and sex. While the sex is sometimes steamy, the violence is what troubles me most for anyone crazy enough to let kids watch this one.",7,8,13,26 July 2014
Ran," excellent but not among his very best
","I absolutely love the films of Akira Kurasawa and have seen most of them. And, for some reason, this is not among my favorites although it is one of his highest rated films on IMDb. Perhaps I'm just being too picky, but I think MAYBE its popularity is because it was made somewhat recently and some of his older (and I think more interesting) films are sometime forgotten. After all, MOST of the IMDb reviewers are old enough that they could have seen this film on the big screen, while very few could have seen his earlier films in all their glory. The other reason why I think it's a little overrated is that his version of Macbeth (Throne of Blood) is the best retelling of Shakespeare and so Ran, despite it being wonderful, pales if you see them one after another (like I did). And finally, the characters and their interactions are just sterile--with little understanding or life to the them.So what DOES this film have going for it? Well, the word is SPECTACLE. Like KAGAMUSHA (which came out around the same time), it had a big budget and glorious locations. It is simply a gorgeous film to see. Some watch Kurosawa for the spectacle, I tend to look more at the characterizations which are really secondary in this film.Give me a film like Kurosawa's IKARU or SCANDAL over a film like this.",7,5,13,20 January 2006
Tarzan," okay....just okay
","I think a major problem with me watching this film is that the character Tarzan has been done so many times that I frankly am pretty tired of him. He's been in 1001 films and at this point, what is there to add to the story that hasn't already been said? Generally, this movie seems to say 'nothing'. The addition of 'cool' gorilla playmates wasn't enough to invigorate the series and as a result of such familiarity of the content, the film is just a very well-made time-passer. Sure, it's very good technically and my kids enjoyed it, but the film has very little lasting appeal. I've been to The Magic Kingdom dozens of times and apart from just after the film debuted, there is almost no reference to it--nothing. And I think this says a lot about this adequate film.",6,2,7,10 June 2007
Easy A," A great premise but the writing really disappoints...
","Although the film begins with some great opening credits and had a great idea for a plot, the rest of the film really, really disappoints due to bad (VERY bad) writing. So, they took a very good idea and made the least of it.The idea of a high school girl PRETENDING to be a slut isn't a bad idea. And her then helping a gay kid by pretending to sleep with him to stop the other kids from picking on him was great. But, the characters in this film are at best cartoony--walking stereotypes who lack believability. They don't act or talk like any teenagers--at least not on this planet. Take, for instance, Amanda Bynes. She plays the most one-dimensional religious zealot--and ALL her Christian friends and family are all bigoted hypocritical jerks. Olive Oyl from the Popeye cartoons has more depth than these characters! As far as the rest of the characters go, they all seem to try too hard, speak hipster lingo too often and just seem like bad fan fiction. Todd is JUST a plot device--not a person. And, on top of all that, the main character is too smart and glib to be real--and difficult to like and she often behaves inexplicably.The bottom line is despite a HUGE ad campaign to sell this film (often a sure sign that a Hollywood films sucks) and a clever idea, they do nothing with the premise and the film is a bore. And, I might add, the film isn't great for teens either as it's rather crude, smarmy and might just make them stupider. Dumb and unbelievable when it COULD have made some sort of positive statement.Oh, and the 'Knock on Wood' number near the end might just be one of the dumbest I've seen in ages.",3,8,13,3 May 2011
The Great Escape," Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...
","I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love 'The Great Escape' as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.",9,3,8,27 December 2011
Click," This review is for those who generally DON'T like Adam Sandler movies
","I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have seen a few of his movies. I am in my 40s and I notice that the appeal for him seems to be with teenagers and young adults--and I assume most of the reviews here are by younger reviewers. So here is a review that might be a little different--a 40-something who is a bit of a hard sell.Overall, I was surprised that I did like this film as much as I did. It was far deeper and less dopey than films like BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and seemed like an attempt by the rapidly aging Sandler to make a more adult film. While there are still lots of crude jokes that fell flat for me (such as the dog and the stuffed animal), there was still plenty to like and a depth that surprised me. Also, while there were some comedic moments, after a while it became obvious that this was really a comedy-drama--with the second half of the film being very serious and even touching.So here we seem to have an Adam Sandler movie that might just appeal to kids AND parents--one that everyone can get something out of and enjoy. I am happy I saw this one and wouldn't mind seeing more films like it.",7,18,24,1 June 2008
Jackie Brown," It's very good--too bad it's a bit overwhelmed by the director's other films of the era.
","There are already a ton of reviews for this film, so I'll try to be brief. This is the last film directed by Quentin Tarantino that have to see (as of 2/11), as I've seen all the other films he helmed. This is surprising, actually, as I love most of his films and I really love blacksploitation movies--and this film would seem to combine the two. That's because the film Pam Grier--a lady who made a name for herself in the early to mid-1970s blackspoitation genre. However, after seeing the film it really seemed like a Taratino film from start to finish and, aside from the presence of Grier, had nothing to do with blacksploitation. Now to me, this was a bit of a disappointment--as I really wanted to see the over-the-top crazy action for which Grier was famous in the 1970s--in such films as 'Coffey' and 'Foxy Brown'. This film, while violent, is much more refined than these earlier films...and I would have loved to have seen more of this sort of action.Grier plays the title character--a lady who uses her job as a flight attendant to bring in money to the country to Samuel L. Jackson--who plays a guy who deals in illegal guns. When the authorities catch her, she has the choice to either play their game or go to prison--but she decides on a third course of action no one else anticipated.In addition to Grier and Jackson, there are a lot of other interesting characters in the film. To me, the most interesting is the laconic guy played by Robert Forster--a bailbondsman who is instantly taken with Jackie. He's older but handsome--and I appreciate that the whole interracial aspect of their relationship is never really discussed or exploited--they are just two people. Also of some interest is the violent guy played by Robert DiNero (imagine that!) and the rather annoying (deliberately so) character played by Bridget Fonda (in a nice change of pace).Overall, it's a good film but also one that can easily get overlooked because some of the director's other films before and after were so memorable (and simply better). Following 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and preceding 'Kill Bill' was tough and by comparison 'Jackie Brown' is an inferior film--though one its own it's a very good film--one that is still well worth seeing provided you like violent films. To me, it lacks the style and uniqueness of these other films...but it's still quite good.By way, there are alternate spellings for blacksploitation--also commonly written as 'blaxsploitation'. So don't write to me about the correct spelling. Enjoy.",8,3,7,13 February 2011
Minions," Lots of fun but every time the Scarlet Overkill plot kicks in, the film slows to a grinding halt.
","In this third installment of the 'Despicable Me' franchise, the Minions are in search of a master and the first portion of the film is a look back through history of their trying to find one. Then, the movie switches to 1968 and their music-filled quest to become sidekicks for the evil Scarlet Overkill as well as ruling the UK.I enjoyed 'Minions' and think it's a big step up from the previous installment of 'Despicable Me'. This is because in 'Despicable Me 2', the film was great whenever the Minions were there but ground to a boring halt whenever the plot reared its ugly head. Here, however, it's mostly Minions and their antics...but once again, the film does bog down when it comes to the plot involving Scarlet Overkill...mostly because it's NOT fun. So, when it's just the Minions being goofy, the film is lovable and fun. And, this is great because mostly the film just involves the characters being funny and cute...especially in the first half hour or so. Is it as wonderful as the first film, 'Despicable Me'? No...but it is fun, very clever and worth seeing in a 'just turn your brain off and enjoy' sort of way.",7,2,4,25 April 2016
Aladdin," Very good...but Jasmine?
","Everybody seems to love Disney's 'Aladdin'...and it is a wonderful film. However, one aspect of it bothered me long ago and still does....Jasmine. Think about it for a moment. Her people are poor, hungry and being oppressed. However, at the same time, she's living in complete luxury...nearly all of her wishes being granted. However, despite that, she wants to run around Baghdad pretending she's poor and hanging out the 'little people'! Doesn't this sound a bit like Queen Marie Antoinette? Such a selfish and annoying girl...in an otherwise enjoyable Disney cartoon. This and Aladdin's propensity to lie, lie, lie make it a film that is problematic and I just didn't enjoy it as much as many viewers. Still, it is worth seeing...with lovely animation and catchy songs....despite an annoying Disney princess.",7,3,7,8 January 2020
Incredibles 2," There have already been 888 reviews....what's one more?!
","I hate most sequels and don't think most of them are necessary...they are just an excuse to squeeze money out of the popularity of the first film. This is especially true to kids' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I'd say no. However, I am happy I saw 'Incredibles 2' as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.In this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It's not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.Of all the recent kids films, I must say that 'Incredibles 2' has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I'll say no more since it would spoil the plot!Overall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn't higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless 'Ice Age' sequels and the like.",8,3,4,17 January 2019
Rockstar," So...the best way to become a huge star is to first become a total jerk??!!
","I can see from the high IMDB rating and all the positive reviews that a lot of folks absolutely love 'Rockstar'. Yet, despite everything, I didn't enjoy the movie much at all. To me, it seemed very cliched and I had a hard time caring about the leading man and his 'plight'.Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor) is a nice guy who wants to make it big with his music. Unfortunately, he seems to be getting no where...until a friend advises him that to be a great artist you need to suffer and experience life..and he's always had it too easy. At this point, Jordan acts very creepy. He sees a lovely dancer, Heer (Nargis Fakhri) and begins stalking her unmercifully. So what does she do? Yep, she decides that he'll be a fun guy to hang around with...at least until her upcoming wedding. So the pair go slumming and have a few laughs. Weird...huh?Some time passes. Heer has married and Jordan has suffered enough that he's gotten noticed and is finally an up and coming rock star. But, as you'd expect, Jordan is smitten with Heer and cannot enjoy his new-found fame. So, he makes sure to go to Prague on tour....because SHE is there. The pair once again pick up where they left off, but Heer seems very ambivalent. At times, she seems to want Jordan and other times she pushes him away. Ultimately, he seeks her out at her home and is arrested for trespassing.
The trespassing charge is all over the media...and Jordan's popularity multiplies as he's now seen as a 'bad boy'. His off stage antics all contribute to this image and he's pretty much a prima donna...difficult and unpredictable. Again, this improves his image and he is now amazingly rich and famous. But he still doesn't have Heer....and he's miserable.Time passes. Heer apparently is dying and Jordan drops everything to be with her. At first, she rebounds and appears to be getting better. But can his love alone cure her illness or bring him what he really wants? Take a wild guess.My biggest problems with the film were that it all seemed so very phony and contrived...he tries to become angst-ridden and eventually does. Additionally, Jordan became so obnoxious during this journey that I also found myself no longer caring about him, his music nor his lady. The film seemed to be angst just for the sake of angst....and I just think that there are many better Indian films out there. Sure, cliches are the norm in Indian romantic movies...but likability...that's what this film lacks....at least for me.",3,2,5,24 October 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," Unlikable and amazingly overrated.
","The reason I saw this film is that it's a Coen Brothers film--and I nearly always love their films--whether they are comedies or dramas. However, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' was, for me, a completely boring film with very little to recommend it. If I hadn't known it was a Coen film, I never would have guessed it aside from having John Goodman in an odd little role and a reference to Ulysses.Llewyn Davis is a struggling fictional folk singer. Not only is he only moderately talented, he's pretty much a bum--living off others and hoping they'll let him sleep on their couch for a day or two. Now if he was a nice person, this could be forgiven. But, unfortunately, he's a rather foul-mouthed guy for the early 1960s and there isn't a lot to like or admire. This film is about a week in his life where not a lot happens. And to me, this ALL sums up why I didn't like the film--Llewyn is a jerk and nothing of consequence happens in the movie. End of story. I kept hoping SOMETHING would happen to make it all worth watching but no such luck.On the positive side, Oscar Isaac's acting was good as the title character. And,....well, I guess that's all there is on the positive side. I rarely have seen a movie so praised by critics that left me this dissatisfied. In this sense, I'd place it among films like 'Tree of Life' and 'The English Patient'. See it if you want--just don't be surprised if there just isn't much to enjoy in this one.",3,18,33,1 March 2014
Saboteur," I liked this much better the first time I saw this.
","The film begins at an aircraft plant in America during WWII. Unexpectedly, there's an explosion and the place is destroyed--thanks to deliberate sabotage. Not only did someone start the film but they filled the fire extinguishers with gasoline!! Oddly, the police automatically assume that Barry (Bob Cummings) is guilty since he handed one of the extinguishers to a friend following the initial explosion. But Barry knows that a mysterious man, Mr. Fry, is responsible and he escapes and seeks out this character on a wild cross-country trek.The very first time I saw 'Saboteur', I really, really liked it--but that was almost 30 years ago. Today when I saw it again, I enjoyed it but also now realize that the film really isn't at all original. In many ways, it's a lot like two earlier Alfred Hitchcock films and one later one--'The 39 Steps', 'The Girl Was Young' and 'North By Northwest'. All three have a man on the run from the law who is innocent and all three team up with a girl who is unwillingly pulled into the affair and all three have the woman come to believe in the man's innocence. Because of this, the film automatically loses a couple of points since it just isn't very original. Plus, while the sabotage angle was great for propaganda purposes back in 1942, today it makes the film seem a bit dated. Now don't get me wrong--it IS a good film.An additional problem with 'Saboteur' is that the film relies on a HUGE cliché--strangers who INSTANTLY assume the leading man is an innocent man and who help him escape the police. In real life, this would almost never happen--yet in this film it happens repeatedly.Because of these serious weaknesses, the film is very uneven. While it is well-crafted by Hitchcock and the acting is nice, the story really is sub-par and poorly written at times. It's hard to score a derivative and clichéd film highly, even if it is well made. Watchable and interesting but flawed...seriously flawed.",6,4,6,11 September 2013
Gangs of New York," Tiring...very, very tiring.
","'Gangs of New York' is a spectacle--with amazing scenery, stunts and special effects. However, it's also a very tough film to like and of all the phrases I could use to describe it, 'feel good' is probably the last. I found it thoroughly unpleasant but spectacular.The film concerns a vendetta between one annoying person (Leonardo DiCaprio) and another even more annoying and unlikable person (Daniel Day-Lewis). Lots of screaming, stabbing, killing and nastiness occurs until ultimately (and thankfully) the film ends. I know my summary above is ridiculously short and vague--but so were the characters. There was little depth, often their behaviors made little sense (why didn't DiCaprio's character kill his enemy early on in the film? Why, exactly, did 'the Butcher' spare his enemy--he had to know he would come back to kill him!) and they were collectively about as likable as a case of VD. And, because the film is about three hours long, I found it tough to stick with this one. While the film is directed well, it's just depressing and awful throughout. Not pleasant and the sort of film I could do without.",5,6,10,9 June 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," It's almost extremely clever...
","'Cabin in the Woods' was a very frustrating film for me to watch. While the movie did a great job in explaining WHY we keep seeing all those dumb clichés in hack 'em up movies (such as the bimbo who dies first and the dumb jock), it ultimately allowed itself to, in the end, be just about as dumb and mindless as a typical hack and slash film. It's a real shame, as for so much of the movie it kept my attention.The film is a twist on the usual young adults being murdered in the woods film because you soon see that all this is being orchestrated by a group of people working in a weird base underground. Exactly why and who they are isn't known until later...all you know is that these folks watch EVERYTHING that's happening to a group of victims and they even bet as to what is going to happen next. It's all very clever and the actual explanation is a mixed bag. On the one hand it does explain things pretty well but on the other, it just degenerates into a giant bloodbath that seems to value blood and chaos more than sticking with the underlying plot. The bottom line is that the film is a near miss...a film that almost works superbly. Instead, the ending just lost me amid the chaos. For my time and money, I much preferred 'Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil'...much more complete and enjoyable anti-hacker sort of film. This was a disappointment...as was seeing the gorgeous Chris Hemsworth...but without his usual blonde head of hair!",6,4,7,20 May 2016
Moon," There is so much to admire about this film!
","'Moon' is an amazingly different film. First, the film is a sci-fi film that is set on the moon. It has exceptionally nice special effects--yet only cost five million dollars to make!! Second, it only stars one guy--Sam Rockwell. Along with the voice of the computer (Kevin Spacey), and BRIEF glimpses at others through memories or over phone calls, this IS the entire cast! Third, and most importantly, the film really kept me guessing throughout and is thoroughly original! The film is the first full-length film of Duncan Jones--the son of David Bowie (Bowie's real name, by the way, is David Jones). While he's only made one film since ('Source Code'), I cannot imagine him not getting many more opportunities because his skills are so evident in 'Moon'--a film he not only directed but he came up with the story as well! This guy is something.The film is set in the near future. To supply the Earth's energy needs, NASA is mining Helium-3 from the Moon. On this moon base is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)--a guy who seems to be losing his mind. It's probably because he's been alone for nearly three years. What is obvious is that something is amiss--and he is either hallucinating or there is another version of him on the base as well! Yes, following an accident, he awakens to see another Sam Bell.At this point in the film, I KNEW exactly what was coming next. Well, I was 100% wrong!!! The film really took my by surprise and the dark turn really caught me off guard--and I really, really like that in a movie. However, I don't want to spoil it. See the film yourself and see a wonderful example of a film that is highly original, intelligent and cheaply made! A truly unique film--and one that is available now on Netflix. And, like 'Gravity', it's a space film with a tiny cast that thoroughly kept my interest.By the way, my only complaint about this film, and it's minor, is that the movie is rated R. You do see Rockwell's butt and I wish that scene was chopped out--not because I am a prude but because a lot of teens won't be able to see the film due to it's rating and some adults might avoid it as well. As a parent, I would certainly let my daughters see the movie--it's really something special.",10,16,24,7 March 2014
True Romance," A film steeped in ugliness and Nihilism
","A friend recommended this film to me, knowing that I like kung fu movies. However, in hindsight, I really wish he'd kept his recommendation to himself. It was only at his urging I kept watching this film, as this sort of super-violent film does not appeal to me and it seems disturbing that people find this style of movie entertaining. Not only did the film use the f-word 1488203240234503 times, but it was unrelentingly violent and featured no one to care for during the entire picture. The main characters were tough to like--one was a prostitute and the other a seemingly normal guy that all the sudden becomes the next Rambo--killing with about as much regard as the average person would have about popping a zit! Plus, on top of all this, they are completely morally bankrupt as when they stumble upon a HUGE stash of uncut cocaine and their first and only thoughts were to sell it. The only problem is, the coke belongs to the mob and so much of the film is spent dodging the mafia. And in the end, the foul-mouthed mob has a showdown with the foul-mouthed cops as well as some foul-mouthed security guards and the foul-mouthed 'heroes'--resulting in perhaps the bloodiest and most violent five minutes in film--and looking much like the recent massacre at Virginia Tech. And to top it all off, the film then is sure to REWARD the antiheroes and kill off all the gangsters and cops--as if there was some sort of moral equivalence here!Just WHO is the audience for this film? Is it possible this film was made as a tool to determine who LIKES this sort of violent stuff in order to lock them away where they can't hurt anyone?!?! I doubt it--like most of the super-super violent crap from Hollywood, its sole purpose is to 'entertain'. When I want this much extreme violence, totally unlikable and sick characters, etc., I really worry about my mental health and the health of this country. What is wrong with America that we put up with crap like TRUE ROMANCE?! Are we really all that different from the ancient Romans who were entertained by seeing people torn to pieces before their very eyes?! Apparently not. If you are one of the ones entertained by this film, apart from a few clever moments here and there, what is it that's so entertaining? Seeing people die?!PS--One aspect of the film I did like was when Christian Slater was apparently having psychotic hallucinations where Elvis came to give him advice. This was a variation on Bogey coming to Woody Allen in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. I just wish these Elvis scenes had occurred more often--seeing a mad man getting advice from Elvis to kill people was pretty compelling.",3,10,36,23 April 2007
Her," Not a movie for the kids, but very insightful and rather sad.
","'Her' is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He's getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it's his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it's also quite beautiful.This film, while sci-fi, doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn't want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze.",9,20,32,25 March 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Not quite up to all the hype and perhaps not for everyone...
","With eight Oscar wins (including one for Best Picture), you can't help but assume this will be one of the best films ever made. Well, although it is very good, it's hard for ANY film to live up to this much hype I was a bit disappointed as a result.I began watching the film with my wife and oldest daughter, a short way into the film my wife left--saying the film was just too violent and depressing. Well, it IS both of these things and shows in awful detail what life can be like for the poor orphans of Mumbai. Vomiting, a kid jumping into a pool of excrement and evil thugs deliberately blinding kids--this movie WILL make you flinch and comes by the R-rating honestly. Now I am NOT suggesting they should have completely cleaned it all up--after all, this is a terrible sort of life and showing it any other way would be wrong. But, be forewarned--this is a very tough film to watch--especially in the first half hour.I would talk more about the film except it has already been reviewed 10000000000 times--and adding my two-cents worth isn't going to add much that hasn't already been written. Extremely well acted and constructed--this is a fine film.Perhaps the Oscar nominees that year were really bad. I dunno. All I do know is that this film probably has killed the Indian travel industry!!!",9,6,12,25 November 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Well made and mindlessly entertaining....
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",8,5,14,10 September 2015
The Breakfast Club," Perhaps you just have to be a teen...and still live in the 1980s.
","Back in the 1980s when 'The Breakfast Club' debuted, I was in my early 20s and never got around to watching it. I know it is considered a classic so I finally saw it tonight...as there was nothing else I wanted to see on TV. And, after having watched it, I really wish I hadn't. I think most of the reason is because I am 52...hardly the target age for the movie.The story is about five teens who are forced to go to Saturday detention at their high school. The teacher supervising them mostly leaves them alone...as he's an apathetic jerk. As for the five, they all seem to be caricatures--archetypes of sorts. And, through the course of the film you slowly begin to learn more about them.As I said, I am hardly the age for this one. However, even aside from that, I can think of quite a few 80s teen films that are simply more fun to watch...such as 'Better off Dead' and 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. I just felt bored as I watched 'The Breakfast Club'...totally bored...even when the characters later began to spill their guts and supposedly 'got real'.By the way, one scene would probably be seen today by many as a sexual assault. When the punk kid (Judd Nelson) is hiding under the table, he buries his head in a girl's crotch and she clearly did NOT want him to do this. Perhaps it was funny in the 80s...today folks would probably not be as impressed by this scene. Sensitivities have definitely changed.",4,4,11,2 February 2017
Gladiator," Amazing and a bit disappointing.
","Visually, 'Gladiator' is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.",8,3,7,12 February 2012
Pocahontas," As long as you don't mind that your children are watching almost 100% fiction and not real history, it is entertaining
","I am an American History teacher and this is the sort of film that causes people like me to grumble and complain because the film bears almost no similarity to the actual story of the founding of the Jamestown colony. But, it is because of this and how widely the movie was loved and accepted that I actually use it in my class discussions--teaching kids that much of our history is distorted or even completely fictional. Like George Washington's 'wooden teeth', the 'fact' that everyone in Columbus' day thought the Earth was flat and Betsy Ross making the very first American flag (all fiction, by the way), this film is a great example of bad history. Now understand, I am NOT an America-basher or live to destroy our national heroes--I just don't like it when something sacred like our history is treated with such blatant disrespect and cynicism.While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was 'Matoaka' not 'Pocahontas' (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not 'tree-hugging hippies'--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).If you can ignore all this, you are left with a heavy-handed and preachy film with a lot of New Age mumbo-jumbo about nature and talking trees and all that crap. Pleasant to the eye--but about as deep as Paris Hilton's personality. Bland and only mildly entertaining---and guaranteed to tick off anyone who cares in the least about the truth.",3,20,39,2 September 2006
The Social Network," Considering I am 'old' and a history teacher, this movie isn't exactly geared towards me...
","My review is best read and understood in context. I am 46 years-old (and in the Facebook world, that makes me OLD) and an ex-history teacher, so what I liked and disliked about the film is not what the average viewer would think. This isn't meant as an insult--just that I know I am not like the typical demographic for whom the movie was made. I am very computer-savvy for my age--but that still makes me a dinosaur compared to a teenager or 30-something person. The fact that I have never had a Facebook account alone makes me an odd-ball! So, when I see the film I do NOT wax nostalgic about the good 'ol days of 2004 or 2005. Additionally, as a history teacher, I CRAVE accuracy in films and tend to nit-pick them far more than normal. For me, history is like the Bible--you don't embellish it or 'interpret' it--is IS truth. So, a younger person seeing the film with me would find me insufferable, as I would look for the flaws and ignore the bigger picture.So, I did some research and found that the film makers did NOT intend for a historical account of Facebook but wanted to craft an exciting story that people would love. And, to do so, personalities were changed and facts were omitted or ignored. My biggest problem is that in reading about Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, while he is no angel, nor does he seem to be (as the movie strongly implies) a sociopath with Asperger's Syndrome (I was also a psyc teacher...trust me on this--this is exactly as the film portrays him). And, although he is exciting to watch in the film, Justin Timberlake's version of the fonder of Napster isn't exactly spot-on, either.So if you can ignore the artistic license, what are you left with in 'The Social Network'? Well, for 46 year-old guys like me, not a huge amount--or at least not as much as I might have hoped based on all the publicity the film received. Yes, I liked it--but didn't love it. I liked some of the acting (again, I'll mention liking Justin Timberlake--something I NEVER thought I'd see myself putting in writing!) and the rest of the cast were good. I also loved the way the twins were magically created using computers and a single actor....cool. But the story didn't engage me that much. Yes, I know they are all rich as can be...but other than that I just didn't get it. And, as a middle-aged fart, I guess I wasn't intended to!",7,7,15,30 March 2011
The Wedding Singer," I wanted to hate this movie but couldn't--it was a wonderful surprise
","In the last year or so, I think I've started to lose my mind. You see, up until then I avoided Adam Sandler movies--mostly because I so disliked him on 'Saturday Night Live'. However, in the last year or so, I have seen several of his older films that I actually liked. Now, this does NOT mean that I particularly liked all of his film! After all, BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are hard to love--though I will admit that parts of them were pretty good. LITTLE NICKY, on the other hand, was just sludge! But CLICK, WATERBOY and now THE WEDDING SINGER are all movies that I grudgingly must admit were far better than I'd expected--especially THE WEDDING SINGER.I think the biggest reason I liked THE WEDDING SINGER was that it wasn't really a comedy but more of a romance--something that seemed to fit Sandler much better and I wish he'd consider making more of these. That's because although the film certainly stuck to established formula, the characters were all so very likable and sweet. As a result, you really cared about them and you got sucked into the story. One of the great moments was when the lady sang to her husband on their 50th anniversary and another was when Sandler had a heart-to-heart talk with his best friend in the bar. Of course you KNEW what had to happen by the end, but still you couldn't help but need a couple hankies--the writing, construction and acting were that good.On top of the characters, this is a great nostalgia piece that would appeal to people of my generation. Despite one reviewer saying that there was nothing positive about the 80s, this is when I met and married my wife. Hearing all the great songs and seeing the romance reminded me what a lucky guy I am.If you are looking for laugh out loud comedy, this probably isn't for you. Sure, there are a few funny moments (I REAAAALLY loved the song he composed both before and after he was dumped, for example), but the film is much more of a sweet romance. See this one with somebody you love--there are so many wonderful moments in it you can't help but enjoy yourself. An immensely enjoyable film.",8,2,3,20 July 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," Exceptionally painful to watch but Will Smith's performance is very, very nice.
","'The Pursuit of Happiness' is one of the more painful to watch films I have ever seen. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--but it's very hard watching the main character, as his life is an absolute mess and you really want to see him succeed in spite of a horrible series of downturns.The film begins with Chris (Will Smith) playing a struggling father and husband. His salesman job is not working out at all--and that's a problem, as without sales he cannot get paid. At the same time, his wife is clearly not happy--and hates to have a failure for a husband--and she sees him as a failure. Beyond this, time and time again, he has many, many setbacks in life until eventually his wife leaves. Now, without a salary, he's trying to somehow work something out so he can keep his son, Christopher (Jaden Smith--Will's real life son). But, before things can get better, things get a lot worse...and it truly is painful to watch as he scrambles to somehow make it.Whether or not you enjoy this film really depends on if you can stick with it. Considering how painful it becomes and how much you like the guy, it's a real chore to stick with it. No matter how many times bad things happen to Chris, it just keeps coming! But, on the other hand, the film is worth it if you stick with it. Will Smith's acting is just terrific--I was amazed how much he could convey with just his eyes. I can understand why he was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor for this film. And, since it's based on a real story about real people, it does (FORTUNATELY) end well and is a very satisfying film overall.",9,4,5,21 April 2012
Shark Tale," A knock-off of FINDING NEMO that lacks heart
","I was not a huge fan of FINDING NEMO, though when compared to this film it is definitely a superior film. That's because while NEMO was a much simpler story and designed more for little kids, SHARK TALE was rather dark and grim, plus I didn't appreciate all the 'with it' hip-hop references or inclusion of Robert De Niro as the boss shark. If I want to see De Niro, I might watch GOODFELLAS or RAGING BULL and I can't see why such an adult actor is given a role in what should have been a purely kids' film. Nothing new or memorable here--just a pale imitation of NEMO with some heavy-handed touches. The charm just isn't apparent and I can't see a compelling reason to seek out this film, though it is an agreeable enough time-passer.",6,2,7,10 June 2007
The Birds," too shallow a plot even for a Twilight Zone episode
","My daughter informed me that the movie, The Birds, was based on a short story--only 33 pages long, in fact. I only found this out recently, but I am not the least bit surprised, as I found the movie to be way too shallow to deserve the positive acclaim it has received. I think what had happened was that by the mid-1960s, Hitchcock had established quite a reputation for himself so people just assumed this was yet another great film. I don't think so. To me, it seems that the brilliance of Vertigo and North By Northwest just isn't evident in this shallow movie. Okay, here's the plot: In a small town, the birds go nuts and start attacking people. A man meets a woman in the midst of the carnage, so, of course, they must fall in love (or something) rather than just LEAVE THE STINKING TOWN. Yes, I know that they were 'trapped' in the town--no one ever heard of using a car? Yeah, the gas station blew up, but that STILL doesn't explain this. If you want to see a movie about a town in terror, watch Village of the Damned--this one SHOULD have been the Hitchcock movie!",3,18,48,8 June 2005
Princess Mononoke," One of the only Miyazaki films that disappointed me
","Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.",6,12,26,11 June 2007
Cinderella Man," A very good film that apparently takes HUGE liberties with some facts to make for a more exciting film.
","Before I get to whether or not I liked this film, the history teacher in me thinks it's very important to set the record straight. Although the film is pretty accurate when it comes to the career of James Braddock, it's very inaccurate in portraying his opponent, Max Baer. The champion, Baer, is shown as a sadistic jerk who killed two men while boxing--and really delighted in taunting Braddock about this. In the film, the evil and filthy-mouthed Baer tells Braddock to bow out of the fight, as he could be the next to die in the ring--and he really seems to LIKE tormenting Braddock's wife about this. In reality, Baer killed one man in the ring. It was a horrible accident which occasionally happens in boxing--one which apparently haunted Baer for the rest of his life. In fact, he helped pay for his dead opponents to get educations and looked after this family--hardly the act of a sadist. I understand why the folks who made 'Cinderella Man' changed this in an attempt to create tension, but the story would have STILL worked great if it had just stuck to the truth. Plus, think of how this film affected Baer's relatives when they saw it. Max Baer Jr. ('Jethro' from 'The Beverly Hillbillies') knew his father was not like this and I am sure it pained him to see him so badly misrepresented.As for the NON-Baer parts of the film, they are great. The look of the 1930s is exceptional--much more realistic than you often see in films. Also, the acting is terrific, the film VERY engaging and the story of Braddock very compelling. Without the misrepresentation of Baer's in the story, I would have given this one a 10. Really....it's that compelling and they did a great job. The acting, direction, designs...everything but the writing was perfect.By the way, this isn't so much a complaint as an observation. In this movie, like practically EVERY other boxing movie, there is hardly any defense (such as blocked shots) in the boxing matches--punch after punch that lands on the opponent. If fights REALLY were like this, they'd rarely go beyond the first round!",8,13,13,22 August 2012
Jurassic Park," With a bazillion other reviews, I'll keep this short.
","By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.",9,6,8,11 May 2013
Beetlejuice," Lots and lots and lots of fun
","This is a great movie to simply watch and enjoy--no need to think or analyze--just enjoy the silliness and cool factor of this nice film.A young couple living in their dream house (Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis) are accidentally killed and thereafter live as ghosts in the home. Some time later, a family of freaks (Jeffery Jones, Catherine O'Hara) and their disaffected daughter (Winona Ryder) move in--much to the ghosts' chagrin. That's because instead of respecting the lovely home's charms, the parents want to turn it into a pseudo-intellectual freak house. However, Winona somehow is able to see and communicate with the ghosts--but her parents can't believe that they exist or that they're doing anything wrong with the house.The dead couple try to scare away the family, but their attempts are really lame (and funny) and this only makes the weirdos want to stay even more! So, out of desperation, they seek out the most evil and obnoxious ghost, Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) to help. The problem is that although Beetle Juice is able to scare anyone, he's also a total maniac and once let out, he's amazingly difficult to stop.The film abounds with many things you'd expect to see in a Tim Burton directed film--weird special effects, an odd set design (after the weirdos transform the house), fun and a definite 'cool factor'. The actors do a fine job as well. Additionally, the script is smart and fun. While some might find this too dark a film for young kids, for older kids and adults, it's mighty entertaining and silly. Plus the music is just so darn infectious and fun!",8,1,2,6 August 2008
The Simpsons Movie," A single episode's number of laughs stretched out to 87 minutes
","'I was right!' was something I was able to say to myself when this movie was complete. That's because I assumed based on other TV cartoons that were stretched into full-length that THE SIMPSONS MOVIE would carry on the tradition of producing a mediocre film. Several Charlie Brown films, THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE and THE POWERPUFF GIRLS movie all were decent enough cartoons that were disappointments on the big screen because the usual pacing of the shows just couldn't be maintained for an entire film.THE SIMPSON MOVIE certainly has its moments, but the plot involving the evil EPA placing a dome over Springfield could easily have been handled on television. Plus, there just seemed to be a ton of padding--most of which bogged the film down to a crawl--particularly the messages about saving the planet. I am all in favor of protecting the environment, but because the occasionally heavy-handed message seemed out of place in a cartoon comedy, the film had me wanting to trade in my car for a Hummer (no crude joke intended) and eat a Spotted Owl. The bottom line is that the reason 99.673% of its audience watches the show is the humor and irreverence--here, it seemed amazingly blunted and bland thanks to the pacing and environmental message.So was it a bad film? Not really...but it sure could have been better and it's sure not worth buying the DVD. My advice is save the money and use it to purchase one of the seasons of the great show.PS--Of the films I mentioned, perhaps Spongebob made the best transition to the theaters. However, considering it was shown on Nickelodeon only months after its theater debut, it obviously had rather modest pretensions.",4,4,8,14 September 2008
All the President's Men," Well done, though it sure helps if you remember Watergate.
","'All the President's Men' is a film that would have played much, much better back in the 70s when it debuted. That is because most of the audience would have known who many of the folks were who were involved in the Watergate break-in and the subsequent attempt to derail the investigations. As a history teacher, I have a much better than normal knowledge of these people and events. But for the average viewer who isn't in their 60s, much of the film will be foreign to them and the names relatively unimportant. Now this does not mean it's a bad film for most viewers--but its impact is less-- especially since nowadays the idea of politicians being this corrupt is old news!The film has a lot of high-powered actors--not just Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford (who, by the way, looks NOTHING like Bob Woodward) but the stellar supporting cast. Additionally, the film is appropriately tense and well directed. The only negative I felt that existed in the film is the montage-like ending which just felt a bit like a tack-on and could have been stronger. Still, well worth seeing.",9,5,8,31 October 2015
The Wizard of Oz," A delight...even if some of the songs really make very little sense.
","THE WIZARD OF OZ is a great film, so please don't be offended and think I hate it--I don't, and have seen it perhaps a dozen times or more. It is truly a classic. However, the last time I saw it, I was surprised because now that I am middle-aged, I finally really listened to some of the songs. While some, such as 'Over the Rainbow' were amazingly sublime, a few surprised me because they had great music but the lyrics were, well, nonsense. Try listening to some of the songs and you might notice that the lyrics, while memorable, are a bit silly. Really...and this is the only reason I can't give this film a 10.However, despite this minor complaint, what else is there about the film that could be improved? Judy Garland is perfect and at her best. The cinematography, costumes, sets and everything about the film is first-rate--even if the story, at times, diverges greatly from Frank Baum's original tale. A film that you must see if you haven't. Just try NOT to pay attention to lyrics in songs like 'We're Off to See the Wizard' and 'If I Only Had a Brain'. It might give you a headache. Here are a couple examples:'You'll find he is a whiz of a Wiz! If ever a Wiz! there was. If ever oh ever a Wiz! there was The Wizard of Oz is one because...''I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry, If I only had a brain.'Oh, and one other problem. At the end of the film, there is no resolution with Miss Gulch and you can assume she STILL is going to have Toto put down!",9,4,8,15 November 2009
The Martian," It's hard to imagine Ridley Scott directing a film like this one....
","Ridley Scott is famous for bringing 'Alien' and 'Bladerunner' to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with 'The Martian' he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it's hard to believe it's from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it's a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies!As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I'll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that's something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it's THAT good!",10,14,28,28 October 2015
The Fighter," Is this family THIS awful?!
","I would love to know more about Mickey Ward and his family. However, at the end of the film you see the real Mickey and his brother--so I assume it was made with complete cooperation of the family. This, despite the family appearing nearly 100% crazy--possibly too crazy for 'The Jerry Springer Show' crazy!! However, when I looked on the internet, I really couldn't find anything that verified or refuted the portrayal of these folks. If this IS a realistic portrait, it is a wonderful argument for retroactive birth control or personal redemption--take your pick.'The Fighter' is a film about a relatively obscure (at least up until this film) boxing champ from 2000, Mickey Ward. Although his comeback is inspirational, the reason the film is compelling is that he apparently was raised by one of the most dysfunctional families I've ever seen in film--Mowgli was raised in a better family background than this one--at least according to the movie. I could say more but you really have to see this film--it says it all.Ward's mother (Melissa Leo) and brother (Christian Bale) in action are pretty intense and interesting. Both of them received Supporting Actress/Actor Oscars for their parts. I wasn't as impressed by Leo's acting--screaming and acting trashy was interesting but that's about all there seemed to be to the character. However, Bale was incredible. Like most of his films, you can't hear any of his natural Welsh accent but what really impressed me was what he did to play this character--losing all that weight in order to look gaunt like a crack-head. Plus, he showed a nice range of acting in the film. It's worth seeing just for his performance.As for Amy Adams in this film, this is NOT the Amy Adams of 'Enchanted'! In fact, it's about as far removed from this role or the one from 'Julie and Julia' as you can find--as she plays a very earthy, crude and occasionally very unlikable character. Plus, seeing her in her underwear was a bit unnerving to me---I just kept thinking of her as a Disney princess gone bad! She was good in the film--just not exactly like I'd expected.Mark Wahlberg apparently produced the film as well as acted in the lead. He was good, but frankly he didn't have a lot to do in the film other than box and let all the chaos happen around him. He simply went unnoticed, in a way, because so many wildly over-the-top performances surrounded him during practically every minute he was on film! This is a well-made but often an unpleasant and very adult film--not nearly as arty as 'Raging Bull' but very similar in content. And, if possible, even trashier...and like a slow-motion train wreck at times as you watch the family in action. Fortunately, late in the film there are some glimmers of hope...some.",9,3,7,23 March 2011
Up in the Air," Profoundly sad....
","'Up in the Air' is a movie you must force yourself to stick with, as although many of the characters are difficult to like it's still very well worth seeing. Much of this is because of the clever script, much of it is because of the nice acting but most of it is because the film avoids all the typical clichés you see in movies. In fact, this is one of the best films of 2009--and far better than some of the other Oscar nominees. Perhaps not as good as 'Precious' or 'Hurt Locker' but a wonderful film.George Clooney stars as a strange and rather antisocial man. No, this does not mean he commits crimes or he hits people--he's just convinced that it's better to have no connections in life...none. He is thrilled that his job keeps him on the road 320+ days a year and has worked very hard to avoid closeness or ties. And, at first I hated this sort of thing as the film seemed to be saying this was a good thing. However, through the course of the film you see a few minor chinks in Clooney's armor. Perhaps it isn't quite as perfect as he says it is--even if he does give seminars on the joys of non-connectedness when he isn't doing his regular job--which is traveling the country and firing people for various clients--a great job for such a guy.There is MUCH more to the film than this and two important women that come into Clooney's life. But the best part of it is NEVER does the film give in to sentiment and clichés--Clooney does NOT discover any magic and the film does not end of a typical Hollywood note. It's daring and you may not like the fact it is not a 'happily ever after' film--but I loved that it was deliberately vague and left so much to the viewer to make of the movie. Clever and well worth seeing...HOWEVER, be careful. It's not a movie to watch if you are unemployed or have just come out of a relationship--it might just churn up too many personal issues. Great...just be careful.By the way, there was one thing I did not love about the film. The soundtrack was filled with too much LOUD indie wuss music and it was, at times, too pervasive and invasive.",9,1,5,3 June 2011
From Here to Eternity," A war film well worth seeing despite a casting problem
","This is a very good wartime soap opera--with a stronger emphasis on love than on war. The film stars a strong cast and all try very hard to make this an exceptional film. Burt Lancaster was very good as the 1st sergeant and Frank Sinatra was surprisingly good as a hot-headed G.I.--so much so, that this film rescued his flagging film career. The female love interests of Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr were also good--and Ms. Kerr did a good job of creating an American accent. However, for the life of me I cannot understand the decision to cast Montgomery Clift as Private Prewitt. While he was generally a good actor and did well in movies such as THE SEARCH, he was totally wrong for this part. I am assuming his recent popularity was the sole reason he was given this part, because physically he was all wrong. Clift played a guy who was supposedly a great middle-weight boxer--despite him being a very thin and delicate man who looked like he would have had a hard time beating Ms. Reed in a fight, let alone beat up two savage sergeants like he did in the movie. This appears to be yet another case of someone being cast for a role purely because he was a hot commodity at the time.Fortunately, aside from one bad casting decision, the film was excellent--blending romance and wartime well and making for a very entertaining film. While not as great as you might expect from a film that earned so many Oscars, it is nevertheless an exceptional film.FYI--The Japanese planes in the movie are actually American Texan trainers and SBD Dauntless bombers. Apparently there weren't any flight-worthy Japanese planes available, so the airplanes attacking Pearl Harbor are American ones!",9,3,9,1 January 2007
V for Vendetta," Among the best stuff you'll see from DC Comics.
","DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...'V for Vendetta'.The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film 'Danger: Diabolik'. Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",9,6,9,16 November 2019
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The film gets better and better each time I watch it
","Despite me giving this film a 10, it is NOT my favorite Coen Brothers film (that honor would go to the even more bizarre and quirky HUDSUCKER PROXY). However, it still is an amazingly good film. The first time I saw it, I might have scored it an 8, but now after seeing it again, I find myself laughing even harder and enjoying it even more. Plus, while the film is a hilarious retelling of Homer's 'ODYSSEY', I find myself spotting more and more story elements from this great book. The cleverness in doing this was truly a work of genius. On top of that, the music is so infectiously fun that you can't help but tap your feet and even sing along--it's THAT good.The film begins with the escape of three idiots from a chain gang. The normally handsome George Clooney is rather greasy and stubbly looking but he always manages to look far more attractive than his incredibly ugly and occasionally dim-witted sidekicks. I liked John Turturro quite a bit, but especially fun was Tim Blake Nelson as the dumbest and ugliest of the lot! He was incredibly funny throughout--especially when he was convinced that Turturro had been turned into a frog (much like when Odysseus' men had been turned into pigs in THE ODYSSEY).However, these three guys were not the whole show, as like most of the best Coen films, they are surrounded by the best supporting performances you can find in film. Charles Durning (who was great in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY) was delightful as the wily old governor and Holly Hunter was wonderfully awful, but so many wonderful actors and actresses adorned this lovely film. So many odd faces (much like a Fellini film) and quirky personalities made this film truly memorable.The look and sound of the film was also terrific--with a real nice early 1930s look about it and great sepia-toned cinematography and the best toe-tappinest soundtrack I've heard in years. I usually hate old time country music, but the songs they chose were amazing! And the actors did a great job in pretending to be singing the songs.See this film. In fact, after you see this film, see ANYTHING the Coens made--THE HUDSICKER PROXY, RAISING ARIZONA, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, INTELLERABLE CRUELTY, MILLERS CROSSING and pretty much most of their other wonderful films. Oddly, while it won so much fame, one of their worst and most disappointing films was FARGO--a one joke film. Plus, I gotta admit that BARTON FINK really fell apart towards the end.",10,4,9,19 September 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," I feel almost ashamed to admit I liked it...and it gets better with repeated viewing!
","Generally, when a 'hot' young comedian is embraced by Hollywood and the American public, I am loathe to see their films. Call me a snob, but I think most comedies in this mold are amazingly dumb and unwatchable--especially when they are done by 'Saturday Night Live' alumnus (who have a history of wretched films). However, even with these 'flavor of the moments' (and I assumed Will Farrell was), occasionally they make a movie that is still well worth seeing. Take, for examples, WATERBOY as well as TELLADEGA NIGHTS--both films made by popular SNL comedians who the American public adore--and both of which made some amazingly dumb and pointless films (LITTLE NICKY quickly comes to mind).So why did I like TALLADEGA NIGHTS? Well, because the film never took itself very seriously and again and again the film deliberately chose to avoid the standard clichés and formula. For once, the film did not insult its viewers by taking a by-the-numbers approach to the material. So many times, I was wrong guessing where the picture went and moments that seemed like they were about to be saccharine and contrived deliberately twisted the tables and went for dark and satisfying humor (such as when Ricky's dad shows up to get the tickets for the race).Did I love the movie? Certainly not. At times, the acting and characterizations were just too broad (such as the 'I'm on fire' scene) and there were quite a few flat moments in the film (mostly in the middle). Comedy-wise, this is not THE PRODUCERS or CITY LIGHTS, but it is pleasant and good for a few laughs.Having lived in Charlotte, NC several years ago, I REALLY enjoyed seeing the gentle way the film spoofed the fans and racers. To many non-NASCAR enthusiasts or those who live nowhere near the Southern states dominated by the sport, this all might fall a bit flat. But my having lived 10 minutes away from Lowes Motor Speedway and having to put up with all the hoopla (which is bad, since I hate auto racing), it was a delight to see this film. By the way, you may or may not be offended by the characterization of Ricky Bobby's arch-rival. If you are French, I can probably safely assume you won't find it very funny--though it also strongly pokes fun of Redneck America as well. Also, if you are gay and are very sensitive to this in films, you may also be offended. However, in this age of political correctness and hyper-sensitivity, it's a bit refreshing to see a film that could care less about these sensibilities. Grow thicker skin and just let yourself laugh. This American with French heritage sure could.",9,2,4,3 November 2007
Semi-Pro," Very little of the magic of TALLADEGA NIGHTS is evident here.
","In SEMI-PRO, Will Farrell is the owner-manager-player for the fictional ABA franchise Flint Tropics. For those of you too young to remember the ABA (American Basketball Association), it was a rival league to the NBA that really suffered due to lack of fan support as well as having teams in amazingly small markets in many cases. Unfortunately, even for an ABA team, attendance is lousy and the players are mostly untalented losers. However, when it's announced that the league is folding and four of its premier teams are moving to the NBA, Farrell is excited when it's agreed that the four teams that have the best record will become NBA franchises. This motivates him and his hapless players into finally playing like a team and it's rather predictable that they manage to pull it all together leading up to the final 'big game'.In many ways, the script is quite formulaic and you know what's going to happen, but there are a few cute moments that keep it interesting. SEMI-PRO is in some ways like TALLADEGA NIGHTS and SLAPSHOT rolled into one with one major exception--it doesn't come close to either of these movies in quality or especially laughs. This really surprised me, as I was expecting a sense of humor like TALLADEGA NIGHTS, but sadly there were only a few small moments like this--scenes Will Ferrell was doing promotions for his basketball team. The best of these insane promotions was probably the bear wrestling scene. I think the biggest problem was that in TALLADEGA NIGHTS, the races weren't really that important--the humor was. In SEMI-PRO, the film seemed to bog down when they actually were playing basketball--especially since, within the rules, you can't do anything THAT crazy. I really think the film would have been better served with either less basketball or by simply throwing reality out the window during these ballgame scenes. Plus, while it sure looked like SLAPSHOT at times because of some of the fighting and a team's efforts to avoid folding, it never really went far enough regarding social commentary or the likable humor of SLAPSHOT.In addition to not quite succeeding like these other two films, SEMI-PRO was extremely vulgar--and often not in a funny way. Too many testicle jokes, crude language and vomiting references--and these were supposed to be the funny moments in the film. Sadly, the crude humor didn't work and really make this a film that is NOT child-friendly.If you are a Will Farrell fan, there's enough to this film that you'll like, so give it a shot. If you are not a Farrell fan, then this film will do nothing to convince you otherwise. My advice is see TALLADEGA NIGHTS and STRANGER THAN FICTION--two exceptional films that show Farrell has some depth and can make a real crowd-pleasing film. SEMI-PRO is a bit of a dud.FYI--Check out the trivia section on IMDb about this film. Apparently, only a short time after this film the bear used in the fighting scene actually killed someone!",5,4,7,15 June 2008
The Godfather," #2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!
","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review 'The Godfather'. After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II', see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.",10,17,29,30 March 2013
