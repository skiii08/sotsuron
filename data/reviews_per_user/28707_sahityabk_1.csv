Skyfall," Overall good direction and stunning cinematography save a lousy script...
","Its good. It is good. Only because of the direction and cinematography. If u were to focus solely on the events of the film, it falls apart. This is one of those movies that is carried by direction cinematography and acting(besides Naomi Harris, she was severely miscast). Basically one major department is crap and that is the screenplay, and all others are solid. This is a testament to Sam Mendes as a director, because only a truly talented director can make a good movie out of a bad script. Any faults in this movie should be attributed to the writers. The overcompensation for the writing by all other departments is so staggering that this movie has been confused by critics for a cause for debate for the greatest bond movie ever. Whereas in reality, it should be up for debate for the worst script for a bond film. Seriously we r talking about a transformers level script here. Thats why they waited for Sam Mendez to direct the next bond film. Because he elevated a garbage script to million dollar blockbuster status. Hopefully the writers will give Sam Mendez a decent script for the next bond film so he can show his true potential!",7,0,2,4 May 2015
