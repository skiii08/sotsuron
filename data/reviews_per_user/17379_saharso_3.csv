Resident Evil: Afterlife," Disappointing
","I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 2 years. Expecting a thrilling action-filled zombie flick like its predecessors, all I could find was one of the most boring, unthought-of and painfully predictable films I had the misfortune of seeing. The action scenes were scarce, too short and not particularly interesting; the special effects were shallow, almost amateurish, and not innovating in any way; and the plot was practically nonexistent. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen that would justify my expectations, only to be disappointed again and again with every passing minute. The only climax in the movie was the opening scene. But even that was not much more than a pale imitation of one 'the matrix'' fight scenes.To sum up: you already watched all the interesting parts in the trailer. Don't bother with the rest.",2,4,10,4 October 2010
2012," Starts out great, but exhausts itself towards the end
","When you thought that disaster movies cannot renovate themselves, this movie comes along and sets a whole new standard. The special effects not only gave a highly realistic sensation, they provided beautiful images, which the viewer will not soon forget. The action scenes were thrilling, elegant and creative.However, the film was too long and tended to play itself out after the first half. The second part of the movie showed the survivors trying to fix a malfunction in one of the arcs that were supposed to shelter them from the earthquakes. This part proved to be long, tedious, predictable and quite unrealistic. The idea that the main character – a limousine driver and failing novelist – could somehow become a humanity saving hero with almost supernatural powers (illustrated by the under-water scene) – is highly unbelievable and tends to put a dent in the whole movie experience.The movie also tried to convey a social and moral lesson: we were supposed to understand that moral issues should be put into politics, and not merely cold calculations, even if it means carrying on greater risks and sacrifices. That to was quite unrealistic: our world leaders hardly acknowledge moral considerations in peaceful times. Why would they start doing so when their own survival is at stake?",6,0,0,9 October 2010
RED," Doesn't deliver the goods
","On the face of things this movie seems to have everything going for it: with an action movie about a retired CIA agent being chased by his highly skilled pears, with Bruce Willis in the leading role, and a distinguished row of beloved actors by his side, the viewer may ask him or herself what can possibly go wrong? Surprisingly, the answer is: practically everything.After a very promising beginning, the movie very quickly ran out of steam. The remainder hour and a half exhibited a rather dull story line and action scenes that wouldn't be innovating even in the 1970s. The direction of the action scenes seem to have no soul: they were void and unoriginal, with not mush thought brought into them. Just a bunch of people running around with guns doesn't quite cut it in today's standards. After so many action films being produced in the last three decades, the viewers thirst for something new. This movie just repeats old formulas and is not even good at that.Other than in the beginning there was a rather well done action scene at an air port. Too bad it was highly unrepresentative to the rest of this movie. On any other respect, the movie seemed to deteriorate as it went on. The end-scene was as unreliable as it was anti-climatic. The villains were shallow: their motivations were unclear and unreliable, and there was nothing particularly interesting about them. To sum up in tow words: disappointing, unfulfilling.",4,6,13,22 October 2010
