Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite good overall, but the Jar Jar character will usher in the era of digital editing!
","The best scene by far is the Jedi vs. Sith battle; it's absolutely magnificent and worth the cost of admission all by itself.  The pod race is also excellent, though obviously stolen right out of Ben Hur.  Overall the movie was very satisfying, and hey, it's Star Wars, though it didn't quite live up to the hype IMHO.  The Jar Jar character, however, has got to go! At least he moves into the background during the latter -- and better -- half of the move, but his annoying presence dominates the first 20 to 30 minutes!  I'm wondering if I can get my copy with him digitally edited out... ?",7,0,0,19 May 1999
