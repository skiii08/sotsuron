First Man," A very solid biopic
","The best thing about this film is the acting, terrific performances were given by both Claire Foy and Ryan Gosling. There are also very few flaws in the supporting cast.
The soundtrack by Justin Hurwitz is very solid and in some cases even outstanding. The music does in a way remind me of some of Interstellar's epic moments, although, as I admire that film greatly, it isn't on the same level. Some parts of the first half of the movie can admittedly be a bit slow but once it pickes up the pace it becomes very enjoyable. This applies especially for a few shocking scenes that did quite suprise me. However, since this is a biopic, the story never took on a direction that was very unanticipated and although that is unavoidable, it brought the movie down a bit. This is overall just a good movie with a solid story and some moments that stand out, but in the end it doesn't do anything revolutionairy",8,1,3,6 November 2018
