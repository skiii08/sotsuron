The Longest Yard," Better Than the Original
","When movies come out with a remake it is usually not as good as the original. The remake of The Longest Yard is more entertaining than the first. Some of the sexual jokes may not be suitable for younger audiences. As compared to the original with Burt Reynolds, the remake is much funnier and more enjoyable to watch. The director also did a great job of introducing the characters and gets viewers to really dislike the guards with use of racial discrimination and abuse to Paul Crewe. Adam Sandler along with Chris Rock makes this a great comedy for all teenagers. The chemistry of these two actors showed in this movie. They were why this movie was so funny. Sandler did a great job of playing Paul Crewe and was a huge factor of why this remake was better than the original.Movie technology played a big role in why this movie was so entertaining. The final football game was intense, humorous, and fun. Camera positioning and cutting made one feel as if they were in the game. This not only occurred in the final game, but also throughout the entire movie. This remake is one that can be watched over and over because the comedy never gets old. It is a great movie and everyone should buy it, or at least rent it.",9,1,1,28 November 2005
