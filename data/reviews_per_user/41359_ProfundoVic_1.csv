Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," ..'taking 'Borat'too seriously will pass, as the laughs come.. non stop'..
","Sacha Cohen(A jew)became Borat from Kadjistan and has stayed in character now and will be better than Peter Sellers cause he has absolutely nothing to hold him back.This movie is the type of movie that separates the 'old fuddy duddys' from the 'love to laugh at at life' types.I saw it three times even bought the soundtrack (I use it to wake me up on my cd alarm clock)I'm not Jewish i don't think the anti jew stuff was needed but it was funny and remembering that Borat really is a jew might be the reason he got away with it.But taking 'Borat'too seriously will pass, as the laughs come pretty much non-stop.Just thinking about it i start to get giddy. You will love it or despise it!!but it's pure politically incorrect fun!!! Thank you Borat!! There will be much more i hope!",10,1,23,15 January 2007
