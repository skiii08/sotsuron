The Avengers," Over-hyped through and through
","I will not make this review very long, but you can add it to anyone else's that gave this a 3 out of 10. First of all, I will say that this film is perhaps the first one (for me ever) that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet. I could not sleep had I spent $10 at the theater on it, and for that matter $3.00 for a one-evening rental of it on DVD.As I downloaded it, I was really excited, mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even. And wow, was I so wrong in doing that. Keep in mind, I know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie, but I have seen Iron Man, Captain America and the last two Incredible Hulk remakes, and somehow this grouping of all the Marvel characters, diminishes the value of all the characters' individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing. I really liked Iron Man but his one- or two-liners in this film are not funny, but very cheesy and predictable. The costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous, namely Loki his 'ram-looking horns' or whatever, Hawkeye and his blue contacts and then CGI diminishes all of the others' looks. And finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of a very few films I have ever watched where I stopped ( or paused) it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else, come back a couple hours later, continue watching,only to repeat the same thing again and again. It took about a day for me to finish it! I mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times. All the fan-boys who may argue out there, don't please because I obviously realize you are a fan-boy. Anyone else looking for a 'truly good, Oscar-winning, or perhaps classic and one-for-the-history-books' type of film, look elsewhere.",3,7,15,11 November 2012
Evil Dead," A hell of a horror movie!!!
","Setting aside any comparisons of this film versus Sam Raimi's originals, I proceed with my review. This is a kick ass horror movie, a fresh feast in such a watered-down genre. Straight to the point, here is why it's so great. The premise of the characters being at a cabin in the woods is believable, and original despite that setting alone being clich√© on its own. All of the characters make excellent performances at all times throughout the film. Gore? Plenty of it-but very well done and refreshing all the same for each scenario its in. In fact, it is done so well and keeps pace with the speed of the film and story, etc. that I laughed in amazement of its brilliancy. Scary? Perhaps, at some points, for some people. Whoever wants to be scared will probably. Others might expect things that happen as they do if you know the horror genre well enough. And even up until the very end, this movie never gives up, never falls flat. All I can say its an enjoyable, well-done film. Taking all this into account, I suggest for a REAL new and refreshing take for a horror movie amongst others coming out these days, it's a must see. I would even be in favor of a sequel, but ONLY if the director or writers can top or at minimum match the level of this film throughout. Have fun and go see it!",8,4,19,3 July 2013
