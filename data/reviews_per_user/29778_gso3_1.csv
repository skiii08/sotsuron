Requiem for a Dream," Real life is much more shocking and vivid, totally overrated movie!
","I really can't trust these ratings at all anymore. I have put off watching this movie for years due to hearing about how depressing it is, depressing indeed.Only a few minutes in and you're hit with a visual assault of flashing images, changing from frame to frame.. which persists the entire movie, what horrible editing. I mean, Tarantino does something similar but this is 10x the pace and intensity, without any style either. They kept repeating that same song, really loudly too.Credit where it's due, this movie does portray the horror of withdrawal very accurately, the sweats, going mental and doing anything for the next hit.But what was with the fridge moving and coming after the old woman, full blown hallucinations on diet pills? I don't think so. It was difficult to watch that same game show segment being played over and over.I guess this is rated highly because it sends home a message to teenagers, not to do drugs and the consequences it could have on themselves, their future, family etc.However, some parts were unrealistic, there wasn't a plot at all that I could see.. one sole objective - make the movie as dark and depressing as possible. Kind of like media scaremongering.In any case, I will never watch this again. I'd much rather watch a documentary with real life stories than this series of unfortunate events, portrayed in such a bleak and hopeless manner.",2,4,7,7 July 2013
