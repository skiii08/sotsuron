Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not the usual tat !!!
","An excellent film which breaks the mould of the usual tat thrust into our cinemas! Borat is very funny and well thought out. It will having you laughing out loud with everyone else in the cinema, staring at the screen thinking 'how can he have the guts to do that?!' and also squirming in your seat with embarrassment felt for him!It holds a mirror up to American society and probably shows the rest of the World the worst of it! The racist and bigoted, the scarily fundamental Christians and the pretentious.If you do not know who Borat is or understand what he is about, then you will not like this film. However, if you are a fan of Cohen, then this is quite a riot!",10,3,19,10 November 2006
