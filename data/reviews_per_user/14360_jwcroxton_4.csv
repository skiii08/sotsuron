Alien 3," Not As Bad As It's Made Out To Be
","Prison boys thirsty for sex cast away their desires in order to help Ellen Ripley destroy the aliens in and around her. She then kills herself in an effort to keep the government from taking her and the alien inside of her and creating military-grade weapons out of them. First off, this film ain't as bad as everybody make it out to be. This film is quite charming when you look at how the story fits somewhat into the rest of the franchise and its exquisite use of hybrid aliens. I would have to say that this is maybe the worst of the franchise, BUT the franchise itself is excellent and there haven't been a bonafide flops. This make this a great film with great special effects and great storyline.",7,2,2,2 May 2014
Alien: Resurrection," Great Film!
","Undeniably one of the top videos of the franchise. This rating is simple due to the ever-changing story and action packed events that keep you on the edge of your seats. Ellen Ripley does a great job using her new alien blood to her advantage in her efforts to exterminate the extraterrestrial species.Although the film is by far one of the best in the franchise, keeping track of how the cloning and cross-breeding can be quite difficult. This film is just one of those that will take a few watches to fully understand and articulate what it going on. All in all, this is an excellent film with a great storyline and it worth every minute!",8,3,5,2 May 2014
Alien," Perfection.
","Such an action packed film that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 117 minutes. The chestburster scenes are raw ( the cast wasn't told what was going to happen ) and leave most of the audience with nightmares to last a lifetime.This film is what started it all. I would have to say that the only downside is just that I felt that there could have been more aliens than there were. I guess it would be easy to say that it left us with many unanswered questions that would later be answered in one or more of the sequels. However, a bulk were answered in Prometheus. This film left every viewer scared for there lives in their own homes thinking that a facehugger was just around the corner.",9,2,4,2 May 2014
Aliens," Perfection.
","If there is a perfect film, it's this one!Spectacular acting and supreme special effects make this film come to life as Sigourney Weaver portrays the ultimate feminist, Ellen Ripley, once again. James Cameron never ceases to amaze me with his supreme skill in capturing the full effect of a movie, even in a sequel. This makes this the top film in the entire franchise. We as an audience are finally able to see how these hideous creatures are reproduced, and it ain't pretty. In the end, it is obvious that more films are to come as so many questions are left unanswered.",10,1,2,2 May 2014
