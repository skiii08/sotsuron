Whip It," Welcome to the world of roller derby!
","'Whip It' takes you into the sport of roller derby, which can be quite intense for the participants, and for the spectators. However, the movie is more than that. Ellen Page is likable as Bliss Cavendar, a seventeen-year-old who is a regular at teen pageants in the state of Texas. While her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and little sister enjoy the pageant circuit, it is not for Bliss.One day, the trio are at a store, and as Bliss pays for a pair of shoes, she sees three women come in, all on roller skates. They leave behind fliers for a roller derby in Austin. Bliss and her best friend Pash go to the event, and Bliss is immediately interested in the sport. After the match, she meets one of the skaters, Maggie Mayhem (SNL's Kristen Wiig, who does a good job with the role). Maggie tells Bliss she should try out, despite the fact that Bliss has not skated in years. Bliss says she'll attend the tryout, lying about her age during the conversation (the minimum age to participate is twenty-one).Bliss returns home and starts skating. She shows up to the tryout, and earns a spot on the Hurl Scouts team. The trouble is that the Hurl Scouts are the worst team on the circuit. Bliss also makes an enemy in the form of Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis, who was well cast), the obligatory arrogant athlete who also happens to be the best on the track. In her debut, Bliss, who is now Babe Ruthless (you have to love the name), draws praise from her teammates, and the head coach, Razor (Andrew Wilson, who is a crackup in this movie).Time passes, and Bliss gets better at roller derby, and so do the Hurl Scouts. While this is going on, Bliss has a developing romance with Oliver, a musician. The Hurl Scouts continue to tear up the circuit, reaching the title game to take on the team led by Iron Maven. What will happen?This was Drew Barrymore's first film as a director, and she deserves praise for the job she did. Drew also deserves a nod for her turn as Smashley Simpson, who is the goofiest member of the Hurl Scouts. The movie works as a comedy and drama. It is really a coming-of-age tale, and it is a good one. I recommend that you watch 'Whip It.'",7,1,5,22 April 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A movie everyone can enjoy
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a truly unique film. It is part film noir, part animation, part comedy, and part drama. That is something that Hollywood doesn't make each day.The movie takes place in Los Angeles in 1947. Roger Rabbit, a Toon, as all the cartoon characters are called, is filming a cartoon and has trouble with a scene. Detective Eddie Valiant watches from behind the scenes and afterward goes to see studio head R.K. Maroon, who informs Valiant that Roger cannot concentrate because his wife Jessica Rabbit, another Toon, has reportedly been seen with a man recently. Maroon wants Valiant to find out who the man is. This does not sit well with Valiant because a Toon murdered his brother some years earlier. However, he ultimately agrees to take the case.It does not take long for Valiant to find out who the man is: Marvin Acme, the owner of Toontown and the Gag Factory. Valiant reports his findings to Maroon and Roger, and Roger goes crazy and takes off.The next morning, Valiant gets word that Acme has been killed. Once he arrives at the Acme Factory, Valiant meets Judge Doom, who has fingered Roger as the guilty party in Acme's murder. His goal is to find Roger and bring him to justice, which includes putting Roger into a barrel of 'dip,' which is the one way a Toon can be destroyed. Doom and his Toon Patrol, a quintet of weasels, are on the lookout for Roger.After leaving the Acme Factory, Valiant returns to his office, and Roger is there waiting for him. He tells Valiant he did not kill Acme, and pleads with Valiant to help him clear his name. Valiant at first wants no part of this, but eventually he decides to help Roger.While this is going on, Acme's will is missing, and Valiant is also keeping an eye out for that. The finding of the will is important because it involves Toontown's future.There is not one bad thing about this movie. The casting is terrific, with Bob Hoskins giving an excellent performance as Valiant, and Cristopher Lloyd is a convincing Judge Doom, who is a very eerie individual. The animation is first rate, and fans of the animation genre will love that the major cartoon characters from Disney, Warner Bros., and other studios, are in this film. What is truly amazing is how the Toons and the humans actually interact. It really looks as if the Toons are real. There are also very funny and clever sight gags, many of them a tribute to the cartoon shorts of yesteryear. The script also pays tribute to the history of animation at times, and has some funny lines as well. Not only that, it is also successful in making the characters interesting and memorable, and that applies to the humans and the Toons. The sets deserve mentioning also. It looks completely like Los Angeles in 1947.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a movie that everyone can enjoy. The kids will obviously love the cartoons, as will admirers of animation. Adults can find the story interesting with it being part mystery. Of course, the film works as a comedy, too, and everyone will certainly laugh at some point. This is a great movie. Don't miss it.",8,0,0,5 April 2010
Dead Poets Society," A well done film about coming of age
","'Dead Poets Society' is a movie that is enjoyable with just good acting and competent filmmakers at the helm.John Keating arrives at Welton Academy in 1959, years after attending the school, as the new English teacher. He wastes no time making an impact on his students, saying 'Carpe Diem,' or 'Seize the day' to them. The pupils at first do not know what to make of Keating, who is not the usual Welton teacher. After coming across a yearbook, a group of his students find out that Keating belonged to a club called the Dead Poets Society. Seeking answers, they confront Keating, and he reluctantly tells them about going to a cave not far from the school, and he and his fellow members recited and created poetry. Intrigued by what he heard, Neil Perry, the leader of the group, organizes a revival of the Dead Poets Society, and everyone agrees to attend. Later on, Neil finds an old poetry book on his desk. Upon opening it, he finds that it is Keating's copy of the book that was used at each meeting. The gang goes to the cave and spends the night there, immersed in poetry.Keating has an impact on the boys in more ways than one. He tells them they are going to think for themselves, and to find their own voice. Several of the boys take that to heart. Meanwhile, Mr Nolan, the Academy's headmaster, has received word about Keating's teaching style. He approaches Keating about this, and wanting to put a stop to Keating's maverick methods, tells him to just prepare them for college and leave it at that. However, Nolan is already too late, for several of Keating's students have already decided to see what life is all about.'Dead Poets Society' features a talented ensemble cast. Robin Williams is great as Keating, in one of his best dramatic performances. Robert Sean Leonard (known to TV viewers as Wilson on House) are both good as Neil and Todd. And Kurtwood Smith, best known as Red Forman on 'That 70s Show,' is well cast as Neil's stern and demanding father. The film is a story of a dedicated teacher, but it is also a coming of age tale. In addition, it is a study of conformity vs. non-conformity. It would have been interesting to see how the lives of the characters turned out during the 1960s, when the counterculture first came about. This is a movie that you should watch. Don't miss it.",8,2,2,11 April 2010
Ed Wood," A very good film about a very bad director
","When you hear names like Ford, Hitchcock, Scorsese, and Spielberg in discussions about who the best director in movie history is, you are not going to hear the name Ed Wood mentioned with them. Edward D. Wood, Jr. is considered by many to be the worst director ever, and this film tells his story.Set in Hollywood in the middle part of the 1950s, Wood's goal is to direct, following in the footsteps of his hero, Orson Welles. He embarks on his quest, and at this time happens to meet the legendary Bela Lugosi, who has no money and has been battling a drug addiction for many years. The two become friends and eventually collaborate on several Wood films.With Lugosi in the mix, Wood and his group of friends begin filming movies that have been rated among the worst in cinematic history. However, the young filmmaker has a never give up attitude. He loves the movies, and feels that this is his calling, and just keeps working.The movie is very enjoyable to watch. The acting is very good, with Johnny Depp doing a great job as Wood, and Martin Landau giving an unforgettable performance as Lugosi. Landau would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and it was deserved. The script is well written, with several memorable lines spoken throughout the film's duration. Not only that, the characters are interesting. None of them are weak. The opening credits pay homage to the movie's main subject (you'll understand if you've seen Wood's movies. If you haven't, you'll see what I mean later in the film). Fittingly, the movie, like all of Wood's, is shot in black and white. 'Ed Wood' is an example of quality movie-making. Directed by Tim Burton, who deserves praise for this film, 'Ed Wood' is a movie that you should not miss.",8,0,0,4 April 2010
Rocky II," Good sequel
","'Rocky II' is a nicely done film that continues the story of the one and only Rocky Balboa.The film starts immediately after Rocky and Apollo Creed's match. Both fighters are being sent to the hospital, where a pack of reporters are awaiting them. Rocky arrives first, and announces he is retired. Apollo comes in moments later, and wants a rematch. Despite the fact that Apollo won the match by split decision, he thinks Rocky's performance was a fluke. Rocky sees no reason to take part in a rematch, and the matter remains unsettled.After he is fully healed, Rocky tries to adjust to life after boxing. He and Adrian get married, and she becomes pregnant soon after. However, Rocky quickly finds that retirement from the ring may not be the best option for him. Adrian is opposed to Rocky making a comeback. Rocky has an eye problem by this time, and she fears that he could go blind if he fights again. Mickey feels the same way, even testing Rocky's eyesight to show Rocky that fighting would not be a wise decision.While Rocky contemplates resuming his boxing career, Apollo has not gotten over what happened in the first fight. Still wanting a rematch, he resorts to humiliating Rocky in the newspaper and on TV. Unable to take it anymore, Rocky decides to come out of retirement. Will Apollo win and prove he was right about Rocky, or will Rocky triumph this time around? Or will the two boxers fight to a draw? The film was written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, and he does well in both roles. Talia Shire is convincing as Adrian, Carl Weathers is perfect as Creed, Burt Young lends good support as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith is fun to watch as Mickey. I also enjoyed the film's score very much.If you liked the first 'Rocky,' you'll like this. It is worth watching.",7,0,1,26 August 2010
Rocky," An underdog people can relate to
","'Rocky' is one of those movies where you identify with the protagonist in some way. Everyone wishes for a chance to change their lives, but how often does that happen? Well, it happens to Rocky.Rocky Balboa is a boxer who fights in local bouts in Philadelphia. To supplement his income, he takes a job collecting for a loan shark named Gazzo. Despite being involved in such a brutal sport and seedy occupation, Rocky is a decent human being. He trains at a gym owned by Mickey, who was a fighter in the 1920s. Mickey cares about Rocky, but sees him as a fighter not living up to his potential.Across the street from the gym is a pet store where a girl named Adrian works. Rocky takes a liking to Adrian, but she does not reciprocate those feelings. It's not that she dislikes Rocky, she is just very shy. Eventually, a relationship blossoms between the two.Rocky is friends with Adrian's brother Paulie, who works at a meat company. Paulie is one of those people who are just rude, and he is mean to Adrian in several scenes in the picture.Unbeknownst to Rocky, Apollo Creed, the Heavyweight Champion of the World, is looking for an opponent to fight after the original challenger pulls out of the contest due to a hand injury. The fight itself is to take place in Philadelphia on New Year's Day 1976, which signals the beginning of America's Bicentennial. After Apollo finds Rocky's name in a book of local fighters, he sees the possibilities. As a result, Rocky becomes the challenger.After accepting the offer, Rocky is paid a visit by Mickey. He explains to Rocky that this chance is a once-in-a-lifetime scenario, and he offers to become Rocky's manager. Rocky does not believe that Mickey is being sincere, since he needed Mickey's help once before and did not get it. Mickey leaves, and Rocky starts yelling at him in a rage. He catches up with Mickey moments later and the two work out their differences. After a handshake, Mickey becomes Rocky's trainer, and the two begin to prepare for the big fight.The cast deserves praise. Stallone pulls double duty as actor and writer, and succeeds on both counts. Talia Shire is good as Adrian. Carl Weathers gives a fine performance as Apollo Creed. Burt Young is well cast as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith is terrific as Mickey.John G. Avildsen, who directed 'The Karate Kid' and 'Lean on Me,' does a good job here. Rocky's running to the Art Museum with 'Gonna Fly Now' playing is a scene that stays in your memory. That can be said about several lines in the film as well.I cannot say anything negative about this movie. It is well done and you should see it.",8,1,1,27 April 2010
The Wrestler," Great film
","'The Wrestler' is a powerful study of a man who has gone from the top of the world to the bottom of it. Mickey Rourke (in an excellent performance) is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a legendary professional wrestler who headlined events for years. He is now wrestling for an independent circuit on weekends in small auditoriums. What's more, Robinson is involved in hardcore matches, which are no picnic. When he is not wrestling, the protagonist tries to find work in the meat department at a grocery store . During his free time, he visits the local strip club, where Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) works. After one of the hardcore contests, Robinson suffers a heart attack in the locker room. After he wakes up in a hospital bed, his doctor tells him that changes in his lifestyle must be made, and that he has no choice. One of the changes is that he can never wrestle again. If Robinson does not follow this order, it could mean serious consequences.Once Cassidy finds out what happened to Robinson, she asks him about his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years. Because of Robinson's status as a wrestler, he was constantly on the road. This resulted in missed birthdays, holidays, and other important events in his daughter's life. Obviously, this created a rift in their relationship. With help from Cassidy, Robinson decides to see his daughter, Stephanie. Initially, she does not want to see him, but she does spend time with him. Will their relationship heal after so many years? As for Robinson, he hears that a special twentieth anniversary match between he and a fellow wrestler is in the works. The match they had was a major one at that time, and Robinson contemplates participating, knowing what could happen.Tomei is good as Cassidy , and Evan Rachel Wood gives a nice performance as Stephanie. The wrestling scenes can make someone squeamish, so you have been warned. Another aspect of the film I want to talk about is the title itself: The Wrestler. This title has two meanings. One of them is self-explanatory, and has been talked about in this review. The other is that Robinson is wrestling with life. He was a man who was probably as popular as Hulk Hogan (I read somewhere that the Ram was modeled after Hogan), and looking at him now, you would not know it. There are several scenes that convey this message, especially early on when Robinson goes home. Just look at where home is. It is not a place you would expect a well known wrestler to be residing. The title may seem plain, but it is brilliant.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this movie. I try not to take awards shows seriously, but if Rourke had won Best Actor for this at the Oscars, I feel he would have deserved it. A Best Picture nomination would have been justified, too. My conclusion: This is worth watching.",8,0,0,11 July 2010
Kingpin," If you like bowling, you'll like this.
","For all of you who are looking for a good comedy, I recommend 'Kingpin.' This is a movie that consistently makes me laugh.The main character is Roy Munson (played by Woody Harrelson), a man whose promising career as a bowler was cut short after a hustle attempt led to the loss of his bowling hand. Nearly twenty years later, he is an alcoholic who sells bowling supplies to local alleys. One day, he meets an Amish man named Ishmael (Randy Quaid) who impresses Roy with his bowling skills. Later on, Roy reads about an upcoming bowling tournament that is to be held at the National Bowling Stadium in Reno, Nevada, with the grand prize being one million dollars. Believing Ishmael could have a legitimate chance in the contest, Roy heads to the Amish community where Ishmael resides, finding him and telling him about the opportunity. At first, Ishmael passes on the idea because he does not want his family to find out he bowls. However, once he learns that the community is in financial trouble, he agrees to go to Reno with Roy.Roy becomes Ishmael's trainer, teaching him what is necessary to claim victory in the tournament. Along the way, they meet up with a woman named Claudia (Vanessa Angel) at the home of her boyfriend Stanley, with whom Ishmael has a bowling match with in an effort to win some money to get to Reno. Things go awry at Stanley's, and Claudia leaves there with the duo and they make their way across the U.S. to Reno, where Roy discovers that Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray), is bowling in the event. McCracken was involved in the situation that ultimately cost Roy his career, and this is the first time they have met face to face since that night. Ishmael has an accident and breaks his wrist, which of course eliminates any chance of him competing in the contest. This leads Roy back to the lanes, bowling for the first time in years. How will he do?'Kingpin' makes one laugh in different ways. To start with, there are plenty of laughs generated by Roy's hook and prosthetic hand. The film itself is a spoof of 'The Natural' (if you've watched that, you'll see what I mean). Randy Quaid is good as Ishmael, and Ishmael's lack of knowledge about life outside his home leads to some pretty funny moments. Bill Murray is talented at playing obnoxious characters, and he is perfect as Ernie McCracken. Vanessa Angel of 'Weird Science' fame is also well cast as Claudia. There are funny lines throughout the movie and there are some gross out moments (you have been warned). Overall, this is just pure comedy that is enjoyable.",8,1,3,14 April 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Looking for a good mystery?
","The most famous sleuth in all of literature is back. 'Sherlock Holmes' is the latest movie to feature the brilliant detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.At the opening of the picture, Sherlock and his assistant Dr. Watson are in pursuit of Lord Blackwood, a man who is involved in black magic. He has murdered five people, and is on the verge of claiming another victim before Holmes and Watson come to the rescue. Lord Blackwood is arrested and sent to jail.A couple of months later, Watson is set to move out of 221B Baker Street and get married. Holmes is in a disheveled state, which is apparently normal for him in between cases. Lord Blackwood, who is sentenced to die, calls for Holmes. Reaching Blackwood's jail cell, Holmes listens as Blackwood tells him that he will return from the grave and kill again, and will change the existence of society, and Holmes will be powerless to do anything. Holmes departs, Blackwood is hanged later that day, and is pronounced dead by Watson.Soon after, Irene Adler, who is both a criminal and woman that Sherlock has had an interest in for some time, comes to visit. She asks Holmes to find a man named Reordan. After she leaves, he follows her in disguise, and finds out that she is working for somebody, but does not know who it is.Holmes and Watson are called to the graveyard, where Lord Blackwood's crypt has been destroyed. A man says he saw Blackwood rise from his tomb earlier that day. The police bring the casket out into the open, and when the lid is opened, they find that Reordan is inside. Holmes sets out to determine what is going on.Robert Downey, Jr. has fun playing Sherlock, and it shows. Jude Law is also good as Watson, and Rachel McAdams gives a fine performance as Irene.Something else I liked about this movie is that the screenwriters, Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg, made the film like one of Conan Doyle's stories. If any of you have ever read a Holmes mystery, you'll know what I mean. Visual effects fans will not be disappointed with this, either. The effects are good.Whether you are a Holmes fan, or looking for a movie in the mystery genre, watch this one. It's good.",7,0,2,24 April 2010
Toy Story 3," Pixar does it again
","I have seen several movies that Pixar has made, and have liked every single one of them. Toy Story 3 is no exception.The story begins quite a while after Toy Story 2. Andy is now a teenager and is preparing to attend college. Woody, Buzz and the gang have been kept in the toy box, no longer getting the attention that they once did. With Andy leaving the house shortly, that is not about to change.Since Andy is no longer going to be living at home, a decision must be made about the toys. Other than Woody, the group gets put into a trash bag, with the intention that they shall be stored in the attic. As for Woody, he will be going to college with Andy.The bag containing the other toys accidentally gets sent to the curb, where the trash truck is headed. They escape and make it to the family car. Woody joins them, trying to explain to them that they were not meant to go into the trash. The toys do not believe that, and decide it's time to move on. In the middle of this argument, Andy's mom gets into the car and heads to the Sunnyside Daycare Center.After arriving at Sunnyside, the gang is greeted by the building's resident toys. The leader is Lots-O-Huggin Bear (Lotso for short), a very friendly toy. He tells the newcomers how fun Sunnyside is. Each day, the several kids who attend play with the toys nonstop. It's several hours of playtime. Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, and the others love it. After what happened with Andy, this is perfect. Woody is not content, of course. Andy is his kid, and that's all there is to it. Will the group split? Will Sunnyside become their permanent home? Is Andy going to miss them? The voice acting is great as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are just right as Woody and Buzz, respectively. Ned Beatty's voice is somewhat unrecognizable as Lotso. Every actor and actress is well cast.The movie has its share of funny dialogue and the sight gags are terrific. There are also references to the film's predecessors that fans of the trilogy will enjoy. I must comment on one of the new characters. That would be Ken, and he has many funny moments throughout Toy Story 3, such as when he meets Barbie, and when he models clothes for Barbie. You get a good laugh there. You'll also laugh when Buzz becomes Spanish Buzz. It leads to some great moments.Once again, Pixar delivers good entertainment. The studio really stands out at a time when movies seem to just be remakes of something else. Pixar is really about quality. Anyone can enjoy Toy Story 3. It is perfect for families. Make this one the next family movie.",8,0,1,21 June 2010
