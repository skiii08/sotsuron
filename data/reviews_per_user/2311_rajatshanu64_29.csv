Source Code," Negotiation with science Just for Happy End
",Source Code i did enjoy and it's also worth of time to watch this movie as a fan of sci-fi this is movie however little similar to tom cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow but i like this one much in movie you can see how there is a science stuff who is sending back to a caption to explore the person who did bomb explode in train he got 8 min to find that when he failed he sent back again well with a view angle of science maybe it's possible to force someone to think about it's past very deeply with some science machine i understand when it's go behind time not really just with his brain amazing movie at all when men change the future and stop to being explosion however it is not possible but it's give very amazing end like Happy end but i don't know they did change some science that is not possible but it gives movie a good end and well it's all about entertainment so it's Good to give end like this nice movie at all,9,1,1,2 September 2016
Gravity," what a brave man
","Academy Awards, USA 2014 win and 222 other wins and 169 nominations this movie is just got much achievement i just watch to know why it got a lot's of award and after watching it watching cum feeling it some astronauts in space got trouble and struggling to return in earth and only one lady did in last but there was man i think the man is just something beyond how can somebody control himself like he is controlling he is all time talking funny when they are in trouble he still talk funny he is very near to death but he just didn't stop it what a man no one can do it like that and when i was watching i just trying to feel it so whenever in space they just moving here and there for a moment they just quit spaceship and not holding anything mean they are totally free my heartbeat increase like if they just miss one time to hold a part of ship his life just gone because that's space you can't stop you you can't run you they just push himself with a force so they can reach to another short distance place where they want to go but when the trouble is involved they can't even bind himself by a rope and that brave man just give his life for that woman so she probably can reach in earth and she did it in last however she quit hope in between and letting her die but then she think about that man what will he do and she just did it and when she just reach in earth and just lie in floor and don't wanna too stand she is just feeling how happy she is when you just escape death what a moment don't watch this movie probably you will not like just feel it feel the fear of death that they guys are facing and being astronaut is so difficult you just go in space like a death mission no one can 100% sure that they will return safe.",10,4,6,15 December 2016
Passengers," i can't be a passenger
",A good mixture of technology with love. technology is really great they are in a space ship which is very big and so comfortable with luxury things and carrying 5000 passengers gods know where . but there were a accident one of them a man got out from hibernation and he was alone in whole ship and there is 100 years ahead him to reach his destination he will surely dead but he break another girls hibernation just to get someone's company i don't think he did wrong cause just look at his life you will dead in some years and you don't have any human around you how you will gonna feel man i just can't imagine maybe feeling like The Martian or something now he got company of girl they are good until girl knew he break her hibernation. there was big big attack in ship but ship is still stand that's really very weird just whole ship is nearly burnt out but they got escaped overall a good one the love between them is good and technology was awesome.

About Time," wasting of a god gift
",About time a movie kinda similar to premature and project almanac well in premature movie where guy got back in time when he had orgasm but in this movie no need to get orgasm he can just go back in time to go a dark place and close his eye and use some force and that's it he is back in time living same day not he is only his whole family man can do that even his father who told about this to him but this movie is all about love romance so he don't have a gf so he just using his power to get a girl after when he meet one and lost him and again got it some time he is being a dickhead he just made a short mistake and he just go back in time to escape from that mistake it's like you have power so you are using it useless but whatever overall about love and romance thing it's fine for me i am kinda sci-fi lover guy so i just liked project almanac type movie but probably it will best for you look at rating IMDb 7.8 i liked premature more than this that have a lot's of comedy and it's kinda unrated comedy movie too,6,0,3,16 December 2016
