The Expendables 2," For all the fans of Rambo, Rocky, Terminator etc. - a must-see
","I loved this movie. The first part was great, the second one - even better. At the end of the movie Stallone says 'we all do (belong in the museum)' - the movie is THE MUSEUM of all the action films of the 80-90s. Don't expect a sophisticated storyline - it is an action film, with a lot of shooting, fighting, exploding, chasing, fast-driving etc. Don't look for deep insights into anything - although there are some conversions pretending to be profound, but really, they are not the point :) With the cast like in this movie, the lines and the jokes they make about each other and themselves - this makes a fantastic movie, a absolute must-see for all those who loved Rambo, Terminator and Chuck Norris :D:D",10,8,19,18 August 2012
The Maze Runner," If you've read the book, don't bother; if you haven't read the book - better read it and don't bother to watch
","I have seen the trailer of the movie and got hooked up really bad. Distopian novels and movies have found their place among my favorites recently. While waiting for the movie I decided to read the book first. Loved it. All three parts of it. So when the movie came out, me and my husband went to the premiere. Of course, I realize that the script does not always follow the book, some simplifications and omissions are a normal practice. But with the Maze Runner, I was utterly disappointed :( The main drawback of the film (as compared to the book) - is the explanation behind the Maze is not something you are gradually led to, but rather it is something sprung on you at the end of the film, in a 'because I said so' kind of way. You may understand that, but you don't empathize with it. In the book, from the very beginning you get those little hints that all of this has to do with the way people think, react to various factors, that this is something to do with the brain, that somebody is watching the Gladers all the time and in introducing new factors and risks and sees how they would react; that there is a higher meaning to that. The telepathy thing between Thomas and Theresa (excluded from the movie) strengthens the idea. The dreams of Thomas (which are very detailed and present a little peak into the subconscious and the memories Thomas lost starting from the childhood - mostly excluded) support the feeling that something bad had happened to the humankind. In the movie - you don't have it. There is a glade, the gladers want to get out because... well because for some reason the gate wouldn't close... Thomas is behind that, but what and why he was doing - he doesn't say... It is a bit chaotic. My husband didn't get that either - he still doesn't understand why I took him to the movie. Maybe I am too prejudiced because I have read the book, but this is the first time I am that disappointed - The Hunger Games, The Divergent (among many others) haven't left me feeling that way. There, I loved the script, I understood why some parts have been omitted and that some things could not be shown. The Maze Runner could have done much better IMHO. So, my advice would be to just read the book and imagine it.",5,11,23,21 September 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Loved it!
","I was a bit cautious before I went to see the film - normally, after reading a good book, you tend to find all the flaws and discrepancies from the book in the movie: wrong actors, wrong settings, changed story lines, you name it. So, I prefer to see a movie and then read a book, or read a book and not to see a movie. In this case I was too intrigued to abide by my own rules :) I was not disappointed.In my opinion, the cast was great. Not once did I want to say 'oh, common, he/she is not supposed to be like that!' The way the story was presented was also amazing. Having read the book and realizing the volume of information that was there, I was curious to see how this amount of information could be presented to the viewers... IMHO, it was done great - naturally, some details were not there, some of the points had to be omitted, but all in all - the story was clear.The ending... - that was the major difference from the book. Although I am not sure why it had to be done... Probably, to save the time (as the movie is long enough without including Australia into it :)) But the main idea remains unchanged - Harriet survived.All in all, I loved the performance, the scenery, the storyline. Thumbs up! Now waiting for the Girl that Kicked the Hornet's Nest :) Hope it will be even better.",10,4,10,8 January 2012
In Time," An OK movie, but a bit disappointing
","I've been wanting to see the movie from the time it was released, but somehow never found the time (ironic :)) Finally, the big day came, and ... I was disappointed :( Not totally, though. The idea is fantastic. It was the idea which made me want to watch the movie from the very beginning: money replaced by time as the main commodity seemed something extremely interesting... But the plot is not that catchy and I was expecting a more (how shall I put it) definitive ending? Somehow, you expect that the main character will change the world, destroy the system, make everybody happy etc etc etc... Here, what you get is a conditional happy ending where the two newly born Robin Hoods continue to rob time banks and distribute time to the 'poor'... Does it mean the system survived? What happens if they come to the Bonnie-and-Clyde finale? I really hoped for a more definitive ending, or - if not that - for something that could be interpreted as a hint that a sequel was coming?? All in all, it was not a total waste of time, but it was a pity that such an interesting idea got to be presented in such an average way :(",7,0,1,17 December 2011
A Walk to Remember," A lovely, dramatic not-a-cliché teen story
","Happened to watch this movie on a local TV channel yesterday and couldn't help writing. I liked it. The story goes from the cliché 'a bad boy meets a good girl and reforms' to something much more dramatic and profound and you cannot help but shed at least some tears. All in all it was a great movie to watch. The only drawback - the acting. Although the main characters are believable, the acting in some scenes of the movie did not really convince me. On several occasions during the movie I caught myself thinking 'ok, I understand what is happening here, but it's being demonstrated in a clumsy way' (the scene in the canteen for example, or reconciliation between Landon and his friends...) That is why I gave the movie 8 out of 10. I can hope it was due to the fact that I watched it in a different language, which probably ruined the feeling. Will definitely watch it in its original version. All in all, it is a great movie to watch, which makes you think about all the good and eternal things happening.",8,0,0,18 February 2012
