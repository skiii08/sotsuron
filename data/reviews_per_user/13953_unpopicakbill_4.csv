Sucker Punch," The lobotomy of the viewer
","I went to see it on a large IMAX screen, in the mid-night show, to get the full flavour of special effects. I did not expect a thick plot, nor a very creative story, probably a linear action story.By the time the movie ended, more than half of the initial crowd decided to do something better with their lives. It was weird to see that Snyder did not manage to hold together the linear story, and it felt that some distinct parts of the movie were quite good, but the link was so abrupt that you remain with nothing.The start of the movie sets expectations that are completely lost halfway through, and towards the end it feels that your IQ gets depressed by the lack of plot thickness.All in all, is not completely garbage, but it will go down in history as just another CGI movie.Go get your lobotomy.",5,3,8,21 April 2011
Youth," Cult movie in the making
","Poetry. I am also one of those who consume video products in large amounts, as a part of a generation that was born with it, and which by abhorrent use has lost the fact that movie-making is in fact an art. By watching documentaries, and reality movies, and all these 'all the same' commercial movies, coming from all over the place, but born in Hollywood, we have lost the sense of art that stands in movies.Here we have a revealing example of art making in movies. Superb. I previously watched Sorrentino's work, but none transcended the average efforts of talented film directors. I found this outstanding. The music, the film making, the scenery, the dialogue, the story, the segmentation, the outcomes, all combined in a perfect mix.Video poetry.",9,1,2,3 March 2016
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Grossly underrated
","Given the title, you might think I wrote this just to praise the creation.Well it's not just that. One has to say the film is very theatrical, but that makes every scene a painting in itself, and the camera angles and the empty scenery is there to emphasize the messages.The fact that the movie was heavily influenced by the transcript of the actual events, can be seen in small details which today may not be in the knowledge of the public, or at least were not known to me.From my experience in movie arrangements, not many directors have managed to use the scene as good, better for this can surely be named a number of Russians and Nippons, but not the mainstream Western directors, with the mention of Bergman.This is a movie to be seen, for the power it transmits the message without words, and might have lost that power if sound was present.",10,1,4,8 October 2009
The Mountain II," Moving indeed
","... to the history's bucket that is!I had to see it, because of the incredible mark, and what a disappointment it was. The more you see, the more unbelievable it becomes, the story is 4-year old-ish, the lines are as subtle as a pin in your toes, the acting is under your average Venezuelan telenovela, and it get's worse still. But hey, if this is for the audience of the Turkish army propaganda and potential recruit pool, I feel there is a lot of improvement of the real army.By the way, I can't digest a lot of the Hollywood war productions, but this can't stand the comparison of poorer Chinese, Indonesian, even Indian, or Egyptian peers.To contradict myself in the end, I don't expect you will not be disgusted with it, just that within a day, you will not be able to tell something dignifying about Dag2, only the beautiful scenery and the potential violence, youtube inspired, but even that poorly staged.A movie to kill.",2,26,63,4 December 2017
