Antz," Fabulous performances by an all star cast with fabulous animation.
","Antz is a charming romantic comedy that is better appreciated by adults than children. In fact, there are some scenes that may be a bit too violent or gruesome for small children.All of the actors perform brilliantly with an excellent script even though the plot is a bit trite. All the actors excel in their roles even the usually bland Stallone and Lopez who are more animated in this film than in most of their other roles.I found the move to be appealing visually. Apart from some of the backgrounds that seem to be hand painted, the animation is superb.",10,16,25,13 March 2004
