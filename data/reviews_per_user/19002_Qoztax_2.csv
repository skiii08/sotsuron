Requiem for a Dream," Don't do drugs!
","When you see a movie that makes you feel bad for such ordinary things like food or water, it is bad, and that was RFAD did to me. I tried to see it once, and gave up, it was 'strange', too strange. Well, I tried again, and the whole movie blew me away, but the last five minutes were so amazing, I can't describe the feelings I had when the music escalates and our main characters finds out why you DON'T DO DRUGS! Beautiful movie, eminent actors, scary ending, and combined with music, oh no not just music but THE music, a soundtrack so pure and fantastic that you get back the feelings from the film when you listen to it To put it out short; watch the movie, but beware, it is extreme!",9,0,1,21 September 2005
Good Will Hunting," Daemon is a genius, Williams is the man who tries to tell him that
","Unless you wanna talk about you, who you are! Then I'm fascinated... I'm in! But you don't wanna do that do you? You are terrified what you might see...Daemon is a genius, Williams is the man who tries to tell him that. We see a boy become a man, twice actually. The film is about friendship, love, passion, following your dreams. It is soft yes, it is American indeed, but no film have ever done it like that to me. This film is real, the acting is marvelous, I believe in it, I want to believe that Will is alive, that Sean is a shrink, and that Skylar is devastated in love with this weird man/boy who does not know who he is.I love this film, nothing more to say :-)",9,0,1,22 May 2006
