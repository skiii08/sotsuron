Sucker Punch," This is a great movie...
","... if you are a geeky boy, aged between 14 and 17 and a VIRGIN! I mean, don't get me wrong, I love action movies myself, and quite liked the director's previous works such in 300 and the watchmen. So I was expecting to see a good action movie with a decent story.Boy was I for sure sucker punched right in the muncher after 10 minutes watching this movie! Although it started as a promising film, it kind of felt like the director went: 'you know what? screw the plot, let's just make this eye candy and CGI, bring me some samurais- BAM!!! right in the face! ha ha ha!' So much for the story and characters, I couldn't care less about what happened to them throughout the movie! It felt like kill bill met charlies angels, mixed with some Call of Duty topped with German zombies, served in a dragon skull by a evil robot. Did they forget to add any boyish fetish?! I rated this with 2 stars because of the CGI, which are pretty good. The rest (plot, script, the whole movie package overall) is quite bad so I'd suggest to wait until this movie it is shown on telly and watch it if you want to waste 109 minutes of your life.",2,16,32,25 March 2011
