Antz," Excellent animation, fair story, slow pacing
","I wasn't expecting another TOY STORY, naturally... nothing will likely compare to this movie for some time.  However, the animation is definitely superior and the characters definitely fit the vocalizations... but I guess that's what three years of additional computer technology will buy you.  I thought the concept was interesting and unique (despite the upcoming Pixar offering...), however, the plot and pacing of the movie seemed to be a bit slow at times... it 'felt' longer to me than the actual running time.",7,0,0,14 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fine entertainment, but not nearly as good as it's predecessors.
","I just returned from a late night showing of this film at one of the local multiplexes.  While I was impressed with the visual dynamics (reported to consist of a record setting 95% of the movie) and while my ears are still ringing from the nearly constant, intense sonic blasts presented by Lucas' latest effort, the movie woefully lacked the 'spark' of the previous releases.  I simply hope this is just a start of better things to come... and that more of what was only barely touched on in this movie gets expounded upon better...",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Finding Nemo," Further raising the bar...
","It seems that while watching this movie, it was even harder to suspend the belief that this was a fully computer generated movie.  Harder, compared to any previous Pixar work.  The fish portrayed seemed so amazingly fluid, so lifelike, so believable (well, other than the talking, but of course, they were talking amongst themselves).I thoroughly was surprised by this movie.  It was much better than I had initially expected.  The previews that I had been seeing for perhaps the last six months or so seemed so empty, like you had no idea what the movie was going to be about.  Advertising consisted of little clips of the fish that were completely taken out of context.  You knew that there'd be something different, based on new levels of animation that were evident... but you didn't have any idea what the movie would be even about.  Even to the ads most recently, you'd have no idea.  I have no idea why they'd approach it this way.  I think that this film is clearly being driven by word of mouth, more than anything.  Now that I've seen it, I'm glad it is doing well in the cinema, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.Adding the little feature clip at the beginning (the 1989 short 'Knick Knack') was delightful to see.  Most people haven't seen this one, and I think it's a good example of where Pixar was, and how they still have the creative knack (no pun intended) after all these years.Overall, a great way to spend about 100 minutes.  Don't forget to stay until the very very end, the credits and accompanying animation are rather interesting.",9,0,0,9 June 2003
Cars," Solidly assembled, amazingly animated.
","I saw a sneak preview of this film last night, which played to a packed auditorium in an area theatre, comprised of an audience who won tickets from various media outlets. I must say that I was completely impressed with this latest Pixar outing and I almost dare say it was among the best animated features I have ever seen. It is almost hard to say 'animated', because it looks like the bar for computer animation has been risen yet again by Pixar. There was the well-animated details of the cars, with great expression and fluidity, and the backgrounds and scenery was just jaw-dropping and nearly seemed photo-realistic.The movie is incredible on so many levels. It is easy to forget that the cars are just cars, and you begin to relate to them on a people-like level. They are made to have easily identifiable facial expressions, which are animated well.Going into the movie, I thought that it would focus too much on racing, since NASCAR related stuff seems to be all the rage now. But, the back story of learning to do things like not taking bad shortcuts with life and not being so selfish and inconsiderate, really takes the fore in this film. We could all learn from these 'car-acters'.I definitely recommend this film, no matter if you're into racing or wouldn't even know what a 'bump draft' is.And, of course... remember to stay until the very very end of the movie, otherwise, you'll miss some cool stuff.",9,5,9,8 June 2006
Toy Story 2," Wonderful, imaginative film
","This film is definitely a pleasure and a joy to see, a very well done sequel.  I wouldn't be surprised if it would spawn yet another sequel, raising the bar even more for computer animation, such as this film has done.  Toy Story 2 looks even more lifelike and realistic than its original, I found myself several times 'forgetting' that it was computer animation. Definitely a must see for all ages.",10,48,63,2 December 1999
