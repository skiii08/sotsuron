The Blair Witch Project," good idea ruined by unsympathetic characters
","The hype is right - this movie does bring something new (or at least forgotten for about 40 years) back to horror movies - scaring the viewer by tapping into their own fears.  That can't be done by special effects.  They take you away from reality.  The best scary movies are believable because you can feel yourself in the situation.  So it doesn't actually matter whether or not you know the story is real - it works because you can very easily imagine it could be.I liked the camerawork, the grainy film, the clever tricks like switching from b/w to colour & back, pointing the camera at the ground while you hear weird noises.  But while the actors were good in their parts, what makes you not care about the film as you otherwise would is the unlikeability of the main characters.  It's a fine idea of the breakdown of relationships under pressure, and it's fair enough to show the actors shouting and arguing at each other as well as their situation.  But we got too much of this, actually they were pretty much fighting with each other the entire time. This made them unlikeable ultimately - we should have seen some warmer aspects of their characters.And hey, I don't mind a bit of bad language when characters are under real pressure, but it should be used sparingly or else they're just unpleasant, brutish, and you can't care about them as you want to.  These guys (all three including the girl) were shown to be swearing the whole movie, even before any scary or pressure situations - they could hardly utter a single sentence without it!  Realistic?  You don't get this level of bad language even in settings where you would more likely expect it (eg the Godfather, Reservoir Dogs).  That made them too unsympathetic, and for a real scare you SHOULD care about at least some of the characters.Overall - good horror movie, but could have been quite a bit better.  I'd put it definitely outside my personal top 100 movies, maybe around number 200 or so.",5,0,2,30 November 2000
Pulp Fiction," how great is this really?
","This film worries me.  Is it great as so many say?  It's riveting viewing that's for sure.  Movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better).  This film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth.The film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.It is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt.  Though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. Goodfellas). Rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know Mr Quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit.  You get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue.
Best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of Saturday Night Fever ended up!  I have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards.  I'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up.  And who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its British name) when it's called epinephrine in the US?  I'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life.  Most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. It's made to seem glamorous and seductive.  Anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen.  I think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie.  Again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein.  Maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)?Overall I think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing.  However it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness.  My opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost.",2,8,18,7 February 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Very worthy, but something seems to be missing - realism?
","This is a very worthy movie, dealing with the important issue of free will against authority.  It's inspiring, humorous and mostly satisfying.Something rings false though.  When is the movie supposed to take place? From the fashions I would guess the 70s, though the book might say different.  My (limited) knowledge of working with psychiatric patients indicates that while there did use to be abusive treatment (like electroconvulsive therapy given for the wrong reasons rather than for serious depression) this was over by the 1950s.  In particular, nobody got psychosurgery (like poor old Randall) later than the 1950s.  Maybe it was different in the US, or maybe I just didn't know about abuses like this. Also, I find it hard to believe that psychiatric patients would be the kind of people who are so beaten down by authority that all they need is to be shown a different way of being to be 'cured'.  It certainly wouldn't be like that nowadays.If the film is describing the past that's fine, but it seems to me to lose a lot of its power and urgency. However apart from that, everything else was excellent.  All the actors were quite outstanding, and Jack Nicholson was awesome.  There is one point about three quarters of the way through the movie where the camera is on his face for a long time, maybe 30 seconds, and you watch his expression change through about five emotions on camera (wicked sense of humour, indifference, pain, thoughtfulness and tiredness, or something like).  Wow!The film is extremely highly rated (as well as having won the 5 major oscars), so maybe I'm just out of line in carping about realism.",Null,1,3,6 December 2000
