The Ring," Absolutely Fantastic suspense horror film
",This is what these types of movies should always be. Most horror films dont have a plot or good characters but this one had both. The entire film is full of suspense and some very jumpy moments. Naiomi Watts was great as well as the male lead Matin Henderson who will probably both be well known stars soon. If you are in the modd for suspense and scares definately check this one out.10/10,10,0,0,21 November 2002
Memento," The most original stylish movie ever made
",This was one of my favorite movies of the year. I am usually into popcorn movies like the fast and the furious and swordfish but this was just and amazing film. It keeps you guessing the whole movie and you have no clue what is going on until the very end. i recommend you go buy this movie.,10,0,1,15 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Classic Star Wars
",This is definately redemption after episode 1. This movie is great. The action is incredible and everything is starting to fall all toether. it gets a little slow in the middle but overall this is the funnest movie in the series. You will not be dissapointed if you are a star wars fan and even if you are not who will still love it.,10,1,2,21 May 2002
