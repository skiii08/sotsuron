The Ring," Before you die you see 'The Ring'
","A combination of the visual chill of 'Stigmata', the remote horror of 'The Blair Witch Project', and the otherworldly, alien evils of H. P. Lovecraft, 'The Ring' is a well-crafted, visually-arresting examination of how one act can inspire madness in everybody.  Naomi Watts is Rachel, a journalist who discovers that four teenagers, including her own cousin, have died a week to the day after watching a disturbing video tape.  Rachel tracks down the video and watches it herself. Immediately following the last frame of the video, she receives a phone call telling her that she will die in seven days.  Desperate to stop whatever is causing this, she enlists the aid of her ex-husband.  Her mission is fueled by the fact that her own son has also seen the video, and they are both being visited by a malevolent and insane entity.Watts is fantastic as Rachel, reminiscent of Nicole Kidman in 'The Others,' a stable woman slowly losing her grip on the real world.  Gore Verbinski, a director who's previous work ('The Mexican') I could describe as wasteful, shocked and amazed me by the stunning visuals and sparse yet horrifying special effects.  The video itself is an emulation of the surrealism of Maya Deren and altogether disturbing by itself.  Other fine performances include Daveigh Chase (the voice of Lilo in 'Lilo & Stitch') as a disturbed young girl who may be the entire key to the mystery of the malevolent video tape.I fault the movie briefly for David Dorfman's performance as Aidan, Rachel's son.  We have seen too many overly precocious, psychic children in horror movies since Haley Joel Osmont in 'The Sixth Sense.'  Enough already.This was based upon an acclaimed Japanese thriller, and I would be highly curious to see what has been changed in the American version.  However, I would highly recommend 'The Ring' for anyone looking for two hours of surreal, insinuatingly creepy horror.  9 out of 10.",9,0,0,19 October 2002
Monster," An uneven melodrama saved by the hands of Charlize Theron
","A powerful performance by Charlize Theron.  I never in my life though I would ever say those words.  Dancer/model Theron always struck as me as pretty first, actress second.  It didn't help that she was normally cast in dreadfully mediocre films as a woman in peril: 'The Astronaut's Wife', 'Sweet November', and so on.  Her work in 'The Italian Job' hinted at more ability than she led many to believe, but it's her role in 'Monster' that reveals to the world that without a doubt, Theron is a power to be reckoned with.Based on the the life of Aileen Wornos, the film begins in the 1980's, when Wornos (Charlize Theron) was a hitch-hiking prostitute.  As the film opens, she's about to kill herself after spending her last money on beer. Unwittingly walking into a gay bar, she meets young, naive Selby (Christina Ricci), who's been sent to live with her aunt in Florida in an effort to cleanse her of her homosexuality.  Aileen, who's never been in a relationship with a woman before, warms up to her.  As their relationship progresses, the two being to believe they're in love, and Aileen resolves to clean her life up and find legitimate work to support them.  After a humiliating series of job interviews, she returns to prostitution.  When one of her johns tries to rape her, Aileen kills him.  This begins a new chapter in her life with Selby, where Selby doesn't ask where Aileen gets her money, and Aileen is filled with a twisted sense of empowerment, killing any john she can in the belief that all of her customers are potential rapists. She went on to become the United States' first female serial killer, and she shot several men before being arrested.But the story of Wornos and Selby is immaterial, really.  The main attraction to this movie is Theron's performance.  Theron also served as producer on the film, and she studied footage and documents on Wornos extensively (the real Wornos was executed in 2002).  Theron disappears so fully into Wornos that even when you look in her eyes, there's no trace of the actress there.  Much has been made of Theron's physical transformation, and it bears repeating.  Theron's Wornos is someone with a soul so broken that it can't help but physically manifest itself.  Model-beautiful Theron has done much to reflect this, including adding a highly unflattering 30 pounds, allowing her hair to become stringy and greasy, and gaining a hard, leathery skin tone.  Add to this an uncanny duplication of Wornos' speech and mannerisms, and Theron's transformation becomes downright chilling in its accuracy.This is both the film's greatest asset and its biggest weakness.  Theron's performance is so amazing, it makes the other actors around her seem unprepared.  Christina Ricci tries her best with the innocent, gullible Selby, but she's too kewpie-doll cute and innocent to make you believe she'd ever spend her life with someone as scarred as Wornos.  At the same time, Theron unwittingly spotlights the wavering, uneven tone of writer/director Patty Jenkins' overall film.  Theron is amazing, but Jenkins never knows quite what to do with her.  Jenkins alternates, sometimes within the same scene, between making us feel sympathy for the damaged Wornos (a victim of childhood abuse, teenage pregnancy, and a prostitute since the age of 13) and making us feel repulsed by the levels of cruelty and abuse she herself can descend to.  Jenkins wants to have it both ways, but she never displays enough evidence to leave the decision up to the audience.  Additionally, the scenes exist out of a clear sense of progression.  We're never sure how much time has passed between scenes, and no attempt is ever made to put the movie into a historical context aside from a few song references and hairstyles. This makes the film seem like it's taking place in a different world altogether as opposed to being set in the real one, starring a cast of people based on real humans.Without the unbridled power and ferocity behind Theron's performance, 'Monster' would be a highly forgettable, well-intentioned biopic that suffered from a lack of vision.  It's Theron that holds the film together, that serves as its cold heart and its anchor.  Besides being one of the best female performances in a while, it's a revelation of Theron's dedication and ability.  A high recommendation for fans of strong female performances, but for a more coherent story about Wornos, I recommend you check out one of Nick Broomfield's documentaries.  6 out of 10.",6,0,2,19 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A glorious return to a lost genre
","Some people may be unfortunate to remember the 1995 Geena Davis/Renny Harlin disaster 'Cutthroat Island,' a bloated and stale attempt to revive an old sub-genre, that of the swashbuckling adventure film.  Long dormant after Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks hung up their tights and rapiers, the genre was due for a comeback.  Now, much like 'Moulin Rouge!' and 'Chicago' revitalized the sleeping form of the musical, pirate films have been rediscovered in the form of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl.'At a British colony in the Caribbean, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter to the governor, is being wooed by two men: the proper and stoic naval officer Norrington (Jack Davenport) and the unassuming yet sincere swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).  But courtship has to wait when the infamous pirate ship the Black Pearl, headed by the vile Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), invades the colony and kidnaps Elizabeth.  Will's only hope to save her is to free the Black Pearl's former captain, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a dangerously unstable and hardly trustworthy fellow.  Things are further complicated when it turns out that the pirates have all been cursed for stealing Aztec gold and that moonlight reveals their true state: that of rotting corpses.This film is wonderfully entertaining.  All of the performers give fantastic performances, from Knightley's strong-willed and curious Elizabeth to Bloom's resourceful and determined Will.  Plus, it's great to see Bloom without elf ears.  The best performance by far is Johnny Depp, giving one of his wildest and strongest performances of his career.  His Captain Jack is half-way between Keith Richards and insanity (which may not be too far), an amalgamation of swishes, slurred words, and blustery bravado.  Depp just doesn't steal every scene he's in: he robs it at sword point.The director has a hand for sweeping adventure, as well.  Gore Verbinski is best known for directing the supremely creepy 'The Ring,' and some of the moody hand that guided that film is present here, as well.  But Verbinski knows how to handle the genre and his actors very well, everything coming together in a strong wind that sweeps the audience along with it.  The movie is full of characters but never overcrowded.  It is swarming with details, but it is never tedious.  The script, like the film, hearkens back to the witty repartee of early swashbuckler films, which may sound laughable on paper but makes perfect sense coming out of the characters.The most striking thing about the film is the CGI involved in rendering the skeletal pirates.  While there are several scenes of fully-skeletal pirates, the most impressive use of this effect is during a fight in a cave, where the pirates dart in and out of moon light with only part of their bodies transformed.  After the offense to cinema that was 'Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones' and after seeing the fantastic effects WETA pulled off for 'The Two Towers', I had lost faith in Industrial Light & Magic's ability to inspire wonder.  They have outdone themselves on this picture.Despite the entertainment value of the film, there are a few minor drawbacks.  At almost two-and-a-half hours, the film is slightly long and could easily have been trimmed down by 30 minutes.  Similarly, several minor characters, such as Zoe Saldana's black female pirate Anamaria, are intriguing and sadly underused.  These are minor complaints, however, and they do not detract much from the overall enjoyment of the film.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is sure to inspire other directors to helm their own voyages into swashbuckling adventure.  Here's hoping that they all turn out to be as thrilling and enjoyable as this one.  9 out of 10.",8,0,1,5 August 2003
Spice World," Clever and energetic, and not nearly as bad as you've heard
","In the 1990's, the Spice Girls were the reigning queens of pop, selling countless amounts of records across the world.  An unprecedented marketing blitz followed, culminating in the film 'Spice World.'  Backlash was inevitable, and many were ready to dismiss the film or praise the film solely based on their dislike or enjoyment of the Spice Girls' music.  When reviewed as a film in its own right, 'Spice World' is a very entertaining movie with its tongue always firmly in its meta-textual cheek.The Spice Girls -- Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Melanie Brown (Scary), Emma Bunton (Baby), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), and Victoria Adams (Posh, now Victoria Beckham) -- play themselves.  The Girls are getting ready for their first live concert in Royal Albert Hall, but their preparation is beset with several obstacles, including the overdue pregnancy of the Girls' best friend ('AbFab''s Naoko Mori) and a vicious tabloid editor (Barry Humphries) that wants to see them ruined so he can the ensuing headlines will sell millions of papers.  A host of supporting characters add to the mix, including the Girls' high-strung manager (Richard Grant), an insidious paparazzo (Richard O'Brien), a clueless documentary film-maker (Alan Cumming), and a Hollywood producer/screenwriter duo (George Wendt/Mark McKinney) relentless pitching ideas to the Girls' manager for movie spin-offs.The Girls do play themselves to a point, but they are more accurately playing themselves as the public sees them.  Sporty is always on an exercise bike, for instance, and Baby is never without a lollipop or stuffed animal. They live up to their stereotypes and play them to the ultimate hilt.  The Girls themselves seem relaxed, with the most confident performance coming from Geri, who seems quite natural on the screen.  Mel B and Emma both seem almost as relaxed, but Mel C seems like she needs a little more coaching on screen presence.  Victoria, unfortunately, looks quite uncomfortable whenever the camera focuses on her, and in some scenes she actually comes off as resentful that she had to star in this film.The director, Bob Spiers, is best known perhaps for his work on the series 'Absolutely Fabulous', and he brings the same comic hand to this film has he did to that supremely funny show.  The comedy is played light, never too much over-the-top, although a good deal of silliness is inserted.  Dramatic moments are often muted by a small joke or bit of campy melodrama.  Nothing is ever taken too seriously, and the film clips along at a good pace, peppered with hilarious fantasy sequences, knowing self-parody, and satirical jabs at everything from hospital drama to action movie car chases.The film is full of cameos as well, including both musicians and non-musicians.  Elvis Costello turns up as a bartender, while Meatloaf plays the driver of the Spice Bus (a double-decker bus emblazoned with SPICE on its roof).  Jennifer Saunders shows up as a bitchy fashionista, while Bob Hoskins' role is too funny to give away here.It's easy to see why some people dislike the film, however.  The soundtrack tries to fit as many Spice Girls songs as possible into the film, which is to be expected, but the songs themselves are of a wildly varying quality, from the rousing 'Spice Up Your Life' to the questionable 'Viva Forever.' It's also hard to buy the Girls' backstory as struggling musicians, and the film lacks any kind of dramatic tension, which may be intentional, but it gives the film a fluffy quality that does not appeal to everybody.  Some moments in the film now seem oddly indicative of future events: about a year of the release, Geri would leave the group and the Girls' next album without her would signal the end of the act, with all the Girls going on to solo careers of amazingly diverse success (Geri and Mel C have score the best, while nobody wants to hear Victoria's album, ever).  Keep this in mind during the fantasy sequence with Stephen Fry as a square judge.All in all, 'Spice World' is a very entertaining diversion. It's a pop song in film format: it's airy, fun, and slightly mindless, but for a while you forget about your worries.  Certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be, but one to avoid if you really just don't like the Spice Girls.  7 out of 10.",7,9,15,11 August 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Gay cowboys eating pudding
","WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NUMEROUS SPOILERS! 'Catwoman.' 'Xandau.' 'The Apple.' 'Pootie Tang.' What do all of these films have in common? They're all about as entertaining as 'Brokeback Mountain', a lead balloon of a message movie undone by its own good intentions and its own sense of cinematic entitlement.Based on the short story by Annie Proulx, 'Brokeback' concerns two ranch-hands, the improbably named Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), who meet as young men while both are sheep-herding on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. The two develop a close relationship, culminating in a fumbling night of intimacy during a cold snap. After their job ends, the two part ways, each marrying a woman and fathering children: Jack marries well-to-do rodeo girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) while Ennis marries down-to-earth Alma (Michelle Williams). Both men, however, continue to hold onto their memories of Brokeback, until the day they finally meet again and begin a secret relationship thinly disguised as a series of fishing trips. The film chronicles the two men as their secret slowly destroys their marriages and threatens to consume them from within. Much angst ensues.'Brokeback' is a film of substitutions: a collection of mannerisms substituting for characterization, a series of landscape shots substituting for direction, an assemblage of country-fried aphorisms substituting for a script, rampant and unrestrained melodrama substituting for human emotion. The largest share of the blame for the film lies with director Ang Lee, a man who could probably make very vivid wilderness films but who rarely knows what to do with the humans caught in his frame. Lee's direction is ridiculously dull and ponderous, each scene moving with a slow, aimless gait into the next with no forward momentum or dramatic pull. To be sure, some of Lee's footage is gorgeous even while its lack of realism proves distracting: the moon over Wyoming is always big and full, the top of the mountain is always pristine, and the small towns of the film are always picture-perfect in aping what Lee believes they should look like. Diana Ossana and Larry McMurty's script doesn't help matters at all. The words don't so much advance the 'plot', for lack of a better word, as much as they intermittently nudge it down a lazy river.But that doesn't leave the actors in the clear. Much attention has been paid to the two male leads, especially Ledger, for their performances, but the praise comes not so much from the performances themselves as from what they represent. Like Charlize Theron in 'Monster', few critics believed Ledger was capable of performing such a role, while both men are seen as 'bold' or 'daring' for playing ostensibly gay men. The caliber of the performances no longer matters at this point: the quickest way to an Oscar nomination is to play gay, handicapped, or a prostitute. But the praise is misplaced. Certainly, both men are giving heartfelt performances, and both fully believe in the film, but Ledger decides to mumble most of his words to the point of making half of his lines unintelligible, while Gyllenhaal comes off simply as trying to act too much. He's endearingly artificial. The only characters who appear as natural, genuine human beings are the two female leads. Williams has a few very difficult, emotionally raw scenes that she pulls off remarkably well. Hathaway is better-than-expected as a woman who decides to drown her marital ennui in a Tammy Faye-esquire swirl of bleached hair, gaudy jewelry, and taloned fingernails.The argument has been advanced, and never more enthusiastically than by the producers of the film, that this is not a 'gay cowboy movie', but a 'universal' love story. But this is not a 'gay' movie. Jack and Ennis never identify as gay or consider themselves to be gay men. None of the lead actors are gay. None of the main talent behind the scenes is gay. This is a film by, to, and packaged for self-gratifying heterosexuals, brimming with a well-intentioned but ultimately patronizing, stultifying view of gays and their relationships that typifies the Hollywood penchant for sacrificing structure, story, and quality in order to advance a viewpoint that the filmmakers have little (if any) familiarity with. I should point out at this time that I am a gay man, but the attitude presented in Brokeback insults me. Jack and Ennis' relationship is presented as the purest of all the relationships between all of the characters of the film, despite the fact that the word 'love' never escapes their lips once during the film. Anyone who criticizes them for any reason is automatically a bigot, even as the two men's selfishness not only brings misery and unhappiness to both their families, but ultimately proves to be their undoing. Jack, while desperately seeking the constant companionship Ennis denies him, is gay-bashed to death, graphically, with a tire iron to his face. Sadly, it is the only appropriate end for this antiquated, 'Children's Hour'-style take on those quaint little homosexuals. On the other hand, given the amount of effort everyone involved in the film has put into making all of these characters so uniformly miserable, a happy ending would have been ludicrously fake.30 seconds of poorly-filmed sex and a few make-out sessions is not enough to call yourself a 'bold' or 'courageous' film. The fact that this is essentially a Harlequin-style doomed romance that happens to feature two men in the leading roles doesn't excuse the horde of clichÃ©s marching across the screen. Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I firmly believe that just because you want your movie to be important doesn't mean you have to make it skull-crushingly boring.On an episode of South Park, Eric Cartman states that all independent cinema consists of is 'gay cowboys eating pudding.' Leave it to Hollywood to prove him right. 3 out of 10.",3,36,130,29 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Waste of Everything for Everybody
","I've been a Star Wars fan ever since I was a baby, when I was shown the first movie theatrically.  I've seen the original trilogy more times than I can count.  While I was at the premiere of 'Episode I', I was sorely disappointed, and after the high of seeing a new Star Wars movie wore off, I was even more so.  So it was with great trepidation that I purchased my ticket for 'Episode II.'  What greeted me was one of the worst films this side of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000.'While I've seen my share of bad films, very rarely have I actually had to suppress the urge to riot (the only other time was during a screening of 'Heavy Metal').  If you don't know the story, here are the basics: Anakin Skywalker, who we all know will one day become the eeeeevil Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent to guard now-Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman) from a bounty hunter.  There are vehicle chases, monster battles, light sabre duels, and what I think was supposed to be a romantic interlude but came off like a commercial for feminine hygiene products.Again, with amazing clarity, George Lucas has demonstrated that he is unable to direct anything with a pulse.  We have a group of fine actors here (including Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson) who all come off as wooden and lacking in any depth, although I think this may be Hayden Christensen's natural state of being.  The plot is needlessly complex and illogical, and situations seem to exist only to bring about certain scenes that allow Lucas to say 'Look what I can do! Aren't I cool?'.  The film displays an amount of fan service that would embarrass the animators at Go Nagai ('Cutey Honey', 'Devil Lady').  And don't even mention the painful and stilted dialogue that makes me long for when Ed Wood was in his heyday.And the special effects.  Let's not forget those.  How can we, when 80% of the movie is computer-generated, including most of the cast?  Peter Jackson has proven that CGI effects CAN be incorporated seamlessly into a movie with a much smaller and less prestigious studio than Industrial Light & Magic (I dare anyone who's seen Gollum in 'The Two Towers' to tell me Jar Jar Binks is better).  And 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' proved that digital actors can be even more expressive than some of the flesh-and-blood humans that Lucas directs, so there is no excuse for the static and uninspiring effects Lucas so lavishly fills his movie with.  Virtually nothing about this film works.  Not the computer-generated Yoda, not the boy band-castoff looks of Hayden Christensen, not the derivative and painfully stale John Williams score (it's a sad state to be in when you rip off yourself), and certainly not Natalie Portman's costumes, which keep reminding us that she's now of legal age.  Unfortunately, there are enough over-zealous fans of George Lucas out there to ensure that his movies make far more money than they deserve to, encouraging him to make more and more of these mindless, overblown faux-mythological epics.All in all, this experience of this movie is little more than watching a friend play a video game to show you all the cool things in it, but all you want to do is go out to dinner.  I give the movie 2 out of 10, mainly because it's only slightly easier to watch than 'Battlefield Earth.'",2,5,11,28 January 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Disney Finally Grows Up
","It was with high hopes that I went to see the newest Disney offering, 'Lilo & Stitch.'  I was not disappointed.Disney's newest offering (like 'Atlantis', a PG-rated movie) is a fantastic mix of superb visuals, an endearing story, and wonderful voice acting.  It also jettisons many standard Disney elements, for which I was most grateful.Stitch is an alien fugitive, a being created by a mad scientist to be a weapon that escaped its confinement.  He is discovered by Lilo, a disturbed young orphan in Hawaii who thinks Stitch is an ugly dog.  Lilo lives with her older sister Nani, and the hulking social services agent Cobra Bubbles has threatened to take Lilo away from her if she does not prove herself as a parent.  Stitch, of course, causes all sorts of havoc in the middle of this.The animation is fantastic, mainly thanks to the use of watercolor cels, a technique not used for almost 60 years prior (in Disney's 'Dumbo').  The characters are drawn with a high degree of realism, especially Nani who has the facial features and build of a true woman of Hawaiian descent and not the nymph-like physique of the standard Disney female.  Even the voices are accented correctly, thanks to native Hawaiians Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee.Thankfully, this is not a musical.  Sure, there are songs in it...but they're all Elvis Presely songs and there are no singing animals or song breaks.  The movie is sweet but not syrupy, endearing but not cloying. Stitch is by far not the cute, sweet, Disney animal but, like Lilo, a lost soul slowly learning to adapt to society and suppress their anger at the world. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you're like me, and thought Disney would never regain the wonder and beauty they lost after 'Hunchback of Notre Dame.'",8,1,1,23 July 2002
Spirited Away," Pure Joy
","I've been a fan of anime for years.  Unlike many anime watchers, my first exposure wasn't to 'Akira' or 'Macross.'  It was to a movie called 'Warriors of the Wind', which I learned years later was actually a hack-job version of the poetic 'Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind' by Hayao Miyazaki, a man compared often to Akira Kurosawa, and who many call the most gifted anime director of all time.Miyazaki's film 'Princess Mononoke', which was imported to the US and released by Disney in an English dub, was an ecological fantasy where humans and ancient gods dueled for the fate of nature.  It was a dark and dramatic epic of culture and tradition.  In comparison, Miyazaki's latest release, 'Spirited Away', is unadulterated joy and innocence, a two-and-a-half hour fable of courage and perseverance.Young Chihiro is moving to the country with her parents.  On the way to their new home, her parents come upon a seemingly abandoned theme park and, despite the protests of their daughter, begin to gorge themselves on food they find.  When night falls, the theme park transforms into a land of shades and phantoms, and Chihiro's parents have been transformed into pigs. Chihiro receives aid from a strange young man named Haku, who tells her that to stay in the spirit world and rescue her family, she must get a job from the witch Yubaba, who cannot refuse her request.  During her stay in this strange world, Chihiro undergoes many trials that put her courage and her love for others to the test.The movie itself plays like 'Alice in Wonderland' filtered through Japanese folklore.  I admit, I didn't understand many of the concepts of the movie because of its reliance on such things, and while at first the movie seems not to have a coherent plot, keep in mind that anime in general has never fully subscribed to the linear plots of American cinema.
The colors and designs of the movie are fantastic, and there is no shortage of unusual beings.  Tiny soot monsters who work for an eight-armed man, a bulbous Radish Spirit, and a majestic river dragon are a few of the inhabitants.  The most poignant of the movie's characters may be No-Face, a lonely spirit that consumes all he can.  The tone of the movie is generally light, with moments of drama and darkness when appropriate, but always filled with a resonant innocence and wonder.The voice acting, while not as star-studded as that of 'Mononoke', is quite good, with seasoned actors like Suzanne Pleshette (Yubaba) and the ever-popular and multi-talented Tara Strong providing solid dub skills. Daveigh Chase, wonderful as Lilo in Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch', is Chihiro, and while some of her readings sound a bit shrill, she is a very believable and realistic voice for the plucky heroine.When all is said and done, the movie may lack the drama and desperation of many anime, but instead of offering this, the movie is content to transport you to another world filled with joy and mystery.  Few movies display as much pleasure as this one in displaying moments of awe and laughter. Never mind that the animation itself is beautiful and intricate as only a master could create.  If you are lucky enough to be in a city where this movie is showing, by all means, see it as soon as possible.10 out of 10.",10,2,3,25 September 2002
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Macho women with guns vs. mediocrity
","Film adaptations of video games have a decidedly mixed life. On the one hand, they are commercially viable with a built-in audience. On the other, they are often lifeless, barely more than live action versions of the games, less films than advertisements. Occasionally, as in 'Tomb Raider', a fantastic lead can overcome the video game-to-file curse. Sometimes, the movie separates itself from the game enough to stand on its own, as in 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.' The first 'Resident Evil' had both of these: only a passing resemblance to the wildly popular game series and a dynamic lead in Milla Jovovich. The success of the movie spawned a sequel, and as in the video game world, so often, the sequel is an overly-hyped, rushed-to-production mess like 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse.'The film begins roughly where the first one left off. Alice (Jovovich) is one of the only survivors of the first movie, having fought her way thought legions of undead when the nefarious Umbrella Corporation's experimental T-virus infected hundreds of people. When Umbrella tries to investigate the events of the first movie, they unwittingly release the T-virus into the streets of Raccoon City, turning the populace into slavering zombies hungry for human flesh. Umbrella shuts the city down to contain the virus, and Alice must fight her way out with the help of mini-skirted cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a small team of elite soldiers, and a trash-talking common citizen (Mike Epps). Along the way are obstacles like undead beasts with huge tongues and a giant mutant named Nemesis.This film is a massive mess of teenage game-boy dreams. The plot is thin and the characters by and large thread bare. Most come and go so quickly that you never even get to know their names before they become a zombie snack. The actors try their best, though, and Jovovich is always a treat to watch in action. Guillory is also quite effective in her role as Butt-Kicking Babe #2, making a rather crowd-pleasing entrance. Epps provides the film's few intentionally funny moments, while there also fine performances by Oded Fehr and Zack Ward as two of the soldiers accompanying Alice. Of all the featured players, only Thomas Kretschmann, as Umbrella's laughably clichéd Eurotrash representative, comes off as particularly mediocre.But all the girls-on-zombie action in the world can't save this film from itself. The film has the quick-cut action scenes and loud, forced nu-metal soundtrack of a straight-to-video release but the effects budget of a minor studio release. Indeed, hardly a scene goes by that isn't punctuated with deafening explosions. Director Alexander Witt, taking over for video-game-to-film director Paul Anderson (who wrote the screenplay), has made a cold, hard film lacking any of the (relative) depth or humanity of the first film. Sure, this film may be based on a video game, but that's no reason to turn the characters into automatons. In addition, the film ends with a bizarre and seemingly arbitrary sequence that will leave most viewers to bang their heads in frustration...and, of course, opening the door WIDE open for a third film.What could've been a more action-oriented follow-up to a fine video-game adaptation has become an incoherent and numb series of shoot-em-up action, a film so ridiculously conceived that it thinks nothing of sending its main characters through a graveyard during a zombie assault. Granted, it's immensely enjoyable to watch the female leads getting their action hero on, but both Jovovich and Guillory (and indeed the whole cast) deserve a better vehicle for their acrobatics. Skip the theatre and just wait for the DVD so you can go right to the good parts. 5 out of 10.",6,9,17,13 September 2004
X2: X-Men United," Another fantastic comic-book adaptation
","'X-Men', one of Marvel Comic's most popular titles, contains 40 years of plot lines and a dizzying array of characters.  For a director to take on a legacy so vast was a challenge, and Bryan Singer delivered a solid adaptation in 2000's 'X-Men.'  Much like the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher 'Batman' franchise, Singer's 'X-Men' universe divorced itself from the comics' plot and structure while remaining true to the essence of the material.  Characters' relationships and origins were changed or adapted, but in the end, their personalities and interactions remained intact.  I'm glad to say that more of the same love Singer has shown in the past, without giving in to fanboy adherence, has yielded another fine comic book film in 'X2: X-Men United.'The film begins with a blue-skinned, devilish-looking mutant named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) teleporting into the Oval Office, attempting to assassinate the President of the United States.  He fails and vanishes, leaving behind a knife with the message 'Mutant Freedom Now.'  Xenophobic and opportunistic military general William Stryker (Brian Cox) uses the attack to propel his mission forward: the eradication of all mutants.  Aided by his enigmatic assistant Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), Stryker raids the Xavier School for the Gifted, rounding up as many mutants as he can.  The attack forces the X-Men -- including Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) -- to team up with their enemy Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) and his shape-shifting partner Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) to fight Stryker's plot.The action and special effects of 'X2' are above it's predecessor in every way.  They are more seamlessly integrated into the film while maintaining their visual flare.  That's a good thing, since virtually all of the characters in the film possess some mutant power that facilitates a special effect.  This reliance on effects sometimes comes at a cost to script and story, but even this is still very well-done, true to the film's origins, and superior to the vast majority of recent comic book films ('Bulletproof Monk', 'Batman & Robin', 'Daredevil').The film has a fantastic ensemble of actors, many of whom have seen their roles from the first film increased significantly.  While this is a great chance for Janssen to become more than a pretty doctor and allows Romijn-Stamos to slink and slide as the sexiest femme fatale in recent memory, Halle Berry wastes her role as Storm with too many weak line readings.  Although it is to her credit that she wisely decided not to try an accent this time around, she lacks the gravity and authority that comes with the character.  Among the other new faces, Cumming is wonderful, and Hu is a marvel to behold when Deathstrike is given reign to let loose.  Cox proves again why he was the original Hannibal Lecter (in 'Manhunter') in a fantastic performance that does not easily slip into melodrama or caricature.Perhaps the most striking part of the film is the ending, which I will not give away here.  'X2' ends with a moment that will have fans familiar with the comics' history nervous with anticipation for the next film...and gives them the job of explaining it to those who are not.  All in all, I can't think of a better way to begin the 2003 summer season of films.  'X2' is a thrilling, dark, action-filled spectacle with moments of genuine emotion and depth.  A must for any comic fan or fan of fantastic cinema.  9 out of 10.",10,0,0,5 May 2003
