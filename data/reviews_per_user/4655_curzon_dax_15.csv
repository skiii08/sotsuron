Hereditary," Fine and great, but it could be greater
","I think that while Hereditary was fine, a near 8/10 for me, it would be near 10/10 if the ending didn't end up being literally supernatural. I loved the part of the movie that lead you to believe there is supernatural evil and then bam, there's greater horror than supernatural horror, there's is reality.
If people say 'it was the way it lead you to believe it's not supernatural that's good' then it's still not enough because they could still twist it again and return to it not being supernatural. In general I believe there is greater horror in the not supernatural (but harder to write and produce).",8,0,1,25 July 2019
John Wick," Stupid, but fun stupid
",This franchise is so fun and so stupid at the same time. I can't wait for more sequels.,8,0,0,12 June 2019
Rocketman," How sad that it was eclipsed by the Freddy Mercury movie.
",This own had actual depth. It actually reached into the inner biography of the main subject and used song in a meaningful and not just for a fast cash grab with memberberries.,9,0,0,14 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unbelievably overrated
","We have reached a point in this franchise that the hard core fans of the franchise skew the rating very easily by giving so called 'automatic 10s'. This movie while not absolutely horrible, it has severe flaws that should not let it deserve more than a 6 with the most objective view possible. The characters are extremely uninteresting, cookie cutter and banal, the writing extremely predictable, the humor is embarrassingly bad and the tropes of the star wars franchise extremely forced, predictable and unfunny. Honestly, if anyone must watch all star wars there is,sure, watch it, it won't be a painful experience, but if you expect a masterpiece walk away as fast as you can. This movie is not the greatest of the year, not the greatest of the month and probably not of the week. The only redeeming quality is that it is watchable. You won't feel completely horrible about it. But don't be fooled, without the humongous budget this 6/10 would be a 5/10 at best.",6,1,3,31 March 2017
12 Angry Men," Almost perfect move, near 10. with a flaw
",The flaw that makes this movie a 9 and not a 10 is that when the racist and the prejudiced jurors changed their minds it wasn't done very realistically in my opinion and more in a theatrical way that didn't feel very believable to me. I guess it was done so that there can be a favorable conclusion otherwise if it would be done more realistically it may had been a hung jury however I can't help but wonder it is possible to do it in a way that was believable and still have the same outcome so I guess that's something for future movies to achieve.,9,0,0,26 February 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Best anti-4chan movie 2018
","It's funny, it's serious, it's determined, it's pretty good. It could be more solemn, they did take way too much time for comedy, especially towards the end but the result is generally great. It could be argued that the characters are often caricatures but I think that isn't very true because neonazis are often simplistic by being single-minded and close to those caricatures.",8,4,8,26 March 2019
Yesterday," When he couldn't google Oasis I lost my s..t
",That was the funniest moment in human history. I can't believe how funny it was the funniest thing ever. I can express how funny it was. It was unbelievable.,10,0,1,28 September 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It was ..interesting.
","The 3D work was OK though it screamed that it was not made with that in mind. Most of the impressive 3D shots were gimmicks entered later with CGI. Some scenery, e.g. in rivendell didn't even have a 3D nature to it, though some other wide shots were OK. The 48 FPS didn't bother me and I found it pristine. I'm certain now that most that badmouthed 48fps were just incapable to disassociate their TV from movies; bad from them, it's not the movie's fault per se, it's pure personal psychology they had.In overall, the movie as a story and movie, an 8. Sue me but I'm quite old to find it too spectacular. But I'm sure it's going to be a 10 for most newcomers in movies.",8,2,10,13 December 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I think it was a bit overrated.
","Don't get me wrong the movie was fine but it had some elements that were clearly misses, e.g. various characters were cartoonish caricatures, leo was again mediocre and a bit annoying, it was a bit inconsistent by having tone swings between seriousness and silliness, and it felt like it wasn't a fully complete story, probably because it was trying to base it on real events and that probably limited its room to grow. In overall I'd say it deserves a 7/10 at most.",7,1,1,1 December 2019
Mr. Nobody," Excellent execution, but lacking story.
","This is one of the very few cases lately, having an excellent execution in terms of direction, photography, production, and even acting, but the story lacking in being very shallow or/and simplistic.I enjoyed the quality of scenes and acting on emotion but the story gives to the viewer an effectively repetitive sequence of romantic emotion. It does not reveal much more emotion than the erotic love between certain protagonist making it a very emotional movie, but also simplistic and repetitive in a considerable part.In short, you will love it if you are into emotion, you will find it good if you're an all-around viewer but you will loathe it if you're not looking for emotion at all in a movie.",7,5,10,3 September 2010
The Mist," The Mist had an amazing 3rd act
",Nothing could have prepared you about how amazing the 3rd act of this movie is. However that doesn't make it perfect since it feels like a few parts of the first acts could have been reshot or reimagined but otherwise the film was greatness.,8,2,2,17 May 2020
The Game," Good movie but it was also way too unrealistic so it can't get a perfect score.
","The greatest hole is that it was just too dangerous to be either legal or realistic to be pulled off. It was way too easy for either something to go horribly wrong (no real bullets needed, e.g. one could just fall off a roof in the wrong way) or to just be not legal to do that.",8,1,2,17 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This movie is a disgrace
","It's what you get when you know nothing about the story of Star Wars and try to make a film out of childish images you saw once for 10 seconds. It completely destroys established characters like Luke Skywalker for no reason at all, other than to do produce a cheap drama for 10 seconds on the screen.
Nobody should ever score this more than a 5/10 if they know anything about storytelling.",1,15,20,19 July 2019
Jaws," It's still great after decades, a little plothole that bugs me
","It was mostly believable, to some extend, until the moment they started shooting it when it was right in front of them but it had almost 0 effect. Later on it was again right in front of them and they had guns but they didn't even try to shoot it.It's pretty obvious an animal like that would either just die or panic and leave, or be eaten by other sharks very easily if shot. So, it was a noticeable plothole that took me out of the story a little.All in all though the movie is still great, especially for its age. Direction is amazing, acting is stellar for the most part, the general story/script great.",8,0,2,8 August 2019
Parasite," It was great.
",It was great. It wouldn't call it a masterpiece since I'm familiar with his work. The Host was clearly more entertaining to be and it was still imperfect so it'd be unjust to give this more than an 8 since it was great but not perfect and not the most entertaining work of the director.,8,3,7,12 February 2020
