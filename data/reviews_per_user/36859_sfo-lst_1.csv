Mission: Impossible III," Modern action film, no significant content.
","I didn't care for the movie because there is not enough to see, believe it or not. It is about 90% close camera work of 'talking' heads. 'Talking heads includes all scenes where there is nothing but a head or two on the screen. The movie is basically just action and suspense with a dash of melodrama thrown in. Much of it filmed close with hand held. I get bored with those and tend to fast-play through them. There is little sophisticated intellectual content or scenery in the movie. All told, there is little to think about and not much to see except the heads and blurry action. I've seen all that before and don't find it interesting anymore. But the film does move along quickly. It has some cool stunts and the scam planning was good. If you like modern action films, you will probably like this one. 01/03/2008 SciFiOne",3,1,1,3 January 2009
