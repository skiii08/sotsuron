The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Sprint to a dull crawl
","Quickie Review:After the events of 75th Hunger Games, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued and brought to District 13 where the rebellion is brewing. Now she must become the face of the rebellion as both sides use propaganda against each other. Meanwhile, Katniss is overwhelmed by balancing her responsibility to the people of Panem with her desire to save Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Mockingjay Part 1 is strong when it comes to the acting talent involved and showing the behinds the scenes propaganda of war. However, the decision to split the story into two parts has really hurt this movie by making it feel incomplete and filled with overstretched melodrama. While it is not a complete failure, it may be better to hold off watching this movie till Part 2 is released.Full Review:I never read the books but I enjoyed the last two movies in the franchise, especially Catching Fire. While I can't say I was aching to go see Mockingjay Part 1, I was interested to know how the story progressed after the cliff-hanger of the last movie. I was concerned that splitting the story into two parts may have been a detrimental choice, unfortunately my concerns were legitimate.I know I'm coming off really negative but there are definitely some gems in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, were the best part of the movie. Watching them clash and play strategic moves against each other was intriguing. The rest of the cast do a good job in showing how they have been affected and changed by this war. This is the first time we see the world outside of the actual Hunger Games and District 12, which helped enrich this movie's universe. Uniquely we get see how propaganda plays an important role in the war. I can't remember the last war movie that delved into that aspect. On top of that, these propaganda pieces were very moving thanks to the rage fueled words of Katniss and the fear mongering of Snow.A lot of the problems for this movie stem from the fact we are spending 2hrs on half a story. This led to us having an entire movie where Katniss keeps crying and moping about either Peeta or the people of District 12 being dead. The feeling that the movie is overstretched is only compounded by how several scenes are just a rehash of a previous scene, for example the recording of a propaganda (3 times) and multiple scenes per character sulking about the people suffering. Look I'm not heartless, I understand those are devastating things to happen to a person, but we want to see the story move forward. I can honestly say that apart from Katniss becoming the face of the rebellion, there is no significant plot development since Catching Fire. There is all this slow build up but that's all it is, a build up to an end that is unsatisfying. Essentially this is a 2hr preview ad for Mockingjay Part 2, and quite frankly I felt mad about this when I left the cinema, and that doesn't happen often.The pathetic cash-grab moves by studios to split the movie into two parts is the root of all the problems for Mockingjay Part 1. To fill the run time the movie is stuffed full with melodrama without much weight to make you care for long. All the momentum that the previous two movies had built has now come to a dull crawl. I'd recommend skipping this movie till Part 2 is released and hopefully enjoy a more complete story.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",6,68,104,23 November 2014
The Equalizer," Liam Neeson found his match
","Quickie Review:Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a law abiding citizen respected by all his peers. He has chosen to leave his dark and mysterious past behind to live a quiet life. However, when his friends are threatened by criminals and corrupt cops, Robert cannot sit idly by and takes matters into his own methodical hands. The Equalizer, is not deep in narrative or storytelling, but quite frankly it doesn't have to be. This is just a fun film where you just get to relax with your snacks and drinks to watch Denzel Washington kick rear-ends till the very end. If that's all you want and need, you'll be more than satisfied.Full Review:Let's be honest here, nobody is expecting an instant classic from this movie. As long as this movie delivered on the fun action, it did its job.Thankfully it was entirely Denzel Washington show and he killed it in his role while he killed the Russian mob. I tend to like the more methodical action heroes, people who give attention to the smallest detail for everything they do. You see that throughout the movie where Washington is thinking ahead and timing his moves perfectly. The fights are well shot too with little shaky cam and perfect sound to really make every punch or shot feel painful. The villain played by Marton Csokas was actually pretty good. They could've gone the generic villain route and this movie would still have worked, but Marton Csokas brought in just the right amount of unbalanced temper that he was big enough threat to care about.The Equalizer is not without faults. One in particular that kind of took me out of the movie was that there were way too many subplots within a short time span. This also made it feel longer than it should. Other than the main plot of the Russian mob, there were two or three other subplots where the Washington's character needs to intervene additional criminals and/or corrupt cops. These were supposed to show how loyal and honorable Robert is. Yet I feel, this could've been achieved through the main plot itself, making the overall movie a bit more concise.Overall, I enjoyed watching The Equalizer, I got exactly what I was looking for. Fans of movie such Taken, Dredd, or some fighting elements of Bourne Trilogy, will find it to be an entertaining time in the cinemas. Now let just have a cross-over with Taken to watch Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson duke it out!Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,0,3,20 October 2014
John Wick," The one is back!
","Quickie Review:John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a highly skilled ex-hit-man who receives a puppy from his dying wife to help him grieve. Things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals John's car and murders his puppy. Now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost. You have heard and seen this type of plot countless times, there are no surprises here, you will predict everything. But is it fun? Oh yes it is. Keanu owns his role and is a complete badass. So despite the unoriginality of the plot, John Wick is filled with some of the most original gunfights I've seen in a long time. Overall this movie is an entertaining pop-corn action flick that is well worth your time.Full Review:I think most would agree that Keanu Reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents. So even though he has been in some terrible movies lately I still find to be a likable actor. I just want him to return to his glory days of being Neo, and John Wick seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that, so I was more than I excited to see it.Let's be real here, this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise. However, Keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool. You can see Reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you can't help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot (strange thing to cheer I know, but you'll know what I mean). Most importantly, this is an action film that actually shows the action. From what I can remember there was not a single shaky cam, every gun fight is brilliantly shot (pun intended) beginning to end. I also loved how precise the movements were, John Wick would always land a headshot and if he can't then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head. Just plain awesomeness.John Wick is not without its problems. As I mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal, so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging. Also I was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end. The rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed, and left more to be desired. One of the positives of John Wick is the rich criminal underworld. It is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions. There is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world. I just wish we got to explore more of that world because I found it to be so intriguing and unique. I am sure they will if there ever is a sequel, which I do think this movie deserves.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching John Wick. Yes it has some flaws, but I was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is. One word to sum up the movie would be 'personality,' because even if it is working with tired story and character concepts John Wick does it with style and fun.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,7,17,23 November 2014
Fury," There's no glory in war
","Quickie Review:Fury follows a Sherman tank crew of four soldiers and a rookie as they take on a deadly mission in Nazi Germany. After being stranded alone, these men unite together to face hundreds of their enemy against overwhelming odds. This movie is small in scope but deep in showing the horrors of war and how it affects individuals. The story meanders from time to time but in the end the consistent brilliant performance by the cast is what keeps you engaged. Full Review:I am not a huge fan of war movies but I was excited to see Fury. This excitement was mainly because of Brad Pitt who is incredible, and Logan Lerman who I personally think has the potential to be a star in the future. The strongest and best aspect of Fury is by far the performances by the actors. Every person, Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael PeÃ±a, Jon Bernthal, even Shia LaBeouf (regardless of his recent tabloid shenanigans) were all impressive. The characters they portray aren't exactly likable, but despite that you are rooting for them because through their performances you start to understand them. That's another strength of this movie, it shows the effect war has on the soldiers involved. They have had to do some horrific things to survive, the harshness of war has turned them into savages. At the same time you see some glimmer of humanity that they are desperately trying to cling onto. Logan Lerman playing the rookie, new to the war, is the perfect window from which we see these gruesome events. Also the tank battles and violence is not there to glorify war (this is not some 80s steroid-Stallone movie). Instead the gruesomeness is used to depict the brutal nature of war, there is real danger, real lives affected, with innocent causalities on both sides.This movie is not without faults, and it has to do with the story. Overall the movie is just very predictable, and I don't mean just the ending, it is also the case for certain critical scenes. You know exactly how some of the scenes are going to pan out, so in a way there are some clichÃ©s that can be distracting. Also there is a part in the middle of the movie where the story slows down. Personally I didn't mind that because I thought it was vital to delve deeper into the characters, but I can understand the complaints from others that say that it felt like the movie came to a grinding halt at that point. Additionally it is a pity that the final climatic battle came off being unrealistic even though rest of the movie was depicted very accurately. The climax just went on for too long, making it very hard to believe that a stranded tank had any chance against hundreds of soldiers.Nevertheless, Fury is a very strong movie with deep characters and perfectly showcasing the nature of war. This is not some grand war epic, it is an intimate story of five men trying to survive a war through the bond they have for each other. I would recommend Fury for the performances alone.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,2,6,26 October 2014
Begin Again," Summer music in the air
","Quickie Review:Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a record label executive is forced to quit his company after being unwilling to compromise on the integrity of the music he produced, for higher sales. Meanwhile, Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a young songwriter cheated on by her college sweetheart Dave (Adam Levine), who is consumed by his new rock-star status. Gretta and Dan meet each other by chance, and the two of them become partners to produce an album to the sounds of Manhattan. Begin Again is a charming little movie about redemption, friendship, and of course music. It is filled with likable characters, witty dialog, and is in the end an uplifting story. While I can't say the movie is original, the chemistry between Ruffalo and Knightley alone was enough to make me enjoy it overall.Full Review:The director of Begin Again, John Carney, had previously directed another music focused movie called Once, which I really loved. So for that reason, I was excited to see his latest work. While it doesn't live up to his previous film, Begin Again is still worth a watch.The stand out performance for me is Mark Ruffalo. From the first scene it is obvious that his character Dan, is not exactly well put together. He is lazy, messy, an alcoholic, also he comes late to meetings and has damaged relationship with his daughter and separated wife. Yet it is his passion for music that shows that there is much more to this man. And he feels the same way about Gretta, that there is a talent that he sees in her that must be shown to the rest of the world. They find a kindred spirit in each other as they work together on the music album. An aspect I love about this movie, is that it is not a love story, or at least in the typical romantic movie sense. Carney could have taken the obvious easy route and just made this a romantic story of Dan and Gretta. Instead it focuses on all the other relationships the two leads have with the supporting cast. In that sense the way the story deals with love between characters is pleasantly charming and unique because it can't be easily labeled.As it is music oriented, I should of course comment on that. Just like movies, music is very subjective, so I won't say that everyone will enjoy the music in this movie. I personally like indie rock so Begin Again soundtrack was a perfect fit for me. If it so happens that you don't enjoy such music, I can at least assure you that the actors involved have a good voice, of course Adam Levine is no surprise in that matter. I should mention though that Levine surprised me with his acting talent. He is no thespian, but he was very natural in his delivery, so props to him.My main problem with this movie is that I feel like I have seen this all before. There is very little risk taken, and you know exactly what is going to happen. So it ends up being that the whole entertainment factor lands on the characters and the dialog. Thankfully, these two aspects is where Begin Again excels and saved the movie. If you are looking for a smart, charming, summer feel-good movie, this is the one for you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,1,2,28 July 2014
The Book Thief," Feel like stealing and reading the book it's based on
","Quickie Review:Set in the period of WWII, The Book Thief tells the story of a young girl seeking comfort in the books she learns to read. The setting is merely a backdrop to show how relationships can enrich one's life while knowing full well that death is inevitable. The highpoint was the acting by the veterans Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush that brought the story to life. Even the child actors Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch hold their own against such great talents. It is not a movie without fault however, as the final act felt rushed and anticlimactic. Yet this is truly an incredible film that is not to be missed.Full Review:The Book Thief, is about a young girl called Liesel (Sophie Nélisse) who is taken into foster care by the Hubermanns (Georffrey Rush and Emily Watson) during the escalating events of WWII. The Hubermanns also find themselves having to hide a young Jewish man named Max (Ben Schnetzer), from being taken away to the concentration camps. Amidst the chaos and horrors of the war, Liesel finds refuge in the written words and shares the stories she learns with the people she comes to love.The highlight of this film is the chemistry between the characters. This can only be achieved through sheer acting talent, and there is plenty of that to be seen. The child actors Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch, playing Liesel's neighbor Rudy, are no acting thespians. Still they both play their parts well and the friendship between them is believable. Nélisse especially brings some genuine innocence and wonderment in her scenes, which contrasts well with the dreariness of the setting. Academy nominated actress Emily Watson plays the role of the foster mother and to no surprise is wonderful in her role. She is supposed to be a cold and strict mother, but when she shows her caring side, Watson makes that transition seem very natural. However, the man that steals all the scenes that he is in, is none other than Geoffrey Rush playing the foster father. This man can do no wrong. He is the polar opposite of Watson's character, being a more nurturing and understanding father to Liesel. He is so charismatic that even in the most distressing moments he livens up the scene. Most of all the relationship between his character and Liesel is sweet and heart- warming.The few flaws that are there has mostly to do with the third act. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed. Much of the movie spends time on developing the relationships of the characters. While that's perfectly fine because it is done beautifully, it left little time to progress to the final climax. So instead it felt anticlimactic, and there was no satisfactory closure.I actually never read the book this movie is based on. The only exposure I had was the one trailer in the cinemas and one of my friends telling me how great the book is. So I went in with mediocre expectations and I ended up loving it. There are some flaws, but as a whole I had a great experience. I'd highly recommend giving it a watch if you can. Geoffrey Rush's charm alone is reason enough to watch this movie. The Book Thief will definitely pull at your heart strings.",8,1,4,3 April 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Go watch this NOW. Captain's orders.
","Quickie Review:Four words – Best Marvel movie yet. That's a bold claim to make, but one I stand by. In this second stand-alone appearance of Captain America, we see him struggling to come to terms with the changed perspective of the modern world on freedom and security. CA:WS takes more of a spy thriller approach to the story, which ends up being very entertaining to watch unfold. This is the most bad-ass version of Cap we have ever seen, and he encounters an equally intimidating villain called the Winter Soldier. A must-watch movie with great action, characters, and story. What more can one ask for? Do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible.Full Review:Time to defend my bold claim.Captain America: Winter Soldier, is directed by the Russo bros. (Anthony & Joe) who are mostly known for directing TV shows. Considering this is their first big-budget movie, they absolutely did an incredible job. I like how they made this movie feel more like a spy thriller than the generic, campy comic-book action. The story is very well paced and I enjoyed watching every minute of the mystery and conspiracy unfold in front of me. Despite being a blockbuster movie, I was surprised to see it go deeper than the usual popcorn flick by touching upon some relevant social issues. That's not the focus of course, but it is nice to see the directors take a serious approach, yet still manage to keep it fun and engaging.Credit has to be given to Chris Evans playing Captain America. I always liked Cap the most of all the Avengers heroes, because of how honest and incorruptible the character is. Evans continues to play him brilliantly, but in this movie we also get to see his full fighting capability. This truly is the most skilled and powerful Cap we have ever seen. The action choreography is amazing. You feel every punch he throws and you will always be on the edge of your seat. Speaking of throwing, we see some of the most creative and impactive use of the shield so far. The main villain of this movie is Winter Soldier and he was excellent. He is definitely the most intimidating villain we have seen in the Marvel movies. Every encounter between him and Cap is exhilarating to watch, especially the climax where you really feel the gravity of their struggle. There is honestly no weak link in the casting at all. Even the newcomers to this franchise such as Robert Redford and Anthony Mackie made a dent in memorable performances.After watching the CA:WS I just can't deny the fact that I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Avengers, which many, including myself consider to be the best one (till now of course). CA:WS is all the more impressive bearing in mind that it was able to deliver the same amount of enjoyment without the spectacle of all the Avengers teaming up together. That is why I have to single it out to be the best Marvel movie yet. This is a must-see. I just can't stress that enough!REMINDER: There is a mid-credits and an end-credits scene, so do not leave after the movie ends. I see people make this mistake, so make sure you are not one of them. Enjoy!",9,2,5,29 March 2014
Interstellar," Interstellar – Relatively perfect
","Quickie Review:Humanity faces extinction as the world can no longer produce the food to sustain themselves. This leads to the choice of either exploring far away worlds in search of a new home, or accepting the end, left to fade into the dust. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his team embark upon a journey into deep space to find such a new home, and save the human race along with his daughter. Director Christopher Nolan is well known for his intricate and often complex stories, Interstellar is no exception. Visuals are stunning, the soundtrack is impactful, and the cast is strong with McConaughey being the excellent emotional anchor. Unfortunately, when the intangible is explored the strangeness of the ideas displayed can be distracting and pull you out of the moment. Still this is a must see movie for successfully melding the ambitious take on the sci-fi genre with the human drama.Full Review:Story-telling master Christopher Nolan, the recent McConaughaissance, combined with sci-fi which sane movie lover would say no to that?! I had to see it on the opening night and I expected to be blown away. Thankfully as a whole Interstellar did deliver on the high expectations, but I have to admit there is one problem with this movie that bothers me enough to not give it the perfect score.Everyone in the cast did a great job but the standout by far is McConaughey. He plays his character Cooper with incredible depth and that helped a lot to make us care about what he's going through for his daughter. Add all the visuals in the universe, but it won't make a difference if the lead was not strong. So safe to say the McConaughaissance is still going strong. The father-daughter relationship is the emotional core, and they share some scenes together that hit you right in the soft spot of your heart. As for two of your five senses (six if you see ghosts) sound and sight, they are both in for a delicious treat. Visually this movie is gorgeous, multiple times my jaw dropped in awe. It is all the more impressive that for the first time ever the black holes and worm holes have actual mathematical and physics basis for how they have been depicted. Facts can be stranger than fiction, strangely beautiful, and there are countless moments of that in Interstellar. The sounds and music only help amplify the effect of the visuals. More than once I was clenching my fist and biting my fingers because of the intensity building up with Hans Zimmer's score. I think this may be Zimmer's most unique soundtrack since Inception.My problems with the movie has to do with the story. Before I explain further I have to be clear about this, I actually really like the story. Nolan is meticulous with Interstellar, the amount of attention given to the effect of scientific theories on the structure of the story is impressive. This reminds me to caution you about the scientific expositions given in the movie. All you need to know is how gravity can affect time (general relativity), this is briefly explained so pay attention to that fact to understand what's going on. You don't need to be theoretical physicist to understand (but hey it wouldn't hurt). Ultimately this brings me to my negative point, while the movie excels at explaining the difficult but accepted scientific theories, it fails when showcasing the currently intangible areas of science. It forces the filmmaker to make artistic decisions on certain things that may come off too strange for the audience to accept. These scenes were really distracting for me, and I think it was for others as well because I'd hear giggles for something that was supposed to be taken seriously. Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't want to give away any plot points.Honestly though, Interstellar is truly a special film with grand ideas given in a deep narrative context. It's a blend that works almost perfectly. Interstellar is thought provoking and I am sure you will be having some long conversions with your friends and family afterwards. Cast, visuals, music, is the trifecta that will make this movie stick with you. Don't miss out on this one.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,2,7,6 November 2014
American Sniper," Little too much 'Murica
","Quickie Review:After the events of 9/11 Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who initially wanted nothing more than to be a cowboy felt the need to use his talent with a rifle to help the American army. So he joins the SEALs and becomes one of the best snipers recruited in American history. However, as the war starts to take a toll on him he is torn between his duty as a soldier and responsibility as a husband with children. There is no doubt Clint Eastwood is an excellent director, and he clearly pulled a performance from Bradley Cooper of the same caliber. Controversies regarding the real Chris Kyle aside, it is still hard to ignore some of the bias in the film. Nevertheless, the movie itself is well shot and acted, delivering some tense moments. In that regard American Sniper gains not all but some of my praise.Full Review:When going into watch the movie, I was fully aware of the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle as he was in real life versus how he is depicted in this film. However, I'm not here to judge the real Chris Kyle, I'm here to share my thoughts on the movie. That'd being said some of the aspects of the movie makes it hard to ignore the politics. Nevertheless I want to make it clear that all of my views will still pertain to the film.American Sniper is a very well-directed film both in terms of the action and the character drama. There were many moments in the movie where you feel the silent tension of making a decision as a sniper. I thought the weight behind some of the decisions to pull the trigger was captured perfectly. Even I who never held a gun in my life (except in the virtual battlefields of video games) wondered what I'd do if I were in his situation. Of course, there are some embellishment of explosions and such, but as a whole the shootouts felt grounded with some sense of consequence. Bradley Cooper did a great job in this film. He was able to portray the struggle of being veteran in a nuanced manner. The fact he has PTSD is not hammered over head for the audience. So was he Oscar worthy? Well no, I could think of two other actors that could've taken his spot in the nomination. But that is a topic for another long conversation, so I won't elaborate on that.As for the problems I had with the film, there's only one but a pretty significant one. The movie is heavily biased and I am not even referring to Chris Kyle because I set that controversy aside to enjoy the film. Not once are we shown the 'good' guys of the other side. Apart from one translator, every single non-American in this film is either a terrorist or only share information when forced to. That can't possibly be the reality. Dare I say it, at times I was reminded of the mock sniper propaganda movie from Inglorious Basterds. I have friends and family in America, and of course I know most people wouldn't be blinded by the bias. Then again let's be honest here, there are people out there who will take this movie a bit too literally. That's why I think it's a little irresponsible on the filmmaker's part to completely ignore the Iraqi contribution to the American army in the war effort, some of which the real Chris Kyle benefited from. Imagine if we had seen a more fleshed depiction of the Iraqi people. Perhaps a family that is also struggling between wanting to help the Americans and keeping their relatives safe from the terrorists. Those parallels would have deeply enriched the movie.I recognize I did touch upon some politics here, but it had to be addressed. Yes there are moments where the movie screams 'Murica!' Still Bradley Cooper's performance and the intense action resulted in an engaging film. I like the movie overall, I just think there was a missed opportunity here to show the contribution of the Iraqi side as well.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,2,24,10 March 2015
Ant-Man," F-ant-astic
","Quickie Review:Brilliant scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), in his desperation turns to con-man Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) for help. Together with a suit that has the ability to shrink the wearer and control hordes of ants, Scott must pull off a heist in an effort to save Hank's research from falling into wrong hands. Ant-Man is the funniest movie in the current Marvel Cinematic Universe. With gut- busting comedy, incredible visuals, and beautifully orchestrated action, this movie clearly shows that the Ant-Man is not to be underestimated. Ant-Man is the perfect blend of action and comedy that makes for one of the more enjoyable blockbusters of this summer.Full Review:It's not surprising that the initial reaction of the general audience when they hear the concept of an Ant-Man is one of ridicule. However, this character has been critical in many of Marvel comic stories. So the question became can they really translate one of their smallest comic book characters on the biggest screen? The answer is a resounding yes.The main cast of this film were perfect for the tone of the film. Paul Rudd has been supporting character in lot of my favourite comedy films, but here he takes centre stage with his quick wit and charm. At the same time he is not just some joker, and is a completely capable action hero. Whoever casted Michael Douglas as an older Hank Pym was a stroke of genius. Even though he is not the main character he brings so much depth to his role. There is a lot back story to him and in just few moments he is able to convey how that affects him. Also he is not just some grumpy old man, he won't hold back in pulling a punch or two if he needs too. The absolute show stealer is Michael Peña as Luis. I don't invoke God very often, but Oh My God he was hilarious. He is such likable guy that won't let anything take away his smile and so you smile with him. Then, when he starts to tell his stories, prepare for continuous stream of laughter. I would listen to him tell me stories every day. The only weakness for me has to be the villain. I found him to be very shallow and one note. Considering how well the rest of the cast was developed, it's a pity that Corey Stoll's addition was wasted.Apart from the characters, what makes this movie stand out is the action like we have never seen before. The shifting of scale from large to small was very well used in the fight choreography. The movements had a lot of power behind them and the Ant-Man felt like an unstoppable force. The small scale scenes were ironically the most grand set- pieces of the movie. It was a different way of looking at the world and it was beautiful. Oh, and don't forget the ants! Ant-Man can also control armies of ants and yes they were fascinating creatures that were way more useful in the missions than you might expect. They were basically another member of the heist team.What I appreciated most about Ant-Man, is the fact that this is a heist movie. With the current trend of comic book movies always setting the stakes higher and higher, with the end of world is nigh, it is nice to pull back a little and tell a much smaller story. The stakes are only high here because of the characters and the father- daughter relationships. In that sense there is a more relatable motive.So don't underestimate this film, go and watch it. You will laugh more here than most comedies, and meanwhile be enjoying a f-ant- astic cinematic micro world. Paul Rudd and the gang are a great new addition to the MCU.",8,5,15,24 July 2015
Nightcrawler," Nightcrawler – Psycho shooting, but with cameras
","Quickie Review:Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) while desperate for work crosses upon the world of crime-scene journalism. Finally finding his talent in the nightcrawling business, Lou is driven to rise to the top. On his path to success he makes questionable decisions and commit acts of crime just to aid his rise to fame. This is by far the best performance in Jake Gyllenhaal's career and one of the best of the year. You will not see the actor because you are so captivated by the character. Nightcrawler is suspenseful, brilliantly acted, well- structured, and gripping. Experiencing this man's psychotic nature unfold should not be missed.Full Review:When I first saw the trailer for Nightcrawler, I wasn't really sure what to think. Trailer didn't reveal too much but it seemed like it would at least be a suspenseful movie. Also I was surprised to see Gyllenhaal's change in look. However, I was glad to find out that the transformation went beyond the physical appearance.Gyllenhaal disappeared into the role completely, fully embodied the character of Lou Bloom. There are moments where Lou is actually quite charming, then all of sudden he becomes terrifying and intimidating. He plays that drastic switching in personality really well, it feels like a very natural transition despite its abruptness. Even though he is committing crimes for capturing the perfect crime scene footage for news, you are somehow still rooting for him at times. It is strange how you will see him as both the antagonist and the protagonist, and I think the vastly different personalities of the character helped a lot in making that effective.To me there is nothing scarier than a crazy person who doesn't think he/she is crazy, because at that point there no moral line to hold them back. You get to see that lack of morality throughout the movie. It is more obvious in the footage capture of the crimes and accidents, but more interestingly it is also present in the way Lou interacts with rest of the cast. These were some my favorite parts of the movie. It is completely apparent that he will do and say whatever is needed to get what he wants. This when the supporting cast excelled, because they mirrored how the audience felt. They, like the viewers, know how manipulative Lou is being and yet they still want to believe him and trust him. So even a conversation between two people was just as intense and enticing as a high speed road chase with the cops.I am certain this will be one of the top movies I will remember for 2014. It has stuck with me even after I left the cinema. It's a shame that it's only out on limited release (at least in EU), so it's not accessible for everyone. But if you have chance, go to the theater and support this movie, if you can't then don't miss it when it's release for home video.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,1,3,16 November 2014
Bridge of Spies," 'Watch this man'
","Quickie Review:When a Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in the height of the Cold War is arrested, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend him in an American trial. Meanwhile an American pilot is captured by the Soviets, thrusting Donovan into the responsibility of negotiating between two world powers on the brink of war. Bridge of Spies, balances the gravity of politics on a world stage with the relations and fears of the people behind it all. This film is yet another great example of what Spielberg and Hanks can achieve when they team up together. Will this be a classic from years to come? I expect not, but the quality of acting and directing is undeniable.Full Review:Considering Spielberg being one of the best directors and Hanks being one of the best actors in the Hollywood business, it is hard not to get excited for this movie. I'm not completely familiar with the real-world story, so I can't say much on the accuracy but on the movie of course I have my opinion to share.In terms of the performances, everybody was flawless but the clear stand-outs for me was Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. The character Donovan is unwavering when it comes to his duty as a lawyer, even when he has to defend an enemy of his country. He believes in the importance of unbiased justice, so strongly that at first it may come off as naÃ¯ve. However, there are understated moments where we can see clearly his resolve being tested to the limits. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy, is a man of few words but with that limitation he is able to convey so much about the character. He is defeated and fearful for his life, but when Donovan shows that there is still hope he will crack a joke. The key here is subtlety, that brings the power into the more dramatic moments without it feeling forced. I didn't feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching real people.Another aspect that really grabbed my attention is the Cold War setting. It is of course the perfect time period for any political thriller story (a real one at that). Despite it being decades ago, it is hard not to see the parallels between the Cold War era and present day. We get to see the xenophobia in USA surrounding communists and Soviet spies, people quick to draw conclusions from their emotion. Could we really say things are any different now? Unfortunately not. So it is interesting how the movie feels relevant in modern day politics. The second half of the movie shows the delicate nature of negotiations. There are moments of manipulations, lies, and deceit. Yet through all that a trust has to be built to have any movement in the talks. How the characters try to build that relation for mutual benefit is what intrigued me the most.I only have one complain, that is it feels like two movies in one. The first half feels like legal drama, and the second half is a political thriller. So I would've liked more consistency between the two plot lines. Bridge of Spies, in the end achieves the authenticity in its characters and the setting. That's why I highly recommend seeing this movie. Personally, movies (not documentaries) that are based on real stories should prioritise authenticity and not accuracy. That I think are two very different things that deserves a whole entire post to explain.",8,1,3,30 November 2015
Divergent," young adult movie that doesn't 'diverge' from the genre norm
","Quickie Review:With the popular demand for young adult novel adaptations, comes yet another movie called Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.Full Review:In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feelAll in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it.",6,7,13,6 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I choose to accept it
","Quickie Review:A rogue international organisation known as the Syndicate aim to dismantle the IMF and control the world in secrecy. Ethan (Tom Cruise) and his team must take on the seemingly impossible task to uncover the secret organisation and stop them before their influence grows. MI Rogue Nation, has all the right ingredients for a fun summer blockbuster: thrilling action, memorable villain, humour, intrigue of uncertain allegiances, and Tom Cruise unnecessarily risking his life doing stunts for the awe of the audience. Together these ingredients work so well for majority of the movie, but at one point too much of one of these aspects starts to leave a hint of a bad aftertaste. Nevertheless, as a whole the movie is a satisfying ride to be enjoyed with some buttery popcorn goodness.Full Review:I loved the last Mission: Impossible so no-brainer I was really looking forward for Rogue Nation. After the Burj Khalifa scene, it was hard to imagine how they'd recapture that thrill ride. Somehow they have managed to pull it off again.Say what you will about Tom Cruise in his personal life, but he is a born action-star, and for an action movie that's all that matters. The way he puts himself through these incredible stunts, is what brings so much excitement to the movie. These scenes could've had a faceless stuntman and it would have been acceptable, but the fact that we see Cruise and know that he is really hanging on to that plane, really driving the bike in a high speed chase, brings a sense of realism that can't be duplicated in any other way. That is by far the most impressive part of the movie. The rest of the cast were also integral to the story, nobody felt wasted. The stand-outs however, has to be the newcomers Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris. Ferguson plays a British agent, a skilled assassin whose allegiance is not exactly clear. She is not a damsel in distress and could kick everyone's ass just as effectively as Ethan Hunt. Sean Harris is the face behind the Syndicate, a great villain that really challenges Ethan with ease. Villains haven't always been a strong point for MI movies but Harris brought this modern twist to an almost old-school Bond like villain.As I said I had fun with this movie but I can't ignore the major problem. Switching allegiances and hidden agendas of characters are pretty par for the course in MI movies. So including these scenes is not my complaint, but it's the overuse that's the issue. The first few times it adds uncertainty into the mix, making the film more intriguing. But at one point every character start to switch allegiances or reveal their own secret goals so regularly that it starts to feel very contrived. All these twists just boil down to conveniences that move the plot along. I would've preferred that these twists were natural outcome of the plot rather than a quick fix for plot holes.In the end, if you are looking for a summer action blockbuster, MI Rogue Nation is definitely a good choice. Some of most gripping set- pieces of the summer are in this movie, especially the car/bike chase in Morocco. In my opinion Ghost Protocol was a better film overall but Rogue Nation is still a worthy addition to the franchise.",7,0,2,15 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Validating the entire franchise
","Quickie Review:Director Bryan Singer, the godfather of all things X-Men (cinematically), returns to the franchise with its most ambitious film yet. In the future the world is in ruins and menacing robots called Sentinels are hunting both mutants and humans alike. The last remaining hope for survival is to go back in time and change history to prevent this dire future from becoming reality. To call X-Men DOFP a time- traveling comic movie is an injustice. This is a movie that goes beyond its genre norm and delivers a compelling character driven story. This is a must-see for all X-Men fans and everyone else.Full Review:X-Men DOFP is incredibly well-directed with strong story-telling, obviously credit for that goes to Bryan Singer. He finally returned to the director seat after years of being just a producer, and he shows how an X-Men movie is done. Movies involving altering time-lines can be tricky to pull off, one wrong move and the story will just fall apart. Yet Singer manages to keep this aspect of the movie cohesive, showing both the past and future scenes with the right balance. He in fact goes an additional step and keeps the cohesion with the entire franchise (even the crappy ones, yes). By that I mean this movie recognizes and corrects the faults and plot holes of all the other movies. At first glance, X-Men is an extremely crowded universe, but you don't feel that at all. Every character is given the right amount of screen time and things to do to make you care about what is happening on screen. They are no longer just a random collection of mutants in peril. That brings me to the strongest part of X-Men DOFP, the characters.I can honestly say there is not an ounce of weak acting from both the old and new main cast. However, majority of the film takes places in the 70s, so it is mainly the new cast from X-Men First Class that get to shine, and wow they shine bright. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence play their parts so well that you will only recognize them as their characters. James McAvoy is Professor X like we've never seen before, broken and tortured. You sympathize and understand the pain he has been going through. You recognize that Michael Fassbender as Magneto is flawed in his ideologies, where the end justifies any means. Still a small part of you supports his ways. When an actor can make you question your own moral stance, that's a sign of brilliance. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence brings to life the multiple dimensions and physicality of the character Mystique with grace. The biggest surprise is the newcomer Evan Peters as Quicksilver, with the ability of super speed. He steals every scene he is in, and I think it's best for you to discover by yourself what makes him so great.I really had to think hard for any negatives, and I just could not come up with any. Some people I talked to think there was too little action, and in a way I can understand that. In the end, that didn't bother me because I was invested in the characters and their emotional interactions. Still, the action set pieces that are there, I found them to be fantastic (now merge this universe with the new upcoming 2016 Fantastic Four already!). The X-men franchise is known for some great and not-so great movies. It is not a perfect franchise. However, X-Men DOFP is one of the greats, and hell, it is close to perfection.REMINDER: There is an end-credits scene, so do not leave after the movie ends.",9,1,3,24 May 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Not just another teen romance
","Quickie Review:Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a terminal cancer patient and Gus (Ansel Elgort), a cancer survivor become friends after meeting for the first time at a cancer support group. Despite the overwhelming circumstances they both have been dealt with, through their friendship that grows into love, Hazel and Gus triumph over the fear of death and oblivion. The Fault In Our Stars is a surprisingly touching movie that is actually smart. Its incredible two leads bring such realism to their characters that make them and the story all the more relatable. A beautifully heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that deserves more recognition.Full Review:Well, I'll be honest when I saw the trailers and saw that this is yet another teen romance novel adaption, I couldn't care less for it. But then slowly I started to hear some good buzz so I got curious. I knew I wasn't the target demographic, this was made even clearer to me when I realized there was literally one other male in the entire cinema (no exaggeration) and he was there with his girlfriend. So I was the only single male in his 20s watching The Fault In Our Stars. Which is a shame because I enjoyed the movie and think more people should go out and see it.There is a reason why some people avoid movies that are based on teen romance novels, because they tend to sugar coat and glorify the love aspect of the story and ignore realistic hardships that comes with relationships **sneeze** Twilight **sneeze** (sorry, allergic too crap movies, can't help it). But let me be absolutely clear, The Fault In Our Stars is not that kind of movie. Both Hazel and Gus are instantly likable characters. They are witty and smart, and that comes across very well thanks to the strong script. Gus especially is this extremely optimistic person and by being with him Hazel finally feels like she doesn't need to be defined by her cancer. At the same time Hazel helps Gus realize to cherish the memories he makes with the people he loves. All of what I described doesn't happen in an instant, it all takes time just like it would in real life. That is why when they eventually fall in love and see them suffer with cancer together, it is completely believable.This is not a movie that only people dealing with cancer or people who know others with cancer will relate to. Everyone will be touched by the story of Gus and Hazel. I could hear half the theater sniffling and in tears, and understandably so.So I must say if you are on the fence about this movie, I say give it a chance. It may not be a perfect movie but it doesn't have to be. I am thankful I gave it that chance.P.S. I know I have male friends that feel like they will be dragged to this movie by their significant other. So guys and girls, if you feel the same way, trust me this is a pretty good one to be dragged to.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,0,1,22 July 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Where are MY dragons!!
","Quickie Review:Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his loyal friend, a dragon named Toothless, over the period of 5 years after the first movie, have built a Viking clan at Berk that lives harmoniously with dragons. As Hiccup explores faraway lands he crosses upon the mysterious Dragon Rider, and learns about Drago Bludvist, a dragon hunter who is building a dragon army to take over the world. Hiccup and Toothless must face this madman before he ends the peaceful co-existence of humans and dragons at Berk. How to Train Your Dragon 2 (HTTYD2) is a great example of what a sequel should be. It builds upon the previous movie, further grows and develops the characters we love, and takes the story to places which most other animations would shy away from. A great, beautiful, and charming film for all ages, a must-see without a doubt.Full Review:When the first movie released I went in with low expectations and came out absolutely in awe and love with the movie. So with this sequel, my expectations were high from the moment I saw the first teaser trailer. Wow, HTTYD2 delivered in every respect, solidifying itself as a wonderful franchise in animation and film in general.I love the fact that we see the characters as young adults now, facing new challenges in their lives. Most animations would have to the freedom just start where they left off and stick with what worked. In HTTYD2 the film takes a risk to age the characters, and yet they all feel their familiar charming selves. They are the strongest part of the movie because their interactions between each other is believable and of course hilarious. There is a new significant character that is introduced, initially known as Dragon Rider. I don't want to spoil who exactly it is (even though the trailers did so), but the first encounter between Hiccup and Dragon Rider is very well executed and felt natural. Throughout the movie there are many emotionally impactful scenes. Especially the strong bond between Hiccup and Toothless is something that everyone will relate to, more so if you ever had a pet. Also the story is not afraid to take some dark turns. I like when animations don't shield their younger audience just because they are young and instead treats them intelligently.I should not forget to mention of course, the animation is gorgeous. I swear there were moments that felt like I was watching live-action scenes. It is that good. Every single flying scenes gave me goosebumps because it was so beautiful. Usually when I do these reviews I make short list of things I liked and disliked about the movie, and in the likes there is Toothless, in all-caps and multiple exclamation points. He was already an awesome dragon in the first movie, and somehow Dreamworks have turned him into an even more badass dragon! Why couldn't he be real!?There is very little to complain about this movie, but there is one noteworthy flaw. I didn't really care for the villain Drago. He felt a bit generic in that he is just evil and wants to conquer stuff for the sake of conquering things. So that could've been a bit improved but it didn't detract me much from my enjoyment of the movie.So if you are looking to have a fun adventure with great funny characters and emotional depth, look no further than How to Train Your Dragon 2. I watched it just few hours ago and I want go back and watch it again now. Do not miss out on this one.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,1,4,14 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Beauty in the static scenery and dynamic caricatures
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is art in motion, inspired by the Silent Era of film. Director Wes Anderson presents us an adventure where Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) tries to prove his innocence of a murder with the help of his employee, simply named Zero (Tony Revolori). While the story lacks focus at times, the movie remains entertaining through its quirky, witty humor and the growing relationship between Gustave and Zero. This is a visual spectacle to be seen on the big screen. Truly.The Grand Budapest Hotel stars Ralph Fiennes, popularly known for portraying 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,' playing a completely different character that I will name, Monsieur Gustave. A devoted concierge of the hotel, Gustave is shallow, selfish, and takes advantage of vulnerable older women for his pleasure. The other major character is Zero, a refugee without a family, looking for a place to fit in. He is played by a newcomer to cinema, Tony Revolori. After a murder of a previous 'lover,' Gustave is falsely framed for her death. This thrust him and his apprentice lobby boy, Zero into an adventure trying to prove his innocence. To start with, in terms of story it felt a bit weak, losing focus at times to show events that never end up affecting the overall arc or characters. However, the backbone that keeps this movie interesting through all the shenanigans is the growth the two main characters go through together. Blended with the quirky banter and dark humor, the relationship between the two is very well written and a joy to watch.There is no way one can watch a Wes Anderson directed movie and not talk about his visual style. His previous films are distinctively unique, and this movie is no different. I personally loved the visuals of The Grand Budapest Hotel. So much so that I feel each frame of the movie could have been hung up on a wall as art, and each of them would tell their own story. Everything in the scenes you see are placed there with a purpose, even down to the way glasses are placed on a table. Anderson does something beautiful where he brings life into static shots of a room or scenery, through the movement and caricatures of the actors. The movie in general gives homage to the Silent Era films, likes of Georges Méliès. This is clearly apparent from the aspect ratio, to the exaggerated acting, and to the bright colors imitating the hand-colored film of that era.I have to admit I really enjoyed the movie, more than I thought I would. There is no denying that Anderson's movies are very divisive, people either really like them or don't. I can say without a doubt that The Grand Budapest Hotel will not turn you into a Wes Anderson fan if you are not already. Still, the ones who are a fan will find plenty to love about this film, and for those this a must see.",8,2,11,18 March 2014
Foxcatcher," Uncomfortably good
","Quickie Review:Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) and his brother Dave Shultz (Mark Ruffalo) are both Olympic gold medalist wrestlers. In a chance to prove himself away from his brother's shadow, Mark joins Team Foxcatcher created by millionaire John E. du Pont (Steve Carell). As their working relationship starts to develop Mark comes to realize John's inner demons. Foxcatcher, is a suspenseful drama exploring very human insecurities and the actions it can drive us to take. Both Channing Tatum and Steve Carell give likely their career defining performance so far. Though a slow burn, the slow rising temperature is worth the wait.Full Review:Steve Carell is a comedy icon, and deservedly so. Meanwhile, a once laughable actor Channing Tatum had found his niche with the Jump Street franchise. Now we gladly laugh at Tatum because we genuinely find him to be great in comedy. However, with Foxcatcher both of these actors are daring to try something out of their comfort zone. That's the reason why I was so excited to see this film.Channing Tatum has really come a long way since his Step Up days (when in mood for puns you could even say he 'stepped up'). Looking at the massive success of 21 & 22 Jump Street I wouldn't have been shocked if Tatum continued to do comedies. Instead he chose to do a dramatic role with the director of Moneyball, Bennett Miller. A ballsy move, but one that pays off. He completely changes himself into a different person in this film. Yes, at first glance you would pass him off as a big bulky gym junkie, but there is more to him than that. He wants to be the best, to be seen as a hero. In his quest for greatness, Tatum effectively shows the jealousy and competitiveness of his character. A quest that inevitably alienates him from his loved ones. As for Steve Carell, he has the obvious physical changes but the dramatic transformation he goes through is much more impressive. His character John presents himself as a visionary and a leader. However, that is all a façade he hides his insecurities behind. His need for approval makes him manipulate people and his own public image. The more this need grows, the more questionable decisions he makes that constantly builds the tension between him and the rest of the cast. Their relation together is what makes the audience remain on the edge.One thing I should mention that some people may have a problem with, the length of the movie. I personally enjoyed the slow pace because it made sense with the psychology of the lead characters. That slow burn and tension led to a narrative climax that I physically reacted to. The only reason I bring this up is because I did notice several people leaving the cinema well before the film ended. The number of people was significant enough that it made me wonder if I was the only one who didn't mind the pacing. Nevertheless, I'm just cautioning you in case that does happen to be of any concern.In the end, I really liked Foxcatcher. It is always great to see actors take risks, even more so when they succeed. Tatum and Carell certainly did succeed, and I hope this isn't the last we see of them in a dramatic role.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,0,2,22 February 2015
It Follows," Weird and intense
","Quickie Review:Jay (Maika Monroe) is a high school girl who goes on a date that ends with a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. Soon after she finds herself being followed by a supernatural entity. She must find a way to escape this curse before it leads to her death. It Follows, is not the typical horror movie that depends on jump scares. Instead it uses a combination of atmosphere and soundtrack to deliver some really intense and chilling visuals. This is not a movie for everyone, with a fair share of weirdness that might put off certain viewers. On the other hand, the unique tone, sound design and visuals, caters to people who are aching for an original film in the horror genre.Full Review:One of my favorite genres of film is horror, but I'm not blind to the fact that this genre is filled with movies of poor quality. Just look at last year with horrible releases such as Annabelle and Ouija. Then again when there is a good horror movie like Babadook, it can induce a roller-coaster of emotional reactions. I had high expectations for It Follows and personally it surpassed it.When it comes to these films I prefer to be frightened by the things I can't see, playing off of the psychological terror of the characters. That was very well done by Maika Monroe as the lead. Quite frequently horrors have the dumb blonde who sleeps around, a cheap cliché that easily fits this premise. However, Monroe's character was more than this typical cliché. She's just an average teenage girl who happens to be a victim of unfortunate circumstances. You see how conflicted she is on how to handle this curse, whether to pass it on, involve her friends, or simply give up. Another horror cliché that is turned on its head is the topic of sex. Most of the time sex scenes are just added in scary films to attract a certain type of audience, but in It Follows sex is an integral part of the story. There is something deeply terrifying about being haunted for a very personal act. A supernatural entity infringing upon your most private moments is disturbing to say the least. Suffice to say It Follows is a horrible date movie.Jump scares in scary movies are like shaky cams in action films, I absolutely hate them. The reason why I hate jump scares so much is because it diffuses all the built up tension in a scene, forcing that build up to start all over again. Thankfully I can only remember one time when It Follows used that trick. Rest of the time it was the atmosphere and the soundtrack that sent chills down my spine. Even when there was nothing happening the 80's synth music kept up that level of intensity. I also really liked the cinematography of the movie. From the very first scene with a fixed rotating camera, you know you are in for a very distinctive cinematic look. That distinct look is also there with the setting of the movie. You don't really know in which era this movie takes place. The characters will be watching black and white cheap sci- fi's on a bulky CRT TV while at the same time using an e-book to read off poetry. It's these little things that bring almost a fantastical element to the story, making the supernatural aspect fit perfectly into this world.With all that said the big question is, was it scary? I'd say yes, because I was noticing every person that passed by me on the street while I biked back home in the night at almost 1:30am. I'd only caution that you be aware of the different tone of the movie, because if you are not expecting that (like my friend didn't) it can be jarring at first. In the end even if you happen to not like the movie it'd be hard to deny the originality of the movie. I loved It Follows for being totally weird while still being interesting and intense.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,142,278,19 April 2015
Gone Girl," Prepared to be shocked
","Quickie Review:On the day of their anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) missing. Following her disappearance Nick is overwhelmed by the media circus and police dissecting every aspect of his marriage. As the lies are uncovered the spotlight grows brighter on Nick as the prime suspect for his wife's murder. Director David Fincher strikes again with yet another incredible movie to his already stellar filmography. Calling Gone Girl a murder-mystery is underselling it. This movie is a deep terrifying study into sociopaths, relationships, and strive for perfection, delivered in a slow yet engaging pace. While Ben Affleck is incredible, Rosamund Pike's performance will leave you speechless. I'd be shocked if this movie is not nominated for Oscars.Full Review:The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fight Club are all movies that I love from David Fincher. So of course I was excited to see Gone Girl, and I left the movie in love once again. Although not the type of love portrayed in this film, that'd be crazy. I should mention that I never read the novel the movie is based on, so I won't be able to comment how well it was adapted.You may notice that run-time of this film is almost 2hrs 30mins, so it is relatively long movie. Nevertheless I didn't want this movie to end, I wanted more. You are drawn in by every scene and that's testament to the slow burning pace that keeps on building momentum till the final crescendo. I'll admit that half way I needed to go to the toilet but I held back because I didn't want to miss a single thing. I'm glad I stayed because it felt like every scene was vital to moving the story along. In most murder-mystery thrillers, the big reveal is the highlight and everything after that has little intrigue. However, in this case even after the truth is revealed you are aching to know more, and that is where the movie becomes most interesting.Ben Affleck was really great in his role. The nuances in his acting added to constant audience doubt and questioning of did he or did he not? Even rest of the supporting cast such as Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, surprised me with how different the roles they played were from what they are usually known for. But the absolute show stealer is Rosamund Pike. At first I wasn't too sure about her performance because it felt a little bit robotic, but as you come to understand her, you start to see Pike revealing all the layers of her character. I think there is not one person who wasn't stunned by her hauntingly beautiful performance. Once again I must say Oscar nominations are much deserved, especially in her case.I would rave more about this movie but that would entail going to spoiler territory. All you need to know is that the acting, pacing, story, characters, everything about this movie is excellent. You will be thinking about Gone Girl for a few days after viewing it the first time. It will affect you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,1,9,13 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," Almost everything is great
","Quickie Review:A young scientist named Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), is in search of finding a single unifying theory that explains everything about the universe. As ambitious as that sounds, it is made more challenging when he is diagnosed with motor neuron disease that will slowly take away his ability to move or speak. Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) decide to fight the disease together, naive to the difficult journey that lies ahead. Based on the life of Stephen Hawking, The Theory of Everything showcases acting of impeccable quality. An inspirational story of a man that overcomes his disability to pursue his passion. At the same time a moving story about human flaws. Definitely one of the finer films of 2014 that must be seen.Full Review:Stephen Hawking is one of the most renowned scientist living today. Considering how he was able to continue his research despite the motor neuron disease makes his contributions all the more impressive. Such an inspirational man, and yet many (including myself) probably are not aware of his personal story. I had high expectations for this film, and now that I've seen it I agree that The Theory of Everything deserves all the Oscars attention it has been getting.This is a wonderfully acted film by both Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The movie covers Hawking's life from the 60's to the early 00's, so you get to see the disease progressively get worse. The way Redmayne shows the gradual effects over time was flawless. I'm not sure how he got his body and face to contort so accurately, but there were times where it felt like the real Stephen Hawking himself was on screen. The real brilliance of Redmayne's performance was not how he looked, but how he was able to emote through the limited range of movement and speech. He was able to show the vulnerability and the humor of Hawking convincingly even in the later stages of the disease. Felicity Jones' performance as Jane Hawking was crucial because her relationship with Stephen Hawking was the emotional crux for the entire film. Felicity Jones absolutely delivered, the emotional transformation that Jones' character goes through is just as impressive as Redmayne's physical change.On the top of the acting caliber, I liked how the script handled the characters. After being together for decades, of course the disease starts to affect the marriage. The script and the director could've easily made the relationship problems seem one-sided, painting one of the two as being wrong. Instead the film treats Stephen and Jane Hawking as real human beings. A couple that was naive and flawed as any young couples are. Both are neither guilty nor innocent, but make very understandable and human mistakes. This ultimately made the film delightfully relatable and emotionally impactful. I have to mention how beautiful the soundtrack for the film was. Instantly from the opening scene the evocative music brought goosebumps to my skin. I have loved Johann Johannsson's music in the past and this might be some of his best work yet. I am glad he is getting the recognition he deserves.All in all, I highly recommend The Theory of Everything. Some people are bothered that it is not a completely accurate story, to those people may I mention that Stephen Hawking himself has said it's 'broadly true' and reacted positively overall. So the film also got a seal of approval from Hawking. In the end movies are meant for entertainment and not a high-school textbook. In that sense not only was The Theory of Everything entertaining, it was a deeply moving.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,1,1,19 January 2015
22 Jump Street," Bromantic comedy of the year
","Quickie Review:After a successful undercover drug bust operation in high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) get their next big assignment. Now in the sequel 22 Jump Street, as Ice Cube so eloquently put it, these 'two sons of b***hes are going to college.' As the cop duo take on yet another drug ring, they go through multitude of ridiculous yet hilarious situations. In doing so, there are some formulaic traps that the movie does fall into. Despite that, it is just an incredible ride with non-stop laughter and great comedic chemistry between the lead actors. This is a must-see for fans of 21 Jump Street and people who generally like to laugh.Full Review:The original movie, 21 Jump Street, was a surprise hit back in 2012. It was a movie filled with many belly aching moments of laughter. For that reason, of all the comedies of 2014 this sequel may be the most anticipated, at least it was for me. So the question is: does it deliver on the high expectations? And the answer is: oh hell yes it does.There is one absolute in this franchise that no one will dispute, the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. Then when they do go about their shenanigans, numerous twists and turns occur that are fun to watch unfold, to hilarious effect. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity. The combination of the comedic duo and the intelligent humor work flawlessly, making the flick all the more entertaining. As great as the two leads are with their comedic timing, I need to especially mention Ice Cube. I won't spoil anything of course, but there are points in this movie where Ice Cube actually steals the scenes he is in. I'd pay the full movie ticket price just to see that dynamic between Ice Cube and the two leads. It is that good.I do recognize there are some faults with 22 Jump Street. It did stick with the philosophy of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' In that sense, the general story plot is pretty much the same as the original movie. 22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. Still, I think this is something that you can easily look past because of how enjoyable the movie is.The one purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills that requirement consistently throughout the movie. By throughout the movie, I mean even during the credits. Your cheeks will have a good exercise, because mine were in pain with all the laughing. It is well worth your time and money, so don't miss out on this one. If they keep this up I will be there even at 1022 Jump Street.",8,79,135,7 June 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man
","Quickie Review:In this sequel Spider-Man struggles between his superhero obligations and desires as Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield). Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a lonely electrician turns into Electro following a freak accident, and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) in pursuit of curing himself of a disease turns himself into the infamous Green Goblin. Spider-Man now confronts far superior foes that not only threaten his city but also the ones he loves. This sequel has many things right such as Andrew Garfield's embodiment of Spider-Man, his interactions with the supporting cast, the action packed fight sequences, etc. Despite all the positives, the focus on multiple villains prevents this film from being one of the best superhero movies to just being a good movie.Full Review:There is a lot to love about this movie that I thought was done better than all other Spider-Man films before. The very first shot of the film is Spider-Man web slinging through New York City, and you can see how exhilarating it is to fly and swing like him between skyscrapers (especially in 3D). That plays into the action scenes as well, which are very well choreographed and gorgeous to see. The character interactions between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and the rest of the characters such as Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and Aunt May (Sally Field), are very natural and truly heartfelt. Credit for that should also be given to director Marc Webb, as he has always been great at showcasing these personal interactions in all his movies. The one thing that nobody will argue is that Andrew Garfield has solidified himself as the definitive Spider-Man and Peter Parker in this film. From his quick wit, movement, and teasing of the villains, to even small things like getting excited by a little kid's science project, it is just perfect. He doesn't just portray the character, he embodies it. Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man.Yes, there is a lot to love, but the few things that did irked me, I really did hate. The brunt of that hate goes towards the use of multiple villains. The marketing for this film shows that there are three villains Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan). The reason all these villains are placed there is simple: setup for the next films of the franchise. Rhino is literally there for 3 mins, you have seen all his scenes in the trailers. Same goes for Green Goblin, as he is just shoehorned into a fight scene. So that leaves Electro as the main villain of the movie, one of the most uninteresting one-dimensional villains in comic book movie history. I can't blame Jamie Foxx for that because that is what the character is even in the comic books, someone who has been neglected his whole life and just wants to feel needed and loved. What I would have liked is to completely remove Electro and just focus on Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. As I mentioned before Harry and Peter have great chemistry and if their friendship and differences was fleshed out more, it would have made for a more compelling villain. Honestly, the Green Goblin as he is in this movie, even with his little screen time, had more gravity and significance than the main villain Electro.I know I went on bit of a rant on the villains, but it is just something I need to address. I don't use the word 'love' lightly, so when I say there are things that I loved about this movie I truly mean it is excellent. It is because of these positives that I recommend watching this movie. You will have an enjoyable time despite some of the things that were disappointing.",7,0,8,29 April 2014
Ex Machina," Engaging and thought provoking
","Quickie Review:Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is an employee at a tech company who is invited by the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), for an undisclosed project. When Caleb arrives at Nathan's estate he finds out that he will be conducting a series of experiments. These are no ordinary tests, he is there to examine the human nature of an A.I. named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ex Machina, is a grounded sci-fi movie exploring the idea of what makes someone or in this case something, human. While this is not an untouched theme in cinema, the movie blends sci-fi with thriller elements that will keep you constantly on edge. The small cast and close proximity provided a great environment to raise the related philosophical and psychological questions in a deeply engaging manner.Full Review:Ex Machina, was one of my highly anticipated movies of the year. I have said so in the past that films about A.I. tend to go over the top with its scope. However, here we have a movie that pulls back and concentrates on the characters involved, and they are the best part about the movie.With such a small cast of just three it was critical that their on- screen performance carried the movie, and it did. Oscar Isaac was great as the eccentric billionaire genius. One moment he is a friendly outgoing guy, quite often making us laugh at his unconventional behavior. Yet the next moment you can't trust him because you feel like he is hiding something from you. Domhnall Gleeson, was our window into this story, he mirrors what we as the audience feel from beginning to the end. The excitement, intrigue, doubt, fear, all these range of emotions are naturally conveyed by Gleeson. As a result you have great frame of reference to experience the character interactions. The biggest surprise for me though was Alicia Vikander. I don't think anyone recognizes her but she should be getting more attention after this role. She walks that delicate line between human and robot effortlessly. She feels like a real human but subtle things like the way her eyes moves, her head tilts, all that add to the almost human characteristics of Ava.What makes Ex Machina unique is the scaled down scope of the film. This is not a bombastic action sci-fi, it is more a sci-fi thriller. A character driven story with brilliant performances that always makes you question the motives of everyone. I found myself repeatedly questioning who is the one actually being manipulated. Nathan, Caleb, Ava? There is a sense of unpredictability because up until the end I couldn't give you a straight answer. The excellent pacing with well written and executed dialog, had me hooked without ever feeling like a single moment was wasted. If there is one complaint, some may find the ending a little unsatisfying. Obviously I won't be ruining the ending for you. Still I'd like to argue that considering the tone and scale of the movie, having any other ending would have felt out of place.If you are looking for a smart, thought provoking, character driven sci-fi, this is the perfect movie. The cast is of excellent caliber, with Alicia Vikander delivering an impressive A.I. performance. Additionally the gripping plot in an intimate setting helped intensify the thriller aspect of the film. Ex Machina is really worth the watch.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,5,15,20 April 2015
Big Hero 6," Disney meets Marvel
","Quickie Review:Hiro is a science prodigy inspired by his brother Tadashi to build and contribute great new technologies to society. After a tragic incident involving Tadashi, his creation Baymax, an inflatable robot does all it can to help Hiro during this difficult time. Soon a new threat linked to the accident arrives in the city of San Fransokyo, forcing Hiro and his friends to create their own superhero team. With Tangled, Wreck- It Ralph, and Frozen, Disney is going through a renaissance in their animation department. Big Hero 6 is yet another solid addition to their roster. Although the premise is not original in its simplest form, the characters and the adorable Baymax make this adventure worth experiencing.Full Review:With such an impressive streak I expected Disney to deliver at the very least a good film. In terms of the story it was very predictable. However, the colorful characters and their personalities is what saved this movie. Most of all Baymax was awesome!Baymax may be the cutest robot in animation since Wall-E. He experiences the world and the people in it with a childlike innocence. He steals each and every scene he is in. He may be huggable but when he needs to throw down he is a formidable opponent to go up against. Though he might not necessarily realize his fighting potential. The 3D animation is gorgeous, blending western and eastern cultures to create the beautiful San Fransokyo. The action in the movie could be on par with the current generation of superhero movies. Big Hero 6 is like a mini animated Avengers, but each of them is a nerd using their scientific expertise to become heroes. The movie is not just an action thrill ride but an emotional one as well. You would think majority of the movie would be filled with light-hearted humor, and it is. Still there is a moment where the movie goes much darker than I had anticipated. I liked that the filmmakers didn't hold back on the dark tone because it made the following emotional scenes much more effective.Although I had fun with the film, there are few things that I wish was done a little better. The masked villain is completely obvious. I knew who it was the instant he showed up on screen. Even Scooby Doo and the gang would request investigating the identity to be a little more challenging. So the intrigue and motive behind the mask is not as impactive as it could have been. The rest of the supporting cast and team members are fun but they aren't given much screen time with Hiro. It would have been nice if we had seen more of their relationship together rather than it being sum up in a 3 min montage.In the end Big Hero 6 is a heart-warming tale about how far we are willing to go for our family whether it be by blood, friendship, or in this case even electric circuitry in a giant balloon. This movie is a clear indication that Disney has not lost its momentum and I cannot wait to see what else they have in store for us.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,35,53,17 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," In Marvel We Trust
","Quickie Review:Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) comes into possession of a mysterious orb that the ruthless Ronan the Accuser is seeking out. A bounty is placed on Quill, resulting in him crossing paths with Gamora (Zoe Saldana) an assassin, Drax (Dave Bautista) a brute, Groot (Vin Diesel) a walking tree and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) a talking raccoon. Their adventures together strengthen the bonds amongst them and they go on to form the most bizarre team, Guardians of the Galaxy. The biggest risk Marvel Studios has taken since even conceptualizing their cinematic universe is helmed by the director James Gunn, who couldn't be more perfect for the job. This is by the far one of the most unique comic book movies that has ever graced the silver screens. With incredible visuals, soundtrack, comedy, and characters, this is a thrill ride that is relentlessly awesome and entertaining. An experience that should not be missed.Full Review:To call this movie a risk back in 2012 because of the non-existent popularity, is putting it lightly. Now it's finally released in 2014 and this risk has paid off big time thanks to its distinctive take on the comic book genre.The best thing about this movie is the Guardians team. Every single one of them is memorable, and relevant to the team and the story. They are not just likable, they are lovable! Star-Lord is bound to become to a classic cinematic hero in the future. The best way I could describe him is that he is the love child of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, and I mean that without exaggeration. Gamora is a great rich and complex character. You can tell there is lot more to her that we don't know, but enough information is given to us that she is fully fleshed out. Drax was a surprise to me because Dave Bautista is not exactly the best actor, but I thought he delivered on the physicality and the deadpan humor of the character effectively. Ah Groot, it is astonishing how this character is better-rounded than most other characters in Hollywood movies, even with his limited vocabulary rivaled only by Hodor of Game of Thrones. Still, the one that stole the show, Rocket Raccoon! Who knew so much badassery can be contained in a talking raccoon? More importantly there is actually an emotional depth behind this gun-toting, wisecracking creature.Beyond the characters, what made this movie work is the overall tone and atmosphere. Again if I used another analogy, Guardians of the Galaxy is like Star Wars on acid (don't do drugs kids). It's visually bright, colorful and absolutely stunning. The movie doesn't bog itself down with overly dramatic brooding moments. In fact, even during the direst of situations comedic moments would sneak through and catch you off-guard, but you'll be genuinely laughing out loud. I think I may have missed some jokes because I was still laughing at something funny that happened previously. The soundtrack, wow, I loved the use of retro classics. It gave the movie its own character and flair.The only problem I have is with Ronan. Once again Guardians of the Galaxy has fell into the Marvel trap of weak villains (excluding Loki and Winter Soldier of course). He is just means to give the story a conflict. There is nothing more beyond the fact that he is evil because well he is evil.So if you can't tell already, I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy. It surpassed all my high expectations. This has already been an amazing year for blockbusters and Marvel delivered us on yet another gem (yes horrible pun intended). So don't miss out on the most unique comic book movie ever that is also one of Marvel Studio's best.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,1,4,15 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Cumberbatch's greatest
","Quickie Review:In the midst of WWII Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant British mathematician, along with his colleagues attempt to break the Enigma code. As Turing tries to uncover Nazi secrets, he must keep his own secrets hidden in a world that does not accept his personal desires. The Imitation Game, is a deeply moving story about the people behind the scenes of a war. The great cast is vastly overshadowed by the performance given by Benedict Cumberbatch, possibly his best so far. This is a beautifully directed, written, scored, and acted film that should not be missed. It is worth all the awards buzz it has been getting.Full Review:Last time I heard of Alan Turing was a brief mention in a documentary about secret historic scientific research, which in this case is the Enigma machine decoder. I know of his contribution to the war effort and science, but as for the man himself I know very little. The fact that The Imitation Game concentrates on the man rather than the machine is what makes it all the more interesting.By far the greatest strength of the movie is Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing. At this point does it really come as surprise that his acting is good in a movie? No, probably not. But is he exceptional beyond his norm? Most definitely yes. Turing was not exactly a likable person, he had problems communicating, often being mistaken for being rude or insensitive. Cumberbatch captures these mannerisms of Turing perfectly. He gets us to figure out what he is trying to say or mean, much the same way he is figuring out the meaning of the Enigma code. This makes it more engaging for us to watch the conversations of the characters unfold. Of course a well written dialog doesn't hurt in that aspect as well. The rest of the cast were also a great addition, especially Keira Kightley who brought a lot heart to her character. The scenes with her and Cumberbatch were some of the more emotionally impactful scenes in the film.Many would think of the battles fought by soldiers with guns when talking about a WWII movie. Even just recently we had a release called Fury. However, in The Imitation Game it's refreshing to see the contributions made by the people behind desks, back in their homes, working daily to help stop the war early. We get to see the failures, the triumphs, the burden of responsibility they bear, and the moral issues they must confront. It's fair to say that these efforts mostly go unnoticed by the public. So I appreciate that the movie sheds some light on this side of WWII. More importantly, I appreciate that the movie does not shy away from exploring the hardships Turing had to go through to hide his homosexuality. The contrast between how the LGBT are viewed back then compared to now is striking. The way that part of the story was handled really added to one of the most poignant endings to a film in recent memory.Sure I didn't mention the problems of the movie, but ultimately the negatives are not prominent enough to detract you from a beautiful story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone really, because I suspect not many people in the mainstream know of Alan Turing. It's important to see how this one person affected the world. 'Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.'Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,3,8,6 January 2015
Jurassic World," Sequel the classic deserved
","Quickie Review:After the events of Jurassic Park, 22-years ago, Isla Nublar now hosts the original vision of a functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World. To keep the public interest and raise the visitor rates, the corporation engineer a new breed of dinosaur, Indominus Rex (I-Rex). Meddling with genetic research once again puts the park and people in danger when the I-Rex breaks loose. Jurassic World while not living up to the Spielberg's classic, stands strong on its own merits. The new I-Rex is a great new addition to the roster of scary dinosaurs and the CGI is very well done. There are some sub- plots that don't fit well, but the overall story is a thrill ride with both horror and action. Jurassic World is a great summer- blockbuster monster fun.Full Review:While I was looking forward to Jurassic World, the trailers left me only cautiously optimistic. I had quite a few doubts about the movie: genetic splicing of different dinosaur species, trained raptors, over-reliance on CGI. It all seemed too different from Jurassic Park. After watching the movie all my apprehensions were thrown out the window because different is exactly what Jurassic World needed.Let's start with the star/villain of the movie, I-Rex. The perfect word to describe her is terrifying. The sheer size of her in every aspect, jaw, feet, claws, if you saw her running towards you, to quote the movie 'The kids? This will give their parents nightmares.' Which is perfect! Because that's an essential part of what Jurassic Park was, a horror. It's not just the physicality of the dinosaur but the way she moves, thinks, and takes advantage of her spliced nature that added a lot to her being an insurmountable threat. A lot of the dinosaurs were CGI even for close-ups but it never pulled me out of the movie. The computer visual effects were very well polished, and I am saying that as a huge fan of practical effects where possible. In fact, the dinosaur designs were so well done I'd say they had more personality than most human characters in other movies.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were also very good in the movie. As much I loved Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy as Star- Lord, I didn't want him to play the same character again. Luckily he doesn't and still is a badass. He showed that with the way he interacted with the raptors and the way he'd improvise to get out of a difficult situation. I'd like to reassure you that the way the raptors are trained makes complete sense in the context of the movie. They are still dangerous animals, not completely tamed, so their scenes with Pratt hold a lot of tension. Pratt and the rest of the cast including the kids Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are not completely humourless. There are some good jokes here and there that keep the movie from becoming completely dreary.There are few small issues I do have with the movie but the subplots in particular is what bothered me the most. This is the second time in two weeks there is a movie with a divorce subplot. But the way it is handled in Jurassic World is even worse because it never really affects the story or the characters significantly. There are also other story arcs that are not executed well and so feel out of place. I can't say much else without spoiling the movie but if these subplots were trimmed off, Jurassic World may have been a more well- rounded film.I have to say I really enjoyed my time with Jurassic World. Like for many others Jurassic Park means a lot to me, it's the first Hollywood movie I remember from my childhood. Director Colin Trevorrow did an excellent job in honouring the classic while introducing us to something new. When you watch the movie, you can tell this was a movie made by a fan (a very talented one too) for the fans. By the end of the movie I was applauding it. So if you have your doubts like I did, go watch it, because I'm sure it'll surprise you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,12,30,16 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Everything you wanted it to be
","Quickie Review:The Avengers are now a fully functioning team stopping other groups who have nefarious agendas. On one of their missions, Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) comes across a dormant peacekeeping program. When activated the program named Ultron (James Spader) sees only one solution to achieve peace, human extinction. One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, Avengers: Age of Ultron has a lot to live up to, and it achieves it in spades. This is not a shallow action film, it is a direct sequel to the first Avengers continuing the story of the team and their relationships. Ultron posed a formidable threat to our heroes, and he did it with confidence and attitude. Avengers AOU is an action-packed, funny, geek out inducing, and most importantly an all-out fun movie that you will want to see multiple times.Full Review:I've been looking forward to this movie not for days, weeks, or months. No, I've been waiting for years. So much so that I went for the midnight premiere on a working day. My expectations were sky- high and wow I left the cinema ecstatic and with a giant smile on my face.Right from the start we kick off with an amazing action scene showing the whole Avengers team taking on the bad guys. I was covered in nerd goosebumps. It shouldn't be a surprise that all the action sequences were top notch. In fact, they are better than the first Avengers because you get to see more of their teamwork. It is exciting to see how they communicate and improvise off of each other's tools and skills. As amazing as these scenes were, the strange thing is they weren't even the best parts of the movie. What I enjoyed the most was the banter between all the characters. The witty dialog had me laughing countless times. I think I can safely say, this was the funniest Marvel movie so far. Yes Avengers AOU is also the darkest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but director Joss Whedon always found a way to not let that compromise the fun. A large part of that had to do with the way the characters were handled.These are not the same heroes we knew from Avengers, they have changed, there are new relationships and priorities. All of that brought a new dynamic within the team we hadn't seen before. Everyone, including the new additions such as Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) get their fair share of screen time to shine. Even, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was finally shown as a badass. He was integral to keeping the team together when things were at their worst. Now let's talk about the guy who was making Avengers' day worse, Ultron. In the trailers he is shown as a menacing villain with an imposing presence, and that is true physically but his personality was more than that. In many ways he had more base human traits than you might expect: fear, jealousy, anger, and most surprisingly a great sense of humor. He had a great cocky attitude about everything he did, which was a dimension to the character that I didn't anticipate but fit really into the tone of the movie.There is so much more I want to talk about but I want you to experience it all yourself. The vastly overwhelming positives drown out any 'complaints' I have. Seriously there were moments I couldn't contain myself from cheering and I was not alone in that. So many times the cinema burst into joyous laughter and thunderous applause. Avengers AOU is everything I wanted it to be, more fun, more action, more epicness that make even the most casual viewer's inner nerd come out of the cinema drooling for more.P.S. There is only one mid-credits scene. Once you see that scene you can leave the cinema knowing you are not missing anything.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,18,39,22 April 2015
Selma," The nightmare before the dream
","Quickie Review:Selma chronicles a crucial moment in Martin Luther King's campaign for equal voting rights. In a time when civil rights movement was gaining momentum, M.L.K. still had many obstacles to overcome, both personally and politically. Despite the opposition that resulted in innocent casualties, King leads the march from Selma to Montgomery that would go on to become a significant victory for civil rights. David Oyelowo excellent portrayal of M.L.K. brings us the relatable human behind the icon and leader for peace. Selma is a deeply engaging biopic showing both behind the scenes of the movement and the burden of responsibility that M.L.K carried as a leader. This is a film that does great justice in depicting a vital moment in American history.Full Review:Who hasn't heard of Martin Luther King? Everyone has heard of him. He led the ambitious peaceful protests to give every American citizen the right to vote, regardless of their skin color. However, I wouldn't be surprised if many of you didn't know much about the man himself. I certainly don't and that's why I had to see this movie.In history class we have all learned about the revolutionary leaders such as Gandhi, Mandela, and M.L.K. We know of all the freedom fighting movements they led in their countries and the seemingly unsurmountable obstacles they had to face. So we easily start seeing them as being more than human without any weakness or breaking point. The greatest strength of this movie is David Oyelowo because he showed us the vulnerability of M.L.K. Just in his silence he communicates the overwhelming doubts he had about his involvement. It wasn't only his life at risk, but also the lives of his family and his supporters. I liked seeing this side of him because it helped to understand his motivation to continue his campaign. Oyelowo portrays M.L.K. as a relatable human being with very real fears, but also his almost superhuman nature in the way he picks himself up and faces the threats head on.The approach to biopic is rather unorthodox for Selma, when compared to others out there. It doesn't tell the whole life story of M.L.K. from birth to death. Instead it concentrates on a 2-3 month period during the civil rights movement. By concentrating on this singular event of the Selma march it refines the storytelling and provides us with a concise, well-paced flow to the movie. I should also mention the depiction of the racial violence in this film. It was definitely graphic, at times difficult to watch. Even when considering setting of the time I was left speechless. So if you are sensitive to that you've been warned. Still it was the extreme reality that thousands of people had to face every day. Hence I appreciate that the director did not hold back on showing the horrible atrocities at its most violent.Filming wise, Selma is well directed and brilliantly acted. However, bearing in mind the historical significance of the events covered, this movie needed to be more than well-filmed, and it absolutely is. This is an important film to watch to understand the man behind the movement, and by choosing to showcase the culmination of King's work, the Selma march, there is not a single wasted moment.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,5,9,22 February 2015
Jersey Boys," Musically delightful, everything else meh
","Quickie Review:From director Clint Eastwood, comes the cinematic adaption of the Broadway musical, Jersey Boys. The story is based on the real lives of the rock and roll hall of famers, The Four Seasons. The film is about the band's rise to fame and the speed bumps that they face along the way. With a talented director and some of the cast from the actual Broadway musical who know the material better than anyone else, this had the potential to be a great musical. The music is very catchy and wonderfully performed, also the era in which it is set is well realized. While the musical aspect is great, the rest of the movie falls apart due to a poorly structured and executed storytelling.Full Review:Despite not knowing much about The Four Seasons, I usually quite enjoy life stories of famous past artists and their struggles along the way. So considering this was a popular and successful musical, being directed by a legend in Hollywood, Clint Eastwood, I was quite intrigued. In the beginning I saw some promise, but as the movie went on I felt my interest wane.This is after all a musical, so the one thing that has to be great is the music, and thankfully it is. As I mentioned the songs are indeed catchy. I never listened to The Four Seasons, and I don't carry that genre of music on my phone to listen to on the road. And yet I really enjoyed all the songs to the point I want to check out more of the band's discography. So the credit goes to the actors for their amazing voices (and of course The Four Seasons for actually making the songs originally). On the other hand the acting style of the cast felt out of place. Some of them come directly from Broadway, and that is clearly seen in their performance, because everything is very exaggerated. That style is perfect and very much needed for on-stage, but on-screen the acting needs to be more subtle. So there are points where it feels like the cast is over-acting, which can get distracting.The main problem with the movie is the structure of the story. There are events and situations that occur very abruptly. The reason for this is because there is no coherence in the time-line of the movie. You don't know whether 5 months or 5 years have passed between scenes, there are no visual cues. So for example, there might be some argument that may break out as a result of tension building up over 10 years. But because you don't see that build up at all, much less know that 10 years passed in just 3 scenes, the eventual fight breaking out feels like it came out of nowhere. This completely took me out of the movie several times because to me the reactions of the characters made no sense without the much needed proper context. There are times where a character breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience. This would've been useful for filling in those gaps, but instead is used to state some obvious things that are happening or about to happen.In the end, I can't say that I enjoyed the movie. The unorganized flow of the story can get the motives of the characters confusing. This completely removes any emotional effect of some critical scenes. As a result you have little care for what's going on. Ultimately this is a slow and boring movie with some good music. I would only recommend this to fans of The Four Seasons, with caution though. At least Jersey Boys got me exposed to some good oldies music **off to Spotify**.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",5,7,31,20 June 2014
Steve Jobs," Think Different
","Quickie Review:Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), the founder and CEO of Apple is known around the world for his passion and drive to further technology. His success in the industry was not a smooth journey, and came with a lot of personal and professional sacrifices. The man behind some of the biggest technology shifts is revealed with each of the three critical product unveils. Steve Jobs, is no ordinary biographical film. This is not the story of his life, but about the man and why he sees the world and people the way he does. The performances are flawless and nuanced, with the incredible script from Aaron Sorkin flowing the narrative without a moment wasted. Sure to get some award considerations, this is one that should not be missed.Full Review:Before the movie even was in production there were multiple highly talented actors involved in the project at one point or another. The likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, just to name a few. It is hard not to wonder how great is the script that all these actors and actresses want to be cast. After watching the film it is clear to me why there was so much intrigue.In the end, we got a different cast but in no way were they a compromise. Michael Fassbender fully embodied what the public has come to know about Steve Jobs. He is smart, cold, calculating, and outright cruel sometimes. Yet what Fassbender did here was to give us the answer the question: why? There is reason behind his actions, and watching Fassbender masterfully explore those reasons was completely fascinating. You may not agree with the man, but you will come to understand him. That was the nuance I was expecting to see, and it was delivered. Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman was a great addition in the movie. She was the counter balance to Steve Jobs. Winslet was the perfect companion to Fassbender's performance, drawing out more of Jobs' thought process. This film is not just about Jobs but also his relation with his daughter Lisa. We see Lisa at three different ages, and so three different actresses, but all of them fit into the narrative, and don't feel like they are just a tool to develop Jobs' character. This may have to do with the fact these child actresses were well-directed and so their interactions with Fassbender felt genuine. Another notable addition to the cast was Jeff Daniels as John Sculley. Daniels and Fassbender share the screens together multiple times, but the rising tension in their relationship is palpable, particularly in one scene that I'll come back to in a moment (no spoilers).None of the cast would matter if it weren't for the Aaron Sorkin's script and Danny Boyles' direction. The film is structured into three parts, each a couple of hours before a major product unveiling. So a lot of major interactions occur in a short amount of time with all the important people in Jobs' life. This will seem extremely coincidental, but if you can get past that it actually serves the narrative much better. We are no longer anchored to the chronological storytelling of every other biographical film ever made. Instead the story is focused, clear, and concise, keeping the pacing consistent in a purely dialogue driven film. That brings me back to the scene between Daniels and Fassbender because it was the impeccable example of how well the dialogue was written. I was biting my nails (bad habit I know) during a scene of just two people talking!If I had any complain it'd be that the unique structure, while resulting in an interesting way of storytelling, does hinder the director from exploring the gaps in between. Nevertheless, the performances are so captivating and the dialogues so engaging that I was fully invested into the moment. I highly recommend this film.",8,0,1,23 December 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Biggest pleasant surprise
","Quickie Review:After an alien invasion, all of humanity unite together to fight a losing war. Cage (Tom Cruise), a rookie soldier, unknowingly gains the ability to relive the last day of his life every time he dies. With the help of a seasoned soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt) and his new found ability, Cage must find a way to win this war. Despite the generic alien-war synopsis, Edge of Tomorrow delivers an incredibly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi, with great humor. This is one of the best sci-fi action movies in a long time. You will no doubt leave the cinema very satisfied.Full Review:When the first trailers were released, Edge of Tomorrow felt like yet another unoriginal movie with a brush of CGI to hide its faults and make it look pretty. I will admit, I should not have been so shallow, because Edge of Tomorrow is also pretty on the inside pretty freaking awesome.The actors Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt were incredible to watch. Cruise has solidified himself as an action super-star over the years, and in this film you continue to see his dedication to every stunt and action scene. Emily Blunt does a great job portraying a skilled badass soldier as Rita Vrataski, a.k.a. Full Metal Bitch (admit it, that's a badass name). They both have very convincing character development and a great on-screen chemistry together.The story involves Cage gaining the time-reset ability from the aliens, and how he uses it. This plot device does mean that some scenes are repeated to a certain extent. However, at no point did the repeated scenes feel repetitious. This is because there is always a change that is introduced, but more importantly it is because of the humor in this movie. Of all the surprises, that has to be the biggest one. The movie, especially the first half, is genuinely funny and that helps keep things engaging. It is a good balance to have this humor against the bleakness of the serious setting. As for the action, it is exhilarating to watch. The clunky yet powerful exoskeletons the humans wear make for some cool fight scenes. The CGI is seamlessly rendered in every scene and is immediately impactful. The best part of the action scenes are the aliens themselves, with some very unique creature designs. Sci-fi elements of how the aliens function is well realized. Additionally to the designs, their movements are actually terrifyingly awesome. They move in a very chaotic and erratic manner, which makes fighting these aliens all the more intense.Edge of Tomorrow has all the elements of a fun summer blockbuster. It is action-packed, funny, has great memorable characters, and more. Some story elements may not be very original, but the way all the pieces come together is what makes it so great. This is a truly gripping movie from beginning to the end. I highly recommend checking it out.",8,1,3,29 May 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Aca-great
","Quickie Review:The a cappella group Barden Bellas fall from grace after a humiliating performance at the Lincoln Centre. As a result they are disqualified from participating in collegiate competitions. Now they must redeem themselves and regain their right to perform by winning the international a cappella competition. Pitch Perfect 2 like the first film brings back a lot of the colourful characters with great comedic chemistry. The sequel remains formulaic, story structure is practically the same as the first. Nevertheless, the movie delivers in the humour and the characters are so likable that you have fun with their antics. This is a worthy sequel for the fans and they will be thoroughly entertained.Full Review:It took me a while to watch the first Pitch Perfect because admittedly I scoffed it off as some singing version of Step-Up. Afterwards due to all the good buzz and word-of-mouth I eventually gave it a shot and ended up really liking it. So I was looking forward to Pitch Perfect 2.The great thing about the movie is the cast, mainly the chemistry between Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Brittany Snow. Of course everyone has their funny moments but it is these three that are carrying the movie forward. Each of them have their own story arcs that led to some hilarious moments. For instance Anna Kendrick's character Beca is interning at a music studio run by one of my favourite comedians Keegan-Michael Key. His commitment to the role of a big time egotistical producer was hysterical. Rebel Wilson has a very unconventional love story in this film, which perfectly suits her sense of humour. Wilson was on fire with joke after joke, all of them had me laughing out loud or at the very least made me chuckle. The rest of the cast all have their unique funny quirks that could've gotten annoying if overused. Luckily that situation was prevented with a well- balanced use of the supporting cast.What prevents Pitch Perfect 2 from being exceptional is that it has the same story structure of the first movie: embarrassing moment, risk of never being taken seriously, bad major performance, team building moment, and then the final competition. This is not a spoiler, you will realize this formula from numerous other competition driven plots. It doesn't ruin the movie but I would have liked to have seen the characters progress beyond their lives in college. They do attempt that with Kendrick's story arc but in the end it's rather inconsequential. Also there are segments in the middle that feel repetitious in conveying that the team isn't functioning as well as it used. So there were moments in the movie that could've been cut out to make it more concise.It is easy to dismiss Pitch Perfect 2 as some random generic chick flick (I am pointing at you macho man who thinks this franchise is a waste of time). I even convinced two of my friends to check out the first film before going into watch Pitch Perfect 2. Sure we felt a little out of place as three guys in a cinema largely filled with a female audience, but we had a really good time. If you are fan of the first one, this is obviously a must-watch and deservedly so. However, if you aren't a fan then this movie will not convert you into one because it is more of the same.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,6,12,18 May 2015
Whiplash," Whiplash – Captivating reach for perfection
","Full Review:Andrew (Miles Teller) is a young and talented drummer enrolled in one of the best music colleges. He is mentored by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an absolute perfectionist who believes there is no line that can be crossed when trying to bring out the greatness in a student. The film follows Andrew as he is consumed and abused by Fletcher to the absolute limits, hoping to be one of the greats. Whiplash is a psychological battle between individuals that is tense at every palm sweating second of the movie. You will be completely captivated by the riveting performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, who show an acting side that we have never seen from them. This is not an easy movie to watch for some disturbing decisions made by the characters, but it is oh so rewarding to experience!Quickie Review:For me, Miles Teller for a long time was just some comedy actor. After watching another movie of his The Spectacular Now, I saw a potential in him to be more than that. So that is the reason I wanted to see Whiplash, but he simply blew me away more than I had expected. Equally J.K. Simmons' character is still haunting me after watching the movie.The most enticing and attention grabbing moments were when Andrew and Fletcher were in a scene together. It is a constant back-and- forth head butting of tolerance for each other. Andrew can be disobedient towards his mentor, and meanwhile Fletcher would be physically and verbally abusive. Seeing how they react to certain situations sometimes made my jaw drop and leave me speechless. There were moments where I'd repeatedly think 'why, WHY? Why is he doing this?' as if they are real people. I know they are just some characters on a screen but because of the strong on-screen chemistry (as stressful as it was), I felt compelled to react.This brings me to the stellar acting by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons, without whom Whiplash wouldn't be the gem that it is. I loved seeing the absolute dedication Teller showed through his character. So much so that in some scenes Teller is in actual physical pain that his character would be experiencing. Watching the drive for greatness destroy his other aspects of life and life itself felt very real and palpable. Many of you might know Simmons for playing J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-man movies, take that character make him more short-tempered, get rid of the lovable quality, and un-censor everything that comes out of his mouth, that's Fletcher (scary I know). One quote from the movie perfectly sums him up, Fletcher says 'There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'' It can't be any clearer how much he despises anything less than perfect. Well Simmons, if I were to ever meet you, I'd say you were perfect.This is yet another movie that is not widely released on every major screen. I had to go out of my way to see it in another city. But I have to stress, because of the exceptional acting talent Whiplash is worth going out of your way to experience.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,1,4,16 November 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Delivers only on the title
","Quickie Review:After the events of Desolation of Smaug, the dragon unleashes his wrath upon the people of Laketown. Thorin reclaims his kingdom, but is consumed by an obsession for all the gold under the mountain. Meanwhile, rest of the Middle-earth races turn their envious eyes towards Erebor. Each of them aiming to exploit its riches, leading to an epic battle that will alter the future of Middle-earth. This movie is the epic conclusion to the Hobbit story, and the name is fitting. There is a grand scale to the battle, and the stakes are high. However, it did not quite strike the balance between action and drama. In the end, Battle of Five Armies is a fitting end to the series of movies and is a great cinematic vision, but as a standalone there is much to be desired in the quieter moments.Full Review:I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, sitting through a 12 hour marathon on more than one occasion. So when the Hobbit movie was announced I was excited to return to Middle-earth. Then it was announced that the movie would be split into a trilogy. I really don't like when a story is split, and the problems that come with that decision is most pronounced with The Battle of the Five Armies. Nevertheless I had an enjoyable time watching the movie.When the title is The Battle of the Five Armies, it had better deliver on some epic battles, and it does. It's really interesting to see the motives of each of the armies (for some more in detail than others). Seeing how the battle unfolds, the uneasy alliances, clashing of dwarfs, orcs, goblins, humans, elves certainly had me at awe multiple times. This is a cinematic spectacle that should be experienced on the big screen. Also there was no weak link in the performances, but that is expected by now in the sixth film of this universe.It is strange that I overall liked the film but my positives for the film only include the scale of the battle and the actors. Beyond those two aspects there are actually quite a lot of problems with the movie, and as I mentioned this is all because The Hobbit story has been split into the three films. You already know that all good stories have a beginning, a tension building middle, a climax, and then a resolution. Since The Battle of the Five Armies is the third movie of a singular story, we only get the climax and resolution. This means that the majority of the runtime is spent only on the battle. As beautiful as those scenes were to experience, I must say at one point it all becomes a cacophony of mindless sword slashing. As a result you start to lose any care of what is happening on the screen. I like the scale, just not the length of time spent on it. That leaves the quiet character moments in the movie to pick up the emotional weight to make us care again. Unfortunately these were also too few and far between once the battle starts. Especially if you haven't seen Desolation of Smaug since last year's release, these scenes might be even less effective because the wait between the movies depreciated the natural progression of the character relationships.If I were to judge The Battle of the Five Armies just on its own merits, disregarding the two movies I'd rate it quite low. Yet I will admit that as a conclusion to the trilogy as a whole, this movie does a decent enough job. If you want to get the best out of the film I strongly recommend you to re-watch both An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,2,5,15 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Nanananana Birdman!
","Quickie Review:Riggan (Michael Keaton) was once an iconic movie superhero, Birdman. He desperately attempts to revive his career by adapting, directing, and acting in his own Broadway play. In the days leading up to the opening night not only does he face the doubts brought on by the people in his life, but he also comes to terms with the reality that he is now a has-been, a washed up actor. Birdman is one of the most beautifully directed films of 2014. On top of that the film is brimming with impeccable acting talent, grabbing your attention with every line of the flawless script. Coincidentally, just as Riggan attempts writing, directing, and acting, Birdman achieves this perfect trifecta that delivers a truly unique look into the mind of an actor.Full Review:Once again an Oscar film had a delayed release where I live. I have been aching to see this movie for a long time, even before all the award nominations. Now that I have finally seen it, I can happily say it was well worth the wait.When it comes to casting many people talk about whether the actor is the right fit for the role. A former superhero who is past the prime years of his career... hmm seems oddly familiar Mr. Keaton. Whoever did the casting, give them a bonus because this was a stroke of genius! It is clearly evident that Keaton drew from his own life experience of being Batman of the early 90's. Simultaneously it never felt forced as if we were just watching another version of Michael Keaton. Rather he used that experience to further flesh out the character of Riggan. He is constantly battling the ideas of either pursuing his passion of being an artist or feeding his ego of being a celebrity. Keaton does a great job of presenting this inner turmoil though a dual personality, so it does delve into some strange territory but captivating nonetheless. There is absolutely not a single weak link in the cast, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, even Zach Galifianakis of the Hangover fame brings his best dramatic chops yet. However, the standout from the supporting cast for me has to be Edward Norton. His character is an arrogant and pretentious method actor. He brought this uncertainty in his character's intent that kept both the characters in the film and the audience on their toes.As great as it was to see these actors perform, what blew me away was the cinematography and direction of Iñárritu. The entire film is made to look like a single long take, similar to the iconic Copacabana scene from The Goodfellas, or more recently the opening scene of Gravity. The fact that the film is a series of these seamlessly connected long takes is amazingly ambitious. If done wrong there could've been a plethora of problems ranging from mishandled characters to forced dialog. Instead this creative decision added to the flow and rhythm of the film, continuously building the momentum of the story from one character interaction to another.I can't recommend this film enough. It is almost perfect in every aspect of filmmaking, while at the same time daring to try new styles to great effect. It's not just a film, it's a cinematic experience. Watching the solid cast members work off each other is a delight. Once again, this a movie that deserves all the nominations it has been getting, and I know it's my frontrunner for some of the categories.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",9,2,9,26 January 2015
The Water Diviner," Crowe's solid directorial debut
","Quickie Review:After the death of his three sons in the WWI Battle of Gallipoli, devastated by the loss Connor's (Russell Crowe) wife takes her own life. To fulfill her last wish, Connor travels to Turkey to return their sons' bodies back to Australia, their home. The Water Diviner is both well-acted and filmed. The movie fully develops its character while fairly showing the perspectives from both sides affected by the war. It is not without flaws in that it occasionally adds melodrama to the war drama. Still as a whole this is a solid directorial debut by Russell Crowe.Full Review:To be honest, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I rarely heard people talk about it and I only found out this movie even existed about a month or so ago. Nevertheless, I went in curious to see what Russell Crowe delivers as a director and mostly I liked what he achieved.The performances in The Water Diviner are really good. That's not surprising from the talented Russell Crowe but Olga Kurylenko did some of her best work here as well. I always thought Kurylenko was a serviceable actress but in this movie she actually shows some range. Asides from the performances, I appreciated the different perspectives that were shown from the people involved in the war. War dramas can at times fall into the trap of painting the different sides black or white. Fortunately The Water Diviner recognizes and presents the fact that both sides have their guilty executioners and innocent victims just caught in the middle of a senseless war. So the delicate handling of such a subject matter should be commended. Also the cinematography of the movie was quite impressive, capturing the life and landscape of the early 1900s Turkey.What hindered the movie from being great for me were the moments where the movie got a bit too melodramatic. I can't say much without revealing some of the plot points but these were scenes that clearly Crowe wanted the audience to be emotionally affected. However, the scenes are repeated so often or prolonged for so long that they started to lose their effect on me and felt like I was being begged to shed a tear. On top of that, all too often there are so many coincidences, the movie almost becomes a fantasy rather than a serious war drama. These series of coincidences solve many of the problems that Crowe's character faced, wrapping up in a nice little bow. It diminishes any sense of struggle and as a result I ended up being less invested whenever the characters were in danger.All in all The Water Diviner is a good movie. I just wish the movie wasn't pandering to our emotions and instead let the story unfold more organically. Nevertheless, considering this is the first feature length film as a director for Russell Crowe I am interested to see what he takes on next.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,6,13,19 April 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty Shades of B.S.
","Quickie Review:Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a naive literature student, who goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They both are instantly attracted to each other. However, Anastasia's life is changed forever as she enters Christian's luxurious and sexual world. Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible. A soft-core porn masquerading itself as something more. Laughable dialog and shallow caricatures, although plentiful are the least of its problems. Avoid this movie at all cost, please don't support such horrid excuse for a film.Full Review:I understand the appeal of exploring sexual fantasies. Considering the world-wide sensation that was the novel, there is a lot of curiosity to know what all the fuss is about. That curiosity is what got me to go to the cinema to check it out. I really wish Doc Brown's DeLorean arrives this year so I can stop the past me from making this terrible mistake.I am not an unreasonable guy, so I'll start with the positives. The cinematography is done well, it looks good. However, polish a turd as much as you want, in the end it's still a turd.There are two reactions you will have to the dialog: laughter at its absurdity or cringing at its awkwardness. There is no flow to what's being said. They'd be sitting at a dinner table having a conversation and out of nowhere Anastasia will say 'will you make love to me now?' I instantly thought of Ron Burgundy's meme of That Escalated Quickly. Little did I know I should have saved that meme thought for the immediate gem of a line from Christian 'I don't make love, I f***.' Well at least he gets right to his point. What teenager wrote this script? It makes Twilight feel like Shakespeare.Now let's talk about the caricatures, yes caricatures because these aren't characters. Christian only has one mood setting, deeply brooding. The only other way to describe him is, rich. On the other hand, Anastasia is desperately made to look like a simple innocent small town girl. Oh look she drives a beat up VW Beetle, oh she's from a small town in Georgia, oh she doesn't own computer, oh she still uses a flip phone from her middle school, oh she doesn't have fancy clothes. We get it! Move on.If you are thinking I am looking too into this, and that all I have mentioned are just means to an end which are the titillating BDSM scenes, fair enough, let me address those scenes. They are simply not sexy, there is no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the time it doesn't even feel like Anastasia wants to be there. If you are looking to be shocked by the craziness of BDSM, except for the last scene it is actually quite mild. There are other movies that handle the topic of sex much better. For example, The Little Death, about taboo fantasies and how real couples deal with them, or Nymphomaniac about sex addiction and how it consumes you, or Secretary about the psychology behind BDSM.But the most insulting of all, that I can't understand how it is acceptable in the mainstream, is how weak of a 'character' Anastasia is. The entire movie, she doesn't stand on her own. Even though she is being emotionally abused, she needs a man. Even when she is whipped and doesn't enjoy it, she is still in love with him. What did he do to deserve your love Anastasia? Oh right, new computer, new dresses, new Audi, helicopter rides, and glider rides. Simply insulting.So please, do not watch this movie. I know I've used the phrase, avoid at all cost, before for reviews of bad movies, but in this case I really mean it. If you are being dragged to see this movie, bribe your friend to not make you go. It's better use of your money anyway. I hate to rant non-stop, but for this movie I had to. If this review saves even one soul from the misery I've endured, I'll consider my life's purpose on this little rock we call Earth, complete.I was battling to rate this movie either 1 or 2 out of 10, but I opted for the higher rating. Why you ask? Because it managed to get a man in his mid-20s to complain about a movie filled with sex scenes. That's an amazing feat in itself that I must commend.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",2,30,59,13 February 2015
Lucy," Black Widow is on drugs!
","Quickie Review:Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), is captured by a criminal group run by the crime lord Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). She is forced to be a drug mule for a new designer drug that accidentally leaks inside her. The overdose results in her unlocking 100% of her brain's capacity, becoming an unstoppable warrior intent on getting revenge. The concept of a person reaching super human level capabilities through some drug and then going all badass is intriguing for sure. Also Johansson is no stranger to being a badass in movies, so she plays well as the lead. The problem remains that the movie concentrates so much on delivering on the style that you'll not care for the little substance there is.Full Review:So, Limitless + Black Widow + Neo from The Matrix? Hell yea count me in! That triple threat combo is exactly what I thought when I first saw the trailers for Lucy, so you could imagine I was quite pumped to watch this movie. Unfortunately I underestimated the epicness of that combo and Johansson ends up being so overpowered that the whole sense of danger is taken out of the movie.If you have seen the recent Marvel movies especially Captain America: Winter Soldier you know that Scarlett Johansson has proved to be a great action star. Lucy gave her the perfect opportunity to be the lead in her own action film, and she owns it for the most part. It was entertaining to see the sudden change from a vulnerable young woman to a methodical killer. The powers she has gradually increases over the duration of the movie, but about the half-way point it is abundantly clear that she has become a generic powerful killer. The power takes all the tension out of the action scenes because there is not going to be any real danger for you to care about. As for becoming an overly methodical killer, essentially all character is sucked out of Lucy and you are left with a emotionless robot that you can't relate to.Director Luc Beeson is a very visual director, and that is the strength of this movie. All the action scenes are very well filmed. There are no cheap tricks like shacky cam, the shootings are all very well edited and paced. There is one car chase that is definitely one of the best in recent memory. So I must give credit to the visual style. There is one thing that Beeson tries that I think will get some mixed reactions. In the beginning few times some national geographic type clips of animals are shown to mirror what's happening in the movie. I personally found it to be interesting but then it's not used at all. It's as if Beeson lost all confidence in this experiment. Why do it with half effort? Either follow through or don't do it all.Lucy is not a terrible movie, there are some things to enjoy. As a whole I wouldn't recommend paying full price to watch in cinema. Marvel, just give us a Black Widow movie!Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",6,0,8,4 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," We're home
","Quickie Review:The Galactic Empire has fallen, but thirty years later from its ashes rises a new threat to The Republic. A rag-tag group of heroes and resistance fighters must come together to face The First Order and the dangerous new weapon they've built. Meanwhile, the mysterious figure known as Kylo Ren is on a mission to finish the journey to the dark side, following his idol Darth Vader. Star Wars TFA, is not perfect but it is the film the fans have been aching for. The focus is back on the characters and their relations, set in the grand operatic setting of Star Wars. Familiar heroes are back to bring out your nostalgia but more importantly the new cast make an impactful impression, leaving you excited to see more of them in the future films. TFA does traverse some familiar plots from the original story but sets the stage for exciting adventures ahead without sacrificing the thrill of this film. If you aren't one of the millions already seen the film in the first weekend, make sure you aren't missing out soon.Full Review:At work I've seemed to have built up a reputation of being a rabid fan of Star Wars. Though that's true, I am a huge fan of the franchise, the fandom all over the world goes far beyond. Considering the hate towards the prequels, many fans including myself had their hopes riding on TFA. Thankfully, the movie was able to re-capture the magic of the original Star Wars.While we do see some of our favourite characters returning, the focus of the movie is truly on the new cast. First of all, the two leading heroes Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (Jon Boyega) are instantly likable. These are not the one note characters of the prequels, they are layered and have growth that feels natural. Their charming personalities had me invested in the perils they are thrusted into. On the darker end, we have Kylo Ren so wonderfully portrayed by Adam Driver. He deserves the honour of being a great addition to Star Wars hall of villainy. In just one film I got to know so much about his conflicts and ambitions. Yet at the same time there is still a veil of mystery on the character, an intrigue behind him that I can't wait to see be explored more in the later films. We also get to see more characters from the original trilogy, the highlight of which was Han Solo. At no point did it feel like he was just playing this role again for some easy cash. He was right at home playing Han which made it all the more fun for me to watch him return to this beloved franchise. Other recognisable icons are used in a smart way, with moderation as to not grab the attention away from the story.Aside from the great cast, I enjoyed the way the film was shot. One of the biggest point of their marketing was the use of practical effects, and it pays off. I will make the claim now, this film will age much better than the prequels, because everything feels authentic and tangible. The practical effects brought a sense of realism to the fantasy of this world. The action scenes were beautifully shot with all the dogfights and gunfights getting your blood pumping. On top of that I loved the light sabre fights. There are no fancy CGI jumps and twirls, instead it was a messy fight for survival, driven purely by rage and fear. These weren't scenes for just spectacle but ones that furthered the growth of the characters involved, a critical moment in their journey with the Force. I'd like to say more about some scenes that I feel will become iconic in the future but I will leave that for you to experience.Though I loved the film, it is not perfect. The main issue it comes down to is the fact there are too many similar story points in TFA borrowed directly from the original trilogy. So for the most part the movie plays it quite safe. At the same time my main complain of the prequels was that they don't feel like a Star Wars adventure. However, TFA does capture that sense of magic and adventure of Star Wars, so in a way borrowing the story elements did help. Moving forwards I'd like to see newer ideas come into play but that's something to discuss in 1.5 years from now (let the countdown begin for Episode 8!).Again if you aren't one of the millions who have rushed out to see it, don't wait too long. Go now and experience what we've always loved about Star Wars, great heroes, great villains, great action, and great mythology. Star Wars The Force Awakens gives me confidence in the future of this franchise.",8,7,24,23 December 2015
Unbroken," Well, a little broken
","Quickie Review:Olympian Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), turned bombardier in WWII survives a plane crash into the ocean. He along with his crew-mates are left stranded on a raft for 47 days. Just when all hope is lost Louis enters another hell when he is captured by the Japanese navy and sent to a detention camp. This is the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie, and unfortunately the lack of directing experience does show when it comes to character development and story pacing. This film certainly has moments where it shines. It is well shot and acted, with the first half showing some potential for greatness. However, the second half feels overstretched without the depth of rest of the movie. In the end it's alright, but it could have been a lot better.Full Review:Coen brothers written WWII movie based on a true story. Sounds like a safe bet right? Well there is one wildcard here, the director is Angelina Jolie. Considering she has never been behind the camera before I had to consider the chance the movie would be rough around the edges. Turns out there is slightly more roughness than I had anticipated.First off this is a impressive looking movie. The opening shot is of a bombing run over an enemy base while trying to survive the anti- air fire. It's intense with great cinematography, and you also see a lot of that even during the smaller intimate moments. The sets and look of the movie add to the tangibility of the horrors of being stranded on the ocean or being held and mistreated as a prisoner of war. Additionally, two of the main cast Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson were great in their roles. Both of them had to carry a significant part of the story, the friendship and comradery they have in the wake of the crash felt genuine. I really enjoyed watching the first half of the movie because it jumped between times before and during the war. So you get to see Louis' past and how it shaped him to handle the hellish circumstances he has been dealt.With such an inspirational story, you would expect to be deeply moved by the film. Instead there are some missteps taken that hinder Unbroken from reaching its potential. I just mentioned how I enjoyed the structure of the first half showing two time-lines, it added the much needed emotional weight. However, that structure is completely abandoned once Louis is captured by the Japanese navy. This would have been fine if the detention camp scenes carried the same weight. The problem is that the sense of consequence is completely non- existent for the rest of the movie. For example, there would be a scene where Louis would be beaten senselessly, to the point he can't stand or loses consciousness, but then next scene is the very next day of him sitting pretty with a nicely combed greased hair and a single scar on his cheek. This happens so often and for so long that I wasn't as invested in him anymore. What's the point if he brushes everything off so easily the next scene? He may be a hero in real life, but he is not a superhero. A good villain could have redeemed this part of the movie, but even that was poorly handled. Takamasa Ishihara, who plays the camp's officer in command comes off as a very shallow and generic villain, being evil just for the sake of it.All the right ingredients are there but somewhere along middle the recipe was meddled with. Overall, Unbroken is a watchable film thanks to its cinematography and decent acting. I wouldn't recommend a full price ticket, but it is worthy of a Netflix stream. Main issue is that too much time and effort is put on the invincibility of the characters rather than their vulnerability. This results in a film that feels somewhat underwhelming and unrelatable at certain moments.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",6,1,2,12 January 2015
Godzilla," God of all monsters in full glory
","Quickie Review:Godzilla, one of the most iconic monsters in film history, returns to the big screen in this latest Hollywood reboot. This incredible creature is a force of nature that has come to correct man's mistakes and arrogance. Director Gareth Edwards, remains faithful to the original 1954 Japanese Godzilla in terms of style and pacing, while taking the raw power of the creature to a whole new level. There is a slow build up till we see our anti-hero in full glory, but when he appears on screen it is truly epic. This is a must-see cinematic spectacle that will go down as one of the best monster movies of all time.Full Review:I really want to get to the meat of what makes this movie great. I'll also be skipping describing the plot, because it is best for you to experience it and all you need to know is this complex equation: Godzilla x Monster fights = Awesome^2. So let me get some general mediocre things about the movie out of the way. The main problem I can think of for this movie is the human element. It is simply just functional. There is nothing outstanding about the performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, or Ken Watanabe. They all did their jobs fine, portraying their characters realistically and grounded. This isn't even a negative, it's just something that could've been improved upon. I'm nit-picking at this point for negatives if I go any further, so I'll skip to the positives.Godzilla Oh my f*****g Godzilla!!! Seriously I'm getting goosebumps as I'm typing this. The thing I most liked about this version of Godzilla is that he really felt like a force of nature, completely unstoppable. The character designs are so detailed that you recognize even the subtle expressions and know exactly what the creatures are thinking. This adds a lot of personality to the monsters, they are not just CGI animals. Also Gareth Edwards brilliantly puts you through an emotional roller coaster from sheer terror to childlike glee. There were moments where I was genuinely terrified, to the point that I realized I was pushing myself into my seat and holding my breath. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum there were moments where I was smiling ear to ear, jumping up and down on my seat with excitement, and even cheering loudly with both my fists up in the air. I am a grown man I never do that, and this movie made me react like that without hesitation.On top of all that, I really like the pacing of the movie. For a long time, the movie teases you with little glimpses of Godzilla. Much like the 1954 version, you don't really get to see Godzilla and monster fights in full action till the last 30mins of the movie. I can see how that can be disappointing for some, but it didn't really bother me. Mainly because the climax of the movie just pays off so well. All the fights are beautifully showcased and choreographed. You feel every bite, crunch, and punch.Summing up, you have to watch this movie in cinema. If you are on the fence about IMAX, I say go for it because the level of immersion in this movie is the highest since Gravity. I would like to end with a quote from the director himself when asked, what he wanted to achieve with this version of Godzilla: 'make it last 2 hours, and uh lot of foreplay, and so when there is the climax, it is the most powerful it could be.' Lot of intentional innuendo there by him, but honestly I couldn't describe this movie any better.",9,9,19,14 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Classic Bond on Steroids
","Quickie Review:After the loss of an agent the Kingsman spy organization start a recruitment process to find a replacement. Harry Hart codenamed Galahad (Colin Firth) believes that a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) has the potential to be a fellow Kingsman. Meanwhile billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has plans for worldwide domination that could cost billions of lives. Kingsman is mindblowing, nay, it is mindblasting fun. Director Matthew Vaughn, brings us another comic book movie that is not only well made but reinvents the spy genre with clever satire. This is a throwback to the classic bond films, but with all crazy violence and beautiful action of Kick-Ass. Watch this movie unless you hate having a good time.Full Review:I will confess that when I first saw the trailer for Kingsman I thought it looked a little campy. Then I heard Matthew Vaughn was directing and instantly all my doubts disappeared. This man has proved that he can take a genre that has been done to death and reinvigorate with new life. Kingsman is exactly that.In this day and age, dark and gritty tones are all the craze when making an action movie. That's fine when done well but most of the time it forces all personality out of the film. Kingsman on the other hand is an homage to old spy movies, filled with crazy gadgets, eccentric villain, intimidating henchman (henchwoman in this case), and of course a wacky plan for world supremacy. This type of film in the wrong hands would definitely have been cheesier than hot pot full of fondue. However, the movie is fully aware of what it is and with the help of some satirical comedy it is able to get away with the absurdity. Then there are the action sequences that were gruesome pieces of art. Best of which was the fight scene at the church. The insane choreography with probably one of the longest chain kills in cinema made my jaw drop. I would pay full ticket price for that scene alone.Colin Firth is the perfect gentleman, sophisticated, well dressed, with just the right amount of mystery. But if you get on his bad side, good luck because he is going knock yours and half dozen other people's teeth out without breaking a sweat. Taron Egerton is a newcomer to Hollywood but I have a feeling he is bound for more. He plays a character that is clearly a street delinquent, but you can tell deep down he is kind hearted. He transforms himself inspired by Firth's character, and by the end of the movie you are cheering him on with every punch and pull of the trigger. A movie is only as good as its villain, and Samuel L. Jackson was a great villain. He is an internet billionaire genius in his 60's who wears clothes like a teenage hip- hop artist, and plans to kill billions of people but can't stand the sight of blood. What? And yet he is having so much fun playing this character that you can't help but laugh with him.With Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and now Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn for me has become the best comic book movie director out there right now. Funny dialog (occasionally inappropriate but no harm done), amazingly choreographed violent action, and memorable characters helped revitalize an entire genre with a modern twist. An endlessly fun adventure that I will definitely experience multiple times in cinema.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8,1,6,17 February 2015
Minions," Banana!!!
","Quickie Review:Minions from the dawn of time have always searched to serve the most despicable masters in the world. After failing to keep their masters numerous times, the minions feel without purpose. That's when three brave minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart set out on a journey to find their new master. Despicable Me franchise has done a lot of things right, one of which that clicked with all ages were the adorable little minions. This film could've been very basic, continuously rehashing a collection slapstick comedy, and just simply depend on the popularity of the minions. Instead, the creators of this film added heart to the characters, delivering a movie that kids will love and adults will have fun with.Full Review:As much as I love the minions in the Despicable Me movies, I was quite pessimistic on how good Minions was going to be. It just felt like a cash grab. Of course, all movies aim to grab some cash but this movie in particular felt like the studio was just capitalising on the popularity of the characters. Gratefully, the movie got me to set aside my pessimism.One of my biggest concerns was whether a collection of side characters can really carry an entire movie. Short answer as it turns out: yes they can. It works because we are focusing on just three minions for the majority of the movie. Each of them have their unique personality that shines through without a single word of comprehensible dialogue. That in itself is an amazing feat, the minion-gibberish is all non-sense and yet I am able to empathise with them. I can't even say the same for actual human actors in other movies sometimes! So in that sense, job well done animators. I also liked the small story arc that was given to the villain of the movie, Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She wasn't a villain just for the sake of it, which added another dimension to what could have been a generic character. There is relatable back story to her that made us understand where she was coming from, while still retaining the unpredictable evil-ness.The movie is not without flaws. There are times where the jokes might be too slapstick for adults to enjoy. These scenes are obviously aimed for the kids. They don't completely alienate us grown-ups but it is still noticeable. On top of that, I have to say I felt the absence of Gru and the kids from the Despicable Me movies. What I love about the minions is their relationship with Gru's family, the pranks, the shenanigans, the care they have for each other, is all so delightful to watch. This absence was bound to happen since we are concentrating on the minions. At the same time, aside from Scarlett Overkill there are no other memorable supporting characters.Even with the problems, I really did enjoy my time watching Minions. It was a great light hearted, charming, fun movie. If you have little kids, nephews or nieces, don't hesitate to take them to the cinema. They will have an awesome time. Together you too will find some amusing entertainment.",7,13,24,9 July 2015
Spectre," Shaken, not stirred
","Quickie Review:After receiving a message from his past James (Daniel Craig) is compelled to take on an unauthorised mission. While MI6 struggles to show the relevance of the 00-programme in the modern era of intelligence, James uncovers the truth behind the secret world- influencing organisation known too few as Spectre. Spectre while not the best of Craig's Bond films, is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. The film is filled to the brim with incredible action set pieces and acting talent. However the weakness of the movie is glaringly apparent in its inability to make the threat of the villain feel menacing. Spectre despite not being the complete package manages to be stylish and entertaining.Full Review:Though I was not a fan of Quantum of Solace, I really enjoyed the other two Daniel Craig Bond films. With Sam Mendes returning as director and stroke of genius to cast Christoph Waltz as a Bond villain, I was excited to see Bond's new spy adventure. In the end Spectre did not meet my high expectations, but that not at all means it was a bad movie.Sam Mendes directorial style is instantly identifiable from the opening sequence. There is clear intention behind how he uses the setting to establish the tone of the scenes. When the pace is slowed there is tension building from the rhythmic beats and movement of the camera. That built tension is paid off with the thrilling action set-pieces that balances right at the edge of chaos. This happens throughout the movie and is absolutely thrilling! The cinematography of the film sucks you right into even the quietest moments, and that makes the rather long 148min runtime feel like it passed by swiftly. Most importantly, Daniel Craig has really grown into the James Bond role with all his mannerisms, humour, and flirtatious charm we've come to associate with this iconic character. This is the most Bond we've seen him yet, so for the Craig doubters out there, you can go into this movie a little less worried. Also the supporting characters M, Moneypenny, and Q had more of a part to play, even some going into the field to help out. Since Bond is always portrayed as a one man army, it's a nice change to see his team take more initiative in the mission.Spectre promised to show how Bond's past comes back to haunt him. While that is achieved to a certain extent, it all feels undeserved because nothing has been done to set up the reveal. It ends up coming off as an afterthought put together haphazardly. However, the most disappointing of all is the misuse of Christoph Waltz. Look I get it, Spectre the organisation as the name implies is supposed to be elusive, including its leader. Still by keeping him in the shadows till the very last act leaves his goals and ideological ambition lacking significant impact. In contrast Dave Bautista posed a much bigger threat physically, and I was hoping Waltz would be his intellectual equivalent.There is no denying there are few major issues and yet I must admit I had fun with Spectre. The potential to create a new iconic Bond villain was a complete missed opportunity, causing me to not resonate with Waltz's character. Aside from that there is little to complain. It's a cinematic experience from beginning to the end. So suit up, grab a glass of martini shaken not stirred (drink responsibly), sit back, relax, and enjoy the spy adventure.",7,5,20,2 November 2015
Her," Her- Step aside Siri, and hello Samantha
","A guy who falls in love with his operating system Admit it, most of you like me chuckled at this ridiculous idea and said 'HA! What a loner.' But wow, this movie blew me away.The movie is set in a not so distant future where technology has developed to the point that the line between AI and a person is blurred. Going into the movie I assumed that the movie was going to be a commentary on the growing trend of people diving into their gadgets, while avoiding actual human interaction. Think of all the times your friends were Facebook-ing and Instagram-ing while you hung out. Though the movie does touch upon that, the focus on the relationship itself is what I found more striking and interesting. Director and writer Spike Jonze, used this seemingly absurd idea of being in a relationship with an OS, to show the absurdity of relationships themselves. As the audience you are left wondering if Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is really any crazier than the rest of us who have human relationships. In doing so there are some surprisingly hilarious and touching moments throughout the film.Joaquin Phoenix played the role of a lonely romantic, aching for personal contact brilliantly. He plays such a relatable and likable character that I was completely invested in him. Even when his character is criticized for his choices, in my head I felt the urge to immediately back him up and support him. Then there is Scarlett Johansson, who lends her voice for the character of Samantha. That's what she was, a character, a person, not an AI. To bring Samantha to life with no physical acting is to be greatly commended. The true gem of this movie however, is the interaction between Samantha and Theodore. It is so rich and believable that sometimes you forget the human-AI nature of this relationship. You as the audience will be in complete sync with their every emotion from sadness to happiness, and confusion to clarity.The world that is created combined with the unique style is visually engaging. This is a movie with a lot of heart, I fell in love with these characters. It dissects relationships in a way I have never seen before. You will leave the movie thinking about the questions this movie brings up, about being human and falling in love. Without a doubt this movie is one of my favorite love stories I have ever seen, and one of them in the relationship isn't even a human! What does that say about me",8,0,0,12 March 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a movie! What a lovely movie!
","Quickie Review:The world as we know it no longer exists, turned into an endless scorching desert where every drop of water and fuel is precious enough to kill for. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) rebels against the oppression of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by aiding in the escape of his wives. She comes across Max (Tom Hardy), a mystery man who needs Furiosa just as much as she needs him in their quest for survival. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the most mind-blowing, insane action movies in recent years. By relying on mostly practical stunts there is a real sense of danger, tension, excitement, and awe with every explosion, flip, and wreck of the cars. More surprisingly there is heart behind the action, thanks to the well-developed characters. Mad Max's beautiful chaos is a sight to behold and must be experienced on the big screen.Full Review:I have never seen the original Mad Max movies, I just never got around to watching them. Since this was a reboot of sorts there is no need to watch them, and I wanted to go into the movie fresh. So this review comes from someone with no prior knowledge of the franchise. Short of it, I loved it!The thing that people will be talking about after the movie ends is the action. This is action like you have never seen before. CGI is only used when it is absolutely needed and the other 90% of the time it is real cars crashing and flipping in every way they can. The chase scenes are breath taking and heart pounding, and I mean that literally. After the first action sequence ended I had to remind myself to exhale because I felt like I was holding my breath in awe for the entire scene. When another sequence ended I checked my pulse, I don't know the exact beats per minute but it felt like I just came off the treadmill after 15mins of running. Like I said Mad Max is beautiful chaos but because of the great shot composition there is sense in the chaos. I never felt lost, I always knew what was going on despite the frantic nature of the scenes. That is why you will fully appreciate all the effort put into filming this movie.One of the things I was most nervous about from the trailers was the world of Mad Max. I feared that everything would be so crazy, like the flame-thrower guitarist on a truck, that it'd be too distracting. However, the world is so well-conceived and well realised by director George Miller that even the most insane things make sense in that context. Yes, that includes the flame-thrower guitarist, he was awesome! Additionally the cinematography and soundtrack brought a much grander scale to an otherwise simple story.Behind all the visuals though there is a level of depth to the movie that I did not anticipate. The best character of the movie by far is Charlize Theron's Furiosa. Even with her disability she is incredibly strong willed and determined to finish her mission. After all, she carries a lot of the emotional consequences if she were to fail and so I was really invested in her story. In a genre dominated by male actors it is refreshing to see a compelling female character such as Furiosa, and we need more of them in Hollywood. Then there is also Nicholas Hoult as Nux who had a great story arc. I was surprised how much I empathised with his character. You might be wondering why I haven't talked about Max yet in a movie called Mad Max, well that's simply because he is not really the central character. Don't get me wrong, he has a major role in the movie and Tom Hardy plays a convincing hardened hero. Nevertheless, this is mostly a Furiosa centric story. That may be a complaint for some that Max should've been the focus, and I can see their reasoning. The way I understood it was that this film is one of many stories or legends in this world, where a mystery man (Max) plays an important part in helping our heroes succeed. In that sense the way Max's character was handled was fitting.We are only half way through this decade and already I'll call it: Mad Max is the best action movie of this decade, the very least top 5. I have a strong feeling that Mad Max Fury Road will be a classic decades from now. I cannot stress this enough, you absolutely have to watch this on the big screen, IMAX if possible. You are robbing yourself of a truly unique visceral experience if you miss this one. The only person I wouldn't recommend this movie to is someone with a heart condition, because it might get too intense.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",10,9,19,17 May 2015
Furious 7," The people's guilty pleasure
","Quickie Review:Dom (Vin Diesel) and his family finally get to return home after leaving their criminal life behind. This calm life doesn't last long when Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks out revenge against them for his comatose brother. This franchise made a great comeback in the past three movies, and this movie continues that momentum. Fast & Furious 7 is not perfect, adding too many story elements taking away the screen time from Jason Statham as the principal threat. However, the all- out ridiculous set pieces, non-stop one liners, and the character banter make this movie a joy to watch. Also Fast & Furious 7 serves as a great tribute to the late Paul Walker.Full Review:Most would agree that the Fast & Furious movies aren't meant to be taken seriously. The point is to go to the cinema with a group of friends and enjoy the absurd fun while stuffing your face with cinema snacks. Fast & Furious 7 is the perfect film for that. I just wish we had seen more awesomeness from one of the most loved action heroes, Mr. Statham.There a lot of movies that have ridiculous amounts of explosions and action set pieces but in the end are horrible movies *cough* Transformers *cough*. What makes Fast & Furious work are the characters that are so likable. All these sequences would be white noise without the cast. The way they react, interact and tease each other, you can really tell that their comradery is genuine. There are countless moments where I laughed at the sheer stupidity of some of the things going on, but I didn't care because I was having so much fun. So if you loved the over the top nature of the previous movies with the great cast, you will continue to love this movie.My only complaint is also a major one, Jason Statham was too much in the side lines. I love Statham in his movies, and when I saw that he was playing the villain I was excited. However, apart from the final act, he only conveniently appears at random points of the movie to make Dom's side missions a little harder. Don't get me wrong, Statham is great in all his scenes, but Djimon Hounsou a secondary villain has just as much screen-time. Hounsou's character wasn't even all that significant or menacing to warrant him being in the movie. All he did was scream 'WHAT!?' like the artist Lil' Jon whenever things didn't go his way. So if the filmmakers had kept Statham as the sole villain it would have served the vendetta plot and the threat that Dom faced a lot better.Of course I can't do this review without mentioning Paul Walker. It was tragic the way he passed away, and all of us know how devastated his family and his Fast & Furious family were. This movie carried a lot of emotional weight for the people involved. The way they honored Paul Walker was truly heartfelt. I was really moved by the tribute.All in all, Fast & Furious 7 was fun and entertaining, did almost everything it set out to do. If you're not a fan of this franchise this movie will not convert you, but if you are fan then you will have a great time. Even with my complaint with the way Statham's character was handled, I still highly recommend checking out Fast & Furious 7. A great start to the summer blockbuster season.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7,0,12,6 April 2015
