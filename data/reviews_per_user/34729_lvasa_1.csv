Sucker Punch," Underrated
","This film is much better than it seems from the ratings. Many complain that it is shallow, but it is just the blindness of the viewer, who cannot see that behind something visually attractive there might be also something rather deep. There is a message in this movie, and although it is a rather simple one, it is still better than message brought by most highly rated movies. Think of it - what's the message of Inception? Don't mess with multi-layered dreams? Is that really what you needed to know?And if you wish, there's plenty of material to brood about too, it's like a book inversed - when reading a book, you are given all the relations, and you must imagine the visuals, here you are given the visuals, but you have to imagine the relations. Most interesting.",10,1,4,11 August 2011
