Blade Runner 2049," This is how you make a worthy sequel: by expanding it in every direction
","Blade Runner has long been tough love for me. The first time I saw it I was almost bored to death by it, but since everybody kept saying what an absolute classic it was, I kept revisiting it. Somehow, there was this nagging feeling that I was missing out on something great. Of course I could see that it was superbly made on the art direction level, but I estimate that it took me about 5 or 6 times before I fully grasped the pure sci-fi themes at its core: what makes us human, and what excludes an artificial human from that qualification? Like all truly great art, Blade Runner has many layers and different qualities, and doesn't reveal its secrets all at once.It is not hard to imagine why Denis Villeneuve was daunted by the task to make a worthy successor to this cult movie. It is also easy to see that he succeeded incredibly well: Blade Runner 2049, like Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, is one of those rare movies that isn't just a great movie, it's also a great sequel. The best compliment I could give would be that it feels like a completely organic and logical follow-up to its predecessor, a natural second chapter, as if it were already conceived together with the original, rather than afterwards. Both Villeneuve and producer Ridley Scott said they were won over by a great script. Now this is something every filmmaker says before delivering a sub-par sequel (Wes Craven reportedly said the same about Scream 4), but in this case, it couldn't be more true.Good sequels use familiar parts, add some new, and in exceptional cases, they create something that casts a different light on its predecessor(s). Unlike The Force Awakens, Villeneuve doesn't rely on the classic elements from the very start (apart from he close-up of an eye). He opens with brightly lit shots from greenhouses on the countryside as opposed to a dark city skyline, and he even resists temptation to use the familiar sound from the flying Spinner cars. After re-introducing us to the harsh world of the future where humans have de-humanized and Replicants have no rights, he occasionally allows himself some familiar iconography, with sweeping shots of downtown LA, its seedy underbelly and the Tyrell pyramid; even Harrison Ford is sparingly used with maximum efficiency. The makers show remarkable restraint in a film that could have easily ended up becoming a quick re-hash; instead, it differentiates itself starkly by visiting the uncharted territories, both in its story and in the art-direction. The main plot deals with detective K trying to unearth a long-hidden secret, but again, those who read between the lines will see the implicit theme being explored here: is denying a race of Replicants their fundamental rights as beings on the grounds of the fact that they are manufactured instead of born not akin to slavery? Hampton Fancher and Michael Green did a superb job of including two survivors from the previous movie into the story, not as a fan service but as a logical extension of their journey. K (Ryan Gosling) becomes a reluctant player in the story, and part of his journey is finding out what exact role he plays in it. Another part is how K must find his place in a world where 'real' seems less clearly defined than ever. In his delightful scenes with Ana de Armas as his companion Joi, the human side of his stoic persona comes out, and it puts an interesting spin on the concept of 'what is real' when even Replicants seem to struggle with it. Some of the more touching scenes are pleasantly reminiscent of Spike Jonze's 'Her', and themes from Children Of Men, another superb movie inspired by Blade Runner's grim version of a dying future, are also quite overt. It is good to see that Blade Runner's spiritual successors have influenced its sequel in turn. Like true world-builders, Villeneuve and director of photography Roger Deakins show us the stark contrasts between the overpopulated city, the worn-out industrial outskirts and the almost surrealistic remains of Las Vegas. Combined with the slow-paced editing, this creates a sense of immersion that is rare in today's cinema. The sets and surroundings almost become like secondary characters in this set-up. Some might complain a bit about the excessive running time of over 2.5 hours, and in some scenes (especially the ones that focus on K's personal life), the tension sometimes trails off a bit too long at the expense of important subplots. But kudos for a director and a studio who dare to deliver a product much like its predecessor: an expansive, subtle, humane, cerebral, slow-burning blockbuster that feels no need to cater to audiences longing for lean, action-packed storytelling wrapped up in a neat climax. The satisfaction from 2049 not only comes from what it shows, but just as much from what it leaves out; not in the least in its beautifully subdued epilogue. 2049 is a work of art that may even surpass the original, although I say that with some reservation, recognizing the amazing groundwork that the first film laid down. It's just that 2049 feels more complete, whereas Blade Runner, despite its many versions, sometimes seems enigmatic in the sense that some crucial parts still feel missing. The ending of 2049 can work on its own, but it could also be an opportunity for a successor that elaborates on the parts that are now merely subplots. The disappointing box office may crush that hope in its early stages; again, it may show that the popularity of a movie reflects the passion of its fans, and not necessarily the size of its audience. The overseas markets may give the film the success it deserves, but even if this is the final word, this makes 2049 a more than worthy companion piece for the fans.",9,11,24,16 October 2017
First Man," My guilty pain of the year
","I don't know if it is an official term, but since 'a work of art beloved by the observer but disliked by the masses' is called a 'guilty pleasure', I propose the word 'guilty pain' for the opposite: a movie praised by people in general, but perceived as overrated by me. First Man is an unfortunate example of this: I love biopics and movies about space exploration, and I went in with reasonable expectations (I think), but despite finding some positive elements in it, I already know it is not going to make my Best Of 2018 list.I liked Damien Chazelle's previous movies, but I also think that all the Oscar-praise and IMDb Top 250 listings that were heaped upon them were way too much credit. Whiplash was a solid piece of breakthrough filmmaking, but it will be primarily remembered for the stellar role of J.K. Simmons and his interaction with Miles Teller, rather than a timeless piece of storytelling. Entire volumes and SNL sketches have been written about La La Land and how a group of its hardcore fans (let's call them Academy voters) made it one of the most successfully overhyped movies of all time. First Man is actually the film that makes me doubt Chazelle's status as wunderkind the most. Whiplash and La La Land, relatively overrated as they were, at least moved and entertained me, whereas First Man failed to actually engage me most of the time.At its best, FM is a fascinating history lesson about a nation's decade-long ambition to reach the Moon, and the willingness of a group of men (and one man in particular) to risk their lives in pursuit of fullfilling this dream. The film accurately shows the bold choices and sacrifices that these men made, going into a project that succeeded with equal amounts of craftmanship and blind luck. It also shows the human folly of spending (or wasting) resources and human lives out of a desire to beat their competitors. The movie isn't afraid to suggest at times that personal ego was a significant factor in the drive of some of the men, and it takes care not to slavishly portray its protagonists as heroes or saints. As a documentary, FM would have done an accurate job.However, as a drama, it falls short in several areas. One of them, sadly, is in the choice of its main subject. I have been told that the real Neil Armstrong was notoriously introverted, modest and media-shy, and the devestating loss of a child made him a tragic figure. Although Ryan Gosling accurately portrays him as such, this doesn't help from a storytelling point of view. We simply don't get to understand how this man thinks and why he does what he does. The way that he talks to his sons about the possibility of him not returning alive like he is giving a press conference suggests to me that he had real difficulties in connecting with people. As a consequence, the movie struggles to convey why his character would put himself and his family through such insecurities, given the absence of any noticeable enthusiasm in him. Some will undoubtedly say that this enigmatic man is a mystery best left intact, and part of the appeal of the movie, but I find that the film's inability to get under his skin seriously hampers my ability to identify with him.My second point of contention is director Chazelle's confined view on the subject. His restraint in re-enacting the events as unsensational as possible is commendable in principle. Stories like this do not necessarily need emotional embellishments, endless character analyses or bombastic enhancements to strike a chord with the audience. Keeping the story focussed on its characters with subtle music is an artistic choice that could have worked. However, in this film, it mostly amounts to a dry presentation of facts that lack a subjective feeling to it. Chazelle keeps the camera locked tight on his actors and inside the shuttles most of the time, and rarely ventures outside that narrow view. Even in the tense scenes, we experience plenty of discomforts and fears of spaceflight, but hardly any of the marvel that I assume makes astronauts want to go into space in the first place. Movies like Apollo 13 and Everest also dealt with people who risk their lives, but it also showed or explained their motivations and euphoria that made you understand and sympathize with them. What I miss is the childlike sense of wonder that would suit a movie about space exploration, which is very strange for a movie that has Steven Spielberg credited as a producer.The movie has assembled a fine cast, including Gosling, Jason Clarke and Claire Foy. Even the fact that some good actors (like CiarÃ¡n Hinds) have only very small parts isn't a problem. However, as stated above, I find it problematic that the film only incidentally succeeds in explaining what drives these characters. Certain scenes are even puzzling in their lack of purpose (like the final shot). It almost seems as if the makers tried to suggest more character depth by copious use of extreme close-ups, coupled with a constantly moving camera. I don't mind a few close-ups or a bit of shaky-cam at all, but when I start to notice it repeatedly (especially in quiet dialogue scenes) it becomes an annoying style trick. Some have praised the photography for its accurate 60s look, and I concur with that, but shaky-cam for the sake of shaky-cam kind of defeats its purpose.In all fairness, every now and then, Chazelle succeeds in getting the message accross. Claire Foy gets away with some of the best scenes as the more emotional counterpart of Neil. The dramatic beginning bridges nicely with the cinematic finale; both are quite effective without becoming overly sentimental, and convey the emotional weight of the events, as well as give us some insight into the characters. But there is still a large chunk of a 141-minute movie getting close to boredom by failing to engage me in its narrative or characters. I hear Oscar buzz all around, and I am fine with any of the actors winning it. But not the picture, not the director, and certainly not the photography. The movie has the elements, but it lacks the passion for its subject.",7,0,0,26 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," A strangely uneven mix of thrills and disappointments
","Eight years ago, Cloverfield was a very effective genre mix of Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. It became a hype that delivered, thanks to a brilliant viral marketing campaign which enticed the audience with shocking images, but without revealing too much of the story itself. I guess it could be called a miracle that the makers were able to wait so long and (undoubtedly) resist studio pressure for a quick sequel, and then produce a successor under the radar, one whose existence wasn't revealed until a few months before the premiere.That is the good news. The bad news is that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a disappointing sequel on many levels. First of all, it isn't even a sequel. Marketing it with creative re-use of the original's title really created some false expectations, because 10CL has nothing to do whatsoever with its predecessor. It has a completely separate story, no familiar characters or locations, and the events of the previous film aren't mentioned or even referenced. In genuine J.J. Abrams 'Lost' style, you would have expected to see something familiar on a TV screen or in a picture frame to connect the dots, but there isn't (apart from a 'Slusho' sign, and there may be a 'Kelvin' reference that I missed, but those don't count). The closest 10CL comes to is a companion piece or side story set in the same universe, but the only small narrative connection to the original (something with a satellite) is such an obscure geeky reference that 99% of viewers will only discover it on this film's trivia page. It would have been great had it started out as something completely separate, and then slowly revealed its connections to the original. This could have created a stand-alone sequel, while still engaging the audience with insider hints. Sadly, the makers missed this opportunity, which isn't entirely surprising, since this movie was originally an unrelated film that was reworked into a Cloverfield successor halfway through.But still, even a disappointing sequel or side story can be great in its own right. I have enjoyed movies like Hannibal and installments in the Alien and Terminator series that way. I am not fundamentally opposed to the idea of a successor that is completely different in style and execution. No found footage-style cinematography this time, since 10CL is a psychological thriller rather than a adrenaline-fueled creature feature. This is okay as long as it is done well, but here it all felt way too familiar for me. Producer J.J Abrams is certainly no stranger to recycling familiar plots and elements from other movies, but he usually combines or presents them in ways that makes them feel fresh again (just look at Cloverfield, Super 8 and The Force Awakens). Unfortunately, the main plot of 10CL in the bunker is more than a little bit similar to a story arc from the second season of his own series 'Lost', whereas the finale evokes a strong déjà-vu from several better science-fiction movies. Never before did one of his productions feel unoriginal to the point of being worn out. And there is more to complain. The beginning certainly shows promise, with Mary E. Winstead leaving her apartment with only the score playing. After an adrenaline-spiking accident, the movie shifts back gear to the most boring part of the movie. We are supposed to invest in the trio of characters, but they are too one-dimensional for us to really care. Winstead's character clearly had some relationship issues, but the writers simply fail to use that premise later on to the character's (and story's) advantage. John Goodman is always good as a man who looks and acts like he means well, but can turn violent in a second (it was almost hard not to think of his work in several Coen brothers movies, if I'm honest). The script certainly creates a compelling mystery surrounding his past actions and present intentions, but again, when it is time for the pay-off at the end, the writers simply do not deliver on that promise. John Gallagher is the only one who benefits from a character scene which makes his persona less than the average redneck he starts out to be, and he gives the movie the memorable twist that actually works (more about that later). There are other good things to be said for the movie. After 45 minutes of boring character introductions, the movie starts to pick up pace and build tension. It was no doubt the creators' intention to keep the audience guessing if the danger comes from outside, or from within, and it works until about 15 minutes before the end. Then we get another twist that answers that question, and although it brings back some of the thrill and adrenalin that Cloverfield had, it simply doesn't feel satisfying; 15 minutes really is too short, and it is such an abrupt change in style and genre that it pretty much reduces the first 90 minutes to an overlong and unimportant prologue. Again, with better writing, the three acts could have been married happily together instead of feeling like three completely separate movies.So to summarize, 10CL is a bold attempt to extend the cinematic universe from Cloverfield in another direction, but sadly without much of the ingenuity and spark of inspiration that we are used to from J.J. Abrams' team. He calls it a 'blood relative' to the original; I'd say its that slacker of a second cousin twice removed that everyone prefers to ignore. It looks like the Master of Pop Culture himself was too busy with producing and directing The Force Awakens, so if they are making a third one to bridge the first two films, I recommend having him fully back on board.",6,1,4,14 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Most impressive: Abrams brought balance again!
","This being a Star Wars film, there will (of course) be extreme reactions on this review page, ranging from abysmal 1s to towering 10s. It is a sign of the times, when expectations go into unrealistic ranges. With every franchise that has such a dedicated fanbase, there will also come a sense of ownership about the direction that it will have to go in, followed by a lot of disappointment mixed with applause. But I don't own the franchise and am happy to let others take me to where they bring it.Much has been said by how Disney handled the Star Wars franchise after buying LucasFilm, and to say that they may have bitten off more than they could chew on occassion (like releasing more than one film within a year) is fair. But I have nothing but praise for bringing in J.J. Abrams. I had my issues with the Force Awakens (or Force Recycled), but it did an excellent job in bringing back the good-old Original Trilogy feeling to the franchise, as well as introducing a fresh new group of characters to take us on their journey. I am still conflicted about Rian Johnson's nihilistic Last Jedi, which was a strange mix of bold ideas and poor decisions. A decent film, but perhaps too dark and too eager to think outside the box than we were comfortable with.Of course, we later learned that Johnson had sort of carte blanche with his movie, and Disney's biggest mistake was that they didn't tell him to align his ideas with the other directors first, for consistency's sake. So when Colin Trevorrow left RoS, Abrams fortunately stepped back in, and he managed to do the unthinkable: finish the story on his terms, ending the trilogy and the whole saga on a high note, while incorporating most of The Last Jedi's mood swings in a logical way.Abrams fortunately knows his stuff. As usual in his body of work, he re-uses old elements, but mixes them with enough mystery so that it at least tastes good and feels fresh. Bringing back Emperor Palpatine (not a spoiler; the movie literally opens with this) initially felt like nostalgia-recycling again, but if you think about it, he has been the Man behind the Curtain throughout episodes 1-6, so it makes sense to make him the alpha and omega villain of the entire saga. And let's face it: no one plays a better villain than Ian McDiarmid (perhaps James Earl Jones).Abrams manages to place Palpatine's return within a greater exploration of the franchise mythology, which is something that I think all good sequels do or should strive to. I am not a connaisseur, but it feels like something coming from the rich extended universe stories that were released after Return of the Jedi, or ideas that George Lucas once had. Whatever the case, it all felt quite naturally, and bringing in the characters, both good and bad, into this exploration is the best way to pull your audience into the narrative.RoS luckily brings back a lot of the adventurous joy and spontaneity that we've come to love in the series, and was a bit lacking from The Last Jedi, which was rigidly plotted with social commentary. As per tradition of the Star Wars threequel, we visit lots of diverse and colorful places, meet new and old characters, unearth old mysterious, and learn a few new truths, and realize that the divide between good and bad is blurred. Some years seem to have passed since Last Jedi, so our characters are older and wiser now, and more familar with one another. They are faced with an old threat that has intensified, and it is planning a decisive strike, so they must trust the Force, but more importantly, each other to survive.It is great to see how Abrams gets this story going like a proper adventure with a race against time, while giving the previous events a proper context or closure. There is at least a minimal amount of much-needed backstory for Supreme Leader Snoke (who was little more than a plot device), although Abrams is smart enough to leave enough room for mystery, and not get bogged down in overexplanation. I hope that he finally managed to steer into his and Trevorrow's original vision for the trilogy (the latter retaining a story credit on this film), which retroactively makes more sense of what we experienced in The Last Jedi . It's still not my favorite, but I feel that its place in the middle of the trilogy is a bit more solidified. And let's not forget, the grim darkness of The Empire Strikes Back probably also made better sense in hindsight, after we saw Return of the Jedi.Of course it is not a perfect film. The late Carrie Fisher is used in the movie in a surprisingly convincing way through archive footage, but you can sense from some dialogues and set-ups that they had to work with what they had. The pace is hurried or even rushed at times. Decisions are made, alliances are forged, and even romances bloom at a faster pace than what would feel natural. It is noticeable that Abrams had to struggle to get his own Force Awakens plot back on track, while also tying the loose ends of The Last Jedi AND create a follow up to Return of the Jedi. He comes a long way, but lets just say that the much maligned Canto Bight subplot from Last Jedi is pretty much left hanging, and I think that is more Johnson's responsibility than Abrams'. Fortunately gone as well is much of the forced goofiness. There is lots of (droid) humor, and only at occassion did it make me roll my eyes this time.RoS just feels like a well-balanced Star Wars experience, with violent clashes and epic battles to pump our adrenalin, but also calm moments that tug our heartstrings, as it should be. The finale is a great emotional pay-off for over 40 years and 9 movies full of Star Wars moments. Sure, there are enough divisive moments. Events and character decisions that may feel left-field or poorly motivated to some, but cathartic to others. We re-visit decisive places and important people from the older movies, which may be dangerously close to fan-pleasing for some. Others will claim it is too diverse or inclusive for diversity's and inclusiveness' sake. Haters gonna hate.All I can say is that it worked for me, in surprisisingly natural ways even. I couldn't have hoped for anything better.",9,4,15,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," This year's guilty pleasure!
","Let me start this review by voicing my genuine surprise: why in the world has this movie been so well received? I know that *I* liked it, but I am not afraid to admit that I also liked the Transformers movies, the first Alien vs. Predator, The Grudge, and (here goes) the Star Wars prequels. I can't shake the feeling that if they had called this movie 'Transformers 4', nobody would have noticed the difference. As always, critics would have universally panned it for its over-reliance on big, ear-deafening action scenes, and the majority of moviegoers would have blasted it on every review site, yet somehow earning it over a 100 million dollar in box office anyway. I can only guess that the name 'Guillermo del Toro', creator of such visual treats as Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, made people let go of their Michael Bay-evoked preconceptions, and enjoy it for the fun it surely delivers. Just like the addition of 'Directed by Quentin Tarantino' can change something from 'excessively dialogue-ridden dud' to 'wonderfully inspired B-movie homage'.It is funny how many people praised the gigantic CGI-battles in this movie, where they would normally balk at such spectacles as looking fake, excessively drawn-out and so fast it is impossible to follow. Although the 3D didn't make it more comprehensible for me, it did make for some awesome sequences. Nothing we haven't seen before, though: if you know Transformers, Cloverfield, Godzilla and Independence Day, you can pretty much see where they assembled it from. 'Original', as overly stated in some reviews, is therefore not my word of choice.But, let's be fair: the influence of del Toro does manifest itself on a few occasions. More care seems to have been taken for some of the main characters than is usual in a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi get some nice background and motivation for getting inside a big robot and beating the hell out of a group of monsters. But that's about as developed as the characters get. If you've ever seen a recent blockbuster disaster movie, the rest can be easily classified: the loud-mouthed annoying bully who gets to redeem himself; the black man who gets to sacrifice himself (fortunately, he was already terminally ill); the anonymous cannon fodder, and so on.I love a good bit of comic relief, but the two 'funny scientists' in the movie made me cringe worse than John Malkovich, Ken Yeong and John Turturro did combined in Transformers 3. Fortunately, there's Ron Perlman, del Toro's secret weapon, to show that you don't need to overact hysterically in order to be funny (watch out for the scene during the credits!) The addition that a Yaeger must be operated by two symbiotically-linked people is a particularly nice touch. So, with such a spark of inspiration, you'd wonder why del Toro would make do with a screenplay that has holes large enough to accommodate the entire Yaeger battalion. I almost found myself yelling such phrases as 'why the hell didn't you use that sword three battles ago, saving precious lives and dollars?!' and 'wow, a Kaiju with an EMP, what a convenient plot device just when the story calls for some drama!' And how can two escape pods get through that Breach without a Kaiju attached to them? I am eagerly awaiting the 'How it should have ended' video for this most blatant disregard for internal logic since they built a second Death Star with another obvious design flaw. What I won't deny is that Pacific Rim is good fun. In fact, if it was del Toro's intention to make an homage to B-monster movies complete with all its genre flaws and conventions, he has succeeded gloriously. Halfway, I simply shut down my brain and enjoyed, and afterwards, I had a good laugh with the other moviegoers over the many silly things we witnessed. All in all, this is not the presumed masterpiece it is generally taken for, but a typical summer movie I enjoyed for its sheer spectacle and goofiness; I simply did not expect the main audience to embrace it so easily.",8,26,41,9 August 2013
Watchmen," Cynical mirror to the world in a dazzling visual style (for those with patience)
","In 7 years, director Zack Snyder has proved himself as a director who can deliver entertainment that meets the expectations of modern audiences in terms of pacing and spectacle, without making compromises to decent scripting or performances from his cast. Granted, his 'Sucker Punch' may not share the sophistication of his former work (and I still haven't tried 'Legend of the Guardians'; owls speaking in British accents almost screams 'Monty Python' to me), but every great director has a dream project waiting to get made after a firm reputation has been established, and it can leave us either in awe (Inception!!), or wondering 'what the hell was he thinking?' (but even 'Showgirls' had its merits). Having thoroughly enjoyed the inspired carnage of 'Dawn of the Dead', and '300', I really consider 'Watchmen' to be Snyder's Mona Lisa.I never read the novel, but I know that Watchmen is dear to a lot of people, that many thought it was unfilmable, and many were convinced it was unfilmable after seeing the result. I guess it is understandable that a story of such thematic and character-driven complexity would be narratively overwhelming, yet disappointing as an action movie for those superhero junkies expecting something like '300 X-Men'. There is always a pitfall when one wants to combine jolly good popcorn-fun with sincere drama. An uneven mix is what made 'Hulk' fall flat on its face. However, Christopher Nolan showed with 'The Dark Knight' that a comic book adaptation can be a genre movie transcending that very description. Snyder goes a step further: this is a work of art, subtly and carefully laden with symbolism, metaphor, tales of morality, allegory and even satire, blended into an exiting mix of doomsday thriller, stylish detective drama and superhero movie. 'Watchmen' asks a lot from its viewers, dissects human nature to its core. Is mankind evil? Can we be saved from ourselves? Are we even worth saving? Ambitious, certainly, and a recipe for disaster, were it not for an excellent script from (amongst others) X-Men's David Hayter, that shows us a parody of our world, on the edge of moral and physical destruction. There is no Good or Bad, only Bad and Worse. In an ideal world, superheroes would represent the best traits of mankind; in this world, the heroes are so messed up that they are hardly distinguishable from the bad guys they used to fight. The people don't even want them anymore, needing no reminder that each society gets the heroes it deserves. But the flawed vigilantes merely embody what is right and wrong in humanity itself: Rorschach is cynical and has lost all hope for mankind, yet he refuses to give in to apathy; Ozymandias seems genuinely willing to make the world better, but himself most of all; Nite Owl is honorable, but lacks drive and initiative; the Comedian, who sees mankind's black soul, and decides to be just a bit darker; and Dr Manhattan, a man of logic, who can only see the world in its physical proportions, making him all-powerful, yet without any passion or love for his fellow men. Together they are confronted with a world on the verge of annihilation as the Cold War moves closer to Armageddon. Is it in our nature to destroy ourselves? Or do we still possess the strength and will to survive? At what cost? It is a rare thing these days that a director takes ample time to let this story unfold, and that he gives each player a thorough background and motivation. Lesser directors might have put Dr Manhattan's origin story in a montage during the opening credits; yet Snyder creates a wonderfully effective comic book collage that brings us up to speed on the alternative history of this universe, and allows Dr Manhattan almost a subplot worth of time to show why he is who he is. One of my friends who didn't like the movie labeled the scene where Dan and Laurie beat up a couple of thugs in an alley as unnecessary action. I knew I didn't agree, but it forced me look again, and notice that those shots are inter-cut with Dr Manhattan's interview, in which he is accused of being a danger; his detachment from humanity becomes painfully clear, as he claims that there is no difference between a living person and a corpse. Just as the fight scene suggests that Laurie and Dan went into that alley knowing full well it could lead to trouble; they seem to relish the violence they can unleash, and savor the felling of excitement that even culminates into sex, making all the more apparent that these heroes are far out of touch with the human world.The world of the comic book is wonderfully captured, and both classical and contemporary music is used to great effect to enhance the feeling of a world that is drifting towards Armageddon. Yes, the movie is long, complex, pompous and slow, but it is well worth it that the viewer is completely immersed in the setting, and the characters are firmly established, since character-driven action plays a major part in the finale. It is also one of the reasons why the ending, although bleak, plays out so satisfying, both narratively and emotionally, and in line with the overall tone of the movie.I see an interesting parallel with 'Blade Runner', a movie also under-appreciated as slow and simplistic by many in its time, but multiple viewings allowed its audience to peel away all the layers and absorb the complex matter it represented. 'Watchmen' already faired way better at its release, but I still hope that doubters will give it a second chance, and that it might make its way back into the IMDb Top 250 one day again.",9,12,21,24 January 2012
Event Horizon," This movie went to Hell and back, and left a piece of it inside me!
","Event Horizon is one of those underrated science fiction movies with a legendary troubled production, but the finished product, despite some obvious flaws, still had a solid core that deserved to be seen. Nevertheless, it took an undeserved beating from critics, and the praises from admirers were drown out by cries of derision from detractors. But then it became a cult-phenomenon. Fans congregated on websites and learned that they were not alone in their admiration. Behind-the-scenes footage showed the intention of the filmmakers, deleted material, and sometimes a glimpse of what could have been.'Hollow', 'boring', 'overly depending on special effects' and 'not scary' were some of the complaints heard on the initial release. Well, 'not scary' is something I didn't believe from the start. I have never been able to finish this movie without a light on (especially not after hearing that last transmission played by Weir). The idea that a ship returns with a presence that can turn even the most rational person into a ragingly aggressive, mutilating animal scares me beyond anything that I can imagine. Although I am not an overly religious person, the notion that something resembling 'Hell' could physically exist is more than I want to contemplate. The potential beast inside us and others as the ultimate scare, it is a pretty original gimmick that few horror movies actually employ. With such a solid-gold premise, EH is one of the scariest movies of all time to me. It sadly is not among the very BEST scary movies ever, but it occupies a special place for me.Paul W. Anderson made a lot of not-too-memorable movies, but this 'Shining in space' guarantees him some cult-status (perhaps because he didn't write it?). The wise casting of not-too-familiar character actors makes it not completely obvious which characters are going to die. It also provides sturdy performances from Lawrence Fishburn as the plagued but determined captain, and from Sam Neill, whose surprising but believable turn towards evil in the second half is actually one of the movie's strongest assets. The ships' interior designs and props seemed a bit clunky and unrealistic to me at first, but the future isn't necessarily Star Trek perfect; EH shows us a state-of-the-art ship still very much limited by human imperfections. It is easy to see how ahead of its time this design was in the 90s, and another reason why the movie deserves a re-assessment. By giving the ship the look and feel of a church, the connection with Hell as a place where the sinners are to be judged is aptly made, showing that the makers tried to put in a subtext beyond the ordinary slasher movie. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses sweeping camera shots to capture the dark beauty, but knows to keep it steady during the action scenes. Usually, horror works best off-screen, but some of the shock effects, ranging from empty eye sockets to a horribly twisted sado-masochistic home video, are the stuff nightmares are made of, and deserve to be shown in full g(l)ory. The nerve-wrecking sound design makes these scenes perfectly timed, heart-pounding moments. But the biggest impact comes from the 'Visions from Hell', which show glimpses of some of the most gruesome images of mangling and torture ever committed to film outside of a snuff movie. Of course, I couldn't resist going through those scenes frame by frame. I really shouldn't have. I have a pretty good idea now of what Hell could look like.EH has plenty of sick and twisted greatness, but it also has its flaws. Some of the (computer-generated) special effects look unfinished, thanks to a looming release date and an unfortunately rushed production. I feel less bothered by this over time; most great films reveal their technical flaws over time. I am more concerned with what seems missing from the film. Negative test screenings necessitated additional revisions and editing, leaving no time for fine-tuning the drama. Sadly, this has become the way movie blockbusters are made these days, and sometimes it shows: the first act of the movie adequately builds up tension and anticipation, the second act delivers quite well with all the unraveling and increasing terror, but the film regrettably rushes through its final act. The straightforward finale is mostly to blame, as many of the genre's conventions take over: the guilt- stricken hero making his final sacrifice, the bad guy returning for the final showdown, and a big explosion to wrap things up. Some opportunities for important character moments were missed. While some of the crew's torments take center stage, it would have helped greatly if the other characters were more involved in the story than is the case now. Still, with the exception of two people, all cast members get their moments in the spotlights. There are no redundant characters here that I wished to have killed off. Sean Pertwee has a few of the best moments as the character who instinctively knows they're in the wrong place; Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs are the cool-headed voices of reason. Jack Noseworthy, however, feels like 'the early victim' who lacks development, and Richard T. Jones' comic relief feels a bit forced at times. EH is nowadays praised as quite daring, and influential in both movies (torture-porn?) and games. Although it may not be a masterpiece, this movie has had its long-lasting effects on me. Art isn't necessary beautiful or in good taste, and if quality can be measured in how something moves us, then EH certainly has some. Every time I watch it, I cannot help being drawn to those scenes that truly disturb me, like a ship out of Hell that is beckoning me to surrender to Evil. Every time I have seen it, I lose at least an hour of sleep over it. God knows why we mortals keep putting ourselves through this kind of mental auto-mutilation. Damn this movie!! Can't wait to see it again",8,0,1,9 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The First Order Strikes Back, but not in the way you may expect
","Over the years I have written several reviews, and adapted almost each of them one or two times over the years, because I find that how I experience a movie can change from year to year, and even from day to day. I am quite envious of people who can grasp a movie in one sitting, because that is something that rarely happens with me. Having seen The Last Jedi on its opening day, I am pretty certain that I am going to revisit it a few times, and that my opinion (and that of many other fans) will probably change over the years.I always prefer to write my reviews without spoilers, but I soon found out that this is impossible if I want to make a proper appraisal. I'll admit, I am in two minds about this movie, and the fans also seem divided, judging by some harsh reviews. But I also acknowledge that there is more than meets the eye here, and that I (we) may not be able to fully grasp TLJ until this sequel trilogy is completed in another 2 years.
 
Let me start out with the biggest compliments that I can give: TLJ is really the Empire Strikes Back of the third trilogy. It is bold, it is dark; it takes risks and dares to venture into dark terrain. This may be the least crowd-pleasing blockbuster since a long time, perhaps even for years to come. There is spectacle and substance, and although there are plenty of visual and narrative nods to the original trilogy, it is mostly referencing instead of rehashing. There is a sense of familiarity, but it is nowhere near the (highly entertaining) nostalgia recycling machine that was The Force Awakens, where Han's death was the only big gamble. TLJ opens with an epic space battle that is both funny and dramatic, and gives Poe Dameron and BB-8, two of our fine new heroes in the saga, ample time to shine and add some levity to a movie that becomes less cheerful over time. Like in Empire Strikes Back, we the find our heroes being chased by evil, and divided into two camps: one is trying to learn the ways of the Force from an old master, whereas the rest (not surprisingly, a quite racially diverse group) are desperately trying to stay out of baddies' hands, and some make a side-tour while they're at it. It's a set-up familiar from ESB and it works, as it takes some pleasant turns to the left where ESB went to the right. We learn that Luke is far from the brave Jedi who we remember; he has become desillusioned as he himself may have been partially to blame for the Dark Side's return. His redemption arc with him taking responsibility and accepting his place in the Force in the touching finale is easily one of the best elements in the film, not to mention his funny yet melancholic encounter with Yoda (although reusing that old puppet really felt unnecessarily retro amidst all those CGI porgs). Some story elements are less easily defined. Finn's subplot where he and his new sidekick end up in a place where the real victims of the conflict can be found initially felt like a cheap jab at the weapons industry, which only strays from the main plot. However, the finale suggests that this subplot is much more important than we thought, and will play out in the next film. A lot in this movie feels like set-up for the main course, rather than plot evolution in its own right. There are more elements in the film of which the merit is somewhat ambiguous to me. Director Rian Johnson (Looper, Breaking Bad) is no stranger to down-beat plot developments, and the scene where the Resistance transports are butchered one by one was one of the most agonizing scenes in the entire saga. Johnson also dares to present unexpected outcomes that we may not like, such as that Kylo Ren may be beyond redemption, the truth about Rey's parentage, and that all old wisdom about the Force is futile in the end. You could call it nihilistic and say that in the end, most of what happened in the film and what has been discovered was all for nothing. As much as I criticized TFA for playing things safe, I have to admit it was all good fun and with instant satisfaction, whereas we derive very little of that from this movie. But perhaps it is all part of a larger theme, that despite our best efforts, failure is sometimes inevitable (and can be the best teacher, as Yoda says), and that maybe the past must die in favor of the future. In that respect, in its uncompromising brutality, the only recent fantasy movie that comes close is Wolverine's Logan. And with every risk, there is always the question of whether it pays off. And to be frank, some simply don't. The most glaring example would be Supreme Leader Snoke, who was once introduced as this mysterious, incredibly powerful force, feared by the First Order and Resistance alike; a man whose backstory would be of great importance. Alas, Johnson simply sacrifices Snoke (whose Force powers should have seen this coming BTW) in order to make Ben Solo seem less whimpy. You can hate the prequels (I like them) but Anakin and the Emperor got plenty of exposition, so that we can finally understand who they are and where they came from. Maz Kenata would have been a great source of some necessary exposition, but she is criminally underused in a whimsical cameo that fails to be funny. And Captain Phasma, one of the coolest things introduced in the previous movie, should have made Finn even more miserable this time, so that he could get his revenge and a worthy battle in the final installment. But instead, all we get is a lame death after a fight that barely lasts 5 minutes. It's as if Johnson did not know what to do with the legacy of J.J. Abrams, and simply chose to toss these figures aside for cheap shock value.There are more things that simply don't work. There is nothing wrong with a running time of 150 minutes, but one hour of Luke moping around being uncooperative gets boring at one point. Silly humor and annoying creatures don't really help make it more bearable, so some tighter editing here and there would have been welcome. The final battle really doesn't amount to anything more than a Hoth-throwback where Finn can learn a cheesy lesson about saving things we love. Also, it seems as if someone organized an overacting contest, and Domnhall Gleeson was the only one to receive the memo. But at least his character gets something substantial to do, which we can't say of Benicio del Toro and Laura Dern, who are introduced as potentially interesting but ultimately served off as mere plot devices.But despite everything, I still love TLJ for its strong points, and perhaps for how it will hold up in the future. I remember not really liking ESB either, until I saw Return of the Jedi. Maybe TLJ is also a movie we cannot fully appreciate until after the fact, when we may retroactively appreciate it as a dark but essential link that tied the new trilogy together.",8,0,4,15 December 2017
Evil Dead," With all the liquid bodily fluids, a solid remake!
","When word got out that Evil Dead, one of the most beloved horror/gorefests of the previous century, would get the remake treatment, most people were less than enthusiastic. Every decent horror movie from those decades had probably already been remade, and not even classics like Halloween proved untouchable enough for studios to stay away from. Most of the time, these 'reimaginations' (as they are euphemistically called) lacked the skill, bravado or craftsmanship of the originals, and even if they managed to match their quality, they often lacked creativity, originality or daring vision.I love the original Evil Dead films for their energetic pacing and humorously icky approach to horror, so I wasn't convinced either that an Evil Dead remake was something the world needed. On the other hand, I was too young to watch the Evil Dead films when they came out, so they are not sacred to me, and I like to keep an open mind to all developments in the horror genre. Unexpectedly, the new Evil Dead was released with high praise from many critics and fans, and as far as I'm concerned, Evil Dead can take its place among The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) as horror remakes that can peacefully coexist with their respective originals. Why? Because they take what was good from the original, yet also add something new. They start on the same road, yet don't walk it all the way to the end, taking the occasional sidetrack that brings a few surprises.Both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell co-produced the movie, stating a desire to revisit their beloved first project, and do things with it they had not done yet. Usually, when the original creators say something like that, it seems to mean that they were notified about the remake, and received a sum of money in exchange for taking an executive producer's credit and providing active support for the new movie. But Evil Dead Reborn is different. The original film had such a massively inventive display of special effects and in-your-face energy that it was easy to look beyond the holes in the screenplay and the technical shortcomings; audiences these days won't fall for that so easily, but the writers came up with a great screenplay that allows for plenty of scares and physical horror, without resorting to a lazily-written re-thread. We start out on comfortably familiar grounds, in a cabin in the woods, where a group of young people inadvertently awaken an old evil that takes possession of them, one by one. One of the nice touches is that when the terror starts affecting the ex-drug addict, the rest initially explains it away as on of her drug withdrawal hallucinations. Needless to say, when they finally get smart and want to leave, the bridge is gone and there is no escape. One big departure this movie takes from the original is the tone. Where the original movies were violent and gruesome, yet appropriately slapstick due to the anarchistic photography and excessive amounts of gore, the remake is more serious, sincerely terrifying, nerve-wrecking, and has some well-timed shocks. Two aspects of the originals were kept: the frenetic pacing, and the copious amounts of bodily fluids. Where most horror movies muddle through introductions and set-up, and don't pick up speed until well after an hour (leaving only thirty minutes until the end), this movie shifts into high gear after 25 minutes, and keeps speeding up until the end. And in a day and age where studios try to contain the amount of splatter in order to not scare off the general public and keep the movie financially profitable, we get showered with amounts of gore quite unheard of since the eighties. I found it disturbingly pleasant to see such an old-school amount of blood, rotting flesh and severed appendages flying around, which could have easily become ridiculous, yet nowhere does it completely undermine the creepy punch the movie delivers.Although not overtly goofy as its predecessors, this movie isn't without its subtle yet crude humor, for instance when Eric slips over a piece of skin that Olivia has just cut from her face; the improvised amputation with an electric knife, the nail gun antics, and the final appearance of the true star of each Evil Dead movie: the chainsaw, which makes for good old-fashioned mayhem. It is fun to see how the creators have added new elements, such as the Abomination, and found ways to present big and small elements from the originals with inventive twists. Of course, many people will think the original was perfect, and the remake is useless by default; they complain that it is too much of the same, or straying too far from the source. Some say it is ridiculous with dumb characters. Well, what horror movies doesn't contain characters doing unwise things? Most horror plots are actually moving forward due to people doing ill-advised stuff. What can we say? Times change. The original movies had their shortcomings as well, but they were a perfect product of their time, and work exceptionally well within that context. The makers of the remake acknowledged that modern audiences have different perspectives of horror movies, and I think they did a fine job translating Evil Dead to a new era. Bruce Campbell himself helped to get it made, and he concludes the movie in a post-credits scene with his signature 'Groovy!' Who am I to argue with Ash?",8,2,5,12 February 2014
Thor," Don't mess with the God of Thunder!
","I have never been very familiar with Thor the Marvel Hero, so I can't say that I was very enthusiastic about a movie with Thor in it at first; having seen screen shots with long-haired men in shiny armor, I feared for something unintentionally ridiculous like Catwoman. When I heard that Ken Branagh was taking the directorial duties, I was somewhat reassured that they would at least make a serious attempt to get something good out of it. But, this being a movie about gods with super powers, I was still less than convinced that they could make something out of it that was both entertaining and engaging.When the reviews came in quite positively, I decided to give Thor a chance, and I am glad to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Mixing fantasy with reality in a believable, non-corny way is no small feat, but Branagh and his team pulled it off greatly.The start was shaky at best, though. The narrated prologue was quite hectic, throwing in vague concepts and weird creatures in a train of fast-cut, badly lit and shaky action scenes, making it hard to make any heads or tails from it, either story-wise or visually. However, then the story slows down considerably and things start to make sense. The rest of the movie is well-balanced between a story of a troubled and arrogant young warrior who has to find his place and prove himself worthy, and some energetic action scenes where you CAN discern what happens, who hits who and what explodes. The feeling I had after seeing the first Iron Man movie certainly comes to mind.Even though I make the comparison with Iron Man, I also should point out that Thor will require a bigger part of your imagination. The flying suit in Iron Man also needs some stretch of the mind, but it is still basically very advanced technology. Thor requires that you accept the existence of immortal superior beings within our world, edging much more into the realm of fantasy. As I said, I was curious if Branagh could handle this 'clash' between reality and mythology without becoming either too serious or too campy, but he succeeds, by using these situations to great comical effect, again balancing it skillfully against the dramatic moments.He has some excellent actors to thank as well. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as a superhero who has to be tough, cocky, but at times fragile and funny as well. Same goes for Tom Hiddleston, who is both devious and likable, making for a convincing bad guy. And last but not least, sir Anthony Hopkins in a part that requires his greatness, divinity and fatherly strictness for a change; all too often, he seems to be cast just to give movies some British stage class and grandeur, but here he is the right man for the part. The 3D presentation of this movie doesn't really add that much; it makes for some nice action scenes, but the 3D rendering has the unfortunate adverse effect of considerably darkening scenes, which was problematic in the prologue and some more scenes that are already dark in themselves. So I'll be looking forward to the 2D BluRay version.So I certainly recommend seeing this movie, and I even suggest that you sit out the end-credits for the traditional Marvel productions post-credit scene, the best so far in my opinion.",8,2,5,24 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A crowd-pleaser, but one with the full power of the Force!
","Let me start by saying: Wow! J.J. Abrams did it again! Like Star Trek before it, Star Wars is ready to take old and new generations of fans on a new journey. This is probably THE Star Wars movie that most people have waited for since Return of the Jedi. But I have to be frank: I liked the prequels. Don't hold it against me. They have their fans, despite what some say and think. It was George Lucas' attempt to show the bigger picture, the politics of this Galaxy Far Far Away; how it not only revolved around the actions of a few individuals but entire populations and governments. And most importantly, how it could have become an evil Empire. At the very least it enabled us to look at the original films and Darth Vader from another perspective. Unfortunately, the depiction of that era took away a bit of the rugged, dirty and lived in environments and the small, personal storyline that hallmarked the old trilogy. And let's be clear: it is hard to make prequels very surprising and fresh, since we know how they end. Even Peter Jackson had to find that out the hard way.But, that said, I am very pleased to say that the old feeling is back in full Force. J.J. Abrams always said that he wanted to make a successor in the spirit of the old trilogy, and he succeeded. From Lost, Star Trek, Cloverfield and Super 8, we know how J.J. Abrams is a master in taking old and familiar elements and putting them back together in surprisingly fresh ways, which is exactly what he did here. We are back to a story of exploration, where unassuming heroes venture into unfamiliar territory, the same elements that made the original trilogy so exiting. Fans will be pleased that the road is paved with familiar sights, old friends, and dark, ominous locations which seem far removed from the clean look of the prequels. Politics are conspicuously left out, and the threat of danger is tangible throughout the movie. And a great cast of not-too-well-known actors understands the B- movie nature of the movie without overdoing it (somethings the prequels were notorious for, I'll admit).If I have to make one obvious point of criticism, it is that it may all feel a bit too familiar. In approaching the old atmosphere and plotting of the original Star Wars, the makers have spared no expense to hint, nod, wink, reference and pay homage to their favorite episodes. The prequels dared to take risks and got into directions that alienated a lot of fans. This episode is playing it much more safe, perhaps a bit too much. If I had a checklist, my guess would be that half the scenes contain a direct reference or re-used plot point from earlier in the series (some more blatant than others). The hardcore fans are guaranteed a nerdgasm virtually every 5 minutes, which explains the extremely favorable first reactions to the movie. At certain points it just becomes a bit too obvious that they want to remind us how cool they are by trying to imitate the cool kids. But, in all fairness, in the key scenes, it works just fine. There are unforgettable moments that make great use of the previously established legacy that is Star Wars, such as the chillingly solemn epilogue. And they haven't forgotten to bring it with a light touch (leave it to Han Solo and his hairy sidekick!). Some of the crowd-pleasing moments had me laugh, some were so über-geeky that they made me think AND laugh, and others made me cheer like a 9-year-old. And in the truly unique scenes, they manage to find a beating heart in the story, remind us of all the great moments that came before, and present things to keep us guessing for what is to come. This movie is a good continuation, a great stand-alone movie, as well as a promise for what is to come. Past, present and future well balanced. Can't wait for Episode VIII!",9,10,30,16 December 2015
A Night at the Roxbury," A Night to NOT Remember!
","There have been several Saturday Night Live skits that were a perfect inspiration for a great feature-length comedy, like Blues Brothers, Coneheads and Wayne's World, but this pathetic excuse for a comedy begs the question of how it ever got made.I have sat through many Pauly Shore, Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler comedies that were enjoyable in their own cringeworthy way, because the jokes were in bad taste but at least they made me laugh. This film doesn't have a single gag in it that made me crack up, I never got beyond an uneasy smile (thank you for that, Michael Clarke Duncan). Not only is the script unbelievably bad, but the performances really made my eyes bleed.You'd think that the premise of two deluded losers who try to talk their way into an exclusive nightclub would be a perfect set-up for some good comedy, but it's not. This part of the movie is over in 45 minutes, and the rest of the movie is a badly written attempt to extend the plot with some scattered ideas to get the film up to feature length. But a bad script doesn't have to be the death blow to a comedy as long as the jokes are good and the actors can deliver. But the only thing worse than the script or lack of jokes are the excruciating performances by Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. Their clearly improvised exercise in hysterics really got on my nerves, and their attempts at picking up women are unbelievably creepy rather than funny. The #metoo movement could submit this film as evidence for how women were mistreated in the 1990s.Clearly there are people who really like this movie, and that's okay. There are dozens of movies that score below 5.0 that I like. But how this ever got to a 6.3 here on IMDb is beyond me. No wonder that Chazz Palminteri remained uncredited (by choice, I hope). Even Freddy Got Fingered had more inspired jokes than this film. The only area where they put in some effort was the cool 90s soundtrack (although even Haddaway's 'Baby Don't Hurt Me' got stale after hearing it for the tenth time). I have a lot of good nostalgia for the era, but this movie is not part of it.",3,0,0,6 March 2020
Godzilla," Great build-up, less great tear-down
","In a time where remakes and reboots cause increasing rolling of eyes from moviegoers, I think that lots of people weren't sorry to hear that Godzilla would get a make-over. The last incarnation from 16 years ago didn't please too many people, although I have to admit that I had a good time with the pulpy B-movie-type creature-feature that Roland Emmerich delivered. Sure, the script was substandard and most of the actors were out-performed by the beast, but there was plenty of action and random destruction to have a good time.This reboot, however, takes its subject matter much more seriously, which is good, because Godzilla is a beloved character with a long history, an iconic presence, and an entire mythology that is just waiting to be explored, something the 1998 version infamously didn't. Godzilla isn't a mutated lizard here, but a mythical primordial creature that has been here since the beginning. The opening scenes, where Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins make a startling discovery, which has devastating consequences for Brian Cranston and his family, are great and suspenseful. They set the tone for the first half of the movie, which has a pleasant what-the-hell-is- going-on-here mood. The big budget is used for some spectacular vistas of deserted cities, mass scenes and random destruction, but it does not distract from the plot. Brian Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson take the viewer on a journey to make sense of all their discoveries, and I must say that there are some surprises along the way that the trailers had carefully hidden. Godzilla gets a few enemies in the form of vicious mega-parasites, which makes him the hero for a change, and builds up a lot of anticipation for their confrontation.It is in the second half where, sadly, those expectations are not all met. Brian Cranston's character meets his unfortunate and unexpected demise, so that Taylor-Johnson gets promoted to the lead. However, he can't match Cranston's rugged charisma and authority, and the dramatic story arc that gave the first half such an impulse gets a bit muddled in the conventional weaknesses inherent to the genre, such as predictability (the monsters just 'happen' to converge where Taylor-Johnson's loved ones are) and excessive disregard for logic ('Let's give the parasites an EMP!' 'Does that make any sense at all?' 'No, but it looks cool and makes are heroes vulnerable!'). Elizabeth Olsen is definitely the more talented sibling of the Olsen family, but she is underused in a typical damsel-in-distress role.Still, I'll gladly look past such weaknesses in an otherwise decent script, but we watch creature features for all the rampaging, mayhem and mass destruction as well. That's where the movie is a bit lacking: Godzilla enters quite late; we see him very sparingly, pushing away some ships and taking some fire; the parasites squash a few people and tear down one or two buildings, but most of the carnage occurs off-screen or through a monitor. There is lots of collateral damage, but too often we only see the aftermath or just a trail of destruction; when Godzilla and the parasites are about to face-off, the camera quickly cuts away. I understand that they were probably saving it for the finale, which was satisfactory, but the climax felt a bit rushed and underwhelming in light of all the waiting. I did not expect to ever say this, but with a little more focus on action than on story, I would have been more thrilled and on the edge of my seat. I had several things to say against Pacific Rim, but that movie DID show a whole range of death matches between large creatures beating the hell out of each other, that made up for all the silliness and plot holes in the script. On the plus side, the special effects look great and very realistic, and the disaster scenes that we get to see are convincing.So, to sum up, I think that this is the story treatment that Godzilla deserves, but not necessarily the movie. He seems to be playing a supporting role in his own movie, and although this may have been done as to not take away the mystery, I hope that he can claim his rightful leading role in the inescapable sequel.",7,9,15,16 May 2014
Warcraft," A decently (war)crafted game adaptation, but what's the hurry?
","Duncan Jones made a name for himself as a director of highly intelligent science-fiction movies with a fair dose of humanism, so he sounded like an ideal guy to deliver a game adaptation that would stand out as really good for a change. Choosing Warcraft was risky, however, since it has become a multi-game franchise over the decades, one with its own complex story lines, characters and mythology. Distilling a story thread out of a game's lore that is cinematically satisfying while still doing justice to the gaming experience is a trap that many a director has fallen into. So the question is: did Jones succeed? My answer is: yes and no. Although I have played my share of Warcraft, I am no hardcore fan or connaisseur (I sort of lost interest halfway through WCIII: Frozen Throne), but I cannot deny that Jones delivered a pretty convincing visual representation of how I remember the Warcraft universe. The cities and castles look impressive and lush; the Orcs look physically imposing, realistic and dangerous, but they never become mindless beasts; and the colorful human armors and weapons are instantly recognizable from the games. The battle scenes look impressive and brutal, without going into much gory and appendage-shedding details (since teens should also be able to enjoy this). The CGI, often the scapegoat that disappointed audiences aim for, looks almost flawless here, and convincingly helps to create this universe. It was a prudent move of Jones to cast mainly Caucasian actors as the Orcs, because many directors before him had to battle allegations of racism for having a tribal people played by non-white actors. Both humans, Orcs and half-breeds are portrayed by a diverse mix of ethnicities now, which works fine.But did Jones really need to be in such a rush to get the story told? I haven't kept a score, but the first 15 minutes introduces about 5 different locations, 10 characters and maybe 7 unique terms. It is as if the entire first act contains more information than both 'Moon' and 'Source Code' combined. I love a bit of fast pacing, but here I got exhausted to keep up with this frenetic storytelling. Jones' scripts are usually pretty well- written, but here it is easily the source of most of the movie's shortcomings, or maybe it is in the editing. I had the distinct feeling that this was originally a 3-hour movie that had to be cut back to 2 hours on studio demand. Many characters are thrown in with little to no introduction (it's usually not a good sign if you have to learn character names from the end credits); some of the peoples (Elves and Dwarfs mainly) are merely referenced, so you never get a sense that Azaroth is such a diversely populated world; and some sequences evoke the feeling that a lot of exposition is missing (even some of the action scenes lack coherence). That makes it difficult to get absorbed into the story, or care for the characters, despite some nice, unexpected twists at the end, which would have worked much more satisfyingly had we known the characters better. Maybe I am spoiled by Game Of Thrones, where I get to know and love the characters over the course of many hours, and feel genuine heartache when they get killed off, but Jones should really have put more effort in building a solid foundation with a backstory and the characters.So, a nice visual attempt to make a faithful game adaptation, but again, the difficulty of translating game to screen is showing. I had a good time with it, but as the subtitle says: it is a beginning, and hopefully a good starting point for a better fleshed-out sequel.",7,2,3,9 June 2016
