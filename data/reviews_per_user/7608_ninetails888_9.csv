Insidious: Chapter 2," How Does It Compare to the First?
","The Lambert Family moves to a new house to leave behind their terrifying experience with ghosts in the first house, only to learn that the spirits are not done with them and the mystery that connects them to the spirit world so strongly has not yet been solved.The original Insidious (2010) is one of the scariest films I've ever seen and I highly recommend it. It had cool old-school scares and some creepy violin music, making it a sort of homage to old ghost films. How did the sequel compare?In a lot of ways, Insidious: Chapter 2 resembles Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. The plots have very similar features (and once you watch this film, you'll know what I'm talking about), and the cinematography in Insidious: Chapter 2 is very similar to The Shining, with all of their tracking shots, it just seems like The Shining with a twist.But I'm not saying this isn't a fun film. I actually enjoyed myself at this one and I think you are going to enjoy yourself at this one if you're a fan of the original because Chapter 2 definitely panders to the fans. The twist, especially, panders to people having previously viewed Insidious. I don't think it's as easy to enjoy yourself at this having not already seen Insidious, because most of the film relies on you having information based on what happened in the first film.The story in Insidious: Chapter 2 is pretty ridiculous but the actors really make it work, especially Patrick Wilson. He's a great actor and has given solid performances in everything I've seen him in. Rose Byrne gives an equally great performance as the mom, the sort of Shelley DuVall like character. The script was where I had most of my problems. There are sometimes one- liners by these two ghost-hunter guys that are trying to be funny but only just take you out of the moment and wrecked all the suspense previously building up. There were clich√©d and cheesy moments but for the most part, they didn't take you out of the story.Insidious: Chapter 2 is a fun film to experience and I did enjoy myself. The performances were stellar and James Wan's reliance on old-school scares hasn't failed him so far. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of the original. I give Insidious: Chapter 2 a B-.Insidious: Chapter 2 is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence, and thematic elementsREAD MY FULL REVIEW AND MORE AT www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com",6,0,0,14 January 2014
American Hustle," One of the Best of 2013
","Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a con-man, unhappily married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), with whom he has a child. One day, he meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who he falls in love with and begins a con business with. Their relationship complicates when an FBI Agent named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) comes into the picture. American Hustle stars a slew of incredibly talented actors, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Renner, Louis C.K. and Michael Pena. It features one of the best ensembles of any movie this year and Jennifer Lawrence shows her comedic chops that she rarely shows in her films. The stand-out performances are Cooper, Adams and Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was a perfect balance between hilarious, crazy and heartfelt while Adams made her character her own. Amy Adams deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role and quite possibly Jennifer Lawrence does too. Bradley Cooper was fantastic as FBI Agent Richie DiMaso who wanted the get politicians to accept bribes so he can arrest them. The screenplay is also Oscar-worthy, like most everything in the film. It's fresh, in-your-face and forces you to come along on the ride and work. It doesn't take its audience to be idiots like some films and is smart and hilarious. American Hustle is a film like no other this year. It's fresh, funny, fierce. It's bold, sad but at the same time uplifting. It's also wildly entertaining. American Hustle is one of the best films of the year.I give American Hustle an A.American Hustle is rated R for pervasive language, some sexual content and brief violenceREAD MY FULL REVIEW AND MORE AT www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com",9,0,4,14 January 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Stop Dreaming. Start Living.
","I'm a fan of Ben Stiller's directorial work and comedic work and he's a pretty talented guy. Zoolander, a film which he starred in and directed is bold and hilarious and a very fun time. But The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is different. It's much more serious and dramatic than a lot of his other roles. It gives Ben Stiller a chance to expand as a filmmaker and show how well of a visual director he is and if he can handle directing serious material. I understand critics are split on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Audiences, for the most part, love it but on Rotten Tomatoes, critics have given this film a 50% which means 50% of critics enjoyed the film. It's kind of a love-it or hate-it film. I'm on the side that really enjoyed it. It's messages are simple, clear and relevant. America is known for being a generally lazy country and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is trying to inspire people to go and live their dream and do something great with their lives. It has a lot to say about following your dreams and says it clearly and in an entertaining fashion.Ben Stiller's performance as Walter Mitty is stellar and engaging. Walter Mitty is a mild-mannered, shy guy and Stiller hits the nail on the head. It's interesting to see Kristin Wiig take on some serious material. She still has a couple of funny lines but for the most part, her character is a dramatic one. She handles it very well and is likable. One of the film's flaws are the characters. There are a lot of generic characters that are hardly given any development including Adam Scott and Sean Penn's character. That didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the film, though. The film almost entirely centers around Walter Mitty and his character is given a lot of attention to detail.Ben Stiller proves himself as a dramatic director in this specifically and a visual director. The film is breathtaking in terms of visuals. The cinematography is something different than what you usually see in mainstream films. It sort of resembles Wes Anderson's without being a total rip-off. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a very fun time and a very good movie. It's worth your money.I give The Secret Life of Walter Mitty a B+.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",8,1,2,19 January 2014
Brave," 'If you had the chance to change your fate, would you?'
","Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) doesn't want to be a princess. She wants to be free and fire arrows into the sunset, but most importantly, change her fate. When she stumbles upon a witch's hut in the woods, The Witch (Julie Walters) gives her a potion to which Merida thinks will change her mother, Elinor (Emma Thompson)'s mind about Merida getting married. The potion does more than Merida asked for. PIXAR is the best animation studio right now but last year the put out Cars 2 which I didn't like and found it a huge disappointment, being a big fan of Cars. I think they redeemed themselves with Brave and the short that shows before the feature, La Luna. Brave has great voice-overs and fantastic Scottish-accents. I didn't find the accents annoying and I don't think they got in the way of the viewing experience although others might disagree. I thought the voice- overs were great. The animation was spectacular as it always is with PIXAR. You can really see the facial expressions well so the viewer can interpret the character's feelings without them talking. The animation was just awesome. I give Brave a B+. For more reviews, go to www.thecheapseatsmoviereviews.weebly.com",8,2,3,13 October 2012
Zombieland," Just read the bottom...I don't believe in letting you read my summary and determine whether you think the movie will be good or not. Read my review.
","This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I told my dad it would go down as an American classic but he highly disagrees but you can still tell he loved the movie. I think all of the actors were picked accurately to play their roles (why did you casting directors think of Megan Fox for Wichita?).Bill Murray will probably get the award for Best Cameo in history (there is no such award but if there was, he should win it.)Jesse Eisenberg was so perfect for Columbus! He has that scardey-cat essence in him.Abigail Breslin, I bet enjoyed making this film (as any 13-year-old kid would), and she was superb in it.Emma Stone was great and I wouldn't have been able to imagine any one else for Wichita and she did really good! Maybe one of the best performances of the movie (besides Woody Harrelson).Woody Harrelson was truly the best of this movie. He was the funniest (e.g. 'You weren't exactly stormin' the trenches before I came in') person in it and the awesomest! GO ZOMBIELAND!p.s. see this movie.",7,1,3,8 August 2011
Rango," I Don't Get What What All The Fuss Is About...
","I don't get what all the fuss is about. This movie had everything it NEEDED just nothing really EXTRA. It was just raw and boring. I actually fell asleep in the movie theater for about 15 minutes! The plot was horrible, too. A lot of people liked this movie, I don't know why, BUT I DIDN'T.Rango (Johnny Depp)-did OK in this movie. It was definitely not his best but a good performance. To me, he brought one of the best performances along with Abigail Breslin. Miss Bean (Ilsa Fisher)-had a very uninteresting character to me. She gave her all to her performance, you can tell, but it still wasn't enough to make her character the best it could be (but I did enjoy the accent.)Priscilla (Abigail Breslin)-had a great performance and it completely matched Johnny Depp's. She had a great accent (perhaps better than Ilsa Fisher) and fantastic acting.Mayor (Ned Beatty)-did just OK in this movie. I thought his performance in Toy Story 3 was great and it was better than his performance in Rango.",5,2,7,20 April 2011
Despicable Me," Best Movie from 2010!
","Despicable Me was DEFINITELY the best movie of 2010 possibly of the last decade! I left the theater loving it and thinking 'I am so gonna buy this when it gets on DVD' and sure enough, I got it for Christmas with an inflatable minion. This movie had an all-star cast and they all gave their best performances!Steve Carrell as Gru-Steve did an amazing job with a fantastic accent. His acting was splendid and his character was really something. Gru's Best Lines: 'You have to be pulling on my leg!' 'We stole the statue of liberty! The small one from Las Vegas!' Jason Segal as Vector-Vector was by far the best character! Vector is just a nerd who can do big things. Thank goodness Vector is a super villain or else he would be a target of every kind of bully imaginable. Jason Segal had the right voice and everything for Vector. Best Vector Lines: 'A little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby to- AAHH! Curse you tiny toilet!' 'NO I'M NOT PLAYING WITH IT!'Miranda Cosgrove as Margo-Miranda has the perfect voice to play Margo and the right attitude. She is the only person they could have picked to pull of this character. She says all these witty things that only a Margo could say. She takes care of her sisters and is a great character to the story. Best Margo Line: 'What about the air? Can we touch the air?' Dana Gaier as Edith-Edith is a ruffian and just awesome. She is the tough one out of the three orphans and she is the one who has many funny moments. I think Dana did an excellent job playing her, she had a perfect voice to fit Edith's rough personality. Best Edith Lines: 'Oops' 'It poked a hole in my juice box' 'What? I'm just walking'Elsie Fisher as Agnes-Elsie was really cute and adorable in this movie. Its hard to believe a girl this little could voice a character just as good as veteran actors such as Steve Carrell and Russell Brand. Most everyone knows her for her funny lines. Elsie Fisher is going to become a BIG star one day, mark my words. Best Agnes Lines: 'Does this count as annoying?' 'Its so fluffy I'm gonna die!' 'IT'S SO FLUFFY!' 'My unicorn! You have to fix it!'Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario-I was surprised when I heard Russell Brand played a super old guy. He didn't seem like his voice could pull off old. I will admit he did the worst acting in the movie but still a GOOD performance. His character was interesting, I guess. Best Dr. Nefario Lines: 'BOOGIE!' 'I was wondering under what circumstances would we need this?' Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie-Funny stuff! Every scene with Miss Hattie in it was funny and enjoyable. She had a great accent and such a funny personality. She seemed Despicable and desperate. Kristen Wiig did a great job as Miss Hattie and whoever did casting, I would pick them if I was making a movie. Kristen Wiig was perfect. Best Miss Hattie Lines: 'Look at my face! Do you still think it's a great sale day?!' 'I purchased a Spanish dictionary. I didn't like what you said about me' 'We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the box of shame. Would we? No?' 'Go clean something of mine'Julie Andrews as Gru's Mom-Julie Andrews is too sweet to play such a Despicable woman. She crushed her son's dreams and laughed. I will make this one brief, good acting bad voice. Best Gru's Mom Lines: 'You're too late son. NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.' 'Eh'GREAT MOVIE!!!!",10,0,0,20 April 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Remember Who The Enemy Is
","I read Catching Fire even before the first Hunger Games movie came out and I was impressed with the whole series, not only The Hunger Games. Is the movie adaptation of Catching Fire worthy of the book?My answer is yes. In many ways, it surpasses the book. Jennifer Lawrence, who has no relation to the director Frances Lawrence, breathes life into the character of Katniss and no one could play it better. There is no question that Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast and an amazing actress who has not only proved her abilities in this film and the original The Hunger Games but last years Silver Linings Playbook and the indie gem Winter's Bone. She brings the ferocity necessary to her role but not only brings what is necessary but adds to the character which is the best an actress or actor can do.The supporting cast, lead by Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are all great. The only actress I had a problem with was Jena Malone because although she shined her some scenes, particularly her interview with Stanley Tucci's hilarious game-show host character, Caeser Flickerman, she overacted a lot in the arena. Josh Hutcherson gives a strong performance as Peeta, also.Francis Lawrence breathes new life into the film and although doing a tremendous job, I'm surprised that he was chosen as the director. So many crazy-talented directors were considered such as Alfonso Cuaron, director of this year's Gravity which is thought to be a tough competitor for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Special Effects, Tomas Alfredson, director of one of the best vampire films ever made, Let the Right One In, and Bennett Miller, director of the 2011 success Moneyball and Capote, starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then you have Lawrence, the director of the decent I Am Legend but I have to say, he did an outstanding job. The arena scenes are intense as they should be and the ideas that were only explored a tiny bit in the first are almost completely fleshed out. He made a thought-provoking and insanely entertaining film. My only complaint is the writing. I loved how it completely dove into these darker ideas that were always kind of lurking in the shadows in the first film but in the second one, they're fully exposed but the love scenes between Katniss and Peeta can get pretty cheesy. Luckily, the actors have the skill to make them more bearable.I really did like The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and I thought it was better than the original source material and the first film so if the movies go at this rate, this will probably be a film series that many more are compared to in terms of quality. I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire an A-.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",8,5,23,19 January 2014
Her," A Moving Look at a Not-So-Distant Future
","Her is a contemporary film that tells the story of a man who falls in love with his computer operating system. Sounds bizarre, right? But is it good, let alone believable? Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect performance as the main character, Theodore. Her is a very character-driven film and great chemistry between the actors and actresses is necessary as well as dialogue that isn't corny, and in Her, Phoenix does a lot of staring off into space because he's listening to Samantha, not physically interacting with her because she isn't a physical being. He conveys so much emotion with just his face. He's perfectly cast.Scarlett Johansson gave one of her best performances as Samantha, the operating system. She was completely snubbed at most of the award shows for Best Supporting Actress and her performance showed so much emotional depth just through her voice.Spike Jonze's screenplay is easily one of the best of the year. It's plot is so refreshing, original and engaging that it's hard not to get caught up in this story. The film's screenplay has its fair share of funny moments while also being insanely thought-provoking and most of the time, moving. Each character feels very complex and each character has multiple layers. It's fascinating to see characters this emotionally developed and real. And one of the best things about this screenplay is that it doesn't always take its bizarre concept incredibly seriously. Jonze knows his film's plot is bizarre and doesn't treat it like it isn't. Jonze is very self-aware and insightful.The cinematography in Her is immaculate and was definitely subbed for Achievement in Cinematography in the Academy Awards for Hoyte Van Hoytema's beautiful work. The film also has an interesting color- palette, consisting mostly of pinks and reds and light blues which give the film a unique, vibrant look. The score for the film is equally brilliant and contributes to the vibrant, colorful feel that's present throughout.Her is a beautiful, poignant film that explores adult relationships to the extreme while also exploring how huge technology is modern culture and how close humans and their computers are becoming. Her explores human emotions until there's little left to explore. It blends social commentary with very real characters so effortlessly and is still visually-striking. Her is a genius film and one of my favorite films of all time.Read all my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!",10,1,3,19 January 2014
