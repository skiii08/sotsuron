The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch project
","Three Americans get lost in the woods. Terrible camera work made itlook very amateur, i'm pretty sure the director even tried to cheat the audience by using two cameras (one of which is obviously noticeable as it is black and white). No music either which is a shame, as i'm pretty sure some of the scenes could have done with some hammer horror style chords and screeches. The lack of any on screen antagonist also decreases its credibility. Although at one point you CAN hear an owl. The three so called actors aren't that good, as i've never seen them in anything else. Another bad move for the director. I think this film would have worked far better with Nicolas Cage, Steve Buscemi and Salma Hayek as the main actors.Basically lots of shouting, rustling and screaming for about 90 minutes.",3,2,5,8 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars episode I - The Phantom Menace
","Without spoiling too much.Arguably THE best Star wars (and sci-fi) movie ever made.Set before the others, and confusingly made AFTER the IV , V and VI , but as i say before II and III, this contains everything.Love, guns, light sabers, terrifying aliens and spaceships. This has better special Fx than IV, V and VI and definitely contains the best characters. Ewan McGregor steals the show though with his blazing performance as Obi Wan, as he fights off the empire.This time though the Empire are using robots! OMFG! You get to see the early stages of Darth Vaders childhood as Darth Maul, before he got his space suit. There's even a race through a desert and everything. This is set somewhere in space, so despite some scenes being slightly unbelievable (practically every scene with Natalie Portman) it's definitely a film you'll be talking about for years.Sadly the franchise slips downhill after number III, and you can't help wondering if Ridley Scott made the others just for the money.But who's to complain with a gem like this? 10/10 Shits all over Star Trek.",10,13,22,8 November 2009
Titanic," Titanic
","Without spoiling too much it's about this old woman who has a dream about this ship that is going to sink.She has to stop it before it's too late and has this piece of jewellery that will somehow prevent it from hitting an iceberg and sinking.Unfortunately the ship is full of guests and they're having a party on it, so in order to get on board she has to pretend she is a young scallywag (played by none other than Leonardo DI Caprio) and infiltrate the ship.Unfortunately she gets tangled up in a bitter sweet lesbian affair with a woman who shares her name (all the while pretending he's a man AND trying to stop the ship from sinking!)and fails to notice the giant iceberg which hits the ship. The party is ruined and there's not enough boats.I'm not going to spoil the end, but i'll leave you with a question...Will the titanic sink? Will the old lady (Leonardo Di Caprio) save the day or will the posh young lady ruin everything? Oh and look out for Celine Dions band who are playing on the ill-fated ship.",3,5,10,8 November 2009
The Matrix," Best action film ever made.... Ever!
","Without spoiling too much it's about this bloke called Neil who works in an office. He has a dream about a black fella called Morpheo who wants him to play a computer game called 'Matrix'.In a nutshell, in order for Neil to play this computer game, he has to jump off a building and fire some guns in real life, before he's allowed to be plugged in to the computer.In the computer world he has a magic coat, which stops bullets and can make him fly. Basically Neil the office worker becomes Neil Matrix and has to fight off some robots in the computer game.But what Neil or Morpheo DON'T know is that the police are after him because of 'Matrix' (not sure why to be honest), but the police are like magic detectives in black suits and they have EXACTLY the same powers as Neil Matrix (and his magic friends).It's very hard to explain because of all the words in the film, but if you like films about magic men in coats playing computer games and getting chased by robots AND the police, then this is not to be missed.But Neil Matrix is the BEST character EVER played Keano Reeves (and that's saying something!!!1!'",9,0,1,8 November 2009
