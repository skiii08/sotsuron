Blade Runner 2049," The Best Sequel of all Time...
","To call this the best sequel of all time may sound a bit too hasty. It is October 7th, and the movie came out yesterday. However, after viewing this movie TWICE within that time frame, I can safely say that Blade Runner: 2049 is my favorite sequel of all time. Is it my favorite movie of all time? We'll see.To avoid any spoilers, I really just want to talk about perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie, besides plot: the cinematography. Holy cow, does Roger Deakins deliver with his photographing skills. I couldn't name a single shot in the film that you wouldn't want to hang up on a wall. From filthy streets to smoggy skylines, audiences feel immediately in awe of Ridley Scott's dystopian hellscape. Not only are these features inspiring, but they are also incredibly immersive. Perhaps more than the first film, you feel like every bystander and every individual in the movie has some unique personality and history. Numerous long takes pan throughout, and viewers have plenty of time to soak in the admittedly emotional scenes throughout. Impatient viewers be warned: this film is slow and contemplative, just like the original. Those who readily watch the film, however, will surely be rewarded.I could go on and on about other aspects. The soundtrack. It's different. It's not Vangelis. Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch deliver an original, emotional, and powerful score that coincides with much of the equally powerful ambiance. I could talk about editing too, though, the long takes reduce that tactics necessity a bit. This isn't an action film, at least a 'traditional' one. With takes lasting upwards of what seems like ten seconds each (with exceptions, of course), scenes play out with limited cutting. You won't have trouble taking everything in setting and props. In fact, paying attention to these things is crucial to understanding the film. Villeneuve won't hold your hand, but he certainly won't make it difficult to follow, either.",10,5,15,6 October 2017
