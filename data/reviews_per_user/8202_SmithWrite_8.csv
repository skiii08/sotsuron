The Ring," Whatever happened to logic?
","This was one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a while. Although the premise is excellent and the images creepy, the total lack of logic both in the overall storyline and individual scenes made it so unbelievable that I stopped being scared long before the ending.SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERSThe niece Katie's attitude towards the tape seems inconsistent.  She doesn't tell her best friend until the witching hour is upon them (and then makes fun of the idea), yet she tells her much younger cousin she doesn't have much time left.  Also how did the rumor of the tape get started? Supposedly the tape got made by Katie and her friends trying to record a football game. If so, she and her friends were the first victims, and there shouldn't be any rumor that the tape actually killed people.Katie's mother asks her sister Rachel to look into the death because she doesn't understand why a 16-year-old's heart would stop suddenly.  Um - wasn't anyone concerned with the way Katie's body looked in those horrifying flashes?  (Especially given someone mentioned that 'seeing the body' had been one of the things pushing the friend into madness).  I'd think any competent coroner would have some questions on how this girl looked drowned, bloated or worse.  The movie would have been a lot stronger if the victims had simply dropped dead of fright leaving beautiful corpses.The tape itself is fine - truly creepy.  And it makes sense that Samara broadcasting from the well could impose the images on the videotape being recorded near by.  But apparently she wasn't exactly limited  to geographical proximity, because long before the taping, she'd been out killing her mother and the horses.  As a matter of fact, this kid can use telephones, move objects at will at long distances, control electricity, and pretty much everything else even before she's `helped' out of the well. (I'm still wondering how she killed the kids in the car given they likely weren't near a television set).The horse scene was extremely well done, tho  it made no sense for Naomi to keep messing with the horse despite its rising agitation.  But then she does lots of inexplicable things, such as her penchant for leaving dead bodies unreported (except for Samara's).  Apparently she not only walked away from the father of her child, but she left Samara's father to be discovered by someone else after his extremely elaborate suicide.  (Still wondering why someone would go so far out of his way to electrocute himself especially with someone else in the house).A lot of the things that affect the characters don't have any explanation. My boyfriend suggested the scribbling over faces was meant to convey Samara's head had been put in the black plastic bag.   That might be, but what explanation was there for the distorted faces in pictures and videos? Or the nosebleeds for that matter.  A lot of times I felt the only motivation behind the things happening was that it would make the audience jump.All in all, a movie that should have gone straight to video where at least they could have gotten some real impact out of the self-referential stuff at the end about making a copy and showing it to someone else.",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
Public Enemies," Other than Johnny and Marion, a complete mess
","I had great hopes for this one because I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan. But within just a few minutes, I was wondering if I was going to make it through the movie considering that the bobbling camera made it seem more related to 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'Cloverfield' than its trailer, which promised a Michael Mann experience (clean visuals, good shots). Most of the time, it seemed the film was shot by a Dillinger gang groupie doing a 'YouTube' piece with badly framed shots, shots from over people's shoulders, and shots made with the camera moving so weirdly that it was difficult to know what the viewer should focus on. Combine that with poor sound, and just figuring out what was going on became a challenge.In addition, although I understand some artistic license can be granted in terms of historical accuracy, this one went out of its way to confuse the time line (especially as regards to what happened to gangsters other than Dillinger).Overall, the film lacked focus. If it was about public enemies in general, than why the concentration on Dillinger to the point that other gangsters seemed like bit players? If it was about the clash between Dillinger and Purvis, why not give Christian Bale more to work with regarding character and motivation than simply looking stony-faced? If it was about the role of the FBI and how it changed during the era, then why not fully develop that theme instead of having just a couple of throwaway scenes? Instead the much-too-long running time was spent on things 'relevant' for the times (i.e., is torturing a legitimate interrogation technique?).I give kudos to Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard for making the most of what they had to work with and pulling off some very watchable scenes. But next time, perhaps the director should concentrate on making a really good Michael Mann movie instead of a movie that seemed to be deliberately breaking every rule that usually characterizes a Michael Mann film.",3,1,5,6 July 2009
Constantine," Much more interesting movie than the trailer
","If like me you saw the trailer a number of times and thought this film was going to be another 'Exorcist' or 'Omen' wannabee with Keanu Reeves sleepwalking through the part, you might want to reconsider. I ended up seeing it because my husband thought the special effects looked great (they are quite interesting), and came away pleasantly surprised by the interesting mythology, quirky dialogue, and Keanu's take on the character. (I've had no exposure to the underlying comic books, so I have no idea what the 'true' John Constantine is supposed to be.)In particular, I enjoyed the way the film blurred the typical good/evil distinctions even when describing an epic battle between the two forces. The 'good' characters do things we question, while the 'bad' ones occasionally do good (or at least are seen as more honest about their intentions.) This highlights Constantine as a man caught between two worlds who must sometimes visit the dark side in his attempts to do good.Because the film raises interesting questions about good/evil, theology, and even psychiatry in dealing with people of visions, this is one of the few movies of its type where I walked away looking forward to the sequel.",8,8,22,26 February 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Should have been a 'Best Picture' nominee
","In a less competitive year, this film would have received its due as an Oscar contender. In addition to the top notch lead acting performances (which did receive nods), the movie tells a compelling story in a manner that perfectly balances horror with humanity. Mel Gibson could use lessons from this director in how much more effective suffering can be conveyed when it is done with more subtlety and restraint so the audience is never numbed by tragedy, but rather is kept constantly feeling with the characters so as to even laugh with them at the occasional light moment.The script may not be conventionally catchy in terms of original dialogue, but it allows the film to move well while presenting many of the characters (even some of the villains) as three-dimensional human beings. When people do things -- even those that may seem unwise -- we understand why they made that choice, which avoids the 'why would anyone do that' problems that so annoy me in other movies.All in all, the film that should have had the 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Ray' slot on Oscar night.",Null,2,2,26 February 2005
The Village," Much better movie was possible
","It's unfortunate that the director was more interested in another 'twist' plotline than working with the other elements available to him that could have crafted a great film.  The first half shows a great deal of promise as the actors create interesting and empathetic characters involved in interpersonal conflicts.  But instead of exploring these people in a straight drama and allowing the actors to continue to shine, the film is forced to veer in the direction of being a 'guess the secret' semi-thriller, a direction that takes it straight downhill.Perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie more if the secret had been more of one, but the director dropped so many conspicuous clues as to the nature of the twist that both my husband and I figured it out about thirty minutes in. (I spent the rest of the movie hoping that there was something more to it, but no -- that was really it.)  In addition, unlike 'Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' which held up very well to scrutiny once the twist is known, the plot of 'The Village' has so many inconsistencies that it falls completely apart.  I'm not sorry I saw it (although my husband considered it a waste of time), but I was extremely disappointed.",Null,0,0,7 August 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Didn't do it for me
","The first 2/3 of the movie is wonderful -- quirky, warm and often funny -- and the acting is outstanding. But then it turns into a completely different film where it loses most of its credibility, and most of all just doesn't deliver the emotional payoff it is trying so hard to do. Two days after seeing it, I keep finding more annoying elements.SPOILER -- SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER I agree with the other person who mentioned in a comment that the ending just doesn't flow from the rest of the movie. It's true that in real life, things sometimes happen out of nowhere, but in films we expect there to be a connection -- that events transpire not just because they can, but because they must, given what went before. In MDB, the central notion of 'protecting oneself' gets an inordinate amount of screen time, yet for the 'twist' to occur, the main characters have to completely forget it. Thus we have Frank (Clint Eastwood) zigzagging from not being able to protect his fighter (Morgan Freeman), overprotecting his fighter (Big Willy), and then both over- and under-protecting his fighter(Hilary Swank). Here Maggie is in a ring with a boxer known for fighting dirty, and neither she nor Frank seem to be particularly on the alert. The film also leaves dangling the whole concept as to whether Frank was wrong or right to be protective.VERY BIG SPOILER - VERY BIG SPOILER - VERY BIG SPOILER My biggest problem with the film (and the reason I can't imagine the Holleywood community voting for it as best film come Oscars night) is that I couldn't accept Maggie's decision, nor Frank's decision to help her, in a world that just lost Christopher Reeve, who showed that even people in Maggie's condition can still do meaningful things with their lives. As a personal matter, I am sure that if I were in that position, I might also long to commit suicide, but knowing that people like Christopher Reeve have chosen to live life to the fullest despite extreme limitations, it's hard for me to emotionally get behind a character who isn't even willing to try (I'm certain I would view 'Whose Life is it Anyway' less sympathetically if I saw it today.)Not only was this major emotional component lacking for me, but some of the rest of the stuff was absolutely ludicrous. I almost laughed at the last scene with the family, given that under the circumstances, no attorney would fail to bring a notary along to ascertain the 'mark' to be made was genuine. The whole scene was also completely over-the-top, in that it had already been established her family was selfish and uncaring.This is definitely a movie that would have had a stronger and more honest emotional impact if it had stayed in its original vein and figured out a more subtle way to show the connection between Frank and Maggie than lapsing into melodrama.",Null,1,3,22 January 2005
Mystic River," A disappointment considering the book
","I'd been looking forward to the adaptation of Dennis LeHane's novel ever since I heard of the superb director/cast lineup.  But it missed for me in capturing the spirit of the book.  Sean Penn was excellent and deserves an Oscar nod; Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden also turned in fine work (as did Laurence Fishburne although he had far less to do.)****SPOILER ALERT***My real problem was with Tim Robbins' portrayal of Dave.  In the book, although the character is tormented by his past, on the surface at least at the beginning he seems to have pulled it together enough to get married and have a child.  His disintegration as the result of confronting that past is much more powerful on paper because the reader is in the character's head. While a good actor (which Tim Robbins certainly is most times) can externalize those changes, from the first time the adult Dave appeared onscreen, he appeared burned out and twitchy, so much so that you can't imagine his wife ever marrying him.  Furthermore I don't think the movie did much with the true horrific twist of the book in exploring Dave's motivations to attack the child molester, which made more believable (in the novel) his later failure to save himself in the confrontation with Jimmy (instead accepting blame for something he didn't in fact do).Much of the strength of the movie comes from the original writing.  I just wish the film had done justice to all of it.",Null,0,0,8 November 2003
The Island," Fun with lots of action, but why didn't they fix the plot problems?
","As with so many films in the thriller/science fiction, 'The Island' does a great job setting up its premise, but loses credibility when the scriptwriters allow plot discrepancies to get out of hand to the point of absurdity.SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER 1. Mccord gives Lincoln and Jordan his credit card, then tells them not to use it after the first 24 hours because he will have to report it stolen. He dies before they've even left, so presumably he hasn't yet contacted the credit card company. Yet at his death, the card has that status.2. The Information Services booth has no trouble figuring out from all the people in the U.S. named Tom Lincoln or (Whatever) Jordan exactly which ones the clones are trying to contact.3. The police car stops in the middle of the intersection for no particular purpose other than to make sure it is in the way of the monster vehicle that will momentarily be barreling down on it.4. Even though the clones are in L.A., it never occurs to anyone to put Tom Lincoln's residence under surveillance to see if that might be their destination.5. Somehow Lincoln and Jordan figure out what a taxi is for and how to use one, even to the point of tipping, because there's no indication the driver pulled away angry after dropping them off.6. No one seems to react to the news that Jordan has left the state in search of her sponsor, when one would expect them to move the whole team across country.7. A trained Army seal doesn't search an arrestee for weapons before sitting down next to her in a car. Of course, considering Jordan was wearing only a tight tee shirt, it should have been readily apparent she was carrying a gun. Otherwise, where did she get it? I was also bothered by the gratuitous waste of a 'valuable product.' Surely considering the way they controlled everything else, they could have brainwashed the 'breeders' into willingly surrendering their babies rather than killing the mothers after they gave birth. Why wouldn't the original woman want the clone kept around for the same purpose as the other clones in case she needed a spare part? Or what if the couple wanted to have another child? They'd have to wait another year and put up another $5 million. Clearly this scene existed just to give Lincoln something horrible to discover and/or make the corporation seem even more terrible than a smart business would actually be.Finally, instead of the ridiculous notion that adult human bodies wouldn't seek out sexual activity just because they hadn't been 'taught' it exists, wouldn't it have been more credible to program the clones that such activity was terrible and that violations of the 'proximity' thing could jeopardize their chance of getting to the Island? Undoubtedly some of these problems exist because of the massive rewriting the script went through since its original incarnation. For example, I got the feeling there was supposed to be a whole lot more behind Jordan's reaction to the little boy mistaking her for his mother, rather than just simply eliminating the question whether Jordan or the mother should survive by announcing the mother was brain dead and couldn't be saved.Someday perhaps Hollywood will learn the difference between an okay film and a great one is having someone watch the thing with a critical eye so that logic and common sense can be used to identify and eliminate all the 'no, that wouldn't happen' moments.",7,1,2,6 August 2005
