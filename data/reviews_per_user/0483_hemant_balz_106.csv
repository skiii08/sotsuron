The Blair Witch Project," Overly hyped
","Blairwitch project,i just saw this crap movie last week.Never i got a scary feeling or anything.The film-makers though were quite smart.They spread the rumor of few college guys disappearing & portrayed this as a real documentary for the search of a witch.But where was the witch.Apart from strange voices & screams there is nothing.You can't see the witch or even have any clue if there is any witch at all existing.This earned a lot from the box office mainly because of the rumor that was spread,but not a good documentary.Fails to live up on many levels.People disappearing like anything & you wont have any clue.A thrilling experience but second half of the movie is much more boring.Can't expect to watch this again.First documentary on horror.But if this is scary,i don't know what to expect.",3,1,3,25 March 2010
Scarface," Mind Blowing Cinema.
","Who is Tony Montana?They call him by another name Scarface.Pacino after this movie would be remembered mostly as Montana.The Cuban drug lord.Scarface is a brilliant adaptation from the 1932 classic.Pure Pacino stuff.If you were amazed with his performance in the godfather,you would not be surprised with his performance here.He steals the show.Dialogue delivery is at its par.Steven Bauer short cameo in the movie as Manny Ribera is often overlooked but this is his best role so far.The movie centers around the corrupt Tony who becomes so engaged in himself that he forgets about everyone & everything.Finally he succumbs to greed.The ending is great.So is a great soundtrack specially Gina & Elvira theme.De Palma makes another terrific movie.Just wanna tell all fans of Pacino.If you don't see this you are not a true fan of him.However its been so many years i have seen this movie,still cant get over it.Totally obsessed with Violence & Scarface.Remember the dialog-'What'd you think of that, huh? What you think, I'm a f***ing worm like you? I told you, man, I told you! Don't f*** with me!'.Awesome.",9,0,1,3 March 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Complicated
","Requiem for a dream is a pretty much complicated movie.This is so complex you feel like the drugs in the movie might make you dizzy.But its not the drugs but the movie itself.Lot of editing & sound mixing in the movie.Though the plot is good enough.But this could have been much better.The acting of Ellen Burstyn,Jared Leto,Jennifer Connelly & Marlon Wayans is pretty good.But its the way the director presents things that it gets very complicated.Even the ending also i never liked one bit.People take drugs & they land up into a big hole or something.They start dreaming & when the dream is over they remember only the past.The days they were without taking drugs.This is a very much dismal & a sad movie from drug point of you.I never got the hold of this.Forcefully i sat & saw whole of it.The 8.5 rating i think is a bit over-hyped.Another movie like Donnie Darko never was meant to be in Top 250.Though i never liked it,some of you might.Different perceptions.So start dreaming about this movie,then only you might get the hold of this one.",3,0,2,21 March 2010
The Ring," Before you die, you see the ring
","The ring is a pretty much scary movie which sets a bone chilling kind of atmosphere.You feel the tension around you & while seeing this if you roam around in dark places you will surely get scary feeling,specially if lately you have seen this.Horrifying experience i felt while seeing this.Specially the camera-work & the sound was pretty much scary.If you see this on Television you will surely feel like missing something as this one was to be seen on the theaters.The plot is a journalist must investigate about a video tape that seems to cause death of whoever sees it within 7 days.The girl Daveigh Chase who seem to be responsible for deaths looks pretty scary in her makeup.The videotape in itself was very scary.Naomi Watts has given a terrific performance while his son David Dorfman(Noah) has added more spice with scary looks to the movie.The ring is a beauty of a movie.Tension seeker movie.Seven days and you are dead.But make sure before you die,you see the ring.",7,1,2,24 March 2010
Deja Vu," Deja Vu is believed by many to be a trick of the mind
",Indeed it was.A trick of the mind.A crime case mixed with sci-fi stuff.That was just brilliant.The plot is not quite logical though.Some time traveling concept.Go to the past & things like that. Denzel Washington plays the role of Agent Doug Carlin.He is a great actor indeed & has been a constant performer.Paula Patton & Van Kilmer also have given good performances.Rest of the star cast is also pretty much good. This movie you can watch one more time just for the sci-fi stuff and the camera-work.Camera-work is brilliant.Good work by Tony Scott here.You all believe in Deja Vu.Well Denzel does & so do i.So get ready to see this movie & see for your self what is Deja Vu...,6,0,1,6 March 2010
Minority Report," Future for Sci-fi is very bright.
","Minority report is a very very special Sci-fi film.This Tom Cruise starer delivers and peaks at the right time for all Sci-fi fans across the globe.When we felt that future of Sci-fi is in darkness then came the movie directed from the man himself Steven Spielberg.A fantastically paced thriller with terrific Sci-fi exploits.Tom Cruise does well as the cop who comes to know his own future.Trying to survive,wanting to prove that he wont commit any murder in the future,he runs from the rest.Trying to find the answers.Max Von Sydow is a class performer.The twist in the end is a great twist.Rarely you find Sci-Fi movies with terrific thrill and fantastic plots.Spielberg again proves he can make any movie.From animation,to thriller,to war and now a brilliant Sci-Fi.His work is perfect and so is this movie.Definitely,after the success of this movie the future of Sci-Fi movies looks very bright.",9,0,1,30 March 2010
Finding Neverland," A masterpiece
",Marc Forster has directed a gem here.No doubt the movie is a bit slow but what overcomes it is the great acting & evergreen soundtrack.Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet have given a riveting performance.A performance that will surely get to you.Dustin Hoffman also performs a great role in the movie.The kids in the film are pretty good.They have done a tremendous job here.The plot is a play-writer finds shade in a family as he begins dreaming about his novel & writes a beautiful play called The Peter Pan.The children & their mother Kate are his inspiration.But something tragic happens in the end.But Depp makes Kate feel what she meant to him.The soundtrack is fabulous.So Finding Neverland is a pretty good film to watch.A family movie.A masterpiece!!,8,2,2,16 March 2010
In Bruges," I didn't even know where Bruges was
","Bruges?Its in Belgium.In Bruges is a satirical movie with a great comic indulgence.It shows that how a man guilts can make him a better person.Collin Ferrel does a terrific job.After phone booth this was the only good movie of him that i have seen for a long time.Brendan Gleeson proves to be a dark horse in this film.Good show by him too.What impressed me was the plot.Two hit men begin to differ on their thinking because of the crimes they have committed.Do they really pay for there sins??Great comical feelings were given in the movie through pretty funny dialogs.Midgets!!!Funny scenes portraying them.The ending was quite unpredictable.Ralph Finees is forever there.I still don't forget his role in Schindler's List but this one as well i shall remember.Soundtrack is also very much to the apt.And if anyone does not know where Bruges is.Find it for your self.Definitely in my top 100.So if anyone tells me to go to Bruges.I tell them 'It's a fairytale town, isn't it?'.Get the f*** out.",8,1,4,21 February 2010
Se7en," Fast paced psycho thriller with a penultimate ending
",Seven in itself is a very good psycho thriller movie.Well paced & terrific star-cast makes it very special.The seven sins will make you think.....that wow!!!what a fantastic concept.I never knew of these sins before i came to see this brilliant masterpiece.Fantastic performance from Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt.Here we see too different kind of detectives.One is sensible & mature whereas other wants action & is impatient.Terrific role from the psycho killer too.I don't want to disclose his name to anyone.You have to see for your self who he is.Dialog delivery is at its par.The seven sins & the psychotic murders will keep you occupied.And the ending its just penultimate.Fantastic & a great surprising ending.The only question is will the psycho killer win or will the detectives catch him before its too late for many.A movie must to be watched.Not to be missed.Unique & surprising in its own way.,9,0,1,23 March 2010
Fight Club," Rampant chaos.
","Fight club ,a brilliant concept and a brilliant ending.This movie twists your mind and bends it in various dimensions.The plot itself makes you feel strange and the narration by Edward Norton here is very much captivating.Faced paced mystery,fight club stands out in the league of movies like Memento and The Usual Suspects.Edward Norton's best surely after American History X.His greatest performance and a fantastic narration.Brad Pitt role of Tyler Durden is one of the very unique roles you will ever see.Brad Pitt dialogs and just his presence on the screen speaks for itself.Acting of everyone is mind blowing and i cannot forget Helena Bonham Carter as Marla.She is a kind of drug addict in the movie and her depiction by the director is superb.David Fincher's another masterpiece.This is a superb thriller,showing how people can take out their frustration by turning to aggression.The ending is very unique.And you just cannot imagine the ending.Cinematography is brilliant.Surely after watching this once,you would have to see it again.International cinema has such gem of a thinking that i cannot even imagine.Mind blowing cinema.Fight club fascinates and creates chaos in the mind.But thats the need for our generation now.And if you are afraid of fighting go for fight club,then you will feel a rampant chaos that will surely change your attitude towards films.",10,0,3,2 April 2010
Memento," Where are the facts....
","Memento is a very complicated but a crafty work done by Christopher Nolan.The movie takes you back into flashback a number of times.Puzzling your mind & creating all kinds of chaos in your mind.But thats what we need.A movie that confuses,shows facts & then in 15 minutes you forget everything.That makes Memento a masterpiece.Guy Pierce(Leonard)acting is tremendous.The facts,the tattoos,the visions everything fits.Till the end you never come to know who killed his wife.Searching for answers Leonard makes facts & based on tattoos on his body tries to find the man he thinks killed his wife.Joe Pantoliano plays a canny kind of a role as a friend of Leonard.This movie is an achievement in itself due to some great camera-work and breathtaking plot.Carrie-Anne Moss does well but only in parts.Her acting looked too-pretentious.Memento was a definitive success for Christopher Nolan.The ending is no guess work.All guesses fail as who killed Leonard's wife.And as Leonard says,Where are the facts.....but beware Leonard in the next 15 minutes you might forget.",10,0,3,26 March 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino proves he's a master at changing history
","This is the best movie i have seen in a long time. The plot is based on world war-2 scenario where Hitler Nazis get a taste of there own music thats brutality.The brutality they show towards Jews eventually comes to haunt them through the basterds(they call them-self)-a small army of American Jews who spread fear among Nazis by killing them mercilessly. The screenplay is awesome.Even the casting is quite superb. The performances by Brad Pitt,Melane Laurent & Eli Roth is commendable. But what takes the limelight is the performance by Christopher Waltz. I have never seen him before.But his acting that of the German Colonel is totally laudable.He deserves a lot of credit for the success of the film. The dialogs are just appropriate & the soundtrack is also very good.Tarantino's portrayal of that of a Jew girl who wants to take revenge on Nazis by burning down the theater in Paris that she owns is just too mouth watering.She(Melani Laurent)looks so pretty in the film I cant tell you how much. The movie finale is just too good to resist.Last 1/2 hour of the movie is a must watch for any cinema lover. This movie has the right blend of comedy,action & thrill. The best part is that Hitler & his men got what they deserve & that has been shown in this movie. Truly Tarantino has made a classic.Changing History so everyone can see the Hitler & his Nazis getting what they deserve in retribution to all the Jews they have killed. This movie was a thrilling experience.Must watch!!",8,1,5,11 November 2009
Rang De Basanti," Awesome awakening of a new generation
","Fabulous movie.The only word i could say after my first view of it.But with more seeings this one gets even better.Rang De Basanti has everything,from great performances to some terrific direction with some very good evergreen songs plus you have the star himself leading from the front Aamir Khan.I ain't surprised by his choice of movies.He is a class apart.You expect such performances from him & he always peaks.Lets talk of the performances first.Fantastic performances all the way.From Aamir Khan to Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni to Soha Ali Khan to Siddharth to Sharman Joshi.Everyone simply deliver with much grace.Waheeda Rehman,the legendary actress performs again a stunning role & gives her best.Alice Patten as Sue was sensational.Everything was just so perfect.The direction was flawless.Beautiful contrast scenes of the present & that of the old freedom fighting days are brought together.Rehman music stands apart.Song like Khalbali add spice & fun for the youth generation whereas song like Khoon Chala displays their anger & will for justice.The songs Luka Chupi & Tu Bin Bataye also are some class songs in the movie.The voice of Lata Mangeshkar in Luka Chupi song is just a honor in itself.Terrific plot with great vision from the director makes this a must watch for everyone.The movie adds fire to your heart & the youth of India begin to awake just to take that first step towards freedom.A rare awakening of a generation & until people keep on seeing this movie,Rang De Basanti will always stand a class apart from the rest.",10,1,4,10 June 2010
12 Angry Men," Guilty or Not-Guilty !!! I don't want to know.
","12 Angry Men!!!Masterwork movie made by Sidney Lumet.What a character display?Just imagine,12 men in a single room.Is this a movie??You bet on it.It is.The facts,the figures,the ego's all change in just a single courtroom where a boy faces death sentence.Henry Fonda(Juror #8) steels the limelight with a performance of a lifetime.& Lee J. Cobb(Juror #3) What a performance?You would remember him after the movie is over.All characters are shown in such a way that each one is different from one another.That means 12 different thoughts and yes different ego's.Battle of wits take place in a small courtroom.Edge of the seat stuff and who can forget the old man(Juror #9).Brilliant stuff.Dialog delivery is at its par.Remember the dialog.(Juror #8): 'You don't really mean you'll kill me,do you?'.Impressive!! also (Juror #8):'We're not convinced. We want to hear them again. We have as much time as it takes'.And for this movie i am not convinced if i can stop watching this timeless epic again & again.For the conclusion part.I am not sure if the boy was guilty or not.The truth is no one would know.I don't want to know.If you have any arguments.convince me by watching 12 Angry Men!!and decide for your own sake guilty or not guilty.",10,0,0,20 February 2010
Public Enemies," Johnny Depp: The perfect public enemy
","Public Enemy or i should say the perfect Public Enemy was Johnny Depp.The way he has acted in this movie is just stupendous.The portrayal of John Dillinger is tremendous.The way he escapes literally from anywhere is just incredible.Towering presence of Johnny Depp of John Dillinger just overshadows the prowess of Christian Bale.Same,what Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight,here we see a superb performance overshadowing every one else.The ending was also very good.Michael Mann wanted to replicate the touch that he left for us in Heat.But Public Enemies never lives up to that level.Nor the star-cast neither the story setup can replicate the history of Heat.All in all,public enemies drags in certain places but the actors have done very well.Be prepared for a prolonged series of bloodshed & violence during this film.Some dialogs make your day like 'Bye Bye Blackbird'.Just watch this one for Johnny Depp,his best performance i have seen till date.",7,0,1,23 May 2010
The Great Dictator," Charlie steals the show as Hynkel
","The great dictator,the ruler of Tomania,this is not the real Hitler but Charlie Chaplin in the role of the Hynkel himself.Satirical performance by one of the true legends Charlie Chaplin.Paulette Goddard as Hanna is a revelation.Her beauty shines throughout even in the black/white scenes.She looks so charming.This masterpiece movie has a great comedy effect with good moral to go along with it.The casting is pretty much good with every actor giving their best.The Jewish barber as Hynkel.Comedy of errors.And not to forget the great speech in the end.The movie turns to a moral sense after this speech & the speech is very captivating.I still remember the last lines: Jewish Barber: 'Look up, Hannah! The soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow! Into the light of hope, into the future! The glorious future, that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up!'. Memorable speech & memorable ending.Great movie to watch.",10,1,2,15 March 2010
Alexander," Real Alexander would be ashamed
","Pretty much boring movie is Alexander.Not at all gripping is the story.Based on a true story this should be at least something courageous portraying one of the greatest conquerers of the world.But rather than being courageous this was quite frail.Collin Ferrel never looked Alexander.His acting is terrible in this movie.Rather than inspiring,Alexander(Collin Ferrel) hardly looked a shadow of himself.Angelina Jolie never looked the mother of Alexander.Van Kilmer also fails to deliver,looking very much shabby & over-pretentious.Rest of the casting is OK.Some fight scenes are good though specially the epic battle with Persians.The fighting was quite captivating.In this movie the effort should have been more on Alexander's battle campaigns but this was more of a drama movie.Never at all you enjoy this film,truly if real Alexander would have seen this he would have been ashamed.",3,6,8,24 March 2010
Troy," Great action but not honorable
","Troy,an adaptation of Homer's great epic,will leave you disappointed after the movie is finished.When the movie begins you see some great action & fighting scenes.But as soon as the movie moves forward the emphatic sword fighting scenes begin to disappear.More of drama creeps in.What i feel that there should be a balance between action & drama.But Troy was lacking with the balancing part.Some scenes like the fighting of Brad Pitt(the first scene) as well as when Spartans enter Troy are fascinating.Tremendous sword fighting stuff.Brad Pitt perfectly looked Achilles.Eric Bana also gave a fabulous effort.Orlando Bloom well,a a little subdued kind of role but still it was quite good in the context of the movie.Rest of the star-cast is also quite good.But the balancing part was a miss.In the middle there are more fighting scenes instead when it should be in the end.The ending also largely spoils the whole movie.Not in the league of 300 neither of Kingdom of Heaven.But a one time watch for some great fight scenes for sure.",6,0,4,24 March 2010
Brokeback Mountain," A Breakthrough in International Cinema
","Brokeback Mountain is definitely a breakthrough in International Cinema.The first gay based movie i have seen.Riveting performance from Heath Ledger.Great acting with an artistic touch.Tremendous adulations for Ang Lee.Jake Gyllenhaal does well again.I think only good movie of him i have seen in a long time.Casting is pretty good.Definitely for the story & the acting you need to see this.This is a good enough western flick but a romance between two men in this case.Ang Lee deserved an Oscar for this.Oscar worthy direction.The soundtrack is fabulous.The ending is very good though the movie is a bit slow.Definitely one time watch.Heath Ledger performances after The Dark Knight,if you see all his movies before that,this is the best after his performance of The Joker.",8,4,4,17 March 2010
Insomnia," Way better than i expected
",Insomnia!!!A decent enough crime detective story that will keep you on your toes guessing. A typically good performance by Pacino who starts feeling insomniac due to the night-less Alaska as well as the pressure of the case gets to him. He has to detect a criminal case where a homicide is been committed.Heis been send to solve the case in the small Alaskan town.He faces a lot of hurdles.Put to many challenges by the death of his partner & his link with his death.Everything good he has done in the past is put on line.He has to take certain decisions on which the case is dependent & also his values.Hilary Swank does a fantastic job as a new detective.Her performance is quite good in this movie.However Pacino steals the show with his charisma.The only weak performance i think was from Robin Williams.He never suited the role that was given to him.A job well done by Christopher Nolan.But this movie is not in the class of 'Memento' or 'The Prestige'.A good detective flick no doubt.Will Pacino be able to solve the case.And make redemption for all the things he has done in the past. A definitely one time watch for Pacino.,8,0,0,8 March 2010
Zodiac," The unsolved serial mystery
",Zodiac by David Fincher deserves a true applause.Based on a true incident a notorious killer takes to the streets of California nearly killing what approximates to 37 of as per stated by Zodiac killer letters.This movie is much like Seven in many ways but this absolutely is a true event.The cryptograms sent to the police by Zodiac are very puzzling.I even read that till now those cryptograms have not been deciphered.The star-cast in the movie is brilliant & the voice of Zodiac can be heard with his letters.Thats just so amazing.The prime suspected for the killings never looked like the one who could have been the Zodiac.This is thrilling stuff from David Fincher as people really fear the Zodiac.His threat calls really spread panic on the people faces & their souls.People become tensed for their children as many threats were made for the kidnapping of school kids.Police confirmed only 6 cases but i believe that he may have killed a lot more than that.The movie ends up with the Zodiac killer not been caught & the last letter by Zodiac himself speaks for everything.He mentions that they will make a movie starring him as a villain.And he would like to know who's gonna play his part.His wish came true.The executioner suit of Zodiac was really pretty scary.People & the press started to portray him as a legend who became a myth.This is a pretty cool unsolved mystery focusing basically on the prowess & the havoc created by the Zodiac.Still we are unsure whether he still lives or not.But some people in California are still not willing to walk out freely on the streets just due to the terror & the history behind that of the Zodiac killer.,7,0,0,3 June 2010
The Prestige," The real transported man.
","Class!!!!One word that can outline this prestigious movie.Christopher Nolan after the success of Memento has again shown what qualities he possesses as a director.The script is fantastic.Where does he get those ideas from.Christian Bale again gives a fantastic performance.He has grown as an actor in the past few years.Hugh Jackman does justice to his role.The screenplay is awesome.Also the work of Michael Caine(cutter) is prolific.He keeps saying those one liners that always impress me.Prestigious indeed is the twist at the end.WOW!!!What a twist ??You need to watch this movie twice to understand the mind of Christopher Nolan.Only one question twists me,where does he get all those ideas??Finally prestige has all the answers.Waiting for his next movie.If you believe in magic.The real transported man holds the answers.Also,remember exact science is not exact science.Prestige is the hardest part.But then who was prestigious at the end.Must watch!!",10,3,5,21 February 2010
Hotel Rwanda," You will regret it, if you have not seen this yet
","Hotel Rwanda.Where is it??Its in Africa.Beautiful movie to watch.I never knew about Hutu & Tutsi's but now i know how people based on simple appearance can distinguish between each other.Its a shame but its very true.Don Cheadle has done a fabulous job as Paul(the hotel manager).Good performances too from Jaoquin Pheonix & Nick Nolte.Beautifully directed by Terry George the movie portrays a man named Paul saving many civilians from the massacre of Hutu rebels.How he convinces the General?How he trades with people?How he saves so many lives?You have to see this movie to feel it.Just to believe it.Really Don you have done a commendable role.Oscar Worthy.Every moment of my time i saw this movie,i don't regret it.Just like Schindler's List.But believe me,if you have not seen this yet,then you will surely regret.",10,0,1,5 March 2010
Crash," Truly Oscar Worthy
","Crash is a film based on caste,color & apartheid.The screenplay is just too good.This is a great movie to watch.In search for redemption is everyone in this film.Every character is unique & has his own perception.A simple car crash makes all the characters in the movie to inter relate. How their life is affected & how their life is changed.The casting is very good.Specially Don Cheadle & Thandie Newton have given great performances.Rest of the actors are also very good.This movie will surely influence the way you think about others.Will surely make you think of the past??Oscar worthy direction by Paul Haggis.All in all Crash is a treat to watch.After all cinema is just imagination.Wow!!!a simple car crash could influence so many lives,i never imagined before watching Crash.A terrific movie.Truly Oscar worthy.",9,1,6,21 March 2010
Shutter Island," Plays with your mind,but not for everyone.
","Only a good movie lover would appreciate such a movie.Last night i saw this terrific thriller movie called Shutter Island.This is a decent movie to come along this year.Probably the best i have seen this year so far.Fantastic performance from Leonardo again.The Leonardo & Scorsese pairing is beginning to have an impact on the audiences.The plot is very very good.A U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels(Leonardo)is sent to the Shutter Island to find about the disappearance about a dangerous psychopath patient.Ben Kingsley also as Dr. Cawley has given a remarkable performance again.Scorsese direction is class here.The terrific pace of the movie plus the twists will keep you guessing.This movie will surely play with your mind but i am not sure everyone will like it.I surely liked it.Shutter Island is just like Memento in many ways.The movie plays with your mind,you might get a psychopath kind of feeling seeing this.But definitely a good one from Scorsese.",8,1,4,22 March 2010
Glory," Will leave you feeling,why you never joined army
","Glory.....The one word you would die for.But glory(1989) by Edward Zwick is an epic.No short of an epic with a blending of emotion,drama & action.Matthew Broderick does justice to his role of Col. Robert Gould Shaw.Denzel Washington deserved as Oscar for this role & so he got it.The scene where he is beaten up was way too emotional.Just see his tears & then you can feel what glory is all about.Morgan Freeman(Sgt. Mulcahy) as usual does a terrific job again.Lot of short cameos by other people as well.Andre Braugher(Sears) plays a beautiful role of a black American soldier & as a friend of Colonel Shaw.Shaw gets caught up in loyalties as a general & a friend.But all in all beautiful movie with a wonderful soundtrack.This truly deserved an Oscar.Bad miss by the critics.Way too underrated for my liking.Its just awesome.Best war movie up to date.Just cant get the hold of the dialog- (Robert):'If this man should fall, who will lift the flag and carry on?'. (Sears):'I will'. (Robert):'I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.' This scene made me think that why i never joined the army.But glory it deserves.The forgotten word shall be relived again if you can see this movie!!!Recommended for a terrific emotional experience.An epic.",10,1,3,4 March 2010
Forrest Gump," Emotionally triumphant.
","Forrest Gump directed by Robert Zemechis is a truly remarkable movie for me.This movie has shades of memories of my life & it has touched me emotionally in many ways.The acting of Tom Hanks is triumphant.I have never seen a better act from him & the truth is i don't want to.Scenes like Forrest having polio & with just few words of Jenny does the magic & he is able to run.Thats so beautiful.Scene of Forrest & Jenny meeting on the sea shore where everyone claps are just some amazing scenes you will ever come across.The agony of Lieutenant Dan is very amazing.Eventually movie concludes with a sad ending & the soundtrack is memorable.It shows the truth of life,you can get whatever you need in your life but still you wont get that one thing that you always want.Superb direction & brilliant acting with a touching story just makes the day for the audience.Forrest's mother reminded me of my own mother.This is an emotional experience for me as i had past of my parents related with polio,my love for the army once,as well as those romantic meets that i always want.This is triumphant.In short,verdict is if you don't see this for your emotional conscience just see it for the brilliance of Tom Hanks.Forrest Gump is emotionally triumphant for me.",10,1,1,5 June 2010
The Godfather: Part II," If history has taught us anything - It's that you can kill anybody
","WOW!!!was the only word that i said after watching this movie.truly its an epic in grand proportions.I haven't seen yet a better sequel for a movie.If godfather affected us,this would change our lives.The casting was prolific as usual but not to mention the role played by De Niro(Vito Carleone).He played a role that could make us believe that Brando legacy has not been left void in godfather part-2.The direction is quite brilliant from Coppola.He shows simultaneously how one can travel forward with Al Pacino(Michael Carleone) & back with De niro(Vito).He's a master at his work,Coppola.Also the role played by John Cazale(Fredo)touched me.It was such a sophisticated role & he played it perfectly.And what amazed me was that who was Michael V. Gazzo(Frankie Pantangelini)??i never saw him in any other movie but what an accent this guy has.Brilliant actor not to mention.And last but not the least Michael says to tom: ' If history has taught us anything - It's that you can kill anybody'.Yes Michael,you are the true godfather & when it comes to Vito's regime.Vito said to don Ciccio : 'My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you'.and just for you Vito(Deniro) i give this movie my personal best 10.",10,1,4,20 February 2010
Léon: The Professional," Besson teaches you how to be a professional
","Adulations for Luc Besson for portraying one of the best classic crime flicks i have seen in a long time.This time its a hit-man movie.The names Leon aka 'The Professional'.Jean Reno gives a commanding performance as the loner named Leon.And what should i stay about Gary Oldman(Stanfield).His acting is just too good in this film.Even the dialog's that he states have a terrific impact on the movie.Natalie Portman(Mathilda)has given a stupendous performance here.Never ever i have seen a better performance from a child of that age.Plots good.Leon must take care of her neighbor Mathilda after her family was hunted down by Stansfield because of a drug problem. Leon starts to teach Mathilda her trade.How to clean??The ending is quite surprising & i was amazed by the screenplay in this movie.It was just terrific.Great work by Luc Besson.Directing is pretty cool.This movie is underrated as many of my friends haven't heard of it.But those who have scene,they surely appreciate.The soundtrack too is fabulous adding spice to the movie.Leon said 'No Women,No Kids'.Truly this movie is for men only.But everyone who watches this will surely become a fan of Leon.",10,4,6,9 March 2010
The Killing Fields," Powerful film.

Ngor.Oscar worthy roles.Masterful direction by Roland Joffé.His work is commendable.The killing fields is the story about struggle of a man caught up as a slave in Combodia,his struggle,his survival & finally the triumph of the human spirit over all hatred.This is a very touching film.Killing fields has given a new meaning to International cinema.Motivational Flick.And wow!!!John Lennon song in the end sets your mood on the right path.Must watch.",10,2,2,14 March 2010
Cast Away," Will to survive overcomes all
","Cast Away,another unique Tom Hanks performance to the International Cinema.Tom Hanks movies have developed a deep relationship with everyone which always appeases the audiences.Always i am waiting for his movie to come,so that i can see.And no doubt cast away is a very unique movie.A courageous movie i should say.Not much of dialogs,only Tom Hanks & still it was a big hit of its time.Thats smart work from Robert Zemechis.Tom Hanks as usual delivers us with something special again.The ending is very good.And is a bit heart aching for all those people who are in love.Not romantic though,this movie tells about a mans will to survive just only hope he has,a hope to meet the one he loves.Truly cast away is very unique.Tom Hanks will to survive,overcomes all in this movie & the audiences as well.",8,2,3,23 March 2010

","I never liked this movie though i still admire the concept of the movie.Such fascinating concept this was but i feel this was ruined by some weak performances.Specially from Joaquin Pheonix.He never looked the one from the village.Adrian Broody was terrific.Sigourney Weaver is just a great presence in the movie.Bryce Howard has done well but only in parts.At some places she is not looking blind at all.The ending too wasted this fascinated concept.You cannot call this a thriller though it can be said as a slow mystery drama.Never ever you feel the creatures presence.They are looking too fake.Never ever you feel the thrill that you experienced in The sixth sense.Still i feel the concept of the village was very good from Shyamlan though the acting at some places,the portrait of the creature and the slow tempo never gets to you.A fascinated concept ruined.This village is truly erratic.",4,1,2,31 March 2010
U-571," Definitely worth watching.
","U-571 is a very good submarine based movie.Yes i understand with people that Das Boot was much better.My friends,Das Boot is an epitome that cannot be surpassed.So no comparisons with U-571.Definately worth watching with a fantastic soundtrack.Even the casting is good.No big names in the movie that's why it is very much underrated.Though good performances from all actors in the movie.Specially Harvey Keitel gives a very good performance.The plot is good & the action is captivating.Great submarine action movie.Lot of torpedoes action & lot of splashes in the water.You will have to see this movie to say whether this is a good movie or not.Highly recommended for all submarine war movie lovers.Lot of drama & time worth watching.",8,0,3,22 March 2010

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Judgement Day arrives with a bang.
",Arnold was a cyborg who was programmed to kill Sarah Connor in the first flick of Terminator.But Arnold is back to protect Sarah from a more advanced cyborg.Arnold gives a damn tremendous performance as the terminator.Linda Hamilton & Edward Furlong are terrific.Linda Hamilton also deserves credit for the success of this movie.She has just acted brilliantly.The direction by James Cameroon is stupendous.What begins in the movie is a cat-mouse chase between Sarah Connor & T-1000 cyborg.Only Terminator stands in their way.The action scenes are quite terrific.The bike scenes are pretty cool.The shooting at the Cyborg University by Arnold by a massive machine gun is impressive.The portrayal of Arnold looks pretty real.Only concern comes out as the powers possessed by T-1000.Massive advancements it seems for the new cyborg.The ending is pretty good & very much touching as the fate of the terminator is decided on the Judgement Day.This is better than both its prequel & its sequel.This is Arnold at its very best.Judgement Day arrives with a nuclear blast through out the world in the movie.And here behind the screen the blast can be heard with a bang.Your ears become addicted to the dialog 'ASTA LAVISTA BABY'.Judgement Day has arrived for you.,10,4,5,23 May 2010
Apocalypse Now," The horror..........will captivate you!!!!!
","Apocalypse Now,a totally psychotic & haunting war movie.Quite different from a lot of war movies on Vietnam to walk on the earth.This movie looked like it never belonged to cinema.Such was the cinematography.The words & all even after the movie ends echo's in your head.Not for everyone.Martin Sheen has given his best performance ever.The role played by Marlon Brando as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz is a very horrifying & a unique role.Such was his acting and his words.That will always echo in your ears.Some scenes in the movie are very disturbing.Specially the buffalo sacrifice was very much a psychotic scene & it will surely disturb you.Surely you will regret seeing this movie as Vietnam war will add new chaos in your life.Such is the theme of the movie that will surely haunt you.You will regret it seeing.You might think it was a waste of your time.But The horror will surely captivate you....The horror...The horror...",8,0,1,25 March 2010

","Edward Scissorhands is another rare movie to see.When i was a kid,i hardly saw any English movies but this movie i can never forget.This one i saw i think 10 years back,& i really loved it that time.Still as a grown up now i can say that this movie is very unique & very good.The plot is that a young man,who happens to have scissors for hands,fells in love with a beautiful girl.But how society accepts there relationship?And can Edward tell Kim how much he loves her?This is more of a impossible story but then again cinema is a blessing.Great performance from Johnny Depp i feel.He has acted brilliantly with showing little emotions at the right point of time.That is what was required in the movie.Tim Burton has done a good job.Such movies are very rare to find.Fantasy cinema at its par.The final scene where Edward carves Kate in the form of ice & then snow is coming out of the windows of the old mansion is so beautiful.If i would love someone i hope i could do the same.Good fantasy cinema plus Johnny Depp charisma.A film to see.",8,0,1,21 March 2010
Rocky IV," Revenge & Pride in Russia.
","Rocky 4 stands out for me as the best of the movie from among all its prequels or sequels.It has the perfect depth of compelling human agony,the taste for revenge,some fantastic songs & triumph of the human heart over all odds.Sylvestor Stallone has done a terrific role here of Rocky again.His facial expressions & just his passion during his training in Russia just sets the tempo before the real fight.Direction by Stallone is exemplary.Just sets the mood for the audiences with some terrific songs like 'No easy way out' & 'Hearts on fire'.People start feeling that even they can be like Rocky in some other way & can take make their own choice.Brigitte Nielsen as Rocky's challenger has an imposing presence.Great act from him & rest of the support cast.This movie lives up-to its expectations.I wanted to give it whole 10 because this movie inspires me every time when i am down & out, but just to save myself from judging this movie by all heart i give it a 8.My heart wants to give it 10 but being a regular movie critic i think 8 is well deserved.Stallone with his revenge shall finally get pride in Russia.You shall see Russian people cheering for Rocky in their home.As for me i am here too cheering for Rocky 4,forever & for-always.",8,1,3,17 May 2010
The Machinist," Insomnia leads to madness.
","The Machinist,is a very strange and a very unique mystery movie.The movie starts with Trevor(Cristian Bale) rolling a body in the carpet and dumping it in the sea.Then suddenly the movie changes.And we can see that Trevor is facing Insomnia for the past one year.He starts imagining people and all.Due to an accident caused by Trevor a man looses his arm.That makes everyone in his work his enemies.His insomnia turns to madness,as he finds things written on his fridge.But what does it mean.And who is writing them all.He never sleeps and still feels nightmares.Cristian Bale gives a tremendous performance.So unique acting and he has mad himself so lean just for this movie.Thats his dedication.Rest of the casting is good.The movie keeps you guessing as Trevor continues to find the answers of his madness.Brilliantly directed and fantastic cinematography this movie is very rare.Strange though just like Memento,there it was amnesia here it is Insomnia.Truly Insomnia can drive anyone to madness.",8,0,0,1 April 2010

American History X," After watching this i learned something : Hate is baggage
",This has been the most influential movie i have seen in my life.It taught me things so as to perceive in different ways.To forget hate & to accept love.Awesome direction by Tony Kay.One of the best directed films i have seen probably the best after the Godfather part-2.Cinematography is perfect.Also the black-white contrast just sets the mood for the audience. Unforgetful performance by Edward Norton(Derek).I think this is his best performance up to date.He has proved how dedicated he is to his acting & truly this role deserved an Oscar. Edward Furlong(Doris) also plays a fantastic role.Lending deep emotions in to the role.This movie will make you feel that in the past if you have wasted your years for no good reasons then please don't waste it now.Becasuse Hate is Baggage.Love can overcome all odds.Some scenes in the movie will make you feel why you don't get along with your brother that well.Hopefully you can learn and see for yourself. Specially the scene in which Derek takes a bath & the movie takes you back to his childhood days playing side by side with your brother.This will cut you deep.You will feel the pain. The ending is very good & unpredictable.Soundtrack is fabulous.Will make you feel why you wasted so many good years of your life. Truly a masterpiece!!!Best movie of the 1990's.,10,0,2,5 March 2010
The Usual Suspects," Stupendous Ending.
","The usual suspects,well for me it was a real surprise.What started as a puzzling movie ended as one of the best endings for a movie i have seen.The movie starts with a puzzling police lineup & then the movie itself flash backs a number of times.The way Kevin Spacey has played his role of Verbal Kint,will leave you speechless in the end.The way he demonstrates everything about what happened always has a bit of flair attached to it.I think its just his panache.Gabriel Byrne is a great actor.What more can i say about him.Chazz Palminteri is very lucky to get the role of Dave Kujan.I heard that it was Al Pacino who had turned down this role.Al still regrets this.Dave Kujan role is a very intrigue kind of a role.A role that believes in himself and draws his own conclusions.A man they say nobody can fool.Kevin Spacey rightfully won the Oscar for best supporting actor because he is a master at story telling.The usual suspects is a rare movie to breathe.The main flair is just its ending.Just adds fire to the movie.And Who is Keyser Soze?A devil of a man from whom everyone is scared of.And as Dave would say to Verbal,don't you lie to me?I know how to spot a murderer?But just see this movie to feel the twists and the lies.And the twist about Kobayashi in the end.That just made my day...",10,2,4,29 March 2010

Great acting from Brad Pitt,Anthony Hopkins & Aidan Quinn.Awesome performances.This movie is a bit slow though.But nevertheless entertaining stuff. In my eyes,Brad Pitt rises to the ranks after such a terrific performance. The ending is fantastic & the linking up of the Red Indians with Brad Pitt is just so magical. Hats of to Jim Harrison,who has written this novel.Screenplay is fantastic.The musical score is very good.Suits the theme of the movie. If you have a family,you love your brothers,you love a girl,you love your values.Then this movie is a must for you.Prepare for a terrific family drama experience.Exceptional movie.",8,1,3,9 March 2010
No Country for Old Men," Highly Overrated, never deserved an Oscar
","Well no country for old men,the name would suggest that it would be some old guy goofed up story.But the story is totally flawed.I wasn't able to make out how it got an Oscar.Though i appreciate the work of Javier Bardem as the notorious serial killer.He rightfully deserved an Oscar for this movie.Josh Brolin also acted pretty well.But whats the point?No doubt a decent action film.But if you apply your mind to it then what the f*** was in the movie? The last speech by Tommy Lee Jones.What was it about?Why the f*** he is talking about his dream & all.The ending is just pathetic.Cant make out what was the ending like.Totally disappointed.From gory & violence point of view its a decent enough flick,but if you are a serious critic guy.This movie is f*****.I admire Coen brothers after their flicks Millers Crossing & Fargo.They were much better then this movie.For me it was a total disappointment.Highly overrated.",4,4,9,6 March 2010
Batman Begins," Leaves a legacy.
","Batman Begins,begins with a new era in the International Cinema where comic heroes come to life.This time its just the real humanly Batman and Christopher Nolan.Christopher Nolan made this impossible into possible.Make Batman come to life,so we can believe something like that sort of can exist.Cristian Bale shows how he can adapt to any role.His role in The machinist & in this is totally different.Though he has given a terrific performance here.Batman of the modern era is truly Bale.Michael Caine is a revelation with role of Alfred.Liam Neeson is a presence in the movie.Even the Batman cannot possess such a presence that he carries throughout.Gary Oldman as Gordon has done a terrific job here.Rest of the casting is pretty perfect.Its just the dark theme of the movie that sets up the pace.Cinematography is perfect.Direction is mind blowing.Batman Begins makes way for another commendable movie 'The Dark Knight' to enlighten itself on us.Dark Knight has already broken so many barriers,achieved so many milestones,but if not for beginning from Batman Begins,it could not have landed up on the top.Batman Begins with Bale leaves a legacy behind....",10,1,1,29 March 2010

","The finest war drama movie you will ever experience.Saving Private Ryan takes you to the path where everyone has his own path,everyone thinks his own way,but why all have to sacrifice just for one.The horrors that each face while searching for Ryan is too compelling.Tom Hanks.Oh boy,what a performance by him again.I cant remember a flop movie of him at the box office.No wonder why he is the favorite of Spielberg.Tom Sizemore & Jeremy Davies have also given a brilliant performance.Matt Demon also does a fair job.The war scenes are just too gruesome & gory at some points but truly battles are fought like these only.True depiction of what lies in war.The horror,the suffering & the truth.The cinematography is too good & the editing is even better.Horrors of the soldiers is just too influential.Everyone has some guilt.Everyone wants to go home but then duty lies in front of them.The question is do they find Ryan in the end.If they do,was he worth it.You have to see this to believe this.Awesome movie.The speech given by Gen. George C. Marshall is just too good.I like to share the last lines of that speech. (Gen.George C. Marshall):'I pray that our heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. Yours very sincerely and respectfully, Abraham Lincoln.'Last but not the least.The end credits of the movie are fascinating.So sit on & listen to it(Hymn to the fallen).Saving Private Ryan,you earn this.My personal 10.",10,2,4,5 March 2010
28 Days Later...," Danny Boyle always delivers in some way or the other
","Another virus outbreak in England and this time the virus brings a new meaning that is rage.This isn't just a survival movie from Zombie or the infected species,instead Danny Boyle brings to us a story of bravery and heroism.Actually it doesn't make much sense till the end.But in the end,this is what we had expected to see.Cillian Murphy was brilliant portraying the character of Jim.So was Naomie Harris.Rest of the star cast was supportive to these two.The screenplay is excellent portraying the raged infected zombie's to be aggravated but very much realistic definitely not like the Jumpy kind of zombies we see in I am Legend.This is way beyond I am Legend in lot of senses.Specially the heroic part and the vision of army men who want to survive or rather want some goal in the form of the women that they see.Danny Boyle brings out the realism that we expected from the characters.The soundtrack in the end is pretty cool as well.Danny Boyle always does a decent job as he brings to us not a perfect but still very good movie.....those 28 days.",Null,0,1,23 September 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," I doubt i will ever see a movie better than this
","Wow!!!I was speechless when i saw this film.Still have memories of the movie.My father used to see this movie i guess 10 years back when i was a kid,he told me that its a masterpiece of International Cinema.But now after watching this i know this is truly a masterpiece.No short of an epic,Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence has given a performance of a lifetime.Peter will always be remembered as Lawrence.The man who loved the desert.The man who united Arabia.The man whose conflicting loyalties made Arabia a united country.The rest of the performances specially that of Alec Guinness(Prince Feisal),Anthony Quinn(Auda Abu Tayi) & not to forget Omar Sharif(Sheriff Ali) are terrific.Brilliant performances from everyone.The scenes where Lawrence sits in the desert just feeling the sand,is so captivating.Lawrence faces such horrors of war that we can feel it through his eyes.The love for the desert makes him to change into something that he was meant to be.A legend.Truly for some men nothing is written until they write it.Though on personal fronts he would have suffered a lot in the desert & in Arabia.That has been wonderfully shown in the film.Still i feel the last scene,where Lawrence is going back to England & just sees Arabs on camels on his way.He feels again that he belongs here.And with the memorable soundtrack the movie closes.Thats so beautiful.David Lean has directed an epic here.This is the best movie of the century.This can never be emulated.This movie is just too difficult to surpass.I doubt i will ever see a movie better than this.",10,4,7,21 March 2010

The casting is good with Jeremy Renner leading from the front.His acting was special in this film.Anthony Mackie also gives a good performance but what was weak was the plot.Its perfectly fine depicting American soldiers having different perception in Iraq,but what was the point.Even the ending was a bit abrupt to say.I never got the hold of the movie & how it won the Oscars.The camera-work is too good.I give this movie a thumbs down 7 specially due to great camera-work i have seen after long time.You can't call this a thriller.Just few men trying to survive in the war going Iraq.Oscar critics.I don't know what they are doing.",7,7,12,14 March 2010

","The Dark Knight,has surpassed all my expectations,all my hopes,all my dreams,everything after i saw it in theater.For me Batman Begins was like a legacy,this was never expected.This was much better then its prequel.Only two movies i think have done that Godfather Part-2 and The Dark Knight.The star-cast and the characterization was much the same from Batman Begins but then came someone who leaves behind a calling card.The one who is called 'The Joker'.Heath Ledger,fantastic actor and a fantastic legacy he has left after his sad demise.The legacy that can be shown by his brilliance in the Dark Knight.If Batman Begins was all Cristian Bale,this was all about Heath Ledger.Tremendous performance,breathtaking dialog delivery,fantastic screen presence.You should just see the eagerness in the eyes of people.They don't want to see the Batman with his heroics.They want to see the Joker playing his little games.Aaron Eckhart too has given a stupendous performance.I never thought he could give such an emphatic performance of two face but he proved me wrong.Christopher Nolan surely is the best director i have seen.What movies he has made...Memento,Insomnia,Prestige and the Batman Legacy now.I can't wait to see the sequel for this.Truly,a departing gift for Heath was his performance as Joker which will always hit deep on our memories and will make him immortal.If you think my review above is serious,i have a question.....Why so serious?",10,1,5,29 March 2010
Into the Wild," I wanna be reborn again like Chris
",Wow!!!What a film this is?After a long time i have seen a movie that will surely touch you.A unique movie in its own.Chris McCandless role played by Emile Hirsch is sensational.He has given a beautiful performance in this movie.Sean Penn direction was superb.From the screenplay to the cinematography to the soundtrack.Everything is exceptional. Oscar worthy direction.The plot is actually quite good.This movie can also be called as a documentary.The movie shows the depiction of events of Chris that change his life.How Chris life's begins again after his college life?What makes him to think so different from others?Why he wants to go to Alaska? Even the casting of Chris's father & mother have been exceptional.Tremendous performance from Kristen Stewart & Hal Holbrook too.Commendable.This movie will surely make you cry if not for Chris but for the events that are portrayed in his life.Some moments will surely take you back to those old memories of you that changed your life.The dialogs are quite good.Specially the narration by Chris sister's in the end.We all miss Chris.But no one could be reborn like Chris again.This is movie is a must too see.A treat for the eyes & International cinema.Fabulous.,9,1,3,14 March 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Never got the hold of it,but still i think it is great
",2001:A Space Odyssey is a rare masterpiece directed by the Legendry Stanley Kubrick.This is a kind of film you like it or you hate it.Seriously i was not able to get the story point for this film but nevertheless its a feast for your eyes.Such brilliant cinematography & graphics in 1960's.That's just amazing work.I had to read the plot on IMDb itself to get the point of the movie but after reading it i truly appreciate.A true cinema lover will surely appreciate.For the rest of the people i am not sure.The ending is pretty good if you can get the hold of it.A man reborn again.Such a sight to see.I never got the hold of this movie but i still think it is great.Amazing camera-work & vision shown.Soundtrack is a blessing.Definitely one of the unique movies you will ever see in your whole life.,8,0,2,16 March 2010
Blood Diamond," None of whom has ever seen a diamond
","Impressive!!!Blood diamond surely stands out as one of the best thrillers i have ever seen.Fantastic performance from Leonardo DiCaprio & Djimon Hounsou.Here we see two different kind of African people in the movie who need diamond for their own different reasons.Jennifer Connelly has done a great job.Tremendous screen presence she possesses. The plot is that two African men have to search for a black diamond but only one knows the location & other has to help him to get his family back.A lot of other people(like businessmen) too want to hunt the diamond for their own greed.Will they succeed??Or they have to give up what they love the most??Must watch.It seems Edward Zwick can't do any thing wrong.After his success with movies like Glory & The Last Samurai,this one surely is in the league.Everything he touches turns to gold or here i should say touches to diamond.Brilliant story showing truth about African land of Diamonds.The slavery of Diamonds.The value of diamonds for them & the rest of the world.The truth about diamonds is not that clear.It has blood spilled all over it.Blood Diamonds is a movie not to be missed.Nor for the acting & neither for the direction.I believe most of us have not seen a diamond,but through blood diamond we can realize what it takes to get a diamond.None of whom has ever seen a diamond,for them blood diamond is a revelation.",9,0,1,21 March 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," Robert De Niro, Direction & Opium leads to masterpiece
","Well what can you say, you feel lost for words after watching this movie.Time and again i have seen this and with it to see more of this, my greed becomes even more.Sergio Leone is a fantastic director, he has proved it in the 60's and again in the 80's he proves it again.The movie revolves in time frames.Where we see De Niro in his youth,in his adulthood and then in his old.Though nothing is chronological.Everything makes sense in the end of the movie or rather befits the sequencing.This is a rare movie,a movie about friendship,with trust,with regret and then with De Niro and his opium.The soundtrack of Ennio Morricone here leaves the viewers numb.As without it i felt the movie cannot be a masterpiece.The story is all about friendship,guilt and regret between couple of best friends.The opium scene is a fantastic add-on to already magnificent tapestry of story writing. Adulation's for the writers.Still i feel De Niro was great but without the direction and vision of Sergio Leone this would have been incomplete.Not to forget James Woods who also gives a great performance.The ending just breaks you or rather portrays your own guilt in front of you.This is special feeling that you wont get.Don't think of a good feeling after watching this.As you will surely delve into bonds of friendship which you had long time ago.Surely this movie will leave you numb....hats off Sergio Leone and tribute to you....still i ponder the opium scene and the guilt....and i wonder......",10,3,8,2 July 2011
Taken," 93 minutes of excellence
",Taken is one of the best movies of 2008.Brilliant fast paced thriller with a terrific performance from Liam Neeson.Such short movie but nevertheless definitely worth watching.Liam Neeson has given his best here.The plot is that a father has to save his daughter who has been kidnapped & is being forced to slave trade.A former spy Neeson tries to save his daughter.Is he still good??You have to watch it to see for yourself.I think only Boondock Saints is shorter time-wise compared to this movie.But this is a great film to see.Just the plot & the fast paced action is too good.Taken is nothing much but 93 minutes of excellence.,9,3,7,23 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," Terrific performance from Hopkins.
","Great performance from Hopkins.Is all i can say after watching this movie.All in all its only the determination of Hopkins that makes this movie such a success.Without him this movie would be nothing much.His role as Burt Munro from New Zealand will surely stand out.The plot is that a old man with an old Indian bike goes all the way from New Zealand to USA to set the land-speed world record.He faces lot of hurdles.Even his health is a problem.But its only his will & hope that makes it possible for him to break the World Speed Record.Beautifully directed by Roger Donaldson,this movie just sets up the mood for the audience.This is a very good movie.All adulations should go for Anthony Hopkins.And believe it or not Anthony Hopkins is the world's fastest Indian.",8,0,0,22 March 2010
Avatar," Quantum Leap in Cinematic Viewing.
","Avatar released in 3D has just created a hype around everywhere in the world.Now everyone wants to see a 3D movie.Such is the impact that Avatar has left.Plot wise it was a failure but who wants to see the plot if you could see mystique creatures flying around in 3D.Enough of this sci-fi stuff but lets get back to the plot.Though technically brilliant,this James Cameroon movie has a very much trite kind of a plot to understand.Sam Worthington as Jake Sully has done very well.But his true identity seems to be lost in the Avatar attire.Same can be said for Zoe Saldana as well.The story mainly revolves around their love affair in that Fabulous Avatar attire.Rest of the casting is pretty OK.What Avatar has done is that it has laid a terrific platform for a lot of new upcoming movies.Even the old ones,if you just think,LOTR or King Kong or even Jurassic Park in 3D.That would be something.Good direction by James Cameroon & mind-blowing cinematography by Mauro Fiore.I gave blade runner just my 9 because i felt that it was something unique my eyes have seen.Same goes for Avatar too.Avatar for me is a quantum leap in Cinematic Viewing.",9,4,8,29 March 2010
Chariots of Fire," When I run I feel his pleasure
","This is a decent enough movie for all sport fans.Most see for all sport lovers.Truly inspiring & motivational.Cinematography is very well done.Editing is fabulous.Very well done performance from both Ian Charleson(Eric Liddell) & Ben Cross(Harold Abrahams).Highly motivational flick.Some scenes would definitely take you back to the past.People find happiness only in their success but such is the theme of the movie that in disappointment one should never fall back.Always move ahead.Never give in your morals.Haunting is the part,when you loose & you look back where were you & where you are now.You are a changed person.Such commitment by both young fellas in the movie.That you wont be disappointed.I still remember the scene & the first dialog:'Now there are just two of us - young Aubrey Montague and myself - who can close our eyes and remember those few young men with hope in our hearts and wings on our heels'.And then there is the soundtrack.beautiful.",7,2,3,5 March 2010
The Last Samurai," Perfect... They are all... perfect...
","Amazing cinema.Top notch movie from Edward Zwick having high class drama & action.Great acting by Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe.Wow,their conversations are riveting.Casting is superb.Dialogues are appreciative.Cinematography is perfect.This movie is all about the American Captain Nathen Algren (Tom Cruise) who captured by the samurai tribal leader Katsumoto(Watanabe) begins to differ on loyalties.Whether he is a samurai or a captain who was to suppress the rebel samurai.Brilliant movie to watch.You would love to watch it over again & again.I don't understand why its not in the top 250.Sure its in my top 250.Fantastic soundtrack.The ending is superb.For honor & for this movie i give it my personal best 10.Katsumoto said 'The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life'.Trust me if you see this movie then you wont think that it was a waste of your time.Just to honor the samurai you have to breathe this movie & watch it.Must watch!!!!!!",10,15,33,5 March 2010
3 Idiots," Truly idiotic story setup but very much entertaining.
","3 Idiots,another new Aamir Khan starer comes to our Indian cinema.That guys just only knows to give decent performances and attract crowds with stupendous acting.No doubt,he is the best we get from Indian Cinema.The plot for the movie is very much idiotic but nevertheless it leaves a great moral in the end for upcoming youth.Boman Irani as usual is pretty terrific and Kareena Kapoor looks stunning.Madhavan and Sharman Joshi also have done very well in their support roles.Good decent comedy movie.This one's for all ages i suppose.Nothing as such of that much nudity and vulgar stuff in this.After all its an Aamir Khan starer,you just have to watch it.Some things in the movie look ridiculous like birth of a child with the help of Vaccum Cleaner but no doubt it was very much entertaining.Good comedy,good moral and Of course Aamir Khan.Very entertaining.But you cannot miss this one.",7,1,5,5 April 2010
Reservoir Dogs," 99 minutes of no nonsense stuff
","Reservoir Dogs,if you like movies with twists,movies with loaded guns,movies with action,movies with some great dialogs,reservoir dogs is the one for you then.It has everything of the above.The movie itself moves so fast that it is tough to catch if you miss anything.Tremendous plot and a perfect execution.Quentin Tarantino's best so far.And funny thing was that they used to call each other by colors not names.Casting is very good specially Harvey Keitel & Michael Madsen have given a good performance.Steve Buscemi as Mr pink is terrific.The ending is pretty cool.All trust & betrayal.Whom to trust & whom to betray.Till the end you just keep guessing.Reservoir Dogs is pure entertainment,99 minutes of no nonsense stuff.",8,1,1,25 March 2010
Inside Man," Spike Lee shows us a perfect bank heist.
","Inside Man,a man who robes the bank,the police comes to find the robbers,but no one's inside.Thats why Inside Man is such an enigma.The police never got a clue what happened?Money was there in the safe but no one took it.Inside man puzzles the police as well as the audiences around.The plot is very good.You just hold on to your seats to find out what happened.But you wont have a clue till the end.The casting is the best.Clive Owen plays the perfect role of the perfect bank robber.Denzel Washington is the detective who has to negotiate with the robbers.Jodie Foster is brought to the case to negotiate a precious thing that is there in the bank,something that's definitely worth more than money.Brilliantly directed,the ending just makes your day.More than a perfect bank robbery.So planned,so perfect.You just thing it might be impossible but Spike Lee has made this possible.A perfect bank heist.A movie nearly perfect with thrilling twists and portraying a new dimension to criminal psychology.",8,1,2,30 March 2010
Pulp Fiction," Only Dialogs with no concrete story
","After such a hype by my friends that Pulp Fiction is a very great movie.I saw this just now.And truly speaking only i felt dialogs were great apart from that Quentin Tarantino has got no story to show to the audience here.All the hype has faded for me.Violence & Mayhem all the way but you never feel like attached or captivated by the movie.I don't know what Quentin Tarantino tries to prove here.Only positive for me was the acting of Samuel L. Jackson.His speeches & the dialog delivery timing perfectly fits.Bruce Willis is again good.Somebody wrote like John Travolta looked lost.Absolutely right.Uma Thurman is kind of OK.Rest of the casting is also OK only.But what was the point for this movie.In the end,we come to know that everyone in this film are on a violent streak and only one wants to change.But this is no concrete story & its a strange way to tell a story.I don't get it how its in the top 10 of IMDb.Reservoir Dogs was more interesting & fun compared to this.So people only see this one if you have a knack for saying some pretty cool mother f***** dialogs otherwise you will end up being disappointed.I give it a 5 just for the character setup Quentin tries to achieve.Apart from that,sorry Tarantino,i hope you learn from this.",5,5,10,9 June 2010
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind:Crowe made it real
","Russel Crowe,what should i say?A Beautiful Mind is his & Howards masterpiece.His performance as John Nash will stand out as the best performance of his career.Also not to forget Jennifer Connely & Ed Harris.Both deserve a great applaud.Jennifer Connely has acted with such passion in this movie that i am truly amazed.She deserved an Oscar for this.She got it.Rightfully deserved.The plot is superb.A brilliant mathematician takes up job as a cryptographer and later finds out about his imaginations.All that he believes is unreal.How circumstances change & how John Nash becomes a noble prize winner.This movie is a triumph over all odds.Ed Harris gives it more spark.Ron Howard has directed this very brilliantly.Oscar worthy direction.Even the dialogs are pretty good.Just don't sit back & read this review,buy a DVD of beautiful mind and see how Russel Crowe triumphs over all odds.Truly only Crowe made this real.Great work.I give my personal best 10 to this evergreen flick.",10,0,2,16 March 2010
The Departed," Extravaganza of betrayal & loyalty.......
","Scorsese brings to us a perfect adaptation of Infernal Affairs, a great Hong Kong crime thriller.Even i saw Infernal Affairs before seeing the departed.The movie is an achievement in itself but what hampers the presence are the subtitles to go along.But then Scorsese brings to us a movie based on loyalty & betrayal which will be a perfect departure for all movie lovers.Leonardo & Matt Demon were superb.Usually crime movie follows like,one is a cop & other is a mobster.Not this time.Be prepared to get your imaginations & your expectations banged hard.The twists & the ending everything just fits too well on screen.Then you have the maestro himself Jack Nicholson,who again proves he is the best.The tempo of the movie is fast so audience get glued to the movie as well as the dialog delivery are perfect.I can't forget this movie with such a unique cast with Martin Sheen & Mark Wahlberg too in it.Scorsese should have won the Oscar before,many people say.Nor i have seen Goodfellas neither Raging Bull,but now i have to,as i know Scorsese sure has the element to surprise me.He did exactly that with The Departed & Shutter Island. This is a great adaptation with some pretty cool dialogs.My personal best is : 'Today, what I'm saying to you is this: when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?'.Scorsese direction is exceptional & the rat concept gets to the audience.But is everything fair in loyalty & betrayal.This is a must watch for all crime movie lovers.I gave Infernal Affairs 9 because its pretty cool film,even better then The Departed.But Departed deserves 10 due to just the brilliance of Jack Nicholson.This is an extravaganza of betrayal & loyalty.....",10,1,3,2 June 2010
Psycho," Fantastic thrill seeker
","Psycho,by Hitchcock is the ultimate thrill seeker.Just the tension floats as soon as one enters Bates Motel.The performances are perfect.Vera Miles starts of this psycho journey and makes us start believing on the strangeness everywhere.Even on the road,even in the motel,and not to forget what happens in bathroom of room #1.John Gavin behaves a deep lover.Anthony Perkins is the one we need to watch for.His acting and just the way he acts as innocent and later on we all know who the mother turns out to be.Psycho is all about tension seeker,thrill twister,pure Hitchcokian brilliance.Just the movie starts and characters itself keep filling in.This is not horror but a thriller with brilliance of Hitchcock.What more can i say.Just watch it,when the lights are out,switch on your speakers to a full bass,and start this terrific and terrifying journey that we all know as Psycho.",10,0,0,8 December 2010
Rosemary's Baby," Only a fabulous ending soundtrack,thats it i mean,nothing else
","Rosemary Baby,what the hell critics are writing.I thought of it as a tension seeker kind of a film.This film does not carry tension.It even does not have horror or a ghost.It has absolutely nothing.Even the direction is also worth neglecting.Its not spooky,not scary.I don't know what it is.Only disappointment you get when you see 8.1 rating for a movie like this.Total annoyance you feel after watching this.The only good thing was a fabulous soundtrack in the end.Soundtrack is just too good.All in all,stands no where near the horror stack of films.I give it only 3 rating.1 for just without any horror,2 for acting of Mia Farrow which i felt was good and 3 just for fabulous score.All people who watch it,all the best.If you get fuc**d up,then just forward it.And listen to end credits for sure.At least,you will find something good for your rest of the day.",3,4,15,8 December 2010
The Last King of Scotland," Great biopic focusing on one of the most evil man in history.
","The last king of Scotland,strange name for a movie shot in Uganda.But this movie is a quality biopic.Forest Whitaker's role as that of Idi Amin is truly commendable.Oscar worthy but i felt the role of Will Smith in that of Pursuit of Happiness was more worthy.Though,thats past now.James McAvoy,the Scottish doctor in this movie has done a fabulous job.Rest of the casting is perfect.Amin was a terrible man and that has been portrayed in the film.Why Amin was called a cannibal and why he was one of the most evil man in history.The direction of Kevin Macdonald is of high quality in the movie.This is a true epic movie.But if you compare,Der Undertang was much better.But that was Hitler of Germany and this was Amin of Uganda.Facts are in front of us.Amin was an evil man,killing his own wife and trying to kill the doctor who wanted to help him.This one is a great biopic on one of the most evil man in history.",8,0,1,26 March 2010
American Gangster," Fabulous character study reminds me of Heat
","American Gangster directed by the maestro Ridley Scott just reminds us of the shades shown by Pacino & De Niro in Heat.The character study is very impressive.We have the calm & composed Denzel Washington who only shows his outbursts just to show his dominance & on the other hand we have Russel Crowe who is having problems with his married life & is a top notch detective just like Pacino in Heat.But the issue here is narcotics.I must say the presence of Denzel & Crowe just stands for itself.It did the same like what Pacino & De Niro did in Heat.Just overshadowing some great performances.Josh Brolin was sensational & so was Ted Levine(the same man in Heat).Also we have the impressive Cuba Gooding Jr. with another short but impactive role.Ridley Scott direction is again flawless.But where the movie slightly looses is the ending.If they could have replicated it like that of Heat this would have been more impressive.All in all,you have everything you want from this film.You have the narcotics,you have the cops,you have the gangsters,you have some terrific performances.Fantastic character study again from two different actors.This is just short of that great word as the ending might have been a little bit good.But still it was very good.Now we know the two sides of the American Dream,on one is Denzel & on the other is Crowe.And the American dream itself is just some terrific performances.Watch out.",9,0,1,9 June 2010
The Mission," Film that needs a viewing
","The mission starring Robert De Niro is a musical epic in itself.Fantastic score by Ennio Marricone.Soundtrack is fantastic.The performances given by Robert De Niro & Jeremy Irons are a blessing for all cinema lovers.This is a very good movie.The mission shows the struggle of two men who want to preach Christianity to the natives living in Brazil.When Spain sells the colony to Portugal,both are forced to defend all that they have built.We see a contrast between two men.Both have their own ways.De Niro wants to protect them by using firearms,as once he was a hunter.Whearas Irons is a committed priest who does not want to take firearms.He believes that god would protect them.The mission is a cinematic beauty with a great camera-work. Terribly underrated but definitely a film that needs a viewing.",8,2,2,24 March 2010
The Green Mile," A spectacle to watch......
","A true masterpiece.Stephen king,last i heard he was a horror novel writer.But can he write any more just like this.I am dying to read the novel after watching the movie.Tom cruise(Paul) what a performance by him & Michael Clarke Duncan(John Coffey.Both were extraordinary.Rest of the cast is also pretty good.Specially Patricia Clarkson(Melinda Moores) & Sam Rockwell('Wild Bill').Short roles but what a performance.This truly deserved the Oscar but i cant make it why it did not got any.Cinematography is exceptional.Editing is at par.Brilliant direction by Darabont.What steals the show are the dialogs- Melinda: 'I dreamed of you. I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other. We found each other in the dark.'Paul: 'We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but, oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long'.Truly this is a masterpiece.Must watch for all good movie lovers.And the ending,i am speechless.",10,1,3,5 March 2010
The Wrestler," Rourke Magic !!
","Mickey Rourke.Oh boy,he can act.What a depiction of an old aging wrestler.Rourke gives his best performance here.No doubt wrestling is not an easy thing in the ring but also outside it doesn't get any easy.A successful wrestler but an aging one who got an heart-ache sometime back.Suddenly has to leave what he loves.People love him for his wrestling but as a normal person he is no more than a side-walker for them.Mickey realizes these as he faces lot of challenges in his personal life after quitting wrestling.He doesn't get along with his girl.She is the only one he has.And to the female stripper who thinks Mickey can be no good.What is best in this movie is the decisions he take.You got to do what you do best.I liked wrestling from my childhood but now i guess i like even more.This was the first movie based on wrestling i saw.Probably expecting more to follow.So friend can you ask for anything more.Its Rourke Magic!!!!",9,2,3,5 March 2010
Inception," Vision,Dreams & just Nolan
","Inception,let us take a leap of faith.Well,People have already taken a leap of faith in Christopher Nolan since the beginning of his era stretching from Memento to The Dark Knight.But this is different.You delve into dreams and then hang on between worlds of realism or just a dream.Christopher Nolan has the absolute best ideas of all the movie writers.Apart from his directing,which is exemplary,the writing script stands out.Just the concept and to make us believe it is possible is just truly remarkable.The casting starting from Leonardo was brilliant.His acts are always regarded as superb.And Mr Cobb in Inception is at the top for me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Ellen Page are great too.Ken Watanabe is a fabulous man to have in your movie as he justifies each and every role given to him.He is a great actor.So is Cillian Murphy for his role.Just so calm and compose in this act where as his previous movie roles were being aggressive and cunning.He is a diversified actor.I don't want to forget Marion Cotillard after her role of Mal and just to have Tom Berenger in the movie is an honor.The movie draws attention on basic idea extraction from dreams.A vision appears to the audiences as Cobb & crew delve into numerous dreams.When we see gravity shifts and Limbo drops audiences will always get a kick of their own that Christopher Nolan is brilliant.Camera-work is sensational,Directing is again superb,Screenplay is everlasting.And music by Hans Zimmer is as perfect as a Dream Creation itself.The conclusion for this movie stands out as one of the rarest & visionary movies to have come along.Justifies its #4th position in the top 250.This is not great,this is just grand.Vision is for the Oscars,Dreams are for the audiences and Nolan is just Nolan.Simply Brilliant.People might think now,after such successes of movies from Nolan.Can't we call Perfect as the new adjective,that we know now,none other than Nolan.",10,1,6,5 December 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Camaraderie between Robbins & Freeman is too difficult to surpass.
","The Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted from a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in International Cinema.The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very difficult to surpass.Wow!!What an on screen display by both of them. If Robbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of performance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James Whitmore as Brooks is a revelation,so is Bob Gunton as the warden.The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what happened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from this:Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music? Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.",10,1,1,14 March 2010
Platoon," Questions Morality of man and leaves the viewers numb
","Platoon is just another war film or its something else.Yes,it is just not another war film.Seems like a war film with strong undercurrents questioning man moments of honesty and his will to do good.Oliver Stone gives us Vietnams Vengeance on the morality of U.S army officers.The movie shows how U.S war soldiers hated Vietnam and hence in their anger and fury started hating each other.Charlie Sheen performance is commendable as he is the one who is haunted by the questions of good and evil in the jungles of Vietnam.But the movie describes the inner self of two men.Elias as William Defoe and Barnes as Tom Berenger.Both are warriors and both are haunted by war.Both have their own ways of surviving and satisfaction.Barnes turns to bad killing innocents whereas Elias finds satisfaction in taking of drugs and always helping others.The movie also has some famous actors like Johnny Depp and Forest Whitetaker when they were not famous.Some scenes like Elias running from Vietnamese and crying for help to his friends are amazing.The soundtrack of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings will surely leave you numb.War scenes are well carried out and character display is perfect.Oliver Stone here gives a film that leaves you numb and all think that war could turn all good to evil.Charlie Sheen ending lines are captivating and echoing.Platoon talks about hatred for Vietnam,love for home,innocence of youth and last but not the least morality of men who usually get consumed and lost in the war.",10,1,2,5 December 2010
Paths of Glory," Truth about morality in war.
",Paths of glory is not a full blooded world war film.Its just so unique.Just tests the morality of soldiers of war.This movie portrays the dominance of arrogance by the generals over soldiers who try to make a mockery of them just for mere pride and satisfaction.This movie shows how generals make few soldiers to pay just to set a mere example for the rest.Kirk Douglas is captivating as Colonel Dax.His speeches in the courtroom of trial are very much captivating.Adolphe Menjou as Gen. George Broulard has given a fantastic performance.Mere soldiers bravery turns to cowardice when they see the casualties in front of them trying to capture Ant Hill.Cowardice is in fact threatening rather than death in war.But just to pick random guys for trial just to create a mockery of others was mockery of the Generals.Colonel Dax tried his best to save his soldiers.But every one was biased.No one listened.This is a brilliant movie by Stanley Kubrick.The ending scene is great where the German girl captured starts to sing and cruelty of men fades into tears.That was the truth about morality in war which opened the pathways for the men to glory.,9,1,2,15 April 2010
Raging Bull," Robert De Niro and the art of film making
","Martin Scorsese,what can one say after watching this.Terrific direction and just terrific character build up.Scorsese always is a director who leaves his mark.Robert De Niro is just like god in acting.What performances he shows.Not to forget Jo Pesci who is totally special.The movie revolves around a professional middleweight boxer who wins everything professionally but on the personal front his life is a struggle.The movie shows as he wins by aggression in the ring,the same aggression outside it leads to his contemplation and isolation.The movie shows the life events of his first fights till his last.Kepping in loop the sequences in his personal life.The name Raging Bull just fits De Niro or rather the role Jake La Motta.Jake who actually tells his life struggle in the ring & outside it.Fabulous.Someone wrote that all young film makers should see this to learn flawless direction.One think i know from Scorsese after watching this,he is a great filmmaker who is flawless....both in direction as well as in thinking........great work....",10,2,2,2 July 2011

","Have the lambs stop screaming,Clarice??Only Clarice can answer the question & the one who watches this movie.Packed with action & lot of thrill.The best thriller movie of the 90's.Mind blowing performance from Anthony Hopkins(Dr Lector) & Jodie Foster(Clarice).Both deserved an Oscar & rightfully got it.Great performance too from Ted Levine(as Bill).This is the movie showing what serial killers are made of.Deep insight into FBI & crime psychology.Though i have seen Hannibal & The Red Dragon.But this is way better compared to the rest.Deserved a 8.7 rating.You have to watch it yourself just for the sheer brilliance of Anthony Hopkins & the maturity shown by Jodie Foster.Will Clarice be able to save another victim from the hands of Wild Bill??& what about Lector,what becomes of him??You need to watch this movie.But just be wary of the fact,if you get too obsessed with this-'Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head'.",9,1,2,4 March 2010
Iron Man," Which suit are you wearing today.
","Iron Man,the comic hero comes to life as we see Stark taking on the might of terrorism & his own friends who turn to evil against mankind. Robert Downey Jr perfectly fits the on screen Iron Man.His suits suit not only him but bring to us another super hero come alive.The first half of the movie is much better then the second half.The thrill of how Iron Man is made in a small cave is so remarkable.Cinematography is superb & the soundtrack also fits the screen.Jeff Bridges does very well as a mutual friend earlier to stark & then his ultimate enemy.Gwyneth Paltrow also looks good & gives good support.Iron man can't be compared to 'The Dark Knight'.In Dark Knight we see superheroes actually come to life.But Iron Man,can it be possible for someone to make such a suit.The answer lies in the future maybe the next 500 years.Till then,Iron Man could be taken only for fun & a new adventure.After a weak period of lull movies surrounding us,Iron Man makes it up as the best from the 2008 period.Only i have one question for Tony Stark,what suit are you wearing today?But just watch out new enemies are starring at your fame & ready to hit back on you in the upcoming sequel Iron Man 2.",7,0,2,23 May 2010
Blade Runner," A feast for the eyes
","Definitely worth seeing not for the story but for the sci-fi effect & perfect indulgence of the superior soundtrack by Vangelis.Blade Runner surely is one of a few rare masterpieces that no movie can emulate.Great performances from Harrison Ford(Deckard) & Rutger Hauer(Roy Batty).Hauer speech in the end is very provocative.Though plot is a bit dangling but this is what sci-fi movies are all about.Great cinematography & terrific cinema experience.Blade Runner,why people don't make movies like these anymore?Though plot wise it was a bit week.Ending was quite surprising & abrupt.But definitely a one time watch.The soundtrack from Vangelis will make you to see this one again for sure.Definitely in my top 250.It is a feast for the eyes.",9,0,1,15 March 2010
Casino Royale," Bond back to the beginning....
","Casino Royale stands out for me as the best movie i have seen of all James Bond movies.Probably because all other movies were old but still this one had everything.Action,drama,sex,suspense and then the new bond Daniel Craig.I never thought he would be a worthy James Bond.But this movie and his performance has proved me wrong.Great thriller kind of experience.Lot of intriguing fighting scenes.More of a swashbuckling action packed James Bond rather than a gadget helped man.The poker game was sensational.It had everything beauty of Eva Green,wine,showdown with Africans & charm of James Bond.And the chicks.They were exceptional.Eva Green looks stunning & Ivana Milicevic looks pretty hot.The ending is very good.The movie for me never looses tempo.Money & Time rightfully spend for this.A movie worthy of seeing in theater.Bond is back but he has to start again from the beginning but still it is great.",9,0,3,26 March 2010
The Matrix," We surely will remember Wachowski brothers for this.
","Wachowski brothers bring to us a world you can never imagine,a world of human beings living as a program,some FBI agent as virus & a few people trying for their survival in a world known as The Matrix.Enter the Matrix.Such fascinating concept & such thrilling action.Scenes of utter slow motion & fascinating gun fighting just stands out as the best.Visually stunning and mostly would be known for its fast pace as well as some terrific fight scenes.Acting is top notch with the apt casting.Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus leads from the front.Carrie-Anne Moss as trinity is refreshing.Keanu Reeves as Neo was the chosen one & he proved it by doing proper justice to his role.And who can forget Agent Smith,absolutely breathtaking dialog delivery.Stunning cinematography & compelling camera-work just amazes the audience.Just wish it to be released in 3D.That would be just simply amazing.Wachowski brothers brought to us The Matrix Reloaded as well as The Matrix Revolution.They are unique but they wont be remembered like The Matrix.Surely Wachowski brothers have attained epitome through The Matrix.We surely will remember Wachowski Brothers for this,until the end of time.",10,0,1,5 June 2010
Heat," Seems an endless crime saga....
","This movie by Michael Mann will create lot of heat around you & you would just never want to walk away from it.The performances of Robert De Niro & Al Pacino can't get better than this.I have seen a lot of movies of both but their pairing stands at the epitome of performances that i have ever seen.You have both Pacino & De Niro on opposite sides of the setup but still they are both loyal to what they do best.What else can you ask for.A fantastic story setup portraying on the crime saga in America.Cops trying to chase robbers out but robbers too getting the better of the cops.Van Kilmer also gives a terrific performance & so does rest of the cast.Its also technically quite correct & the camera work is sensational.Both Pacino & De Niro,being on different sides of the law are so similar to each other.De Niro is alone due to his principles & Pacino has marriage problems as he is too much dedicated to his work.The ending scene is stupendous & the soundtrack by Moby in the end just makes your day.My three hours were over so quickly i never got to know.This movie should never have ended as we need to see more of Pacino & De Niro together.In the end you just feel like that the movie will continue to prolong in your memories for a long long time to come.Just seems an endless crime saga for me.",10,0,1,22 April 2010
300," A new meaning to fantasy war cinema
","Fabulous film.I again regret seeing a great movie at my home & not at the theater.Leonides(Gerard Butler) & his men have given war a new dimension.Excellent cinematography combined with lot of blood & gory filled scenes.The plot is that brave 300 stood against the whole might of the Persian empire ruled by a dictator named Xerxis.So can the might of the Persian Empire annihilate whole of Greece?Or will they face suffering from the hands of 300?Must watch.For a great cinematic experience.The dialogs in the movie are just too good.Remember the dialog:'This is Sparta'.Yaa Leonides that was Sparta.You were gone long back.But you are born again in our memories through the movie 300.For all Greece,for all Sparta.I recommend watching brave 300.",8,1,2,15 March 2010
The Great Escape," A classic having some great chases & valor of heart
","The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is a story of hope for those few men who were trapped in the German camp.These captured soldiers of war make every attempt to escape but all fail.But eventually as the movie reaches its climax we are able to see that the plan made to escape for 250,only 11 were able to escape from the camp.Over 87 escaped but were recaptured & nearly half were shot dead just to set an example.The star-cast in the movie is very cool.The names like the tunnel king & cooler king just were so good.Steve McQueen led from the front.Rest of the casting is very good.A lot of stars from the past.The tempo of the movie is a bit slow but the later half of the escape is very good.Great chases & surprised captures.And in the end instead of hope they get execution.This one is a classic.We see some great chases & some great valor of heart by the captured prisoners.",9,0,1,13 June 2010
Braveheart," A movie that gives hope & Inspires
","Fantastic movie directed by Mel Gibson.Braveheart is truly a masterpiece.You take the soundtrack,you take the acting,you take the cinematography.Everythings so good.A movie based on freedom,that inspires a lot.Mel Gibson has done a commendable job with his acting prowess.Excellent presence he possesses through out the movie.Patrick McGoohan has done a great job as his counterpart.And Sophie Marceau,she looks so pretty in the movie.Fantastic casting & terrific performances.The plot is that a lone William Wallace,a Scottish warrior stood against a tyrant known as the Longshanks.Based on true story,this is a lovely movie to watch.A movie that inspires & makes you feel for your freedom.Such movie is hard to miss.The dialogs are a masterpiece.So inspiring are some dialogs that always i carry with me.specially the speech given by William to rest of the Scotish: William Wallace:'Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they will never take... OUR FREEDOM!' So inspiring is this quote.And the ending is brilliant.Never i have seen a better ending for a movie.Still the last dialog echo's in my ears. Wallace:'In the Year of our Lord 1314, patriots of Scotland - starving and outnumbered - charged the fields of Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets; they fought like Scotsmen, and won their freedom.'. Wow!!!What impact of the dialogs.Memorable dialogs.This is truly a great movie.A must watch for all cinema lovers.Mel Gibson at its best.A movie that gives hope & inspires.",10,0,6,22 March 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Fabulous editing & breathtaking scripting will make you see this
","Slumdog Millionaire,a relief for the Indian film fraternity.Finally the name of India,our motherland has been given some fame in the International Cinema.Being a critic i feel this movie was good but Oscar worthy was a bit of a dilemma for me.On personal front i don't think but on a patriotic front i wanted it to win.Though no doubt,this movie is a success because of its fabulous editing to go along with breathtaking scripting.This truly was surprising.The script is fantastically written to go along with a memorable soundtrack from Rehman.Good acting specially from Irfan Khan & Anil Kapoor makes this a must see.Great characterization.The suspense of how Jamal(Dev Patel) gets to know all the answers of 'Who wants to be a millionaire' will keep you well seated in your chairs.Well directed by Danny Boyle the movie has many kids who have given a terrific performance.The role of those little one's cannot be denied for the success of this film.Though how it won the Oscar i am still not sure,but still i am very much happy.Fabulous editing & breathtaking scripting will surely make you see this one.....",9,0,2,23 March 2010
Gladiator," Gladiators... I salute you.
",Gladiator!!!Inspiring & true to its word action & gory filled.Top notch performance from Russell Crowe.His dialog delivery & facial expressions were just too good.Joaquin Pheonix plays a pretty classy role as Commodus.He was just too good.This movie deserved an Oscar rightfully.Ridlet Scott is a master at story telling & he has prove this in gladiator.The little performances by Djimon Hounsou(Juba) & Oliver Reed(Proximo) are applaudable.The casting is perfectly appropriate.Movie quotes in this movie at its par.You wont forget them for a long time to come.some memorable quotes always follow me wherever i go: Juba-'I will see you again... but not yet... not yet...' & who can forgot Proximo-' And when you die - and die you shall - your transition will be to the sound of... Gladiators... I salute you.And truly to Ridley Scott & his gladiator.We salute you.Must watch!!!recommended.,10,2,3,4 March 2010
Donnie Darko," Totally over-hyped,how can it be in the top 250?
","Red was my face when i saw this movie for the first & the last time.Not at all a good movie.Whats the point of this movie.We all have dreams,everyone dreams.So what?can everything happen in a dream.I don't know man,from sci-fi point of view this is decent but from a plot wise & the perfect ending types this is not up-to the level.Jake Gyllenhaal(Donnie) performs a decent role.But i guess his role in Brokeback Mountain was his best.And then whats that demon rabbit?Why does Jake has to listen to him?I don't know.this is a total crap movie.For the critics this is a major let down,also for me when i see guys giving it 10/10.This isn't worth it.The ending is too way abrupt.The middle portion of the movie is too weak with dangling story thoughts.I cannot recommend this to anyone.You can watch it once but i am sure you wont want to see it again.Totally over-hyped.Major let down.",2,2,5,14 March 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Truly Inspiring.
","Brilliant was the word i said after watching this film.It has inspired me in many ways.Every time you are down & out,you just gonna hold on cause something good is gonna happen.Will Smith(Chris Gardner).Fantastic.I saw I-robot as his previous movie.This guy proves he is a great singer & now a great actor.Such commitment & such blend of emotions.I never thought Will could perform like this.But i was wrong.Oscar Worthy.I Think way better that Forrest Whitakers role in The Last King of Scotland.But hard luck Will. The kid Jaden Smith(Christopher) also gives a terrific performance.Probably when he will grow up & see this film again.He would know how well he has acted.This movie is very much inspiring specially if you were poor at some stage or your family life was totally ruined.I am always fascinated by the father-son camaraderie.I have seen many films like Road to Perdition & The Road.But this one is the best.Every father & son should go together to see this movie.Editing is fantastic & also the dialogs specially the conversation between Chris & his son.Truly breath-taking & Oscar material.Hats off to Will Smith.",10,1,1,5 March 2010
Goodfellas," As far back as i remember,I have always wanted to be a gangster.
","Scorsese brings to us another of his masterpieces.After the score of Raging Bull he brings a gangster flick to us that just tears us apart.Best since the time of the Godfather.Or i can say you can compare it even to the Godfather.This is tied for me as the best film of Gangster era i have seen with the Godfather Part 2.The casting is perfect.Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta are all superb.Lorraine Bracco is sensational.Paul Sorvino reminds us of the dons used to be in that of the Godfather.The story never looses tempo.Audience tries to predict the ending but then is just not able to predict the end.The narration of Liotta is fabulous.Gripping narration & perfect crime gangster flick.Scorsese should have got the Oscar for this one.The entry of the drugs & narcotics later on just adds so much more to the film.Based on a true story its a terrific adaptation with pretty cool dialogs like 100% Italian stuff.Henry Hill said as far back as he remembered,he always wanted to be a gangster.But surely for the acting of Joe Pesci,for the presence of De Niro,for the narration of Ray Loitta,for the brilliance of Scorsese,as far as i remember,i ain't gonna forget this one for a long time to come.",10,1,2,14 June 2010
Atonement," Lacking emotionally
","Such talented actors(James McAvoy & Keira Knightley) but what a waste of time this movie is.Never ever you get a romantic feeling nor you get a kind of drama.This was more of an overacting drama.Just one lie separated true from false.That changed few lives.No this is just so weak kind of love story.And in the movie you never feel any romanticism.Totally lacking in emotion as well as a weak plot.This is a strange movie & i don't get it how people are saying its the best they have seen.Surely this is not the best.Atonement lacks terribly in emotions and i am sure many would see this once,but you wont want to waste your time to watch it again.I cant give good reviews for this one.Neither it is gripping,nor a kind of good storytelling.This is,i feel very much boring.Don't repent later,after seeing this.",2,4,8,23 March 2010
V for Vendetta," Who is V ?
","Crazy movie i said when i saw it first.I was not able to get the crux of this.But after seeing this the second time this movie is surely unique & tremendous achievement in its own.A great film all in all.Consider the star-cast or be the cinematography. Terrific performance from Natalie Portman & Hugo Weaving as V.Stephen Rea role of Inspector Finch is appreciative.And who can forget John Hurt from The Elephant Man,but this too is by far the greatest performance from him.The plot is based on a terrorist who calls himself V,sets out to take revenge against the government.And in Natalie Portman(Evey) he finds an accomplice & one he is deeply attached to.Will Finch be able to uncover who is V??Will Evey support V??Will the corrupt government fall?? A great thriller in all.Will keep you on your toes guessing.But in the middle slightly it loses some pace.Thats the only fault i could find in this movie.But definitely one time watch.A great movie on terrorism.After this movie you will surely say,who is V?V my friends means Vendetta.See for your own sake.V for Vendetta.It is indeed......a class in the making.",8,2,9,14 March 2010
