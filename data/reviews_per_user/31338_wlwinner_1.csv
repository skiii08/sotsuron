The New World," Terrible movie
","This may have been one of Malick's best films, but the movie itself was one of the slowest movies I've watched in a long time. Reminded me of trying to get through 2001: A Space Odyssey. While the cinematography was beautiful, the script must have only been 30 pages long. Also curious was the fact that Pocahontas' name was never uttered, nor was her husband's name. There were a few action scenes with some fairly interesting fighting, but the scenes themselves had slow classical music set to them as if to say...these were beautiful fights full of harmony and balance. There was too much focus on cinematography. As the movie was drawing to an end...I kept thinking...'just end it!' And they did just end it, abruptly by, not rolling the credits, but just throwing up the first set of names filling the screen with no real music. It just died...as it should have.",1,4,14,23 January 2006
