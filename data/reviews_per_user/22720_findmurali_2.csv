Captain Phillips," Get a first hand experience of getting kidnapped!!!
","That is what Paul and Tom give you. Not just a movie, but an experience. As it should be, the film doesn't waste time and takes one straight into the life of Capt. Rich Philips, who is a little fed-up of all the travelling and sailing. Throughout the movie we are getting a close view of Rich and his experiences.When he has doubts and concerns so do we. When he is helpless and afraid, we feel it. When blood splatters on him we want to wipe our face and when he is in shock and relieved we have confused emotions too. Barry does a great job of capturing the seas and the mighty ships. But the claustrophobic shots of the life-boat in the darkness is the highlight. The screenplay keeps even the easily distracted audience, engaged. It might seem a little stretched in the second half, but that is the reality of the situation. One cant pull out such a film without an actor like Tom Hanks. In-fact after watching the movie I couldn't think of any other actor who could have been cast. He does another Oscar worthy performance by expressing subtle emotions with such class that we forget that we are watching the actor. And the there is the climax scene in which there's an outburst of varied emotions and it shows why Tom is a great actor.Watch it for Tom, watch it for Paul, watch it to get some reality into the modern piracy and the lives of a ship crew. Watch it if you will appreciate a great movie-experience.",8,2,5,20 October 2013
Rang De Basanti," Clearly an awakening movie
","An excellent script can always take a movie to places-RDB is a clear example.The actors have done just a decent job(Alice Patten esp, not to be forgotten)But it's the script and direction with an excellent music(A.R.Rahman) which suits the scenes and the mood very well,that clearly awakens the audiences. The general mood of the Indian people esp, the youth has been exploited well.It answers all the doubts and criticisms that have lingered in the people's minds through Sidharth's character,Karan. The highlight in my view is the well planned and executed mixing of the current situations and those during the times of our freedom fighters.The sequences will always be remembered for their point that the problems in the country are similar to those during the freedom fight period. It is really a surprise that this movie didn't trigger an uprising....,or maybe, who knows the change is happening right NOW. Not to be missed by any Indian esp,the youth.",9,0,2,17 December 2007
