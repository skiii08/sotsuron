Black Swan," Classical music versus classic psychoanalytic theory
","Sometimes the conception of art can be everything. Every artist approaches the subject in a unique way, and there is never a right or wrong option. Some alternatives, however, can lead to self-destructive behaviors (consequently, the image of the tormented artist has been tremendously popular in the past).Darren Aranofsky's latest film deals with art and the delicate balance between Eros and Thanatos. As Sigmund Freud wrote in some of his books, the vital drive and the death drive are forces that coexist in each one of us. Nina, the protagonist, though, finds out that sometimes it's nearly impossible to regain a sense of selfness after such different and opposite forces menace to pull her apart.Nina has a deep devotion for ballet. Her whole emotional stability seems to depend on being selected for the main role for the upcoming ballet production. She is a superb ballerina but her director constantly criticizes her for being too rigid, too cold, too passionless. What lies underneath her unruffled expression? What's beneath all that control and perfection of movement? Only neurosis, I'd dare to claim.If life and death are the most relevant aspects as some philosophers might affirm, then one could easily find a connection between sexual impulses and the vital drive. But what would occur when the pulse of nature is denied? What happens when sexual activity is not only disregarded but put off altogether? Freud did a thorough analysis of his time and he reached one daunting conclusion, which was quite polemic back then: sexual repression always leads to neurosis.Nina's director can easily spot the uptightness of the future star. She is not only tense, she is afraid of her own body, of her own sexuality. Perhaps one could identify Nina's mother as the source of all evils. It has been said before that it's so easy to blame everything on the parents that one should look for other possibilities. This case, however, proves that parental influence can be most detrimental. With a mother that watches over her daughter constantly, controlling her and treating her like a child, it's only foreseeable to understand how this will affect Nina.When Nina's mother undresses her or sleeps in the same bedroom, the viewer may be shocked at the lack of privacy, but perhaps what is more shocking is the passive response of the protagonist. It should be understandable, then, to see those repressed feelings surmounting the mental barriers she has put into place; in fact, after certain events Nina will even fantasize about the possibility of engaging in a lesbian affair of most physical nature.There is much suspense throughout the film, and the constant supernatural visions of intrusions of the ominous can take us back, again, to the Freudian unheimlich: quotidian activities or mundane locations are infused with something that might be real but at the same time defies possibility, thus instilling apprehension and anxiety in people. Nina will experience something similar, but in a much more frightful manner. The very first scene sets the tone for these dark and ominous moments.Art is creation, but it can also be destruction. At moments it would look as if Nina won't be able to resist the pressure, and the constant visions she seems to have might be seen as proof of her weak psychological condition. She could crumble at any moment as things heat up. Surrounded by envious ballerinas, sieged by her director, betrayed by the only girl she could call friend, Nina will soon find out that true artistic creation requires absolute passion and commitment to survive the experience. And thus, finally, the viewers come to realize what is the ultimate conception of art in Nina's mind.",Null,3,6,3 February 2011
Lost in Translation," Lack of Communication & Simulacrum
","A woman, Scarlett Johansson, is in a five star hotel, beholding Tokyo's skyline. A man, Bill Murray, looks through a car's window, curious perhaps, but above all estranged. Combining a deeply poignant music with suggestive images, the director creates a world, a filmic universe that captures our attention immediately. What Sofia Coppola does in the opening frames is what many filmmakers struggle to achieve in their entire careers.Throughout the film there is always a feeling of longing for a different tomorrow, and loneliness as the confirmation that the one constant in human condition is discontent. Lack of communication can be seen in the title but it's also an indicator of all that we can't put into language.Perhaps in the best role of his career, Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed-out actor that used to be a super star and now has to endorse a Japanese whisky. He feels like an alien in Tokyo. But he's also a specular image of the Japanese people's own alienated condition. Westernized to the extreme, the Japanese have lost their essence, they are the living example of how further can people go in order to disallow themselves.Giovanni Ribisi's character, a professional photographer also ponders on it: Japanese rock and roll groups that have no substance and exist only thanks to the decoration, the false reality that photography and the right publicity stunt can imprint on them. The photographer is there to sustain the alienation process, even if he disagrees with the falseness of it all.In the same way, Bob Harris has to synthetize in a TV commercial what the Japanese consider the core of Western elegance and sophistication. He is asked to be Roger Moore, Frank Sinatra, he is asked to perform not as the white man he is but as the white man they need him to be. Of course, there can be no words or guidelines for such a taxing acting job. And that's why also it's impossible for the interpreters to translate the instructions given to him. Not only are words lost in translation, but also there is an unnamed need, a 'real' that threatens to irrupt into reality, and as Lacan explains in his psychoanalytic theory, the real exceeds the language, the real can never exist within the boundaries of the symbolic, id est, language.Bob Harris is an exhausted man that finds alcohol soothing, although just barely. After 25 years of marriage he is unhappy. Between him and his wife no real communication exists. What takes place, however, is a very insistent simulacrum, much in the same way that everything takes place in Japan. Philosopher Alan Badiou's talks about the importance of the simulacrum in postmodern society; if Sofia Coppola's film is more revealing and enthralling than anything else out there is precisely because it embraces contemporaneity to the maximum; this isn't a film about explanations, about outcomes, which would be a modernist approach; this is a postmodern film in the way that it sates our hunger for art, for beauty and for intellectual value while establishing what Derrida proposed in his deconstruction theory: knowledge can never be complete. When Bob's wife sends him a fax, or Fed-Exes carpet samples, or calls him, it's all a simulacrum. They are never able to connect with each other, not even at the most basic of levels.In the same manner, Charlotte, extraordinarily interpreted by Scarlett Johansson seems to be drifting away. She's married to a successful photographer but she can't figure out what to do with her time. There is no meaning for life, and that thought depresses her and fills her heart with anguish. She tries to get into self-help audiobooks to feel better, to no avail. The entire boom of auto-help material is also an example of Badiou's simulacrum; thousands if not millions of these books are written each year, and yet they are all useless. Life cannot be summarized, standardized and explained so that you can feel better. But despair takes the best of us all, and thus self-help becomes the one and only thing that sells out nowadays.When Charlotte and Bob meet in the hotel's bar, they recognize in the other the same existential doubts, the same sensibilities, and they feel connected. They are the only characters able to actually communicate with each other. Their bond is intensified when contrasted with the world around them, for example, with Charlotte's Japanese friends who are so absolutely alienated and have tried so hard to look and act like Americans that end up as ridiculous and pathetic creatures. Tokyo is a city that denies its past, its traditions, so much that it's simply brutal to see how its inhabitants behave.However, there is still some true beauty left (beauty as it would be understood in the Genji Monogatari and other traditional Japanese works of art), and Coppola gives us a glimpse of it, in a couple of moments. Nevertheless, this beauty, this true spirit, is constantly covered by the appalling reality that surrounds the protagonists. When Bob Harris receives the visit of a woman wearing sexy stockings, we are privy to yet another example of westernized acculturation and fantasies, although here the fantasy instead of covering the horror of the real merely exacerbates the void, the structural fissures of Japan's society.Sofia Coppola's masterwork resonates deeply inside of us because it's one of the most refined and superb portrayals of the human condition in cinema's history. The final scene, of course, proves once again that there is no such thing as a happy ending, and precisely because of that it reminds us that life is just like that, unpredictable, full of suffering but also possibilities of change and, of course, free will. Lost in Translation makes it into my personal top twenty without a second thought.",Null,0,1,27 August 2011
