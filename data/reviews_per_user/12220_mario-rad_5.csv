Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MUCH MORE THAN THIS
","I know that someone would say that expectations for the new Star Wars trilogy were too high, but when You think about it, it just had to be high (the expectations were also very high for The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Peter Jackson sure did live to it). I mean, Lucas was pointing that he waited almost 20 years to film another chapter because he needed visuals not possible in those days. Why is then that after watching The Phantom Menace I had the feeling that this one is so much beneath the previous trilogy (including the effects). Don´t get me wrong, CGI done here are correct, but that´s mostly it - correct. That´s just not good enough for the Star Wars. Previous movies with five times lower budget took us to the most beautiful, imaginary, challenging and powerful places. The Phantom Menace did no such thing. Now let´s come to the story. I think that it´s a big lie that Lucas wrote all six chapters at once. It just can´t be true, ´cause quality´s fall is more than obvious. Mr.Lucas is, let´s face it, not any more full of flashy imagination that we loved so much. I mean, The Phantom Menace isn´t a bad film at all. It has a very unique moments and a story that holds on it´s own, but that´s it. I hope that, in some way, I was wrong and that time will show me the real importance of The Phantom Menace. I really do.",7,0,1,22 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," another zero shot
","After a bit of dissapointment after The Phantom Menace, I still had some hopes in me that this one will finally live to it´s right. But again...no, it did not. Ok, now we see why did Lucas said that he waited so long for the effects to improve. When it comes to visuals this probably is one of the best in saga. But when it comes to story and what Star Wars are really about, then it´s no better than chapter I, maybe in some ways even worse. But still, there are a few points that I liked. Since the new trilogy is more about silly politics than anything else, I really liked how he treats Palpatine. I could see his rise from the strange character in shadows to the Great Emperor in the old trilogy. We all knew that in Attack of the Clones we are going to witness the start of an Anakin-Amidala romance, but what we got here is dreadful. Dialogues and the whole love story can only be compared to the lines of Dawson´s Creek or some soapish nonsense like that. And the philosophical lines are now laughibly pretentious and meaningless. Again, very similar to chapter one, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch and it has some of the most spectacular scenes ever to be seen in science-fiction cinema. But for a Star Wars fan it´s not even close to enough. Sometimes I think that Lucas shouldn´t go further at all from the original trilogy.",6,0,0,22 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," NO MORE WAITING. IT´S HERE!!!
","Let´s face it. This is something that a lot of us waited our whole life to finally see on a big screen. Jackson carried a real heavy burden of bringing Tolkien´s magnificent world to life. And, by God, he did. I mean, there are a few minor mistakes here, like: Liv Tyler should not, by all means, be with Frodo and the Nazguls in the river scene. She completely ruined the importance and the symbolism of gathering that took place there (it is what the whole movie is about: inner conflict of dualised forces). Sometimes it seems that Ralph Bakshi with his animated The Lord of the Rings understood better the abstract, mythological and philosophical aspects of the book. But, at the end, it doesn´t matter, ´cause Jackson blinded us more than effectively, with his brave and powerful vision. We can even forgive him Aragorn-Arwen romance plot. What else to say than: congratulations mr. Jackson! You brought us the most beautiful and the strongest imagination ever to be seen. By far, the best fantasy (and much more) in the history of moving pictures. You just can´t beat this one.",10,2,2,21 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," SAGA CONTINUES...........
","Nothing but praise for mr. Jackson. I think it was even more difficult to film The Two Towers than it was to film The Fellowship of the Ring, ´cause now there is no more pacing and building to be done. We are there. In the book, all the important stuff you could find in the narrative process. But this is not the book and Jackson isn´t Tolkien. But obviously he´s a great director. ´cause what he did here is marvelous and deserves only full respect and admiration. He transformed me into this beautiful dream and by the end, I could hardly believe that 3 hours have already passed. I read the book more than five times and I never suspected that there will be a superb movie adaptation of Tolkien´s magic. But there is and it´s called Peter Jackson´s THE LORD OF THE RINGS. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,21 January 2003
Ran," THE BEST ADAPTATION OF SHAKESPEARE´S 'KING LEAR'
","What can I say? It´s a movie I´ve seen dozen times and it´s still exciting and glorious as it was the first time. This is Kurosawa at his best, and as far as I know the best and most original adaptation of Shakespeare´s 'King Lear' I have ever seen. Superb acting, marvelous directing, brilliant screenplay, make this one into magnificent 3 hours ride. 'Ran' is simply a work of genius and as important as 'Seven Samurai'.",10,0,2,20 March 2003
