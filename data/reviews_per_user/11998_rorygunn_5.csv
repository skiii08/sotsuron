Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Should've been the beginning of the Clone Wars.
","First I'd like to say that I liked Episode 1 well enough.Jar Jar didn't bother as much as it did others...I suspect that despite what he says,Jar Jar was a test so that Lucas could try out a new toy when he replaces his actors with CGI in his future films...Apparently those are the only ones he can direct...Ep. 1 is a visual feast but is rightfully lacking in story...I know this is the set up for the next three but you could've still had a good compelling story...The problem lies in several factors.1-This should've been the start of the Clone Wars or at least the Clone Wars should've been happening...2-Anakin should've been played by Hayden Christensen from the start..and he should've been a cross between Han and Luke..Then that would've explained his arrogance and a lot of other traits that would become evident in Episode 2&3...Instead we got the little boy who is supposed to have this crush on this older woman....Doesn't work....and it doesn't create the heat needed for these two to get together as you know they will...The third thing is that the Qui-Gon character is unecessary...Obi-wan should've been the one to discover Anakin...He should've been just promoted to Knight status and a bit full of himself too...Then the remorse he feels in Return Of The Jedi would've been more poignant....The villians aren't anything to be feared....Without an enemy that is rightfully identified as the villian you don't know what's going on?That's what made 4-6 classics...The Empire was the enemy....But here there is no enemy and Lucas isn't good at trying to fool you with suspense over who are the good guys and who are bad and he can't cut it in trying to create the'Menace' in the title....There are some good points...The lightsaber battle is fantastic...But overall it too much of a technical thing...There are continuity issues....And let's face it...Lucas is in love with his toys....",Null,0,1,20 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the effects were good
","When I worked at a video store,this was the line I would give when people asked about The Day After Tomorrow which was the new DVD release at the time.The rule of thumb was that we had to say something positive about a release no matter how bad it might be and that's the line I'm going to use here..The effects are good and some of the action sequence are also good but go by too fast and overload the senses in that you can't enjoy them...Same with the lightsaber battles...Some people say this is on par with Empire...Nowhere near it...The duel in Empire was like two predators stalking one another..The ones here feel like a speed race...As for story..What story??This movie feels incomplete in it's story and looks like the editing wasn't complete...Some scenes in fact feel incomplete unless you've read the novelization...And despite what all the Lucas yes-men say..it does not answer every question and I got no sense of wonder or excitement from the last few scenes at the end and the Vader appearance was over hyped...As for the acting....Ian McDirmid does the best job followed by Ewan McGregor...Dopn't get me started on the other two...They didn't have any chemistry in Ep. 2 and they don't here...One would think that by working with Ian McDirmid,Hayden Christiansen would be inspired to step it up a notch but doesn't...As for all this talk about the comparisons with Gearge Bush,as a conservative republican I don't see it mainly because that would require some level of intelligent writing and that isn't present...But the effects were good",4,5,9,21 May 2005
Wonder Woman," No threat to Lynda Carter's legacy as Wonder Woman
",Just finished watching Wonder Woman the movie and all i can say is this...Lynda Carter's legacy as the personification of Wonder Woman is still intact and is in no danger whatsoever...this had so much potential but instead was flushed down the toilet...it's hard to believe they couldn't have come up with a better story than this..if you want to see Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor working together done the right way watch the episode of The Justice League cartoon called The Savage Time...which is what this movie should've been..,4,2,7,21 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Where's the Biggs footage??
","When I heard that Lucas was releasing a special edition of Star Wars in 1997 with footage that was taken out to be put back I was excited..Finally the missing Biggs scenes that I had heard about but only knew from the original storybook and comics that I had bought during the original release was going to be shown...Imagine my disappointment when once again I was robbed...Instead I got a lame Jabba the Hutt sequence that is a dialogue repeat of the equally lame new cantina sequence....This is why I never fretted over the lost Jabba sequence...Everything I needed to know was explained in the much better original cantina sequence...Why Han needed the money and so on...But the Biggs footage explains a whole character including Luke's and gives part of the reason why he's so frustrated about his life...Unless you had known like I did before hand,when Luke mentions Biggs and Tank you ask yourself who are these guys that he's talking about and what is Tosche Station?All that would have been explained in the Biggs footage...If Lucas wasn't going to put those back in then he should've cut those lines referring to them out...Even the restored hangar scene leaves you wondering who Biggs is and what his relation to Luke is....Bottom line-If the Biggs footage had been restored it would have put the special in the special editions and would have given the fans a chance to see what they'd been missing but as Lucas has said in interviews pleasing the fans is not his priority..In some cases this is true but not in this case...Not when the unseen footage would've provided new insight and development to a character...But then character and story development were never Lucas' strong points...No,the special edition was a chance for Lucas to test run his new toys...Toys which he apparently now totally fallen in love with....",Null,1,1,17 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Why did this film need a special edition??
","Ask yourself this:Why did an already excellent film need a special re-tooled edition?Other than some minor effects touch-up(i.e erasing the black lines from the models)this film is virtually flawless...The effects advance instead detract from the story which is superior to the rest...The dialogue mercifully not written by Lucas is funny and insightful...So why the re-edits.The only reason I can think of is once again so Lucas can try out his new toys...Some of the re-edits are unecessary...The scenes with the Wampa are an example..If Lucas wanted to show the Wampa then it could've been edited right...Instead we get shots of the wampa eating then getting up.Then we see the wampa writhing in pain with one arm.Are we to believe that this is the same Wampa that attacked and captured Luke???Based on how it was shot and edited,it looked like there were two in the cave to me.Another unnecessary edit is shots of Vader's shuttle going back to the Star destroyer...Lucas said he did this because you wondered how Vader got there when you watch the film.I never did...If you pay attention to the film,Vader tells his troopers to bring his shuttle...Case solved...The extended scenes with Slave 1 and the Falcon I can understand but the shuttles scenes are done in what is essentially a fast paced car chase..Lucas cut the Biggs scenes because they interrupted the flow of the opening of New Hope but yet he had no problem putting in Jedi outtakes that are slow and lumbering into a fast paced scene....And did we need to hear Luke scream a recycled scream from one of the other films??....No,I don't think so...Nor do I care about Cloud City being opened up..It was fine as is....Overall,Empire was and still continues to be the flawless cream of the crop of the Star Wars sextet...There was no need for a special edition....",Null,1,1,17 April 2003
