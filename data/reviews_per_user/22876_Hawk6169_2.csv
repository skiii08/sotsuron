Resident Evil: Afterlife," not impressed anymore....
","i liked resident evil at the beginning, but now with this one, they got way out of the material in the other movies. in the other movies, to kill a zombie you had to shoot them in the head. now in this movie there killing zombies by shooting them in the body. they have also added content from the following movies it looks like.: the matrix and silent hill.... from the matrix they took the moves, where there's one guy in the movie that moves so fast that he can dodge bullets....just like in the matrix. and from silent hill, they took this big monster (in silent hill he had a huge sword) and they replaced his sword with a huge hammer/axe combo weapon. so basically what I'm saying is if they would have stayed with the type of content they put into the other resident evils, it would have been better. they changed it too much by trying to mix content from 2 other movies. and they ended this movie with the possibility of another one. oh great, that's all we need. final score of this movie is a 4 to 5 out of 10. also this is how i scored the other resident evil movies: Resident Evil (2002) 9/10 ..... Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) 8/10 ....... Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) 9/10 ........ resident evil Degeneration (2008) (also known as Biohazard: Degeneration) 6/10 ....... now this movie: Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) 4 to 5/10",Null,1,2,28 December 2010
Black Hawk Down," great movie
","this movie is great. its sad how so many lives were lost that day. 19 Americans died and 1000's of Somalians died as well. in my opinion, the 2 helicopters that went down and killed many people in them, could have been avoided if they weren't so close to the ground. i think the only choppers that should be that close to the gun fire are the small birds, because its less of a target to hit. this movie had great graphics and sound, and wonderful acting. it has a great cast. Josh Hartnett plays as eversmann and i think that was the best actor to choose for that role. he's great at acting in his movies. he plays a very good leader of his chalk, and the men respect him. Sam Shepard plays as general Garrison and does great.",Null,1,2,4 April 2009
