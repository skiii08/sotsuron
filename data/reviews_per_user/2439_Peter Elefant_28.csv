The Blair Witch Project," The first rule of a horrorfilm:
","NEVER discuss it afterwards! 'Pet Sematary' scared me. It wouldn't scare you. 'The Blair Witch Project' didn't scare me at first, and it probably didn't scare you at all. I remember walking out the cinema thinking: 'Wonder what it's like to die in the woods like that.' (I hope THAT's not a spoiler, folks!) And then slowly it turned on me, the way that silence in itself can suddenly become alarming. Like that single 'Hello' down a dark hall. Yes, I got scared. Yes, I got afraid of the dark for like 14 days or so. Yes, I'm 22 years old. It might be the whole documentary-style of the thing. It might be the acting and the 'Dogma'-style. It might be something else. Ask yourself, before calling me a chicken: Do you know what scares you? Do you? Really?Until then it's a 9 for the concept and execution. (Not seen since the Orson Wells' Halloween prank) And because I really found it eerie.",9,1,2,3 June 2001
Se7en," ...
","If I had the meer words to describe, I'd be the greatest writer on earth...This is one of those films that you won't get the first time. You wont understand the evil. The desperation. The philosophy. You'll think it a 5 or 6. But still you'll have this voice in your head telling you to watch it again. And again. Just like that song you can't stop hearing, although you know you hate it. And then it hits you. The ingenious. The brilliant acting from Freeman and Peltrow, to Pitt and Spacey. It's like a whole universe unfolding in front of you. The noir-style. The edgy dialog. The characters, that are all in some sort of pain. The profound understanding, that nothing is going to be alright. Ever.Fincher, your brilliance is divine.As if my 10 would ever mean anything....",10,1,2,21 April 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Singing, dancing, joking! Fun for the whole family!
","What is it this time? 399 'naughty' words, not counting those spoken, of the ever mumbling Kenny? This film has such excess that it goes to the place where it's corny - beyond - and out on the other side, where it's SO ridicolous, it becomes funny once again. It's an important film as well I think. It's good to know, that a film THAT offensive (In every and any way possible), can still go to a worldwide audience.The songs are silly, the animation horrible, and the jokes are so far out, that if Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone can't push you in some way, noone on this planet ever will! It's more than great. It's South Park! And don't think for one second, that it's just a long episode. This is much, much more.Leave your sence of self-importance, and your 'sacred cows' in the swing door in, and I guarantee you, you'll be laughing on the way out.I'll give this one a 9, as I really missed Mr. Hankey - The Christmas Pooh.",9,0,0,3 June 2001
Insomnia," Not a bad effort (SPOILERS)
","I enjoyed Insomnia, because it is a story that is all too ordinary, and then again not. Begins pretty obvious. Two hot shot detectives arrive in small town, trying to solve a murder. One very smart, one very slick.The murder victim is a 17-year old girl. She's been beaten to death, and then, afterwards, washed and cleansed. It seems to be first victim of a serial-killer.Luckily they are pretty clever, these detectives, so they lure the murderer into a ingenious trap, which fails, sadly.But this is where the story takes a turn. One of the detectives (played by Al Pacino) is a little too clever. He's a bad good-guy, which has been a little too clever with the evidence in his early career, and the thing is, that his partner knows about it. And to make things even worse Internal Affairs are hot on his trail, and his partner is pretty sure that he's going to tell everything in order to save his own neck.It's very foggy were the trap is set, and in all of the confusion (And all of the fog), Al Pacino shoots his partner. Maybe intentional. Maybe not.Fact of the matter is, that when he is to give testimony, he tells a(nother) little white lie about how the shooting went down. No reason not to blame the murderer, right? He's a murderer anyway, you see.But the night after, Al Pacinos character can't sleep. He's suffering from insomnia, constantly rethinking the events that led to his partners death.That's when the murderer (Robin William) calls him. Seems the two of them have something in common now. None of them can sleep, and they both seem to have 'accidently' killed someone.The rest I will leave for you to enjoy as I did. You will see a thriller that could be pretty ordinary, but is saved by a good director, being the magnificent Christopher Nolan. Nolan understands to show - not overdo - subjective storytelling, where we are to understand why it's not a great thing not to sleep for 6 days or so.Al Pacino. Well. He's good old Al. A great character-actor, which I find interesting to watch.Robin Williams acting in this one I am very conflicted about. I didn't find him very scary. He seems a pathetic character, in the way you think of William H. Macys character in Fargo. But then again, maybe that's the whole point? Portraying a man which seems to be 'Just a smart man that made a mistake'. If so, he hasn't enough screentime. Be it Robin Williams performance, or be it lack of twists in the story, I found the ending quite anticlimactic and kinda ordinary. That is why you should view this film as entertaining, not as film-study.
As entertainment it's pretty good, though. 8.",8,0,0,19 November 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Naah!
","Good start about the soldier training, weak ending in Vietnam, Full Metal Jacket never raises itself over other war movies. It's cold, distant, cynical look at war, seen through the eyes of... cold, distant cynical Private Joker, sadly makes it uninteresting to watch the war part. It seems a random act (!) of dying soldiers and quickfired rounds. But by then you've lost interest already. Well I had at least.6 out of 10, where five is average.",6,0,3,24 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," In the clash of the titans---
","Peter Jackson is running with two points, leaving Chris Columbus with 1, and George Lucas with zero.Let me not praise this film too much, but just reassure you, that this is a good film. If you don't like the action, you'll love the scenery. If nothing of that does it for ya, you've gotta admire the acting. The only thing that I found just a tad boring was the soundtrack-part, but that's me. AND LET ME SAY THIS!!!! People, who gave this film 1, have shown themselves not only to be film-analfabeticals, but also the soul reason, why a democracy will never truly work. 10/10",9,0,0,27 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Final chapter
","Spoilers ahead. Yes, I am that kind of guy.The Matrix revolutions picks up immediately after The Matrix Reloaded. Neo is caught in a world between the matrix and the real. A trainstation largely run by the Merovingian. After some... persuation by the lovely Trinity (Well until she pulls a gun to your temple), Neo is set free, and our heros now home to defend Zion, a city under threat of annihalation by the machines.Neo, getting advise from the, now changed oracle (due to the tragic death of actress Gloria Foster) ... (Morten you twit, when is a death NOT tragic!?), sets out for the Machine city with Trinity (and that's one heck of a city, if you don't mind my saying so folks!!), and Morpheus, captain Niobe our videogame friend Ghost, and others set home, to defend the city.Meanwhile Agent (or should I say former agent?) Smith is taking over the Matrix, assimilating everyone (and -thing) in his way. (A true yet extreme communist).And then the battle begins. Everything that has a beginning has an end.I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand I feel that the Wachowski Brothers have done right in this trilogy. Rules apply and they are following them to perfection. A trilogy must expand. Number one has the advantage of surprisal. Number two is must be bigger, faster, harder, still expanding the universe (Something forgotten in most trilogies. Like Jurassic Park, who cares if there's a bigger lizard?) Number three is the hardest, because you are concluding the story. Sacrifices have been made, and it is time to show what they have been made for.The Matrix was the most surprising, and therefor the best. It dealt with discovering what is real and not, and accepting this.The Matrix Reloaded was an expansion of the universe, and the ideas within the story are drawn out. This movie concerns itself with the next logical step. You have found out who and what you are. Now you must make choices.The Matrix Revolutions deals with love and death. The choices have been made, it is time to find out what you are fighting for, and carry out what you must do.The trouble with The Matrix Revolutions is that too many loose ends remain when you have watched the film. You are disorientated, thinking: Who was Neo? Who was agent Smith? Who was who? Who am I? (This you don't really think, I just made that question up).The brothers leave behind too many questions, and too many loose ends. They fall back on too many 'old tricks of the industry', thus making the story of some of the characters predictable. There are some scenes in the film, that are just there for no reason.The Merovingian is threatened by Trinity to hand over Neo. This happens with a gun to his temple. Trinity shows that she really loves Neo, which is fine. Just... we already knew that, now didn't we? So why do we have to watch Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph fight themselves all her way there?The ending just becomes too gritty. What I always hated about StarTrek is that they always seemed to get saved in the last minute, by some technical gimmimanot, and using fancy words they explained themselves out of everything. This exact problem is what Revolutions suffers from. It get's TOO fantastic and TOO amazing, thus losing the audience completely. By the end fight, between Mr. Anderson and agent (or is that... former agent?) (Shut up, Morten you're repeating yourself) Smith, you know that something fantastic is going to happen. You just haven't a clue who is who and why.On the other hand the effects are gorgeous. The Wachowski Brothers delivers what they promished, when they said they would do something new every time. Trust me. They did. The battle of Zion is one that I personally think makes the dreadfully boring Battle of Helms Deep look like a Jerry Springer stage fight (or whatever - I just liked this battle better, ok?!!)They keep the philosophy in the mix between sophisticated and simple, so everyone can follow, and they stay as much away from the Matrix as they can. Everything can now be done in the Matrix, as long as Neo is doing it, so why watch, right? Right.I think the ending to The MATRIX trilogy is decent. Some storypoints pull it down, while every single effect raises it to a level, where other films just seem to never get. My judgment is 8/10. Everything that has a beginning has an end... and you've never seen an ending like this.",8,0,0,5 November 2003

Pitch Black," Yeah it's just another one of those...
","Horrorfilms are all alike these days, aren't they? There are the stranded people, the dark and the monsters? A 'who-get's-it', that's hardly interesting, as the characters are never that fun to watch. As a matter of fact, you're GLAD the monsters eat them, as you think that if you were in a room with them, YOU'd have to kill them.This one is just another one of those, with a few twists. Because what a bunch of evil b******s, you'll see in this movie. And I'm not talking about the monsters! The immoral co-pilot, the cold-blooded killer, the cracked up cop? I mean. It's not really THAT good thinking, but hey! It's new!Futhermore I like the style of the film. The blue, the white, the yellow. That's not bad thinking at all. Great crash-scene also.

Dark City," Psst.. Wanna know where 'The Matrix' came from??
","Then this is just for you. Alex Proyas is a genious, and even though you might not always like his films, you've gotta stand in awe over the moods he can create. This noir-thriller 'Dark City' is no exception. It's one of the first films that introduces that 'What if the world is not really the world'-themes, best known from 'The Matrix', and it does it really, really well. It's edgy, creepy and well told.It's another 9 for Alex P.",8,0,1,29 April 2001
Pearl Harbor," I liked this one, I did.
","ME SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY:There a thing people have to understand. When wanting to recreate the battle of Pearl Harbor, for the reason of entertaining, you need money. A lot of money. And those money are bound to come from  people who have them, yes? These people, who lend you the money are bound to wanting to get their money back, yes? So naturally there'll be A LOT of poll-searches done on a project of this magnitude, before the filming begins, yes?So what do we end up having is a 'Usual' story, with unusual images. Which is all the 'Pearl Harbor' is... and that ain't all that bad.
THE 'PEARL HARBOR' WALKTHROUGHThe characters are thin, but believable (This is entertainment, people, not 'The late hour' with Siegmund Freud), and the love-story that goes on for the first hour is okay. It's a warm-up for the inevitable.
And then: Battle. For 45-minutes of incredibly digital imagery, you get a feeling of how stratigicly brilliant, the Japanese war-machine was. They blow up practically everything, which really is not that surprising to those of you, that know history a little.So: There's gotta be some sorta happy-end, right? For the americans, yes? So our pilot-boys, though strugling for the same woman, take on a suicide-mission to bomb Tokyo. This bit is a silly add-on, as nothing comepares to the battle at 'The Pearl'.And then: End Credits.ME TALKING ABOUT GOOD STUFF.I like first part of the story. I feel entertained and moved, by all that love, and all that war to set it apart. And naturally I like the battle-scenes, and the thinking: 'This is what it was like'I like the acting of:Ben Afflect Dan Akroyd Alec BaldwinI love the whole quality of sound and image. It's incredible. There's been masters at work here.ME TALKING ABOUT BAD STUFF:I don't really like the end-bit. It's too long, and becomes too much of a 'And so on and then and so on'.I don't like the acting of:Cuba Gooding Jr.I don't like the patriotic feel to the last bit either. The whole 'We can do anything c'os we're americans'-thing. But that's just me being dane.ME RATING THIS FILM AND ENDING THIS HORROR OF A REVIEW:I give it a 7. It's viewable (In the cinema only), but not deep and full of special messages. You'll like this one, I guarantee. But you won't fall in love with it.",7,0,0,14 July 2001
Good Will Hunting," This ain't bad at all!!
","It's an alright film, I think. I was amuzed, entertained and moved. So who cares it's kinda been done before. The actors are great, the music is brilliant, and hey! If you look close you might even find a little lesson for life. 9's the vote. What a little charmer indeed.",8,0,2,22 April 2001
The Elephant Man," Wonderful film
","It is a great story, and it is well percieved and executed. There are many references and beautiful pictures. But one could have hoped that Lynch had gotten over his 'Erasorhead' fever and grown up. It is annoying to see such a straight story infected with pop-surrealism. Another director would have suited this film.9/10",9,1,1,30 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Indeed a musical for people who don't like musicals.
","What a spin! Moulin Rouge! is beyond anything ever before. A perfect mixture of love and musical, drama and dance, comedy and cabaret. It uses whatever it likes from modern music, and tosses away everything it doesn't like about musicals and theater. (Eat this Saturday Night Fever!)The images strike you first, with amazing zooms and spins and cuts, the story is highly paced and perfectly timed with the charming, funny and sometimes even heartwarming. (Wait a second. Gonna shed a little tear here)The plot is downright idioticly simple, but the mixture of different genres and funny twists, the anarchy and the daring, makes you forget that. Hell. The lovestory of this film is topped only by pieces such as 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. And right now, even that seems debatable!The actors are all great, and they perfectly portray the image of good, evil, love, desire and most of all SHOWTIME!!!Baz Luhrmann has overdone himself this time, and it seems to me, that his career can ONLY be downhill from here.10/10 - shut up and go see the movie.",10,0,1,13 October 2001
The Mummy Returns," This film is quite silly!
","But it is way better than Stephen Sommer's first attempt at the genre. He's not much of a director, but this time he has driven the special effects to such an excess (Love that word), that you simply can't not get caught up in the action of it. It's a rollercoaster-ride, that you've tried before, but that you can't help loving.It's an 'Indiana Jones' rip'off (The bugs, the archeology, the time, the super-duper shoot-em-up hero), but who cares these days, right?
The effects range from really impressive, to down right silly, but the sound and music saves most of it. You believe it anyhow.. Maybe because you want to.Look folks! To put this short: You will NOT learn anything of value at all! You will NOT change your way of living after seeing this! But you can have a really great time, if only you leave that precious brain of yours in the door!8! I must be in a silly mood....",8,0,0,3 June 2001
Reservoir Dogs," I shouldn't do this, I know.

You won't like this if you're not into art, hard-to-get-plots and deep psychological undertones. It's a very different 7.",7,0,1,4 August 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The greatest love-story of all time...
","...Adapted to the screen. Count Dracula defies and denies God, when his beloved throws herself in the river, after having heard false news of his death. Therefor he becomes a vampire, a damned creature forced to wander the night, sucking blood, praying on people... sorta like a nocturnal lawyer.
So anyways, you know the story, let's not dwell in that. Let's talk about how Coppola made this film, one of the most beautiful at it's time, using great ambience and lightness in it's pictures. Many people think it's a horror-film, but compared to 'I know what you did last summer', 'Scream' and other abominations, Dracula is so elegant by comparasing.The story suffers a little from the adaption. There is a lot of so on and so forth, and many of the characters seem weakly drawn, and vague. Directors have to remember that NO we did not read that seven thousand page epic of a story, before entering the cinema. This is, at times, forgotten by the director of this film.But who cares? With Oldman, Hopkins, Ryder, Reeves and even Tom Waits, you tend to let the story slip out your mind, as you enjoy the violent, beautiful pictures, and the wonderful gothic score of Wojciech Kilar, ending with 'Lovesong for a Vampire' by Annie Lennox, the greatest lovesong of all.You're gonna see this one, and you're gonna love it.9/10",9,1,2,4 September 2001
WALL·E," Too many short circuits for grown ups
","Looking for a movie, that your kids will love and adore? Look no further. This'll do the trick. Looking, for something for the whole family? This movie fails. This movie could have been so much more! It could have easily been amongst PIXARs bravest and best! The story pitch really suggested that they were ready to try something new; something bold. Imagine:A love story between two robots. 'Real' robots, that is, without the physical human attributes found in other animation features like, well, 'Robots', set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic Earth.If one can accept that pre-programmed machines are able to feel love (and that concept was good enough for Kubrick!), this would truly be a movie for the grown ups, investigating that strange, obviously platonical romance between two 'artificials' (echoing the likes of 'Blade Runner'). Two man-made objects, seeking each others companionship in a desolate world of human remains. An idea of such fragile beauty, that one could throw in quite a lot of robo-stick comedy (you know, for the kids!), and still leave something for the everyone. Children wouldn't understand the haunting quality of a dusty wasteland, inexplicably void of people, nor would they get the love story; they'd just enjoy a robot falling on it's metal bum.It never became that movie. The end product abandons the pioneering spirit of the original idea, and the movie falls back on clichés, predictable gags and an eco-message so heavily stamped in our faces throughout the story, that it becomes borderline sickening, by the end of the film. The problems are obvious from the get-go: The visual design of WALL-E himself is annoying. He's mainly a dwarfed version of Johnny 5 from 'Short Circuit', with the big dark eyes from 'Puss In Boots' ('Shrek 2'). The design reeks of 'play it safe' producing: It's obvious that some producer 'liked the wicked idea', and then demanded something that was a) done before b) something cute. WALL-E is cute; Cute as step-dancing penguins, another safe bet with an ego message.More annoyingly: this lonely robot is  in fact  not alone. A cockroach, has befriended him. It's called 'Cri-Kee'. Wait. Sorry. That was the name of the cricket in 'Mulan'. Easy to get confused these days...This benign, loyal side-kick serves no narrative purpose, and seems present only because side-kicks are demanded in these kinds of movies. Again, you can see the producer's memo: 'Love this story, Jones! But.. could the lonely robot perhaps be not entirely alone?'It wouldn't be fair to discount WALL-E because of cuddle-factor or lack of original design, and that's not his primal malfunction: His problem is that he's a freak! A strange robot, that collects artifacts from an alien (human) civilization, and studies it, caught up in his own lonely despair. SO when the other main character, EVE, arrives, he immediately starts following her, dragging her around, oblivious as to whether she's 'there' or not.Okay, I'm being a cynic. The part between the two robots actually works! She's an advanced model, way out of his league, what plays into a 'uptown girl, downtown boy' kind of romance. Also EVE is by far the funniest character in the movie (the girl has a temper). WALL-E attempts to impress EVE, with generic slapstick montage sequences to follow. They're predictable, but would again be harmless, if we had any incentive to root for WALL-E, and his desperate wooing of EVE. Being cute/clumsy just doesn't cut it as interesting character traits, and he fails to be likable. 'Puss in Boots' was also adorable, but also quite deranged in his delusions of grandeur, while self-conscious enough, to use his fluffy-factor, when in a tight spot. WALL-E lacks those comedic layers, and his effectuation for EVE seems desperate.If the first half of the movie is patchy, that's nothing compared to the second half, where EVE travels back to the spaceship she came from (WALL-E ever desperately clinging on to her).We now see what has happened to humanity, and the second part seems more engulfed with them, and their dependency upon technology. People have become insanely overweight, uneducated and complacent. They now rely on machines to take care of everything from food to control of their spaceship.The satire seems thick. Yes, there are overweight Americans. Yes some Americans are less educated. But to suggest that the human race has become stupid, fat and irresponsible, is just a bit thick for me. EVE and WALL-E become tools in a story bigger than them, and their own romance is drowned. Arguably, by then you'll be happy to look at anyone/thing but WALL-E. I know I was!People might say: 'Look at how simple the story is! Enjoy the beauty of it!' I respectfully disagree. I think they should have gone all out, and created an even simpler story, between two robots. What would have been PIXAR's most mature work yet, becomes it's most simple.This movie seems overproduced, caved in by the fear of what the public might want. They seem to have been desperate to make this feel good politically correct picture, right down to the notion that even though some machines might be 'faulty', they can still help you.To conclude: In the end it turns out, that there's not much in 'WALL-E' that hasn't been seen before. Judging by PIXAR standard this movie is just not 'that complete package', that we've come to expect from 'Toy Story', and 'Finding Nemo'. It remains a visually stunning, tragically empty shell, seriously lacking a courageous, wicked ghost.",4,8,18,9 October 2008

The german camp-leader is humoures and has a pleasent side to his nastiness. The 'I-can-get-it-for-ya' guy is a racist. And so on and so forth. The plot is not what you think.

Donnie Darko," Dark DARKER DARKO
","This film is disturbing, amazing, fantastic. I've just seen it once, but I'm going to have to watch it again and again. It is about a mentally troubled 15 year old, and his life in the 1980's contemporary America. Donnie Darko is his name, and he's made a new friend: Frank - the giant bunny rabbit.Frank is telling Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.Richard Kelly has made a modern masterpiece. There can be no doubt about it. Incredibily filmed, well directed. DONNIE DARKO keeps switching between surreal horror and a intense drama. Thanks to the suburb looks and action of Jake Gyllenhaal, you really care about this boy, and what is happening to him.It's like there is something definitly not right, in this right world of jesus-freaks, surburban comfort and that fat girl from school, noone will ever talk to. Donnie has been seeing stuff, and lately... Frank has been telling him to do things... Dark things.I find myself without words now.

","I noticed that this was the best rated film in this place a couple of months ago, so naturally, I decided to give it at shot. But I just don't get what attracts you folks to it?The character-draving is pretty weak, and you don't really get to go inside the heads of the gangsters. The pictures are pretty ordinary and the whole storyline is... well... boring.I mean no disrespect or anything, but maybe this is to old folks, what the first King Kong film was to my great granfather... Maybe I'm just part of a next generation... Or maybe.. A next step in the evolution. A superman! A mastermind! Maybe I'm going to be king of the hill! Top of the heap! Maybe I need to find some sleep.Sorry. This one did nothing for me, but if you're high on gangsters, this is definitly the one for you.6/10.I'd love to hear from you folks that thinks this is Gods gift to movies.",3,6,18,17 October 2001
