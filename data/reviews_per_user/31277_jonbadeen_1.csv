Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," If you are a fan of Borat/Ali G, you'll love it
","I give the movie a 10 not because it is a 10 movie but it is a 10 Borat movie. Meaning, if you are a fan of Ali G and Borat you will find this movie hilarious. Hopefully you will find it funny even if you aren't. Tonight was the first public screening and the majority of the packed audience seemed to eat it up. I haven't laughed like that in a movie for quite some time. It is extremely crude with multiple full frontal male nudity shots which add to the humor of the film. I don't mean to say that it is inappropriate though. Those who take it for what it is will find it absolutely hilarious. I was surprised that so much antisemitism was included since it was a feature film. If a person didn't know that he is Jewish in real life I'm sure they would be truly offended. As for the format of the film, it is a blend between narrative and real footage. However it's very difficult to tell which parts are real and which are not and I will be very curious to find out if several of the bits were real or staged. There were times when I thought that I was watching something real and unscripted only for something to happen that seemed all too convenient for fitting into the plot thus prompting my curiosity. If you like Ali G or Borat (who is my favorite of his persona) then you have to check this movie out whenever it comes to theaters.",10,236,483,2 February 2006
