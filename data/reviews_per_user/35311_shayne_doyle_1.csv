The Blair Witch Project," Absolute waste of ticket money
","I, my wife, and about 25 other persons unknown to me saw this movie last night. The universal reaction of all present was 'is that it ??? we've been robbed !!!' At the end we all waited while all the credits rolled, thinking that that was the end of the awful amateur footage and now some proper stuff would show, but no way !  This was the worst movie I have seen in my life. The constant darting, shifting and out-of focussing of the cameras gave me a major eyestrain problem, and while I appreciate that is the reality of amateur film making, I found it carried to excess here. I got utterly sick of viewing twigs, piles of stones and stark winter forest. I found the incessant foul language from the characters really got on my wick after a while. When I left the theatre I felt like telling everyone in the next session queues to get a refund if they were intending to see this.",Null,0,1,4 January 2000
