Sucker Punch," As a guy watching this, i can say that it brought about feelings of anger and hostility towards my fellow men!
","Whilst i can see that the visual effects are stunning, and the movie captured and brought home the concepts it wished to portray, the movie itself, i found sickening and degrading towards women in ways i did not expect and i wanted to fast forward through some scenes. This movie is all about the pre-era dominance of prehistoric men in a world that they believe only they understand and the movie captured the concept of the young women truly being in a powerless situation that they are unable to control thus concocting a fantasy world as a form of escapism. The film used attractive, vulnerable looking young woman as a tool for these purposes, beating them down and destroying their sense of hope and will throughout. This movie made me very angry but fulfilled the purposes with which it set out to achieve so 6/10 from me even though i wished to give it lower.",Null,1,2,24 July 2011
