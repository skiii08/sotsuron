First Man," Great acting but.....
","The very very hard technical aspects from leaving the lunar surface till the Astronauts was back safe and sound on earth, was not shown at all, which made me sit with a empty feeling.....
The earlier launch in the movie as well did not show the complexity of returning from space to earth......The reason for giving the movie 7/10 is simply becuz the acting from both Ryan and Claire was firstclass..... Claire... especially did outstanding credible acting.",7,1,1,23 September 2019
Interstellar," This movie will stir you up inside
","Its the third time I watched this movie,.... reason:.... The storyline, The Topics, The Music, The effects, The love/longing between father and daughter..........Nolan just serves the sweet pain of melancholy all the way......If you did not watch Inception,......Then go for it, it also leaves you stirred up, I promise.......",10,0,0,23 August 2018
Event Horizon," Horrible Sci Fi Horror
","Dumb script, lousy movie from a time where most of mankind believed in Hell.If you like sci fi horror, theres only 2 masterpieces to consider .....Alien 1 & Alien 2",3,1,5,13 October 2018
Midsommar," rubbish
","Took only a short while to see through this plot, and its made by a very young untalented writer/director..... I have spoken",1,10,15,11 May 2020
The Matrix," could we be part of an animation?
","Yes we could. This movie should score higher. Reason:Plot could be true?? Especially in nowadays computer graphics keeps getting closer and closer to the real thing. Would Super Mario know from where his world was made/executed??!! Could this count for the human race too?? Story is more likely to be true than Adam & Eve, the snake and the apple, which is a bit outdated :) Scenes, acting, philosophy behind ..... everything about this movie is outstanding.Do yourself a favor and watch it..... forget about the sequels, they should be deleted/wiped out of our Matrix",10,0,0,1 September 2017
