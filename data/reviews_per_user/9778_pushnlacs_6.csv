3:10 to Yuma," That ending!!!!!!! (NO SPOILERS)
","At first I was thinking that it might not be as good as I was hoping for. The opening scene contained way to many close ups for my taste as well, but by the time the end credits rolled I was thinking it was even better than I had expected.If you've seen the original, things are pretty much the same except this one is a bit more violent and darker overall, and lets just say the ending isn't the same lolBut what a ending it is!There's good performances all around, though I'm not sure Ben Foster(is that his name) is as good as a lot of the reviews are claiming. Or maybe its just that he didn't play the part like I pictured it from the reviews. I pictured a crazed quick talking madman but instead got a slow soft spoken killer. He's still very good though.Crowe was good as well but I have to be honest he's never been an actor that blows me away, I like him and he's given some great performances which this is one of but his name alone for one reason or another doesn't make me want to see a movie. AFter this one it might though.Like I said he does a great job, I actually Think he was pretty bad-ass, Still I think Bale gives the best performance of the film. I used to think Bale wasn't a very good actor but that has changed(long before this film). He ma not give the coolest performance of have the coolest part, but it's the best performance acting wise IMO, it's subtle and doesn't draw attention to it self yet you can feel what he's feeling. You Cant ask for much more than that. Then again you can't ask for much better acting all around including the smaller roles like Fonda for instance.In terms of camera work and the cinematography, I have to say there's nothing that really stands out. The Browns and grays of the old west look fine but there's nothing that really catches you. Same goes for the camera work, the film is shot very simply. Im not taking anything away from the film because of these facts though. For what it is the cinematography and camera works just fine.Its honestly the ending that makes this film though. It would still be a really good film without it but the ending makes it a great film.",9,18,44,2 September 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Creative and Magical
","THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERSOK i want to start by saying that i believe the film is meant to be taking as a fairy tale and thats all there is to it. meaning that the magic and fantasy truly existed and was not simply in the little girls mind as some like to say.there is proof to this throughout the whole film. the voice over at the beginning talks of her being reborn, most people i think take that literally but i think it was actually talking about her death. her mortal death. through her mortal death she was reborn as the princess of her world. hence the fauns constant references to mortality.also the root was actually under the mother bed to be seen by others, and did make the mother better while it was there. then as soon as it was removed she feel ill again.another strong piece of evidence proving the fantasy was real was that she escaped her lock and guarded room to retrieve her brother at the end. there's no way she could have done so unless the chalk was truly magic allowing her to draw a door.plus i believe the director himself said that its real. its a fairy tale through and through and you are not meant to question the magic of fairy tales. you just accept that its real and thats what makes fairy tales what they are. a place for magic to exist.OK now onto the actual film review. i really liked it. there was some poor writing in some areas IMO, like the girl eating two freaking grapes of all tings despite all the warnings. also the girl going out of her way to place the chalk on the captains desk for him to see. also some of the production seemed like it could have used a bigger budget.all that aside, its a great film thats more than good enough to make up for its flaws. i like many would have liked to see more, a lot more, of the fantasy world and in general would have liked the film to been More fairy tale than war drama but still its a great film that i liked very much. its creative, magical, and enjoyable.",8,2,5,19 August 2007
The Man Who Would Be King," A welcome throw back to the Golden Age
","I want to start off by saying that though this film was released in 1975, it has the fell of a film produced by earlier Hollywood. That of course is due to it being directed by HUston who was a product of Hollywoods Golden Age.That is one of my favorite things about the film. I love that it is filmed in a elegant manner straight out of the Hollywood of yesteryear and does not at all look or feel like most films that saw release in the mid 70s.That said, without a great story and great characters that wouldn't matter much. Luckily the film as both. The story of two soldiers who head of to take over a little known country out of greed is simple yet epic.The film is filled with excitement, drama, humor, and more. It constantly keeps you drawn in. The acting is also top notch, it is likely Conery's best and may very well be Cain's as well.On a side note, the women who plays Roxanne is Cain's actual wife, he's a lucky man lol.",8,1,3,20 September 2007
American Gangster," Irresponsible and Dull
","When I first heard about this film, I was hopeful and expected some pretty good things, but once I started seeing the trailers that all changed.At best I thought it would be an OK film that could wait for a DVD release. Well since I had the chance to see it at no cost to me I went ahead and did so. My instincts were correct, about it not being worth a theater going experience. But I was way off on it being at least OK. It was much worst than expected.By no means did I expect such a dull film. It lacked detail and jumped around in a horribly irresponsible manner. This film depicts a POS that smuggled drugs in the caskets of American soldiers yet glosses over that fact. It doesn't show the rise nor fall of this man in any detail what so ever. In return avoiding depicting the monster that he was, even his acts of violence were shown in a cleaned up matter or off screen all together.And the end can be argued as to showing him in a somewhat positive manner.Not only is the film irresponsible but it takes way to long just to end up saying absolutely nothing at all.",5,7,14,3 November 2007
The Queen," umm........
","....I don't know. I didn't hate it or anything but film making and story telling wise there just wasn't much here IMO.Obviously it's not a movie that calls for flashy camera work or anything like that, but there just seemed to be no energy. I know the film maker and all those involved probably put tons of energy and effort into it though, so don't take that as me saying it was poorly made. I will say that the direction probably didn't deserve an Academy Award nomination though.Performance wise The Queen was played well from what I could tell though transforming appearances seemed to be the most impressive thing. As for the rest of the cast, there wasn't any poor acting but nothing really that stood out or anything that had a chance to stand out for that matter.While the film did fill me in on some interesting facts that I did not know and tells a worthwhile story I'm not sure it works as a film overall. Princess Diana's death is sad, as is any persons who goes too young and I do not mean to insult her, her life, her death or anyone who loved her in any way. Just that for me personally, I'm not sure if the film accomplished what it set out to do or not and I'm not sure if it connected with me.As I said I didn't hate it, or dread sitting through it, far from it but when all was said and done I don't know if it was as memorable as it should have been.7/10",7,0,1,2 September 2007
All the President's Men," Interesting
","Today I just read Ebert's review of Zodiac in which he calls it the All The Presidents Men of serial killer investigations. well thats pretty fitting. Just as Zodiac is today, ATPM was a film of details then.It starts With The Water Gate Break in and end with Nixons resignation. It follows the two reports that broke most of the news and who were seemingly two of the few people who cared to find out what was going on.I honestly never knew exactly how it all went down regarding Water Gate and this film is very informative. Though it's never boring. IT keeps you interested as the reporters follow leads, mostly dead ends, and you feel involved as they put clues together and build their story.(with the help of Deep Throat of course).I enjoyed it. 7.5/10",7,2,5,17 September 2007
