Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," some of the parts are are good
","The good: liam neeson was pretty good as qui gonn jinn.
the pod race scene and the dual of the fates was pretty entertaining.
the mixed: i would like to see more of darth maul, but his fight scenes were good so i will let this one slide.
anakin was pretty cute and had his moments but thats it.
the bad: jar jar bink was pretty distracting.
it took to long, with that i mean there is a ton of talking and talking.
a lot of cringe.
overall decent movie for the star wars franchise.",4,0,0,19 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," i bit better than the phantom menace i feel
","The good: ewan McGregor does a pretty good job as obi wan..
the planet design as Always..
the geonosis arena battle was pretty entertaining..
some other fight scenes were also fine..
and the music obviouslythe mixed: anakin is fine in this one..
padme, count dooku,and some other jedi were also fine..
i liked jango fett but i feel like something is off by him i dont know what, same with dooku, mace windu and yoda..the bad: the Interaction between anakin and padme was pretty cringey..
cgi felt weird..
what was zam wessel for again..
why did zam wessel not just use a blaster to kill padme in place of a weird worm..
that women on the beggining was pretty pointless..overall again a decent star wars movie with alot of flaws.",5,2,3,19 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," my favorite of the star wars movies..
","The good: ewan McGregor as Always does a great job..anankin was this time really good, you could known he became darth vader ofcours, but it still was nice to see him turn to the dark side..palpatine was pretty cool but when he spinned in the air was pretty random..after watching the clone wars series order 66 gave a bigger impact than i thought, and one of them was plo koon who i really likedsome jedi like mace windu and yoda were also fine..the music was really good..the action like the battle on mustafar, and yoda vs palpatine was also pretty good and it shows how strong palpatine really is..i dont have a lot to say about general grievous and count dooku but they are fine..the interaction between obi wan and anakin was nice..padme was also fine..the battle of kashyyyk could have been longer maybe..mace could have used the force to push anakin away when he got killed but ok..poor younglings, i would like to see how he killed them but i understand why they didn,t show it..i also would like to see more when anakin invaded the jedi temple..overal a really good movie and gives a good story for anakin",9,0,0,19 February 2020
