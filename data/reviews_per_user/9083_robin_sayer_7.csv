Blade Runner 2049," Visually Stunning Piece of Nothing
","How hard is it, when you spend $150 million dollars to actually come up with a story line.
Even though this nonsense is over two hours longs - what little I could comprehend of this movie wouldn't hold the attention span of a 20 minute midday soap opera.The visuals are great and otherworldly but for some reason that seems to give every single person in shot a permission slip to talk really slowly, to not impart any information, to talk in a whisper and to leave 20 second gaps between everything that's said while staring at each other expressionless.The story seems to me, android cop whose job it is to track down and destroy the old androids - finds cause to think that one of the androids managed to have a baby. Queue the world powers being interested in that, and him suspecting that it might be him. Surprise surprise its Harrison Fords and the hot robots from the last movie, and its not him but some weirdly simply whispering woman who he interacts with for about 2 minutes halfway into the movie.Absolutely nothing is explained - as the entire movie is just utterly laden down with its own sense of self importance, and unspoken meaning. As far as I can see, for both this movie and the original - The only redeeming aspect of any note - is the fantastic visualisation of a futuristic city which shows Asian and American culture clash in some rainy dirty downtown of the future. Also the sound is very good. Take those two things out of either blade runner and you would have absolutely nothing of any consequence.",6,2,5,9 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Just Wow from Start to Finish
","I dont know why we cant see more films like this.This movie is beautiful - in the writing, in the story, in the acting, in the heart.",10,2,6,10 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Very sad - that this is what has become of a fantastic franchise
","It's certainly watchable, and perhaps worth watching on the big screen just because of some of the few great battle moments. However other than that - what we have here is so formulaic that you imagine the plot to have been written by a committee.It's as though someone said - 'we need surprises', so they sprinkle a few surprises in the script, 'we need some comedy moments', OK sprinkle a few wry sesame street wacky moments in and james bond style sarcasm.As others have said - it's too long, almost looking like the end of one movie was just tagged onto the end of another.
In terms of money - some star wars executive must have pointed out that the younger the key protagonists the greater the scope for making MANY MANY movies before they get too old - so for me, none of the new characters are believable as either heroes or protagonists.The story line is mostly silly with nothing particularly happening - just sufficient forward movement to drag us from one set piece and environment to another.For me - there was only one moment of grandeur and awe in the entire movie, and it was the scene towards the end when an array of giant walkers have all stopped in a line with the red sky behind them, and luke standing in front of them. That was a fantastic moment - and the shot there was terrifying. For a moment - I felt like the movie was all worthwhile and capable of great things. Unfortunately what followed next was another ridiculous committee style moment that missed evert opportunity in the book. After all of the thousands of books written on the subject of Star Wars - you would think that they would no better how to make a worthy sequel.Basically all you need is a King Arthur style good and evil characters, a decent plot that's a bit grander than simply being chased, or simply defending something, sprinkle it with half memorable space versions of things from history books and your done.",4,2,4,5 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Dull Dull and More Dull
","There are absolutely no redeeming features in this film.It looks as though someone simply opened all the standard moulds for a comic hero movie - and then poured the money/dialog/acting into those.It's horrible that movies like this seem to do well, while really great sci-fi like Valerian gets down voted.
As far as I can see - the difference, is that films like Wonder Woman are hyped with franchises and have a greater selling potential simply as an idea, rather than being a good movie.",1,3,10,18 April 2018
Blade Runner," Hard to fathom why people rate this movie
","The absolutely ONLY thing that this film has going for it - is that the director didn't succumb to the normal futuristic movie mistake (and particularly American penchant) of making everything clean.
I dont know what it is, perhaps just the way the Hollywood sets and costumes are used in so many things - but if you watch even modern day episodes of Star trek - then a distant alien village of poor humanoids will still manage an immaculate village - and it will look as though people who have just come from the hairdressers have been handed a designer sack cloth which has just come from the dry cleaners.
So blade runner is a completely run of the mill story which has been done a million times before - which has been placed in a gritty realistic dirty future.
Star wars also sort of managed this a little - with ships and vehicles at least looking dirty and worm - but then spoilt it with aliens out of the muppets.So Blade runner after having a fantastic dirty realistic looking future - then spoils it not with the muppets, but by making everyone wander around in some sort of miserable haze. There's not a single spark of normal human emotion in the entire movie - which just drags itself from long silence to long silence, and standing in the rain.So it must be that people are just fixated on that stylization. Because apart from that dirty future - maybe the music is pretty cool. or at least it fits in. Harrison Ford is his normal grumpy looking self.",5,2,5,12 February 2018
Life," Great film - only spoiled by idiot critics
","There is absolutely no justification for the low scores handed out by some of the idiot sci-fi brigade - who all claim to know better than anyone else about what creatures can survive in space.That's ridiculous - and this film if anything, is a very much more well thought out and realistic movie for its handling of this creature.Those critics who say things like 'it couldn't survive in space' would probably be more than happy if this creature got in someones blood stream - laid eggs - did mind control or some other type of BS.Those who claim the crew are all dumb - would probably be much happier with your normal alien type behavior where having an alien pod stuck on your face, and then fall off, means its fine for you to go an have lunch in the cafeteria with everyone while it bursts out of your chest.As it is the acting was first class, the way the crew behaved very much closer to what you would expect in real life.This was an absolutely great movie from start to finish - and it refused to fall into any of the stupid clich√©s and is all the better for it.",10,3,8,5 November 2017
The Martian," A truly great original movie
","A really interesting movie, which I was worried about because of the necessary lack of dialog when watching one person battling the odds all alone.A couple of shortcomings were the weird downplayed interaction when he first makes any kind of contact with other people. When he first has a conversation with his crew who he's not spoken to for over a year, you get the impression that you must have missed something and perhaps they had been talking the day before or something.I think he made an agreement with the director that he didn't want an Oscar winning emotional bit but this seemed to go too far in the other direction, so what you get is a completely unbelievable conversations of a human whose not spoken to another human for over a year just talking as though you spoke yesterday.The other issue for me was Sean Beans slightly strange performance. He seemed to be going for a real person and was playing his character sort of techy dysfunctional anti social and nervous - but no one else in the NASA role did. Jeff Daniels only seems to have one acting style, so while he was just being a NASA version of NewsRooms Will McAvoy, Sean was probably being a more realistic version of a NASA chief nerd. Also it seemed a bit weird that Sean Beans character saves the day but is fired.",9,1,4,30 November 2015
