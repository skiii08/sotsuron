The Blair Witch Project," Worse movie ever.
","Where do you begin. This is the worse movie i have viewed and on all levels. Just bad. Bad acting, bad camera work. People were afraid of this pos. You got to be kidding. Anyone giving this about a 4 is out of there minds. Its almost like its a spoof. Like a college movie with a bunch of idiots go out into the Forest and make a stupid movie on purpose. The premise is good and thats about it. And enough with this modern day shaking camera syndrome. This isn't Saving Private Ryan. What happen to the days of steady camera work, even on the amateur level. Please, if you haven't watched this crappy movie yet, don't waste 90 minutes of your life with it.",1,3,6,4 September 2011
United 93," United to the end.
","Hard to review this without feeling the emotions of that day. As a movie, its one of the most riveting, horrifying, and draining movies i can remember. Sorta reminded me of watching Schindlers list. Another great movie with a tough topic. Like Schindlers list, you put yourself in these peoples situation and ponder how the heck would I react to being in those peoples position. No one knows for sure of course, but gives you the feeling of what it probably was like. From seeing the terrorist blend into the normal situations at an airport to seeing people from different ways of life, taking what they thought was just another flight not realizing that there fate was doomed the second they shut the planes doors. Filmed as if you were on the plane. The acting was great all the way around. From the scenes at the different controls towers, to the people on the plane. There's the very few rogue morons out there panning this movie. What can you say, there's bound to be 1 moron for every 10 normal people in the world. Anyone who isn't moved by this movie either didn't see it, or probably could care a less about someone else's life or supports what happen. I know for me, its a movie experience that brought 9/11 back has painfully as a baseball bat to the back of the head. And its a pain that will never go away.",10,8,15,11 September 2008
Caddyshack," Classic.
","With Animal House, this is one of the great all time classic comedies. Bar none. There isn't enough praise you can give this movie, from the millions of classic one line jokes, to just the overall performances. There's the old saying, they just don't make them like this anymore. And that applies to this gem. Even the small characters like Spalding are funny as heck. When is the last time you saw this many funny actors in one movie. Never.. Egos were put aside to put this great movie together. From a great soundtrack, to just the overall chemistry of the cast. You can't do any better than this. And for all the total morons and newbs out there that gave this anything less than an 8- Go home. Play your ipods and go watch some crap like Spiderman and leave the real judges of comedy to the pros....",10,1,3,21 January 2010
World Trade Center," Fine movie
","Highly underrated movie that follows the will to survive of two Port Authority Policemen after that attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Special affects are amazing. I know the former WTC complex very well and from every angle of this film, it looks just like it did. Its almost laughable about how many idiots pan this movie for various things like one comment about the Jesus figure showing up. Ever consider thats what that policeman saw while going in and out of consciousness? The acting is fine. Like any of the totally stupid action movies that came out this summer are Oscar material. I know I'm getting old when great movies like this get panned, yet crowds head to the theaters for the stupidest movies nowadays. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Give this a look over and judge for yourself. Along with United 93, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer in the shows of the people who were directly impacted that day. It almost didn't feel like a Oliver Stone movie. So if thats a reason your not giving it a chance, you should see it anyway..",9,2,4,7 September 2013
The Dark Knight," Terrible
","By far the most overrated hunk of junk i have ever viewed. Who the heck thinks this is a good movie. Its just another in a long line of stupid super hero/comic book movies that have come out to the theater in the past few years. The acting is terrible. From Batman himself who i couldn't understand half the things he was saying. To the very barely average performance of Ledger. They consider his role Oscar material? You've got to be kidding. You want to see a good performance, go rent Monster's Ball. Even the Patriot he was better. The special affects are nothing to go crazy about. Just your typical CGI thats not so spectacular nowadays. And that plot. Like that made allot of sense. But i guess like Adam Sandler movies, people like this garbage. To think this movie is getting higher ratings than the Godfather movies, Shawshank, Pulp Fiction, Schindler list, Star Wars and Casablanca shows you the mentality of todays movie viewer.",1,30,66,1 August 2008
War of the Worlds," Very good film
","One of the best sci-fi movies in the last decade. So many crappy sci-fi movies have come out recently, its laughable to see people trash this movie. Like Spiderman, Transformers and all the other trash out there is good. Many scenes that people hate, i thought were great. Like the scenes down in Tim Robbins cellar. If i have one minor gripe, I wasn't too thrilled at the aliens themselves. I expected something more like the ones in the original movie. Red skinned, 3 eyed creatures with big heads. But thats about it. People who hated the ending, Well you know, thats how the book ends. Guess people can't handle a non explosive ending to a film nowadays. If you like a good old alien movie. You can't do better than this.",10,1,4,18 April 2009
Her," Beyond terrible
","I rarely give thee old 1 rating for a movie, but this one was beyond bad for even my taste. Seriously, one of the stupidest movies I have ever viewed. Talk about wasting a couple hours of your life. Reading about the plot I figured what the heck, its on cable I'll give it a chance. It just doesn't work on any level. It got to the point where I wish I could go through the TV and smack this guy around and say wake up you dummy and get your head examined and just go out and meat somebody the old fashion way.",1,3,7,26 July 2017
Alien: Covenant," Not bad - Somewhat Interesting
","Have to wonder about the users giving this 1's and 2 ratings. Did you see the same movie? Is it the first 2 Alien movies from the 80's? No. Sorta like Star Wars 4 and 5, you will never get those great movies again. But its not that bad. With some of that bad reviews I expected the worse. But I was entertained for the most part. Special effects were very good. Lots of scary parts throughout the movie. And the acting was fine. I've viewed far worse sci-fi movies in the last couple years to know what a real crappy movie looks like. If I have a minor complaint about the plot, I would of liked to here more about David's thoughts on why he did what he did (won't spoil the plot). You get some of his thinking (and its not positive for sure) but not quite enough. Still, this is getting 6.6 from IMDb raters and I gave it a similar 7. If you got a descent TV and audio set up, than just chuck in this movie, get your popcorn ready and take it for what it is.",7,2,5,10 August 2017
