Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest Movie of Gen-X
","This is it, everything you ever wanted in an adventure movie.  Some dared try to copy it, to pay homage to it, etc.This movie not only deals with life and death, good vs. evil, but gets into the mysteriousness of Christianity.I cannot sum up enough good things about this movie, acting directing, special effects, plot, pacing, characterization.  This movie pioneered new frontiers in blockbuster entertainment.Actual historical facts can be disputed surrounding the controversy of the Ark of the Covenant, but the movie was beautifully made, and will stand for all time.  It is the Gone With the Wind of Generation-X.
John Williams is at his finest hour in this movie.  The music in the 'Map Room' scene as well as the theme for the Ark at the very end during the climax still send chills up my spine.10 out of 10.  Movies rarely get better than this.",10,0,0,14 April 2004
