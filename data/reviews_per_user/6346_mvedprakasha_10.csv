Black Swan," The Conceptual Review
","The story opens with the dark background with the white dressed women, indicating the existing of the angel within the minds of the evil society. This symbolism is maintained throughout the movie and this carry of symbolism is the heart of the story and is taken throughout till the end. Camera work is simply superb giving the viewer no chance to close his camera eyes.Natalie Portman is at perfection in the acting giving no scope for others to replace her with.The Director Mr.Darren tries to convey the message of 'Anything which is true to heart within the bounds of civilization of culture directed in the path of righteousness is the essence of life' which he achieves in the movie. Culturing the mind in such a path is difficult but important for the well being of the society. In order to feel such a essence there are a lot of intrusions, preventions which has to be overcome for better understanding of life. One such obstacle is dual mind set which is evidently shown in the movie. when Nina steels some of the things of the person whose behaviors does not meet the standard well being and then starts using it, the consequences seems to change. Her mind seems to see only the evil existence in the society and the good remains unrecognized. The movies shoots the duality of the mind in the way the white swan turns into black. She does not understand that she is killing herself in that force of down mentality. She does not even accepts the suggestions of her mom who symbolizes the essence and experience of life. Nina wins the heart of millions of audience but fails to understand her own heart and soul. The final gravity of the story faints to that the 'Love is perfect' and is equalized to 'Death is certain'.",7,0,2,15 December 2011
Gravity," The Conceptual Review
","Gravity is a movie all about ourselves raising beyond the gravity to a state of achievement. The environment puts us into various challenges which pulls us to the ground level however we need to raise to the heights of excellence to fulfill the dreams. Meanwhile the process of excellence demands sacrifices in that journey which needs to be adorned. The well effort-ed satellites (dreams) of life sometimes explode and go un-repaired. That's the time we need more and more oxygen to breath in, take in all the confidence and fearlessness and get our mind in the state of balance for moving forward. We may need the help of experience of friends, relatives, guides and mentors but its we who have to continue the journey and reach the destination. The movie takes us into such various stages where everyone is stuck at some point in life, where a question arises as whether all the human effort is made before accepting the defeat. Its God who help those who help themselves.Its the capacity and the caliber of the director Alfonso to direct such a movie to take ahead with only couple of artists who keeps running the show for the entire 90 min in great 3D effects. Its just the Sandra and George who keeps us entertaining. On the darker side of the movie, the audience shall be more or less interested in the achievements rather than the effort put forth in the process, which the director does not give the clear view. Though its all about 'standing' high, amidst challenges, the greatness of a person shall be in presenting himself as effortlessly flawless, in spite of being surrounded by drowning challenges. Another point of notice is that its better to give people the examples of situations which seems more familiar to them rather than choosing the space domain which most of the audience may be unaware of. Any way the director and his team's effort is fantabulous and is indeed successful in conveying the message that any success story needs seamless effort and sacrifice.",7,2,4,17 November 2013
The Prestige," The Prestige: A critique on the concept of movie
","I conceive that the any movie as a matter of fact can become successful if its core is a concept. Its a movie pertaining to human behaviors who are interested in becoming successful by following an idealism. whenever two persons fighting to achieve a single idealism finds it hard to find the secrets of that idealism, or he wrongly interprets the idealism, then he reaches a stage of perverted mind set. Even in this movie Hugh Jackman though right in presenting himself as a magician, making illusions, he goes wrong by losing his 'prestige' both in show as well as in understanding the idealism. In spite of Mr.Cutter's immense knowledge of the trick, Jackman does not believe his words. The human behavior is to keenly know what others are doing and do the same either steal or copy or pull their legs for the self raise. But when it satisfies the extent of challenging the nature, nature or the destiny makes sure that it will always exist by destroying the unnatural one. The story has a nice balance and surprise maintained till the climax designed by Director Mr.Nole. The story also depicts how two mental status under a single guidance(teacher) turning into two rivals because of business and PRESTIGE issues. Prestige when exceeds the desires and ambitions of winning the others at the cost of challenging the nature, though nature looses some of its very needy part, does not hesitate to destroy the artificial existence. All that we need to remember is :- Anything Great deserves Sacrifice.",8,0,0,26 November 2011
Life of Pi," The Conceptual Review
","World is a zoo bearing many species of the life where each individual witnesses the minds and souls of others which actually represents the universal truth. Opening with the soothing voice the Indian classical music of Bombay Jayashree gives us the calmness that exists in the blue planet. The takeover of the story slowly grabs the impetus in the traditional method of the Irfan khan recollecting the olden days as though inculcating the thought process of mind which always moves back either into the history or toggles into the future and never stays in the present. The years of 1950's of newly born India's is well thought of to be a subject matter. The story giving a philosophical glimpse starts with Lord Krishna who symbolizes the ultimate bliss of life throughout his journey of life, by a way of circumscribing the entire Universe in his tiny little mouth is a valid way of representing the Pi responding to it while his brother doesn't. The interests of pi and his brother are varied throughout the movie. The hunger for knowledge awakened the pi while his brother was attracted by the fantasies of the world, cleanly represented by the holy water in the church. The senses of hearing of Allah did not affect Ravi but the listening Allah touched the ears of Pi. The concept of Absurdity is also meaningfully taken into the story by the introduction of Albert Camus to the pi. The worldly fascination doesn't give the 'Anand(i)' is very well depicted in the movie. The concentration of the fact of Darwin's theory of 'struggle for existence' is shown at every step of the movie such as his father's business mind where he thinks to move to Canada, and also by the fact in the life boat where at the point where he kills the fishes to feed himself and the fierce Richard parker. The conflict in the mind about the killing of the fishes (other species) for the one's own survival on this planet is the lively truths of past, present and the futuristic tendencies of the world. The colors about the godly islands which shall mark the origin of the all the energy which starts with the birth of cold and healthy water lakes along the sunrise and dawns with the water being acidic in nature turning wild to end the life of many species also seems relevant to life. The realization of the nature's thunder storm-god paradox is brought evidently to depict the curiosity (JIGNYASA) to know the world, one self and God .The simile of Tiger to that of the soul of the pi is very interesting. Life is a journey of the body and the soul in this planet to evolve or reach a destined destination. On finishing the journey body shall cry for the loss of the soul, nevertheless the soul is liberated without even bidding the good bye, becomes one with the universal eternal energy. The tiger which represents the depth of the pi, departs without any hesitation deep into the forests brings the end of the 25 years story in 3 hours. The making of the movie and the 3d effects and photography has really made it worth the golden statues. The editing and the Foley have made it supportive to the great Oscars.",8,6,10,28 March 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Review
","The entertainment and the action is in pure form to all the audience. The Technological advances represented are at its best. Story though fictional in its approach, hope to see such technological research in reality. The opening of the movie where we see the silent killing, is reasoned in the mid of Ghost Protocol, which is something special unlike any other movies. Technical issues are also handled at its best. But I guess story line up could have been more critical than shown. Story does not even reason why is it India not any other country, as it is no way consent with either USSR or America. Just bringing up Burj or countries like India without reasoning, makes the movie down to that level. The eminent and experienced actors Tom cruise and Jeremy Renner have given their best for the success of the movie",6,3,7,30 December 2011
The Artist," The Artist- Conceptual Review
","Director Michel Hazanavicius has made all effort for the look and feel of the 1920s, for the silent movie.The screen opens with the late 1920's with an instance of picture within another movie. That movie gives us an introduction about the lively movies which shall comprise of emotion, comedy, horror and all aspects which an ideal movie should consist to become a hit. The artist and the team watch the movie behind the screen in silence clearly delivering the message of his story is next to be screened in silence. The success of the movie being shown brings immense happiness to the artist, and when he shares it with media and press, introduces the 'Miller', who shares it along with him. Jean Dujardin-The artist makes small efforts to make her special with the help of beauty spot for her appraisal in the cinema industry. Meanwhile the introduction of the talkies starts slowly replacing the silent movies. Man is a social animal and has to sustain and adopt to the changes if he needs to survive. But the George valentine- The artist refuses the change , hence forth starts finding his down days, but Miller accepts the changes and turns successful.This nonacceptance of change supported by symbolism is very well depicted in the form of stairs when they both confront each other with climbing Miller and descending artist. The symbolism of psychology is also extended by the director when artist dreams of feather falls from great height, symbolizing his fall, but on the contrary the non egoistic nature of the feather of being light weight and flexible remains unnoticed by artist. The artist tries to overcome others in the competitive world by his own production to produce 'tears of Love' which gives him only tears and not love bringing him to 'The End'.He gradually gets isolated represented by walking across market shop named 'lonely star'. The 'guardian Angel' for him arrives in the form of Peppy Miller saving all his assets. Finally, the shadow of him which is also fed up of his failures walks out of screen leaving him alone. He starts burning all his ego which he finds in his own films. The last attempt of his killing ego which landed in in killing himself is stopped by Miller leading to the dramatic happy ending.This movie can be compared with two already existing Indian movies. 'The dirty picture' which also represents the fall of a person because of pride. And the second one is 'Pushpakavemana' which is a silent movie enacted by Kamalhasan whose performance leads The artist. I also appreciate the Foley artists for providing the good sound effects which is highlighted as it is a silent movie. The actors effort of a blank and Blanca of 1927-1932, a five year story is thus satisfactory as it only of symbolism of 'pride ruins the game'.",6,1,3,14 March 2012
Pulp Fiction," The Review
","This is what is called entertainment...!!!!. The movie moves with a touch of comedy. The story belongs to a typical English movie which has the beginning repeated in last part of it regaining all of its connections to set it right and provides the understandability to its viewers. But the negative part of it is that Mr.Director could have utilized the excellent work of eminent actors like John Travolta and Samuel Jackson to convey some true message which the society is in need of.Unlike any other movies like Shaw shank Redemption or Black Swan, people who expects something strong message, will surely be disappointed. But Of course a set of viewers who shall expect only comedy shall get their target set reached.",5,1,2,29 December 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," The Conceptual Review.
","The story opens with a non intelligent man who is committed to make a crime, in the mid of 19th century. The story is furnished with the solid voice of Mr.Morgan Freeman who narrates the story throughout the movie. Though the story has a very slow pace which makes it a bit boring, it has a fine twist in the end which clears all the memory of that boring bit , to turn in an interesting end. The concept of the movies which works out to be a backbone of the story is that the prominence of intelligence along with the persistent effort which brings success to any man. The Director Mr. Frank brings out three interesting characters Boyd,Andy and Brooks who contrasts each other in their approach to life. Brooks in spite of the spending nearly half of his life in prison fails to make an identity of his own,while Andy tries to make his identity by giving some risks, while the Boyd plays safe to join the winner. The resources were available to all the prisoners at equal band, but the approach of each individual made a difference. The library project, and chess pawns carving symbolizes the way the Andy was creative. Brooks had already lost his 'hope' in life(Symbolized by crow liberated by the way he is liberated from the prison). Andy always believing in himself and Boyd neither there nor here with both the intentions. The effort of twenty years of Andy gets him the victory the way he expected causing enough damage to the one who dominated him (Norton) for twenty years. The director clearly conveys the message 'Hope is a good thing and Good thing never dies'. His judgment cometh and that right soon.",8,0,0,12 December 2011
X-Men: First Class," The Conceptual Review
","The story begins with the mid of nineteen forties where the heat of second world war was in the end. The people are in the heat of survival from the German Monarchy. The story opens with the prisoner in such a camp who is non other than the young, kid Magnito. The death of his mother forces him to develop more fierce and agony in his mind set. After the years passes by, he meets his good friend Mutant with intelligence, Professor Charles Xevier. The Story also gives a good insight about the Development of Mutants from the child hood of professor and Eric(Magnito).Coming to the conceptual points, it seems that the director Mathew Vaughn wants to convey the messages of any modifications or changes to any physicality(Proud of being Mutant), other than what nature has provided to us brings harm and not charm. Professor X tries to elevate the people(Non mutants or humans) as they are in the advanced state of the life stack structure. Professor X also tries to convince Magnito that sweet memories are more powerful than agony. Magnito when asks Charles to shoot him, he denies it indicating that Goodness always persists and cannot be changed by agony(Symbolized by Magnito) while the reverse is only possible. When the Humans when starts reverting against the mutants (after the understanding between the USSR and America), its Professor who stops the process of attack and follows 'Ahimsa' rather than killing the humans. The story begins with young Eric being drowned with agony and ends with he himself being the owner of agony and pain. Magnito also breaks the unity among the mutants in the process of achieving that dominance over others by fierce.The power of mutants is been overwhelmingly showed in the movie. The camera work and the editing is simply superb!. Satya Meva Jayate-Truth(Goodness) Always Trumps.",7,0,1,6 December 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Conceptual Review
","The movie depicts the death of the ego of the person and hence I believe the name is made as deathly hallows. It answers all the questions of the author put forth in the beginning of story of HP. It describes that the ego is of 7 categories(Crux). Out of them few of the Crux is present in a student which has to be destroyed by the Teacher(Dumbledore). Few destroyed by friends(Destroyed by Ron).And the rest has to be killed by the enemies(Voldemort). The strength of the confidence has to be taken by the aid of the Knowledge of the Teacher by either conversation or the gathering of the good will to prepare ourself to destroy the evil may be either external or internal. Story also depicts that when the evil in oneself raises to such an extent that it can cause the death of him, then its always power of knowledge which embodies to survive him(HP surviving after the deathly blow). I think the direction has brought the immense truth of the feelings of the message that is needed to be conveyed by the story writer. The existence of life of ego(Voldemort) within HP, is made felt of the presence by the scar on his forehead. The scar could have been on any other part, but still its on the forehead indicating that ego raises as he develops,grows. At the point in life hp reaches a stage where he needs to tackle his enemy Voldemort(ego) where the ego itself kills its mere existence in the Harry, then the Knowledge of DumbleDore flows through him for the perish of voldemort, to attain the state of Bliss.Knowledge Possesses the overwhelming victory over Ego.",8,0,1,30 November 2011
