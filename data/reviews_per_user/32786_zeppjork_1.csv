Requiem for a Dream," just...UFF!
","What can you say after watching Requiem For A Dream? I long breathing and thanks to God for not being any of the characters in one of the most brilliant movies of the few years.A well told story with incredible performances (starting with Ellen Burstyn in her best), it deals with the things we hate about ourselves, and that takes a real courage. I still remember the scene in which Sarah tells her son how she's old and lonely: this is one of the most heartbreaking moments I've ever seen and you just want to jump into the screen to hug her and to take care of her, since her son doesn't know how...A mention apart is deserved by the wonderful score, that deals with all the insanely hurtful feelings the characters go through in a brilliant way.Jennifer Connelly is like a fallen angel, Jared Leto's character is just so stupid that you want to protect him. It seems that you'll walk out of the theater to run into one of these guys. This is a movie that shakes you, that makes you tired, sick, sad, and most important...alive.",10,0,1,15 December 2003
