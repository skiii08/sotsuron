Blade Runner 2049," A true masterpiece
","I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. That's what I said about the original Blade Runner.It was long but none of it felt wasted. It held nearly true to the iconic original yet technology escalated the visual aspects far beyond what seemed cinematically possible. The soundtrack all important was equally as mysterious and the brutality of the future was brought to the forefront in a way that didn't disappoint. Harrison Ford nailed it in his sequel roll and Ryan Gosling proved an effective successor to the beloved Daekert. Edward James Olmos was there as well however fleeting, which delighted me. I could have delivered a full 10 if it t were a bit lower tech and there had been more memorable a script. The first delivered more iconic sound bites yet for what this was I am totally blown away by each and every character and each and every gorgeous reference to the original version. A beautiful and thoughtful film and an enormous success no matter how you slice it. This deserves to be watched and studied. I have seen the original about 10 times or maybe more.",9,3,11,4 August 2019
Frost_Nixon," Leave it to Ron!
",Somehow Ron Howard makes ever project work. It's as if his direction skills would literally be a part of his DNA. I'd venture to say everything h touches turns to gold and this film is no exception. His choice of Frank Langella to play Nixon might not have been an obvious one but bad boy Frank pulls it off and leaves one convinced Nixon I s really in the room. In fact the whole cast from on down through Kevin Bacon to Sam Rockwell to Oliver Platt had me really wondering if it would flow. And by golly it did. His choice of Michaeli Sheen to play Frost was also spot on. He delivered a meticulously on target replica of the dapper David Frost which was almost uncanny. Great show. In fact jolly good!,9,0,0,10 November 2019
A Star Is Born," It will bore you to tears
",Please hear my plea. If you aren't a fan of Lady Gaga or Bradley Cooper you're better off skipping this slow moving train wreck of a melodrama entirely. It's really hard to see why they bothered making this. There's just really no point n watching a two hour long orgy of boredom. Skip it at all costs. That is the f you aren't a fan.,1,5,7,23 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Wake me when it's over!
",It's pretty amazing what star power can do. Just because the two leads are superstars doesn't mean this tired old rehash is any good. Bradley Cooper is always typecast as a debonair leading man and generally pulls it off regardless of whatever lousy script he's handed. But Gaga? Please. She should have quit while she was ahead with her music and during or after her string of hits. Poker Face and Alejandro were good tunes. But an actress she's definitely not and is simply ruining her musical legacy by performing in this contrived bore. People should do what they do best. Acting isn't for everyone.,1,0,4,5 October 2019
Wind River," Shoulda coulda woulda
","It should have been more highly paced. The dialogue and soundtrack could have been less slow, tedious and arduous. I would have liked it more if something actually took place during the course of this ridiculously boring endeavor.",1,3,9,4 October 2019
The Irishman," Hugely disappointing
","I consider myself a seasoned Scorsese fan but this was over hyped and underachieved. There is very little about this mammoth production that is memorable.There were certainly elements of greatness which are masterfully reflected in each star studded actors performances and Scorsese's flair for story telling on mixed timelines but there I wasn't a moment of the movie where I thought yes! That's the master at work.Pacino was horribly cast as Jimmy Hoffa and must have (true to his type) used the swear sucker at least 20 or thirty times. There's was just a point where that kind of language no longer propelled the script or mood. De Niro was cast correctly but his performance seemed kind of contrived.
and lackluster. I wanted more from Joe Pesci. He lacked the cruelty and ruthlessness he used to portray so-very well. It was a botched effort to keep the Casino/Goodfellas theme alive due to its lack of intensity. It was an attempt to stay true to those films but that was a mistake. There are much more compelling and exciting epics of history that Scorsese could have delved into. But since he insisted on performing the same old genre (this time focused on the Hoffa era) with the same old actors without really having his heart committed to the project which produced a 3 hour long sojourn into nothingness seems like a waste of time and money. Considering this would most likely be their last hurrah they didn't by any means go out with a bang. Just a tepid whimper. Let dead dogs lie.",1,4,7,6 December 2019
Aquaman," Good. Could have been better though.
",Unfortunately this had the potential of being a 10 but didn't measure up for two major reasons. The over use of certain techniques that made it visually impenetrable in certain crucial scenes. Sometimes less is more. That was the lesser of the two issues. The biggest problem was that Nicole Kidman was cast into a substantial supporting role. She was an exceptionally poor choice for this film.Just about any other woman would have been better in that roll. It was kind of like having Senator Gillebrand of New York play in a mythical roll. Nicole Kidman simply wasn't made for that part. It was an inexcusable casting error and ultimately should have sunk my rating to a 6. I liked Jason Momoa William Defoe and Dolphin Lundgren's performances. Period. Oh and and a particular octopus',7,0,0,19 October 2019
American Sniper," Great film except for the furloughs.
",I loved this movie except for when Chris has to deal with his boring whining wife and a bunch of people back stateside that have it cushy. Why do so many productions get bogged down by mediocre leading ladies? The best example of that being Breaking Bad in which half was marital fluff. A lot of that crap here too I'm afraid. No wonder there are so many guys deploying whenever they get the chance. They just can't stand being at home. Great modern warfare action otherwise.,8,1,20,17 February 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Word!
",I have a problem with the clothing and the script.I am always very sensitive to when the slang or clothing are misplaced in an era.Young black men didn't say ah-IE back then. Lots of baseball caps and over-sized t-shirts as well.The word alright sounded more like alright back in those days. Black urban youths started saying ah-IE pretty recently.Perhaps no longer than 10 years ago.In fact they didn't ask 'what-up'? either.They didn't use the N word as much however did in fact refer to each other as blood or sometimes even dog. It would have been a pretty good production they just gotten their 80's script down (by law).I am.When it comes to black cinema I am fairly sure I know what's good and genuine.The police use of unnecessary force and the N word are induced to prove the peril of Compton at the time. Colors portrayed it with more realism and I have to give this an overall low rating for being too contrived an poorly researched.I know i'll get my honky s whooped now and have to lick it up but word.,4,59,147,19 September 2015
Coach Carter," Too long and too formulaic
",This receives a six only because of SLJ. Otherwise this long drawn out stinker of a sports drama would have have only received 2 at best.,6,0,0,7 December 2019
