Moneyball," FANTASTIC
","Very well made film. Keeps you engaged and has tons of brilliant emotional scenes. Jonah Hill is terrific in a more serious role than I'm accustomed to seeing him in. However, it's a Brad Pitt show all the way. He nails the character and is incredible in the more confrontational scenes. One of my favourite films now",9,4,5,29 September 2019
Catch Me If You Can," The Leonardo DiCaprio Show
",DiCaprio's Performance is incredible. Spielberg does a great job utilizing his range. Tom Hanks and Walken provide solid performances also that keep the film riveting. The first half is stellar. The second half could have been shorter but overall the film ends on a good note. Fantastic film,9,1,2,28 September 2019
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Masterpiece
",Wildly fascinating. Can't take your eyes off the screen. Carrey is at his best and is a perfect foil to Kate's eccentric character. Beautiful film.,10,1,1,20 September 2019
The Social Network," Clever
","Overall, this was an entertaining and well made film. The narrative structure keeps you engaged. There is a lot of detail about the creators of Facebook and it's fascinating. The actors do a great job for the most part. Andrew Garfield's Performance is inconsistent at times but he nails the emotional scenes. Eisenberg creates a very interesting character. Timberlake does a good job in his supporting role, but the character is quite generic. The film at times became boring especially in the second half where too much time was given to the other part of the story about Harvard connect. Solid film overall",8,1,1,28 September 2019
The Godfather," Worth the hype
","It's difficult watching old films retrospectively and understand why they are so acclaimed. But, The Godfather lives up to the hype. The dialogues are outstanding. The story is captivating. And the performances are extraordinary. Michael Corleone's transformation is quite riveting. Al Pacino was wonderful. Marlon Brando is also amazing as Don Corleone. The film was slow in some aspects but overall it was an incredible film.",9,0,0,22 September 2019
