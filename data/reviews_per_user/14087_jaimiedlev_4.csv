The New World," Not worth the time it takes to see it
","Let me start off by saying I like artsy movies. Movies with subtitles, ambiguous endings--I can take it. Bring it on. I also like shots of nature. Give me grass, sky, birds, whatever you got, I usually like it.HOWEVER, when I rented this movie, I had a horrible flashback to 'The Thin Red Line' before I even got to the counter at Blockbuster. I went to the theatre to see it, shortly after I saw 'Saving Private Ryan', thinking it would be a thoughtful war movie. I was ready to see a movie like that...But 'The Thin Red Line' is not that movie. It was a horrible movie filled with tall, lush, waving grass. I know this because that is where the camera sat pretty much the whole bloody time. I also remember not being able to understand what people were saying. In this day and age, the audio should not sound like crap, and I have no idea why it did.So back to'The New World.' It is another slow, tedious movie with very little emotional involvement by actors who are, at times, almost impossible to hear. Yes, many artsy shots. Plenty of nature. But the story cannot be communicated by hand motions, soulful eyes and fuzzy eyebrows (yes Colin--that means you!).And the soundtrack was so weak. Who said that a symphony blaring over all the action is a good idea? Whoever had that bright idea should not be encouraged to do THAT ever again. And speaking of things never to do again, I am adding watching movies directed by this Malick fellow to my own personal 'Don't Do' list. Giving blood, watching paint dry--these things would be more interesting.Boo. That's all I can say about this movie.",2,1,5,4 September 2006
Marie Antoinette," Loved it! But don't look for a lot of depth...
","I love French history. I've been to Versailles, and I have tried to imagine what it must have been like to be Marie Antoinette, living in her Petit Trianon and her little hamlet....what kind of person would need to create such a world for herself? What could she have been thinking? I didn't admire her, but I have always been curious as to how she could be so obtuse, and, along with her husband, so blind and politically inept.What I have always come up with kind of meshes with the portrayal in this movie: she married young and naive, then, isolated in her luxurious bubble, progressively lost touch with her people and responsibilities. Not everyone cares about those type of questions, but clearly some of us do. I found it a fascinating character study.Also, I really appreciated the fact that this was a woman's movie. It shows perfectly the loneliness and feelings of defeat Marie Antoinette must have felt in a new country, unable to fulfill her husband's family's expectations by producing an heir. It shows her completely devastated by her first real sexual passion, and enraptured by motherhood. Her friendship with the King seemed true to life, born out of their shared isolation and the shared burden of royal responsibilities. She seemed vulnerable and real, despite the her extraordinary circumstances, and I thought Kirsten Dunst did a fine job (though she was far to pretty and too skinny to be Marie Antoinette--but I forgive them that!).Don't get me wrong. I don't think this is a true to life portrayal. The best part of the movie was the visuals. The parties, food, the beautiful people....I loved the the way becoming a Queen (and gaining some autonomy) allowed her to grow to be a new person. She became a decadent libertine, falling in love, indulging in food and drink and dress. Anyone who has ever visited France and seen those gilded interiors has wondered what it was like to properly enjoy them. Watch this movie--see these parties--now you know! I watched this movie with two other women/girls (we are in our late 20's), and it was the perfect girly fix. It made us all want to get all be-ribboned, curl and tease our hair, and giggle about how cute Count von Fersen was while eating bon bons. If that is what you are hoping to get out of this movie, you will not be disappointed--like us!",9,1,3,30 October 2006
Troy," Not bad, but not so good either.
","Umm, I saw this movie last night and they even made us fill out a Neilsen survey regarding it afterwards, but I can't give it a great review (not that our surveys gave us much room to review it).Where are the Gods? Without the soap opera background of the gods, this movie makes much less sense. Without the competition for the golden apple, and aphrodite's meddling with Helen and Paris, they just seem like a bunch of spoiled kids. 'Whoops, bro, I brought this chick back with me from Sparta.' I mean, really. What kind of statecraft is that? It means more that the goddess of love has made Helen's defection fate instead of a stupid accident.I also feel bad for the tons of High School students who may never read the Iliad and may never know WHY Achilles' was so invicible and and WHY an arrow in the ankle killed him when nothing else could. It's implied his mother is a nymph (not that the word is even used) but the story of his ankle is never explained. I think this movie would have been much better in two parts, with a better screenwriter. I mean, I loved this story when I read it--it was like an ancient potboiler I couldn't put down. I couldn't believe Helen and Paris were in love at all, and that was the start of this whole war. Without believing that, the rest of the movie seems a little hollow.On the positive side, the fight scenes were great. Just what I needed to see about ancient warfare--no fancy schmancy fake stuff, just men actually fighting face to face with very little of that computer generated crap that is going around nowadays. Some skill here for sure.And Eric Bana is great! I find him believable in almost everything I see him in. The only TRULY three-dimensional character in the movie (too bad the women didn't have the opportunity to flesh out there characters like he did). After this, I'd watch him at the opening of an envelope. Too bad one man and some nice fighting scenes can't save this movie.
I would buy the DVD, though...as long as I could mute certain stupid speeches, ffd through the scenes with the long lost Hansen brother (I mean Patroclus) and learn to get over the lovely tie dyed mu mus (I know blue is a royal color and that they wore tunics, but COME ON).Anyhow, that's my two or three cents.",Null,2,4,15 May 2004
Empire Records," Wow--This movie has certainly become dated
","I remember when this came out--it was 1995 and I had just graduated high school and was entering university. Everyone I spoke to who had seen this movie at that time really liked it, but I thought it looked totally lame, so I never saw it.Fast forward to last night, when I did! Owch! It was so bad. Worst of all, the music, the clothes, all that stuff--I wore the little minis, the belly shirts, the big boots, dated boys with skater haircuts--now I know how my mom felt when she looked back into the '70's and realized that the Farrah Fawcett hair and big owl glasses were not the height of style.Plus the plot on this movie was weak, weak, weak. If there EVER was a place where people could work and this kind of adolescent s**t went on, even in the mid-nineties, I would guarantee they would get fired. What kind of manager puts up with this drama? And to have an employee have sex with a guest in a closet AT WORK? Classy! Dancing with your shirt off in the aisles? Woo-hoo! Sounds professional to me! Why not shave your head at work before your shift--and leave all your hair in the sink? Yay! But I guess I perhaps missed seeing this in the window where it might have been relevant to me. I hope that teenagers today realize that someday they are going to look back someday and see just how silly their fashions (hello 80's new wave! Wait--there's nothing new about it) will look with 12 years distance. This movie takes whatever coolness that existed in the time period and encapsulates it into a sitcom-esquire music video. So I do have to say, Booo.On a horrible note, this movie brought home the fact that Renee Zellweger has NEVER BEEN YOUNG. Liv Tyler and I are the same age (29) and I don't think that she looks much different, which is a good thing. Renee Zellweger looks like a less pruney version of herself, but definitely not a teenager! Don't waste your time on this crap! See 'Kids' or even 'Swingers' if you want a cooler mid-nineties vibe.",3,5,16,15 January 2007
