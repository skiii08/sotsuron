Catch Me If You Can," So very dissapointed...
","I am a huge fan of Mr Spielberg. I love movies and actually like to learn a lot about movies I watch. Knowing that this movie had great reviews everywhere and has also been a huge box-office hit, I thought it would be great. This is why I ran to see it on the first day it was released here in Greece. I can not teel you how dissapointed I am. And it is not only me, but everybody in the screening were bored to death! If it was half the time it might have been much better. Really sorry Mr Spielberg but don't do this again. Minority Report was also long, but it was great!!!! Hope next time I will see something worthwhile!!!",5,1,4,28 February 2003
Minority Report," Mr Spielberg does it again
","Before actually seeing this movie, I couldn't really imagine that Spielberg would be able to reach his 'Schindler's List' level. I am not a big fan of Cruise anyway so I was a bit prejudiced about the outcome. However the movie is great and unique. It is one of these movies that really make you think after leaving the screening (like 'Amelie' does in a completely different way). Beautiful movie, perfect directing, good editing and inspiring movie. Maybe it should have been somewhat shorter and have more action scenes. Going for next years oscars is certain anyway. Don't miss it and ...keep running.",10,0,0,12 October 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," WHO COULD BE BETTER TO PLAY CAPTAIN SPARROW THAN JOHNNY DEPP?
","OK, the movie was GREAT. A bit tiring though. MR VERBINSKI could have cut off about 20 minutes. Very funny indeed. NICE OPTICAL EFFECTS: Especially the scene underwater where the pirates-skeletons attack the ship! BUT MR. DEPP IS ALL YOU NEED TO SEE IN THE MOVIE. HE IS ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE. GO SEE THE MOVIE, EVEN FOR MR. DEPP ALONE. 8 OUT OF 10 CAN'T WAIT FOR NUMBER 2!!!",Null,0,0,18 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," OK, this was great but...
","OK, Mr Jackson has done it again. A great film, much better than the first one. But... the only new and really exciting stuff here is the Golum (which is unbelievable and is getting an Oscar for sure this year) and the war scene during the last hour (which is magnificent and breathtaking). Other than that it is same oh same. And why is the ending so bad? See you next year on the 17th of December for the grand finale!!!!! 8 out of 10 guys (it really should have been better)",8,0,0,18 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Please Mr Cuaron, make the third one SHORTER!!!!!
","OK it is a good film. The special effects are actually great!!! Acting is good, Mr Branagh especially but... why did it have to be so long??? Mr Colombus, if it was half an hour shorter, it would have been quite a masterpiece. I also think that it was quite a violent film, not one that children under 10 years old should be allowed to see.",Null,0,1,30 November 2002
Bruce Almighty," NOT SO BAD BUT NOT SO GOOD EITHER
","Since I first saw the movie's trailer on the Internet I  was eagerly expecting to see Bruce Almighty. I even downloaded the trailer on my hard disk because I found it to be brilliant. However, the movie sucked!!! There are about 10 to 12 jokes overall throughout the movie. About half of those jokes are in the trailer!!! And what is with all this drama towards the end? There was so much potential with such a good idea. Imagine Jim Carrey trying to save the world from various disasters! Instead of something really hilarious, we have a romantic - melodramatic ending which serves nothing. As if he was going to leave Mrs Aniston and stay alone. And what is the point of all this box office success worldwide? Did people really like this? Sorry, not my taste. 4 out of 10",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
