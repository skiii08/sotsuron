Iron Man 3," Less Iron, more Panic
","One of the most anticipated films of the year has done what few expected -- surprised many people. Not because of the amazing fight scenes or the evil dimensions of the bad guys, but because instead of focusing on the suits, this movie focuses on the man. Who saw that coming?! This film focused far more on Tony Stark than Iron Man, but it did not focus on the character extremely well developed over the last 2 movies, and in The Avengers. Somehow, Tony went from a confident swagger to an anxiety-ridden non-performer. Think of first love, the first fumbling, non-rhythmic, earnest but wrongfully directed energy of 1st sex, and that is what pops up here (no pun intended). Tony is his own worst enemy. Unable to coordinate moves, attacks, defenses... He is reduced to the figurative cave where he started where he has, not only himself, but mostly only himself to rely on. This being Tony, you know he can MacGyver a new suit out of a hardware store supply center and leftovers from Ikea, and it's that ingenuity that makes Tony the genius you want to see get physical. And he does! Only without the suit.Wait, you ask, where did Iron Man go? And why am I watching a Bourne Identity rip-off? A James Bond impersonation filled with Q's brain children? And here is where you see the film peel apart the layers of what makes up Tony, and what makes up Iron Man. Unlike the Congressional testimony of films past where Tony states that you can't have 'IT', referring to the suit, this film delves into the line, 'I am the suit, the suit is me'. Would Tony be as awesome with or without the suit? So at this point, you have to ask yourself, is this what you came to the movie theater to watch? Or did you want the Iron Suit replete with Tony's narcissism and genius? Luckily, the film never forgets to add humor throughout. Although Stark is at times paralyzed by anxiety, the witty banter portions of his brain do not seem to be affected. There are a serious number of one-liners that zing through the air like diamond-tipped arrows, and while your lungs are pumping out a good guffaw, your brain is shouting Shut Up, I'm going to miss the next line! Pepper Potts -- or is it Pepper Stark now? Pepper Potts-Stark? -- plays an integral role in this movie, for several reasons. But I thought she also lacked the confidence of old. Instead of the playful repartee of old, Tony and she are shackled by their love of one another. OK, so love is not a bad thing, the fact that they want to coo and apologize to one another is not a bad thing, but the sexually tense edge between them is gone.Now back to the action. The 1st three-quarters of the movie having been the anxiety-driven and comedy-filled demoralization and deconstruction of Tony's world, it's time to build it back up. Yes, it tuns out Tony is James Bond's alter ego, yes it turns out that he has a back-up plan and more than a few suits in waiting to confront the evil that caused the destruction of his world. And both Tony and Rhoadie come back with a vengeance. The sequence is exciting, eventful, and reminded me of those comic sequences where you see a row of doors on either side of a hallway and characters run left and right going in and coming out of the doors variously chasing one another or running from one another for various reasons. The suits appear left and right in front of Tony, to be worn, destroyed, discarded... We have come full circle where the suit is just a suit, but Tony Stark is Iron Man! I cannot say that I liked the finale, which I won't describe here. And I never mentioned the 'twist' because it is too important a plot point to describe. If you've not heard about the plot twist, do yourself a favor and do NOT read any more reviews about the movie until you see it. As in the movie 'Crying Game', if you know the twist, it renders much of the movie pointless. So dazzling special effects at the end, a great fight sequence... I can't say I found the ending believable, or even gripping -- no where near as much as I liked IM or IM2's finales. Certain plot points were overlooked or sent to hyperbole, others were wrapped up way too fast, but I do recommend the movie. I'll just be watching IM 1&2 more.",6,0,1,5 May 2013
Train to Busan," Fair acting and plot degenerate faster than the Zombies
","What starts off as something interesting quickly descends into just another zombie movie, where the zombies move fast and the plague turns people into zombies faster. So one chomp and evidently the zombies aren't hungry for you any more as you are one of them. Makes you wonder what all the fuss is about since all you seem to have to do is tape their mouths shut or stuff a sock into it.Virus outbreak zombie movies seem to fall into 2 camps, those with slow moving zombies and those with olympic sprinters. These are the latter. Despite epic levels of speed, they are blind in the 'just dark enough' passages. Again, makes you think all you have to do is wait for dark, I mean dusk, and duct tape them all, threat neutralized.I was willing to look over all of these shortcomings because you do find yourself caring about most of the characters presented. But then came the last 20 minutes where it was just so overdone and stupid that I had to write a review saying so. The ending is overly dramatic and totally predictable and immensely underwhelming. It really makes the previous time spent watching the film feel as totally wasted. Despite the high praise of many reviewers, I cannot echo those sentiments and think there are much better zombie movie alternatives out there.",3,3,6,27 November 2018
Cloverfield," Root canal could be more entertaining
","Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.Once again, with NYC as the target, aliens invade. Not right away, first you have to bear the brunt of mindless early 20's drunken banter and the scandal that one of them slept with another. You also have to believe one of these guys is wise enough to actually be promoted to an international vice-president's position, but to the film's credit, it never did say that daddy didn't own the company.Cue to the attack and as everyone is sanely leaving the city, the golden boy jeopardizes his group of friends, who stalwartly refuse to leave him, in order to rescue his scorned princess. Along their way they get plenty of reminders that they should turn around and run, but press on. Including a wildly unrealistic encounter with the military in which golden boy argues that despite countless thousands already dead, they should help him go get his girlfriend, but if they won't help him, then he must save his girlfriend and they can shoot him if they want to but he's going. Personally I wanted the military to knock him out, with drugs or by force, just so I didn't have to watch the movie any more, and perhaps the focus would change to something more interesting. The military, being the sweet, understanding people that they are known to be when under hostile fire from aliens, point him in the right direction and wish him much success.The only thing amazing about the film is the battery life on the video camera. And if the battery power had to continue, I was cheering the invaders on, to find this group and devour them just so I didn't have to listen to them anymore.",2,168,261,26 January 2008
The Bourne Legacy," I'd say it's more of the same but it wasn't that good
","This movie overlaps Matt Damon's Bourne and attempts to flesh out some of the reasons for the program's 'success' in Bourne and others, positing that it wasn't through massive amounts of high-quality yet unethical physical and psychological training but genetic manipulation that made the operatives such a threat. This DNA manipulation was perpetuated through the use of pills devised and created by lowly lab technicians who didn't know the extent to what the little blue pills would be used for, or the green ones, or the yellow ones... Alice in Wonderland or The Matrix proposed a better use of ingestibles.But even giving this plot line a pass, and just looking at the film itself, comparisons to Matt Damon's classic series is inevitable. This movie does not shirk from that comparison, but tries to interweave some plot points, unfortunately it also regurgitates many of the exact same scenes...with only the geography being different. But running on the roofs in Manila versus running on the roofs in Tunisia, motorcycling through narrow streets add nothing to the overall skill sets we are looking for in genetically altered and able to wage urban warfare' men and the similarities do not bode well for the capable acting skills of Jeremy Renner (he had better fight scenes in MI4: Ghost Protocol). It's been done before and it's now boring, AND Matt Damon did it better, mostly because the plot was better and really worked in his favor.Treadstone, Blackbriar, and other failed government programs are re-written here for no apparent reason. There was no true ultimate villain, there was not a series of trained operatives fighting one another, there was simply a few flashbacks, a lot of cops, security guards, some agents clearly over their head, and the pills as the major protagonists.Wait for Netflix/Red Box/cable whatever, this really isn't anywhere near the calibre of the previous Bourne movies.",6,2,7,26 August 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," Great Start, Sagging Middle, Bad Ending
","The movie was not unlike other movies where you see the good guy go rogue after rough handling by 'the system'. But I really liked the development of the characters in the beginning, and I am sure I am not the only one out there hoping that the 'Law Abiding Citizen' would be able to pull it off.Then came the middle where plot points become strained, where we have to take a few leaps of faith and leave the world of genius for one of Hollywood. OK, I'm still there, taking the ride with you.But then we get to the ending which destroys the film and makes it into brain pablum; mental oatmeal that anyone can digest but no one can get any flavor from. Mr. Genius buys several industrial areas -- but why? Only 2 seemed to be necessary for the plot. And why would Panama know the purchase prices? And down to the cent! Corporations don't need to share that information with foreign governments. Nix that link and this movie would have been more interesting. We're expected to believe a genius would leave the cleaning cart in obvious view in the hallway and right next to the area where he put the bomb? We're expected to believe the genius wouldn't have trapped his escape route. And we're expected to believe they transferred this bomb from Point A to Point B without setting it off and in record time, all while Foxx waits in the cell, and Scotty Junior brings up the rear, unseen and unheard.I wanted Foxx's arrogant character to lose his daughter, to feel what this man went through, and then I wanted him to get away with it.Anyone agree?",6,434,475,22 November 2009
