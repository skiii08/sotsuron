Antz," Forget Titanic - small is good
","This is Woody Allen as he feels about himself - definitely. An insignificant ant, the middle kid in a family of five million and named Z-4195 (Z for short),. Well, Zee, actually - it is an American ant!This film is not good because it has a thrilling storyline - it hasn't; Nor because it has a complex interwoven plot which keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the final credits - it hasn't;  Nor because it examines in ruthless detail and satirical probing, humankind in allegory - it doesn't. No, this film is good, because it is good.Telling a familiar story,  the awakening within a person (ant) of something beyond the mundane and the search for utopia (insectopia in the film), combining excellent characterisations and truly awesome visual imagery courtesy of the ever present CGI industry, works a treat. Woody Allen, sans body, is perfect, as are each of the other voice characters.  This may be one of the best things Stallone has ever done. All the voices are superb, and without the distractions of the bodies, you really appreciate them for the first time.  This is a much, much better film than 'Small Soldiers'. Nearly 5-star but not quite.There are no huge surprises; no real shocks (just one maybe); the good guys beat the bad guys; some movie and war clichÃ©s are paid tribute to along the way (including a battle scene pulled straight from 'Starship Troopers') and the final scene is epic in its smallness.   Forget Titanic - small is good.  See this one and you'll feel better for it.",Null,0,0,14 November 1998
