The Blair Witch Project," Definitely the best movie of the year...maybe the best of all time
","'The Blair Witch Project' was quite possibly the absolute scariest movie I have EVER seen.  I absolutely cannot stop thinking about it.  It was so realistic, it was scary.  Never have I seen a film with so much realism (in fact, I only found two lines in the movie that didn't sound all that real to me).This year has been a year for a lot of good movies, but NONE of them have been, or will be like 'The Blair Witch Project.'  This movie was 10 times better then 'The Matrix,' 10 times better then 'Star Wars,' 10 times better then 'Son of Sam,' and 10 times better then just about any other movie I have seen in years.'The Blair Witch Project' is worth every penny, and if there is one movie you see this Summer, this should be it.",10,1,2,9 July 1999
