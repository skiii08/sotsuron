Requiem for a Dream," Good movie, better book
","I have seen the movie and read the book (I own both by the way) and I would have to say that although this was a good movie, one should definitely read the book.There were a lot of things in the book that Darren Aronofsky ignored while making the movie, which is a major reason why I think the book is better. For instance, the quick shots in the movie of the pupils dialating, etc. disappointed me the most with this movie.  One of the reasons the book was so great was because Selby, Jr. described the heroin parties in great detail, which was the meat of the entire Harry, Marion, and Tyrone story . For Aronofsky to condense the most entertaining part of the book into quick shots to give audiences the IDEA that the characters are getting high made me feel cheated out of the full experience.Another part I was disappointed about was that Marion and Harry's love wasn't shown as well as it was shown in the book.  I have read many other reviews of this movie that agree with me on this one.  At times when the two are talking they seem rushed to me, like Aronofsky just wanted the audience to get the IDEA that they are in love.  If the Harry, Marion, and Tyrone section wasn't so rushed then I think that this movie would have been a lot better.  Even so, I still think this is the most entertaining section in the movie; too bad it was ignored.However, the part that was not rushed and, to me, seemed drawn out was the Sarah Goldfarb section.  Her's seemed like Aronofsky's favorite story and he explains it well (often exactly like the book) although there are some parts that seem more long-winded than effective.  The part where the people come out of the T.V. could have been a lot better if the T.V. characters didn't break into a Conga-line (or however you spell it).  For me it made the scene seem more fun than scary and disturbing, and watching this part more than twice is liable to cause the fast-forward button to be pressed.This totally sounds like a bad review, but this really is a good movie for someone who didn't read the book first.  If I subtract my biases for the book then I have a very good movie sitting in front of me.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected after reading the words first, which is probably a normal reaction to everyone who has read the book before seeing the movie. As a whole I recommend this movie to anyone who likes different movies and does not get offended easily, but the book is a must no matter what the circumstances.",9,0,0,15 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Nervous twitching
","Okay, I'm not sure if this is because of the crap that went down last night afterward, but my heart is still beating like crazy after my first viewing of Kill Bill.  This movie was completely insane, evil, traumatizing, and excellent!  Some director is really gonna have to pull something out of his @ss to top this movie off within the decade, and I've only seen the first half!  I just have to say that part 2 has a LOT to answer to, and I trust Quentin and everything, but this movie was just larger than life.Some great parts (****WARNING!  MAY BE SPOILERS****):The very beginning where Bride gets shot in the head surprised the crap outta me.The evilest moment in this movie is when Vivica Fox all of a sudden blows a hole right through her kid's cereal box at the Bride.  That was sooo surreal, it still feels like it didn't really happen.There were a few great songs in this movie especially the one that was simply whistled by Elle before it was time to finish Bride off.  There was one more song (aside from the trailer music) that was so cool but I can't remember where it was in the movie.  It kinda sounded like that Tears for Fears song 'Head Over Heels.'  What are these song titles?  I want them!The whole anime sequence was just mind-boggling.  I'm not much of an anime watcher, but I've never seen the camera shake like that in any animated sequence.  The best part was when the girl, under the bed, 'Whimpered' and shoved the actual word that floated out right back into her mouth so they wouldn't hear her.  The guy in the white cloak who kicked that cigar butt into the alcohol was one of the evilest looking villians I've ever seen in animation.The whole sword master part was hilarious!  And that was one of the most natural conversations I've ever heard in any movie to date.  It had a lot to do with the writing and acting as well, especially the 'Now you're making fun of me' line by the Bride.  I know we've all heard chicks say that in real life before, but movies just don't like to be realistic I guess.Hilarious part...'Silly rabbit--' '--tricks are for--' '--kids.' Almost like one person saying 'Catch' and the other saying '22.'And finally, the moment I realized that this movie was unbelievably larger than life was when all of the kung-fu guys were lying in a huge mass of blood and lost limbs whimpering (hehe) and moaning while Bride stood on the balcony to curse them all.Lucy Liu was beautiful in this movie. Great.  Just great.  Everyone go see it.  Support the talented man that is Quentin Tarantino for all of his great work.P.S. If one more person, regardless if they've see it or not, says this film is 'Croutching Tiger Hidden Matrix' I will slug them because they are obviously jealous of all the attention Quentin deserves.  They feel perfectly fine paying 7 bucks multiple times to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle though.",10,0,1,11 October 2003
Pulp Fiction," The worst review I have ever written
","I have seen this movie many times and I still haven't figured it all out because it is a very complex movie.  I could go on and on about hidden plot meanings that I interpreted, but that would take up too much space so I am just going to write about the bigger things.I think the greatest thing about this movie is that in the end it made me feel like I was watching more than one movie.  This film is almost 3 hours long and I wasn't bored for one minute, and it didn't even feel like 3 hours to me.  I also have to reward Quentin for his writing because he doesn't hide anything from his audience, he places them in the character's shoes and has them follow their every step.This is the worst review of a movie I have ever written because there is not much I can say about this movie.  It is freakin' awesome because it is such a long, enthralling, and enjoyable ride.  Other than empty comments on this movie there is not much more I can say other than it is very entertaining, although it is not for everyone.  Quentin Tarantino's movies are very selective with the audience it draws in so if you don't  like this movie then you might as well give up on this man because his movies will never be normal.  I, for one, love Quentin's films because he is great at writing realistic, funny, and cool dialogue.  So, of course I recommend this movie to everyone because I think it is great and we should support good filmmakers such as Quentin and boost the demand for more 'different' movies. By the way, the whole non-linear thing works because it is related to the style of the movie:  The past meets the present.  As for the references to the past we have Jules's 70s style afro, the film's older music soundtrack, the Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant, the outdated audio equipment at Mia Wallace's house, and various other things.  As for the present references we have The Wolf's modern style Camero, Jules and Vincent's cell phones, the style of Honey-Bunny and Pumpkin's clothes, the drug dealer's girlfriend and friend's style in the beginning, and various other things.  The film looks like it takes place in the past but we can clearly see that it takes place during the present, so it looks like the characters are caught in a time warp.  Since the film is non-linear then the audience too finds themselves in a time warp.  In that way I think that the storytelling has relevance for those who do not believe so.     P.S. I have read many reviews on this movie about people commenting on the excessive violence and explicit language in the movie, which are not things to be singled out about this movie.  A lot of you know-it-alls out there don't like these kinds of movies because you think that the movie wouldn't sell if the bad language and violence were taken out, which is not true. There are a lot of stupid and unimportant movies out there that a lot of people like because they are traditional and do not make the audience think. Just because a director like Quentin decides to tell a story in a different way does not automatically make it stupid.  Different is not stupid.  This movie needs violence and the like because that is what gangsters do, and the style of the violence makes the movie interesting and unpredictable.  Action movies are the ones that strive for violence because that IS the plot, and there are many of you who would die without your car jumping off a 10 story building and staying in one piece.  I am just sick of people hating movies because they are different because that just means less good movies for me to watch.",10,0,1,16 February 2003
Bruce Almighty," Two thumbs DOWN!
","I am shocked and must ask 4 questions about this movie:  1) How the heck did the get an $81 million budget?  2) How did the average user rating for Bruce Almighty on the IMDB make it up to 6.4?  3) Has Jim Carrey lost it?  4) Why the heck did I pay back my friend the 6 bucks my friend lent me to see it?I have seen a lot of really good movies, and I've seen a lot of really bad ones.  When looking at my experience with the movies and after seeing the first 20 minutes of Bruce Almighty I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Now it's one thing to have a bad/cliche storyline in a movie, but at least the majority of them are enjoyable.  Crossroads was an awful movie, but at least I could sit there and make fun of the characters to myself (and plus, Britney Spears alone in the movie made it worth my wasted time).  Bruce Almighty was just obnoxious and embarrassing!  There were so many times when Jim Carrey (one of my favorite comedic actors) would try out his goofiness and fail miserably.  There is nothing more humiliating than a comedy that isn't funny.To make it even worse the movie pretty much offended me.  A normal movie in this type of cliche where the main character obtains a special power and has himself some fun with it and realizes it's more work than he/she thought in the end--teaching them a valuable lesson in life--would at least make me think to myself 'I wonder what I would do if I had those powers.'  I could not say that throughout the movie I was daydreaming about becoming God because that is just evil, and so is the way it is portrayed in this movie. Jim Carrey becoming God?  Walking on water?  Parting his soup?  I am definitely not a religious freak but I still say BLASPHEMY!  Now I wouldn't think this film was blasphemous if it actually had a point, purpose, or if it was even entertaining, but all this movie did was just play.  The writers were probably sitting around one day trying to think of a way to write a cliche screenplay with a new premise, and decided it would be fun to PLAY God for once.  I wouldn't care if I saw a movie that encouraged the worship of Satan as long as it had a point and/or a message.  So I am offended not because a normal guy challenges my beliefs of God's ultimate power by becoming him, I am offended that the filmmakers toyed around with this subject (very poorly, I have to remind you, and without any hint of entertaining material) just to please Hollywood studios, say they worked with Jim Carrey, and to make a chunk of change while they're at it.In the end I give this movie zero stars for not only having a crappy storyline, but by the lack of comedic/entertainment value, and by taking the subject of 'God' and exploiting it disrespectfully, illogically, and completely half-@ssed.",Null,0,1,14 September 2003
Trainspotting," Freckin' awesome!
","There are very few movies that I believe are worth something, and Trainspotting is one of them.  I had gotten many recommendations to watch this movie, so I watched it for the first time.  Before watching it I was feeling indifferent because it didn't sound like a very good movie, but I was way wrong.  My first viewing was difficult because I didn't understand the Scottish dialect, but I still managed to tell my friend that it was significant (which is a good thing because I could probably count the number of significant movies I have seen on one hand).A few months passed by and I kept thinking about the movie, and one day when that same friend of mine wanted to rent a movie I said, 'If you get anything, get Trainspotting.'  So we did and the second time I saw it I knew that it was definitely on my list of favorite movies of all time.I ended up buying the DVD because I might as well not even have a collection without Trainspotting.  I watched it over and over and loved every minute of it.  I would have loved to see a sequel to it, but it wouldn't be appropriate so I tried figuring out what it is I wanted out of this movie. I watched it so many times because I wanted to re-live the experience over and over again, and then it hit me.  I wanted to BE Mark Renton.  I wanted and still want to live the life of a Scottish junky like the characters in this film.  That is the effect the movie had on me.  This wasn't a film that showed me the scum and destruction of this world, it showed me that skinny sickly slackers with nothing to lose are awesome!  I would love to live a rebellious day in the life of one of these characters.  I may not want to become a heroin junky in the future but I would love to live in Scotland and be part of that culture.The best line in the movie-->'So why did I do it?  I could offer a million answers, all false.  The truth is that I'm a bad person.'",Null,0,0,9 February 2003
