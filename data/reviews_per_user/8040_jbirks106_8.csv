3:10 to Yuma," Solid Western morality tale
","'Unforgiven' it ain't, but '3:10 to Yuma' is as close to a modern Western classic as we've seen since. Crowe and Bale are completely convincing in their roles of rogue outlaw and the man who's determined to bring him in. Crowe gives great depth to the Ben Wade character, though his actions in the last half-hour are a bit of a stretch. Bale, likewise, captures the haunted, desperate Dan Evans brilliantly.The audio commentary by director James Mangold is quite good. Director commentaries are a mixed bag -- many times the commentary is either bogged down in minutiae or lacking in objectivity -- but Mangold acknowledges his debt to the earlier film (50 years old at that point) and in general provides interesting details about the shooting process.",8,0,1,12 October 2013
Alexander," Interminable, ponderous, absurd, occasionally hilarious
","Reading these reviews -- well, some of them, I don't have all day you know -- it seems folks either really love this film or really hate it. I find absolutely nothing to love here. The movie is far too long, the plot has no cohesion at all (strange for a historical epic), and most critically the star is utterly miscast and over his head. I don't know what Colin Farrell did to deserve top billing in a $150M project. He's a perfectly fine actor, but perfectly fine actors are a drachma a dozen. 'Alexander' needed a big swinging dick to fill this role. Farrell looks like a guy from Duran Duran. Angelina Jolie is certainly A-list material, but her role is too fragmented and, quite frankly, her performance is so ludicrous that it supplied the only real enjoyment I derived from this whole mess. To see her literally covered with snakes and intoning absurd lines like 'My son you must face your glorious destiny' with an out-REG-uss ack-SENT that was once the sole province of James Bond villains. The fact that Jolie and Farrell can't be more than a few years apart in age completes the fiasco.Another point of hilarity, this time courtesy of Stone: during the Gaugamela battle scene, Alex is heard to order his troops 'back and to the left!' not once, but twice.",2,4,5,29 May 2015
Concussion," Melodrama masquerading as expose
","This is a well-made film about an important subject. Unfortunately it degenerates into a polemic against the National Football League, elevating its principal character from forensic brain specialist to crusading hero to martyr, all the while taking liberties with basic facts in service of a narrative. One such basic fact concerns Mike Webster, on whom the first portion of the movie focuses. Webster was the victim of child abuse with mental illness on both sides of the family. He had a history of substance abuse and depression. This was before he ever played a game with the Steelers. And while Landesman encourages us to believe Webster killed himself, he actually died of a heart attack. Another basic fact involves Cyril Wecht, portrayed superbly by Albert Brooks. A keen-eyed observer may detect the JFK connection; Wecht has been a prominent assassination conspiracy theorist (Landesman's previous film 'Parkland' is devoted to the assassination). Here we see Wecht being arrested and are left to assume that it's the NFL retaliating for Omalu's research. In fact Wecht was charged well BEFORE that research was published, or even known to the NFL.dCentral premise of the film: repeated concussions cause CTE. This is asserted throughout, with Omalu expansively blaming football for the players' deaths. The problem is that there is no scientific basis for this claim. According to the British Journal of Sports Medicine, 'there are no published epidemiological, crosssectional or prospective studies relating to modern CTE... Owing to the nature of the published studies, being case reports or pathological case series, it is not possible to determine the causality or risk factors with any certainty. As such, the speculation that repeated concussion or subconcussive impacts cause CTE remains unproven.' In short, the plural of anecdote is not data. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that NFL players live LONGER than average.I realize it's too much to ask a Hollywood picture to eschew emotional appeals, narratives and love stories, even when they do harm to the movie's impact. But this movie would have been so much better served by hewing to the truth.",4,3,5,10 June 2017
Taxi Driver," Terrific Special Edition
","Any fan of this film, or of film in general, owes it to himself to get the 2-disk SE, which was released in 2011. Not only is the picture quality significantly improved over previous versions, but the extras are simply amazing.'Making of' docs are fairly standard in sets like this, but most have a perfunctory feel. 'Taxi Driver' includes a 70-minute documentary truly deserving of the word, a feature film unto itself, with interviews of every significant actor. Other extras include photos, storyboard and advertising materials, giving an almost anthropological completeness to the package. Separate commentary tracks from screenwriter Paul Schrader and academic type Robert Kolker round out the package.Simply put, it's a carefully thought-out package that is worthy of the film itself, maybe the best I've ever seen.",10,0,1,25 July 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Great acting but distracting structure
","The original 'Godfather' created the template for every mob movie thereafter. Gangsters previously were either celebrated or loathed, but never well understood. Then 'Bonnie and Clyde,' released five years earlier, attempted to humanize criminals by showing not only the spectacular bank heists and subsequent car chases, but also the mundane, banal and tragic nature of such a lifestyle. But B&C weren't Mafiosi. 'Godfather' portrayed the Mafia as a unique and fascinating subset of society. Along with the requisite violence, we see the gangsters with their families, at weddings and christenings, or planning a multiple murder over takeout Chinese. Most of all, it is a portrait of Michael Corleone, the war hero and prodigal son, who returns to the fold and ends up running the show.In 'Godfather II' Michael is running much more than a crime family. He's a big shot whose son's first communion is celebrated by senators and other luminaries. As Hyman Roth famously tells him, 'Michael, we're bigger than US Steel.' But his personal life is disintegrating. Michael has promised Kay, his wife, that he's 'going legitimate' but it's clearly not working, and we wonder about the sincerity of the promise. The family narrowly escapes a hit following the communion ceremony, initiating a series of retributions that we know will not stop. Meanwhile, a series of flashbacks to Sicily show Vito, the paterfamilias, as a young boy who himself survives an assassination attempt (his mother is not so lucky), sails to America and sets himself up as a street hood who through guile and guts takes over the neighborhood rackets. He is respected and feared, but he's not without compassion. When his wife tells him of a friend who's having trouble keeping her apartment, Vito intervenes on her behalf. He didn't have to do it, and there's really nothing in it for him.This is the central contrast in the film. Vito is undoubtedly a criminal who'll kill anyone in his way, but there's a humanity behind his calculations. Michael, who disdains his criminal family at the beginning of 'Godfather I' and shows a naïve, even playful side, has lost his humanity by the end of that picture, and that hardness only deepens in 'Godfather II'. The only glimpse we see of that earlier man occurs in a scene with his mother, in which he asks how his father kept the family together. It's a rare example of self-doubt in an otherwise scheming, manipulative and deeply cynical personality. When he learns that his weak older brother, Fredo, helped set up the botched Lake Tahoe hit, he permits him to live, but only while their mother lives. By the end of the movie Michael has lost his family (his natural one), and any remnant of human feeling.The structure of 'Godfather II' is problematic for me. The repeated flashbacks to the young Vito, while engaging, interrupt the flow of the film. That this is a strategic error on Coppolla's part was demonstrated when one of the networks aired a miniseries, 'The Godfather Saga' a few years after the sequel. It took a strictly chronological approach: beginning with scenes of young Vito in Sicily from 'Godfather II' and then continuing with 'Godfather I'. (Some scenes were edited or omitted entirely, in conformance with network TV standards, while others not appearing in the films were included.) This merging of narratives conveyed all the power of both movies without the distracting flashback device to form a much more coherent whole. What to say about the cast of 'Godfather II'? It is uniformly excellent. DeNiro's Vito is pitch-perfect. Keaton's performance as Kay is striking in its nuanced disaffection as she grows to realize that her husband has no inclination to go straight. Dominic Chianese gives a strong performance as Johnny Ola, a quarter-century ahead of Junior Soprano. Michael V. Gazzo, as the harried, doomed Frankie Pentangeli, won a supporting-actor nod, and his might be the best performance of the film. Talia Shire, as sister Connie, shines as the floozy who -- like Michael in the first film -- finally returns to the fold.But it's Pacino and Cazale who really carry this picture. Theirs is a complex, combustible relationship: the strong, ruthless younger brother and the skittish, increasingly resentful older brother share two memorable, but radically different, scenes. In the first, Fredo has just arrived in Havana with Roth's $2 million. They repair to a street cafe for daiquiris as Michael pretends to confide in Fredo -- in fact everything he says is a lie. But Fredo is appreciative of the confidence and regrets that the two never spoke so intimately before. Later, after Fredo stupidly reveals to Michael his association with Roth and Ola, Michael severs their relationship in the harshest terms. Fredo is practically recumbent in his chair, even as he insists that 'I'm smart! Not stupid like everybody says. I want respect!' But he's not smart: he's a dead man, and everybody knows it but him. Cazale plays the pathos for all it's worth. The film ends with yet another flashback. It's Christmas, and the brothers have planned a welcome-home for the Don (never seen). Michael announces that he's joining the Army, winning congratulations from Fredo, bewilderment from Tom, and scorn from Sonny. This is evidently Michael's reverie, perhaps driven by the guilt of killing Fredo and his brutal treatment of Kay. Flash to present: Michael is seated outside his Tahoe estate, his only companions the fallen leaves whipping around his feet.It's a real tour de force, this movie. It is flawed in its conception but brilliant in its execution. I can see why many people think it's the best sequel ever, even better than the original. I just can't take it that far. It may be the best sequel, but it nonetheless suffers by comparison to its predecessor.",9,1,2,27 July 2014
Liar Liar," You know a movie was made before 9/11
","When a guy can drive to an airport, park right at the curb, head to the terminal without being molested, sneak past security by hiding in the luggage, commandeer a staircase vehicle and cut off a commercial airliner right on the runway. Today he would have been shot at every turn. Which is what I wanted to do with Jim Carrey in each scene of this wafer-thin vehicle for his tired antics. I have no problem with broad, physical comedy, but Carrey's mugging is so incessant that it stops being funny after 10 minutes and is just annoying thereafter.",3,2,5,23 June 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," Sci-why?
","When science fiction meets romantic drama in a Hollywood film, one of them almost always suffers. Writers either lack the skill to pull off the combination in a way that's mutually reinforcing and consistent, or they lack faith in movie audiences to comprehend what they're watching without lots of pace-killing exposition. In the case of 'Adjustment Bureau' we have the added Hollywood trope of political intrigue. The result is only occasionally enjoyable. The rest is just a mess.What's enjoyable are the performances of fine actors making the best of some sketchy material. Damon seemed a natural for the Norris character, even though he's done better work in the 'Bourne' films. The interplay between him and Blunt is completely authentic on screen. Mackie, Slattery and Kelly are very good also, and Terence Stamp is always good for that suave, menacing role. Unfortunately, the script seems more focused on humanizing the 'adjusters' than in filling out the other characters. Oh, there's tons of back story on Norris and his family, mostly from Mackie, but the relationship between long-ago events and present-day reality seems either forced or tenuous. Blunt's Elise character has no back story at all, and her front story is strikingly one-dimensional. The main problem, though, is simple logic. We're told that the Bureau has 'the story' and is simply 'adjusting' its characters to keep to the plot. But the plot keeps changing, apparently, and it never makes sense to me. Both Slattery and Stamp seem to have telekinetic powers (if only to make people fall down) as well as a sort of omniscience. Why, then, are they so powerless to prevent a simple kiss, or to predict that one of their agents will secretly aid Norris? Why does Stamp, after telling the Damon character why the powers-that-be can't trust lowly humans to manage their affairs through free will, minutes later send him on his way to prove his point? Why is Norris' political career so important to them? And the hat thing: why not just get an extra hat for Elise? I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are inconsistencies, plot holes and loose threads galore.One personal peeve of mine is the obligatory celebrity cameo, specifically media figures who seem to appear in every single movie with a political angle -- even when, as here, politics plays a minor part in the story. It no longer adds verisimilitude to a film, if it ever did; it's just a cliché. And a self-defeating one, because many filmgoers these days don't watch CNN and have no idea who James Carville is. In coming years nobody will even remember these people, let alone recognize them.I don't discount the problems inherent in making a story like this accessible to easily distracted audiences. I don't even want every question raised by the story answered. I just want the story to be internally consistent, to make sense on some level. It can be done, it has been done before. But not this time.",4,2,2,15 July 2014
Looper," all time-travel movies suffer
","from logic burps and flat-out absurdity, but I did like this one more than most. Bruce Willis really sells the concept, as he does in the much different, and better, time-travel film '12 Monkeys'. He doesn't resemble Gordon-Levitt very much, but the latter does a nice job mimicking Willis's by-now-familiar mannerisms so we don't notice their physical dissimilarities.Emily Blunt's performance stands out to me. The scene on the porch where she's smoking a make-believe cigarette (presaging a later post-coital scene) is a nice touch. Jeff Daniels is the least menacing crime boss I can recall, but he somehow pulls it off.Really fine cast, and a plot that doesn't have as many holes as most of the genre.",7,1,2,16 October 2014
