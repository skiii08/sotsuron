Blade Runner 2049," The Sci-fi movie...
","Blade Runner 2049 manages to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor, although not so noir and more futuristic, but the film is impeccable. The entire production of the film was well made, all detailing, from the smallest detail to the largest set. Dennis Villanuave was the best choice for this film, a director who technically manages to stand out among others, the choices of making a film without much green screen was risky, but he managed to make it the best part of the film. Although long, the film increases its rhythm to the bottom of the plot, soundtrack and sound editing help you stick to the chair in the action scenes.
 In the end Blade Runner manages to be great technically and physically, good story, good message, good actors ... THIS IS THE FORMULA FOR A GOOD SCI-FI MOVIE!",9,3,8,5 March 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Emotional, sad, funny and exciting
","Firstly, Frances McDormand is the badass among the actresses. Without it this film would not be what it is in that final product. She is perfect, the role was made for her.
 What Martin McDonagh did in the script for this movie is to clap his feet. It makes a joining of emotions in two hours. The movie is unique, at least for the movies I've seen. The story is excellent, sad but funny, emotional and exciting. But the film has a problem. He has holes in the script, although he is very good. History is imcompletas, which makes you very curious and the film only gives you chance to speculate. Apart from this big problem, the film has an excellent ending, with sadness but joy.",9,1,4,21 January 2018
Dunkirk," The magic of IMAX....
","What a good movie! Seriously, one of the best of war years, technically magnificent, stupendous no doubt. Christopher Nolan and his cast is the director for this sort of thing, all the sound coming out of the speaker seems to be so realistic and that puts you on the battlefield. Watching IMAX is the best choice, it was made for the IMAX, no movie can compare to the experience that this movie goes through. Despite not having so many dialogues, the film manages to live up to the feelings of those soldiers, both the fear and the relief of seeing the civilian boats.
Another great Nolan movie.",10,2,5,5 March 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," A great movie! One of the best movies ever made!
","The film is about a history of redemption, as the title says. The film has all the elements to be a classic and one of the best films ever made. the performances are perfect, bringing the feelings of the characters with mastery. The direction is something else that was made with all the love and affection of Frank Darabont, known for being the creator of The Walking Dead. The story, nothing more and nothing less made by the master Stephen King, is of excellence, the script well adapted with a touch of suspense, drama and comedy in some scenes. In the end, the film is one of the movies you should watch before you die.",10,0,0,26 November 2017
