The Blair Witch Project," Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time
","I bought the Blair Witch Project, on DVD, to watch on Halloween. My friends and I expected this to be a good, scary movie because of all the excellent reviews.  Instead, we found the movie boring, but it gave good headache with all the camera movement.  My brother just borrowed the movie and now wishes he never wasted the time watching it.I do have two good things to say about it:  It was original, and had a good cast, but these two positives couldn't carry the movie.  If you want a good scare, watch a classic like JAWS, The Howling, etc.",1,1,3,11 December 1999
The Matrix," One of the top 5 Best SCI-FI Movies Ever Made
","The Matrix was over the top with it's original story line, and incredible effects.  The producers did an outstanding job casting for the movie.  It is a must see for anyone who enjoys action, science fiction, comics, etc. This one is a must for a DVD collection!",10,0,1,25 November 1999
