Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes
","I watched sherlock Holmes 1 week ago.Film was directed by Guy Riche, he is my one of favorite directer.I read Sherlock Holmes books but this film has different vision.Characters have very good acting.Director used different slow motions techniques.1894's England was very authentic.Sherlock Holmes is very clever he sees every detail.he is a good fighter and he thinks very fast he knows enemies' next move Dr. Watson is his helper they solve every case together.The forest scene is very fantastic. Oxygen mask used very cleverly.",10,0,1,30 May 2012
