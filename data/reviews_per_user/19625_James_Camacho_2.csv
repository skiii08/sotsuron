Black Swan," It is an epic piece of garbage!
","This may be the most overrated film in years. Other reviewers have already hashed out its flaws, what we now have to try to make sense of his why so many people profess to like it and think it is a great movie. I actually skipped through many parts of it on my DVD player, as there is virtually no plot. It is truly one of the most pointless endeavors ever conceived. Some of the acting is a bit grating, as well. Portman's performance is one-note. Maybe it's just good at being bad?",3,3,6,26 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's awful.
","I'll add more later, just need to get this up. I'm sick.",1,69,112,15 December 2017
