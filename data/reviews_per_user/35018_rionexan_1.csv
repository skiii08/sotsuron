Mission: Impossible III," Simply great.
","I had been waiting for this one for a long time. Once the movie started, I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole time. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME! I strongly urge everybody to go and watch it as soon as possible. From start to finish, the action was exhilarating and the writing was tight. The performances of all the major characters were absolutely ace. In my mind, Mission: Impossible III trumps the first movie. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and I believe this to be the best movie this year so far. It will take a mammoth effort for any other movie to try and top this! Still, the year is far from over. Anything can happen. Nevertheless, this movie rocked.",9,2,3,12 May 2006
