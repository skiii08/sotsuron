The Monuments Men," Great new WW II perspective
",WARNING SPOILERS---WARNING SPOILERS---WARNING SPOILERSFrom the moment they landed on the beach in Normandy. You realize that their job is huge. All the pieces of art in Nazi Germany were taken from the respective owners. Their job is to turn it back. If you watch a sometimes Nat geographic you already know the real situation of the art in WW II. 100.000 pieces of art are still missing today*. From paintings to Nazi gold you get to know the plundering of Hitler. Movie Reality:From my perspective in movie reality I liked that the moment that Jean Claude Clermont was shoot he really died instead of all the happy endings. All the little scenes from the little German boy that was shooting the 'monuments men' is true. I know that from my small WW II obsession.Source: * http://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/records-and- research/documenting-nazi-plunder-of-European-art.htmlThis is my first small movie review.
