The Lobster," Nice idea worst production
","I became really interested in this movie when i read the description on IMDb. It was a creative one with lots of fantasy. So i started watching and immediately realized that this was going to be a slow movie. That is not a bad thing if the movie itself has lots of detail. And although you can clearly see that the writer tried to make it detailed and hard to understand, it is equally clear that he missed the point each time. To give an example: When they try to explain how the people are transformed to animals they say that the eyes and heart are transplanted and that the rest is custom made because it wouldn't fit. Implicating that the heart of a human would fit in a lobster or a parrot. Oke so that is how most of the movie fails. But you are curious if it gets better in the end. Because there would be potential for it to have an amazing end. But the answer to that is no. They actually made the end worse than bad. They let the main character do something illogical and then stop there. Really unsatisfying.",4,2,2,30 October 2016
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Its like you watch the real life world that good is the scenery
","In the beginning everything is kept small katniss has to adapt to the new situation and think about her role in this event. Most science fiction films like this one have always made hospitals look sterile with totally white corridors and always feels unreal like 'maybe in the future but not possible in nearly 50 years'.In the hunger games this is different the hospital and underground corridors are extremely realistic. It gives the feeling, if something like the the hunger games happened that the places you will get look exactly like this. The first quarter of the movie some of the text comes directly out of the book and they left some background information out of the movie which makes it better to read the books before you watch the movie. Jennifer Lawrence,Liam Hemsworth and josh Hutcherson all played their role very well in this movie. Though Jennifer Lawrence was just awful playing like she had a nightmare she did everything else on a high level of acting. Josh Hutcherson didn't have so much acting to do most of the film. Though in the last twenty minutes of the film he proves to be a great actor.The feelings the movie should give the audience is one of the only flaws in this movie. They didn't really get the cruelty enough in the picture and didn't made the audience really feel and thats why i didn't give this movie a 9.",8,3,17,8 December 2014
If I Stay," Only a bit more chemistry needed to become the best movie ever made
",Watching this movie it clearly has two goals. First letting you see the bond between her and every one she loves. Second slowly tearing your heart apart with all who she lost and who seem to loose her.Than to make this movie even heavier we get to see what sacrifices have been made by the people close to her and made clear how much struggles everyone gone trough. Getting to know one by one how close she was to everything she wanted.The only thing that doesn't make this movie the 1# in top 250 would be the lack of real chemistry between the two.Great movie bravo!,8,0,0,6 July 2015
Fury," Upmars to Berlin encountering lots of Nazi's
","At first it looks a pretty good movie right tank right scenery.Until the bombs strikes near them. The bombs hit the same place next to the tank though one way or another the bomb does not hit the tank.Im fine with that as long as they don't bomb the same place just centimeters from the tank time after time.Time after time the enemy should have won, they couldn't have missed even by accident. And if the good guys hit the enemy with tracer ammo there is actually fireworks exploding not just a lot of fire no only smoke and red/green fireworks.And then in the middle of the film there is this moment where you just know the Americans will make a mistake because of the horror everywhere in the movie.Probably because it are the good guys though they use euphemism. They actually turn the act of horror in a love scene just like killing is the same as giving live.The only good thing about this movie is the way they let us see the horrors that those man encountered there in 1945.",2,3,8,30 November 2014
Deadpool 2," Still way better than other marvel movies
","Oke so I thought it would be way worse than the first movie, but it wasn't. The trailer does some deception though. After the cinema trailer I was certain that some charaters would fullfil a much bigger role then they did, On the other hand it still is someting else from the rest of the marvel universe. Most Marvel movies feel the same each and every time wich is why I stopped visiting most of them.The comedy still makes everyone in the cinema litteraly laugh out loud. But the bigger buget has made the movie worse than the original. It has become less down to earth. The writers have become a bit lazy. So in the end I would advice to watch the movie but hope the changes aren't increased in a possible third movie.",7,1,5,9 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Not feeling it
","Maybe it is the 3d that i am missing. I am sure that that ruined some of the 2d graphics.I liked the older, girl and miles spiderman. The others did have potential. But this movie was way too fast! You get no time to feel empaty. All character introductions and developments are russed like crazy. This is not the way to make a giant story like this on screen.Maybe it is more like the commics but then i would have disliked this one too.Would not have spend my time watching it if i knew it would be like this.",3,3,5,1 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Missing a storyline and character development
","Went to the Film museum cinema to watch the movie on 35mm film. I do like analoge more. It feels easier to watch.This movie has great acting, props, comedy and does not really bore. The problem is that there is no real storyline for 2 hours. There are some clues to what is going to be used and what is going to happen throughout the movie but it feels repetative after 1,5 hours. 10 minutes is how long this movie isn't too mild. Great how in the part with the stuntguy and Pussycat he shows how men should behave when confronted in a situation like that.
I do not know if putting a 25 year old in the role of a minor that likes older guys was on purpose but it did add a extra layer.Throughout the movie there isn't the level of sexual freedom and use of weed one would expect during that time period in that area. It is very Mild in that way. And i do not know why because the reason this movie is therefore ratwd 16+ comes down to just 10 minutes not suited for people younger.Though as said earlier the first 2 hours felt overall repetitive, chaotic and pointless. This kept me and others from leaving the cinema statisfied.",6,1,2,20 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Just the same story again
",Oke so to be clear i think this was already the case with the other 2 movies before this one but it has to be told. The prequels were at least original in contrast to the first star wars movies. But this is just making more money out of those frist movies by putting old ideas in a new coating. It looks amazing thats true. But it is so predictive that i could have left after 20 minutes and regret nothing. If it wasn't for the 4dx i choose i would have been really disapointed. I will never go to a star wars movie again before there are enough reviews that tell me that it is new and fresh because at this moment it is a wast of money. Maybe it is Disney that does not dair to change it too much because they only care about the money and don't think about making a good original movie.,5,0,0,19 December 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," 2 hours of getting chased with nothing that amazes
",Lets make one thing clear there is no way to say this movie was great.From the first second you are put right into a hostile environment where without any argument a man gets attacked. It stays unclear why (because it stays unclear why the half living needs its blood. that half living seems fine without it the rest of the film.) Though that isn't why i grade this movie so extremely low. The thing is that there is nothing more to the film than chasing each other till some key figure dies. Every moment i was watching for something new and impressive. Butt even the guitar/drum car was not loud enough to be that. The bomb sticks are immensely overrated and multiple armies can't take out one single truck loaded with water. There I named another point of annoyance the amount of water they keep with them in a car chase. Who takes a truck full of water to a chase? They could at least have dumped some to be a bit lighter.So there is now way you can call this a good movie. It was a boring slow and monotonous action movie that does not deserve a rating above 4 stars. It's a shame that even todays critics call this a good movie.,3,79,158,5 July 2015
