Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GREAT!!!INCREDIBLE!!!PHENOMENAL!!!WONDERFUL!!!!
","What more can be said about this movie?   It was incredible and extremely fun.  As both a movie fan and a Star Wars fan I was blown away by this film. For that reason, I feel I must reply to some of the criticisms I've read about this film.  There was one person on this page who put it best in saying that anybody that disliked this movie just does not know how to have fun.  I think that is true and is a shame, because the same people who loved the original movies as kids 20 years ago have now grown up into cold-hearted, pedantic nit-pickers more interested in having a religious experience at the movies than having fun.  This movie was fun and captivating.  Many people have said that there was not much of a plot. That could not be more untrue.  There is a great plot filled with political intrigue.  Many people have said there is no character development.  The whole movie is spent developing Anikin, who is supposed to be the main focus of these three films.  Many people criticized young Jake Lloyd's performance, which I thought was excellent.  I've even heard people criticize Natalie Portman's performance, and she was incredible in this film.  People have compared this film to Episode 4, saying it did not have the heart or was not as good.  Come on, Episode 4 was a bad movie... it was hoaky and cheesy and campy and that was what made it great.  You cannot compare the two films. You've got different characters, different actors, different technology, different times, and different movies.  If you want to see the same old movie, then just stay home and watch the original trilogy on tape.  I've also seen the term Star Wars 'purist' thrown around and you can basically through that out the window.  IT'S A MOVIE!!!! And in addition to that, it's a SCI-FI/FANTASY movie.  Things are not supposed to make sense or be perfect.  It's just supposed to be fun and entertaining.  This movie delivers.  The special effects are beyond anything ever seen before, the characters are very likeable, the action sequences are intense and incredible, and I LIKED JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  If liking Jar Jar means I'm like a 6 year old, then I'm happy because the whole point of going to  the movies is to just have fun.  This movie pulls you into an incredible world and keeps you enthralled throughout.  The end lightsaber battle contains some of the best sequences ever put on film and is worth the price of admission on its own.  Don't analyze this movie by comparing it to other films. Analyze what the events of this film mean to the world of Star Wars.  Picking on this film is like criticizing the Mona Lisa because she's not smiling. Get real, get a grip, go see this movie, and enjoy it because it really is something special.  And if you leave the theater wanting more then you've got the point.  You're supposed to want more, that's why you go see the next movie.  Just go and enjoy this film, it's really excellent.",10,13,18,27 May 1999
Blade II," Very Entertaining Action
","I saw Blade II last night and really enjoyed the film.  I was in the mood for a well made action movie after being a bit disappointed by Arnold's last go around, Collateral Damage.  I was looking for a film with enough plot to keep you thinking and lots of exciting action.  Blade II delivers that.The action and fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed with a very frenetic style that makes each scene unique and entertaining.  The film is very stylish and was a bit more dark than the original, looking deeper into the underground world of vampires.  I was impressed with the movie in general.There was enough plot to keep things tied together and the plot holes that do exist can be easily overlooked if you just kind of shrug your shoulders at them.  There is not much suspense in the film and the attempts at twisting the plot are predictable, but acceptable within the realm of the genre.  When the movie was done, I turned to my friend and said 'very cool.' That seems to be a good description for what was a surprisingly entertaining movie.  If you are looking for a visually pleasing, fun movie, Blade II is it.",8,0,1,26 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I loved it and I think it's getting too much criticism
","I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.-The new movies are too childish and geared towards kids: So, somehow we're supposed to believe that the droids, aliens, spaceships swamp monsters, and warriors with mystical powers from the original trilogy were of the more mature variety.-The new movies have too many special effects: We're forgetting that the original movies were also special effects laden.  Lucas has always pushed the limits of technology, even inventing new technology all the way.  He has not sold out or changed or just now relied on special effects, he has always concentrated on the effects.  If he had digital technology 20 years ago, he would have done the same thing then that he has now.  That's what he does; he makes up worlds that don't exist and then comes up with a way to put them on film.-The writing has been bad on the new films: Does anybody recall Lucas ever receiving a Pulitzer Prize?-The acting has been bad on the new films: Carrie Fisher???  Mark Hamill??? Harrison Ford???  We're not exactly talking about Academy Award winners here.  Name me one of the original main actors who was actually a great actor (other than Sir Alec).  Now, Harrison Ford has had a great career, but he's no Jack Nicholson.  And where are Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill now?-Anakin is just a whiny little brat: Does anybody also remember how whiny Luke was in the first two movies?  I mean, he did nothing but whine and complain until Jedi.  And how many times did they say that Luke was just like his father?  Should anybody then be surprised that Anakin was a whiny adolescent?I think my point here is that people from my generation have taken something they loved as a kid and put it up on a pedestal so high that they are confused as to why they liked it.  They think the original movies were these serious Academy Award caliber pieces of art and that's why they liked them. In fact, we liked them because they were cool and had monsters and space battles and there were toys that we could play with and have fun.  The new movies are of the same mold as the original, they are unchanged.  WE have changed and we're having a hard time dealing with that fact.  Some would argue that these movies are not true Star Wars movies.  I say, they are exactly the same... that's why I love them.  If I want a serious film, I'll go find somethings starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  I like action and science fiction, so I'll stick to the childish, poorly acted stuff.",10,577,953,26 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!
","Episode II is an absolutely stunning film.  I loved Episode I and was even more impressed with the next installment.  Hayden Christensen does an excellent job in portraying the anger and hatred of a young and impressionable Anakin.  I was truly impressed with him.
This film feels much more connected to the original trilogy as well, with much more foreshadowing of events to come and a wonderful score by John Williams that incorporates more of the original music.  You leave the theater waiting for more.  I hope that George Lucas has something great in mind to conclude this trilogy because it will be hard to top the final 45 minutes of this movie.  He does open up a lot of questions and will really need to tie things together with the original trilogy.As far as special effects go, the film is visually stunning.  The effects are much more seamless than Episode I and the final battle is outstanding. Fans of the original trilogy who did not like Episode I will have their faith renewed and those who did like Episode I will like this movie even more.One final word... Yoda rules... enough said!!!",10,4,7,20 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great Action Movie That Moves The Series Along
","***Minor Spoilers***  While watching T3, one cannot help but notice the lack of Jim Cameron's unique touch to the film.  The movie does not feel the same as its predecessor's.  That being said, T3 is still a great action movie and does much to move the series ahead.  I love the fact that Arnold has to start over with the Terminator character.  He does not have the polished interaction with humans that John taught him in T2 and John even comments on that in the film.  The movie also attempts to tie up many of the loose ends left by the first two films when it comes to the whole time travel timeline paradox thing.  It dives right into the idea of fate and how the previous excursions into the past in the first two movies only served to postpone Judgment Day, not stop it.  They threw a few things in about how things got screwed up by Kyle in T1 and the Terminator in T2.  Mostow does an excellent job taking over an established franchise.  The film does not have the same frenetic style and suspense of the first two, but was well written and directed.  While the first two were both groundbreaking films, this movie does not have anything you have not seen before, but does have something the other two lacked, a raw human element contained in action sequences that are toned down to a more realistic level.  This film definitely moves the series along and will stand out as a great movie if it is used as a transition into a film that deals with the future and the war against the machines.  If it is the last in the series, it will be a great end, not spectacular, but solid and well made.  I liked it and I think most Terminator fans will be satisfied.  Surely, what we will need is a mind-blowing 4th film that does contain something we have never seen before, but enjoy this one while it's here.",9,0,0,5 July 2003
Meet the Fockers," Refreshing, well written, and well acted.
","I was really happy with Meet The Fockers. I was not sure if it could live up to the first movie and I was expecting a lot of lowbrow humor. There are, of course, some lowbrow jokes (all of the play on the Focker name), but it is, for the most part, funny without getting too crude and without a lot of bad language. It was refreshing to see a comedy that was funny based on the merits of the writing and the acting, rather than depending on base humor and sight gags. Dustin Hoffman was superb and DeNiro gives a performance where you forget it is DeNiro you are watching, which is great considering all of the expectations that come with him. The laughs never let up and the story, in the end, is about accepting your family for who they are and about dealing with the obstacles that life throws at you. If there is a negative about the film, I think it is the editing. It felt really choppy in a few spots. But that did not prevent me from enjoying the film. It exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it if you are in the mood to laugh and have a genuinely good time at the movies. Bravo to all involved in making this picture.",8,1,3,2 February 2005
Hellboy," Solid film - nothing great - but entertaining
","I was unfamiliar with the Hellboy story going into the movie, so I did not have any expectations of the film.  I thought the commercials looked cool and I was looking to be entertained.  I am, however, a big wrestling fan and I chose to see Hellboy over the Rock's new movie Walking Tall, so I was at least expecting to have a good time.  In that sense, this movie did satisfy me.  I had a good time and found myself really into it.  There were no real eye-popping moments, but there was plenty of humor and the crowd in the theatre laughed heartily on many occasions.  Ron Perlman does a great job, as he normally does, and he really made me root for Hellboy.  He connected the audience to the screen with a very human element and many humorous elements that made you feel the human, emotional side of this character. 
I thought the effects were good and close to seamless, but they were nothing we have not seen before.  The pace is a little slow at first, but picks up. I did get the sense that they were trying to introduce a franchise rather than a single complete story because you do not get any sense that anything was really completed in this film.  My other complaint would be that Hellboy does not face a wide array of enemies in the film.  He fights the same type of monster throughout the film and the main bad guys seem to be an afterthought that he catches up to at the end.All in all, I would recommend the film.  It is fun and smart and never seemed to be contrived.  It actually made me want to go and read the Hellboy comics and peeked my interest in the storyline.  I will definitely go to see a sequel if they make it.",9,0,0,5 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wonderful Film... Stands Out... Bridges The Gap
","There is no getting around the fact that Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a great film. It is unlike any of the previous Star Wars films, both the Original Trilogy and the prequels. The movie is very dark and intense, even brutal at times. It is not a gore-fest, but this movie is definitely not for little kids and the PG-13 rating is appropriate. The movie seems to stand out on its own as more of a bridge between the old and new than an ending to the prequel trilogy. It is the best of the prequels (and I liked the previous 2) and is on par with Return of the Jedi.What's Good? -The direction of the film is well done and I have to give credit to Lucas for actually working to make a good film rather than seeing what the limits of CGI are.-Ian McDiarmid gives an awesomely creepy performance as Palpatine and steals the show... the scenes between the Emperor and Anakin are worth the price of admission alone.-The score by John Williams is captivating and leads you into the original trilogy.-The special effects are seamless and take a backseat to the plot and the characters. The CGI is not the focal point of the movie, the people are.What's not good? -While Hayden is apt in many scenes, he seems to bring down some of the heavier scenes. I'm not sure that is his fault, it may be due to the dialogue, but some of the delivery of the lines in his performance hamper the film and prevent me from really lauding his performance. He is better than he was in Clones, but the jury is still out for as to the merits of his performance in Sith.-There is absolutely no chemistry between Hayden and Natalie Portman. Again, it may be the lines, but you don't feel much between them.-As a whole, the trilogy does not give you much time to like Anakin. He is extremely likable for the first 30 minutes of this film, the only time in the series you actually get to see any personality out of him. It is unfortunately too short for my tastes since he starts going batty really early in this film. Thus, you have only seen him as a child and a whining teenager, with only 30 minutes of seeing him as a hero, making his fall less significant than if you had actually liked him prior to his turn to the Darkside.Consensus The film is not perfect and has some hokey moments, but it delivers and may be a surprise to a lot of viewers. It is markedly different than the other films and it may be some time before we can actually judge its place in the Star Wars universe. Parents should be warned that some scenes might be too intense for young viewers. Most of the characters in the film do not meet their destinies pleasantly. Fore adults, the film should be satisfying. It gives the prequel haters what they wanted, a dark and adult oriented film and bridges the gap (with one or two inconsistencies that will probably be debated endlessly in the forums) and leaves the viewer with both a sense of loss for our favorite characters and a sense of completion that the saga has ended.I was very happy with this film and think it just may do the job painting the overall picture for this saga. We'll have to see if the good vibes about this movie continue as more people see it.",10,4,10,19 May 2005
