United 93," Sad, brainwashing movie
","I can easily describe this movie as brain washing. American emotionally exploited. That's sad.Sometimes you have to have a critical vision of movies, and this movie involves 'real' facts, or better, a good story told to us to believe in terrorism and go crazy.We don't have to accept everything we see and hear. Things need to be analyzed. And I say that if the official version is true, there's nothing to hide, no answers to skip.Please, take a hard look to the facts and remember to think before talking. The brain must come first, the heart shouldn't blind us.",1,2,11,18 February 2013
