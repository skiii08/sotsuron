Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't read unless you've seen
","When my friends and I arrived an hour early for the matinee show (with advance tickets purchased last Wednesday, of course) we eagerly chattered about the coming epiphany.  Then, after too many, too long previews, the Lucasfilm logo and that familiar soundtrack lit up the screen, followed by the most famous words in cinematic history. Those first few moments were my favorite in the movie.  I describe myself as one of the countless sencond-generation SW lovers.  And I'm a die-hard fanatic. But George, where's the emotion??  The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie. I will recommend it to my friends.  But, although the effects were smashing and the technology mind-blowing, I felt a huge chunk of the Star Wars appeal was missing from Phantom. You've read it elsewhere, and here it is again: You just don't feel for the characters.  No romance, no Harrison Ford (okay guys, and no Princess Leia in bikini), and no heartbreaking scenes.  The final lightsaber battle wasn't bad in that regard, but when Neeson's character was killed, I didn't feel as I did when Obi-wan died in ANH.  Why?? I don't know. The actors here are talented, but I feel someone told them not to ACT!! Natalie Portman is undeniably gifted, but she seems so dispassionate throughout.  The film could have been greatly enhanced by a little emotion on everyone's behalf. I did not like the 'touching' scene between Ani and his mother.  Not only was it forced and unbelievable, the dialogue was not the quality of the first trilogy. I understand that, following the traditional three-act play format, George will introduce everyone here, then develop his characters in future films. I hope so. Enough rotten tomatoes.  I DID love the final lightsaber battle-there was something ultimately menacing about Darth Maul's double-edged saber.  But why must every saber battle take place beside an open pit??  And I'm so glad the Jawas made an appearance at the Podrace to deliver a resounding Ootidi! I suppose the things that pleased me most were those that reminded me of the first trilogy. My final word:  I loved the foreshadowing of the impeding rise of the Dark Side--the reference to the Dark Lords and the profile shot of young Anakin and Senator Palpatine.  But then came the ending--just too darn HAPPY!!  I was looking for something a little more suspenseful, something that will lead into the coming films.  But at least Ani finally got a haircut.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
The Sound of Music," Pure Magic
","The first time I saw The Sound of Music, I was with 50 other 14-year-olds in a tour bus.  We watched the movie because that day we were arriving in Salsburg, Austria, where it was filmed.  The chaperones figured the cultural enrichment would be good for us. That was some time ago, and then I didn't really appreciate the real beauty of Music--understandable, I suppose, since some kid kept kicking my seat and yelling 'Where's the beef?' But the movie is so well-known and revered all over the world, it's become a basic cinematic staple.  In Salsburg, tours feature landmarks made famous in the movie.  You can buy music boxes in any souvenier store that play 'Eidelweiss.'  They're still nuts about Music over there.  And in a way, I suppose everyone is. The movie is a double romance.  The obvious one is between Maria and the Captain.  The other, just as powerful, is the love of music.  The only character I really didn't like was Liesel--pretty as she was, she seemed a textbook musical actress--fake and perfectly rehearsed.  But the famous gazebo scene with Maria and the Captain is still my favorite, as is their lovely dance at the party. Incidentally, it was Julie Andrews who was originally slated to play Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (the role went to Audrey Hepburn.) Hepburn's singing was dubbed by Marnie Nixon, Sister Sophia in Music. She appears in the 'How Do You Solve a Problem...' number before Maria rushes in.If you haven't seen it, why not?  Even if you're the kind that just mocks musicals for their cheesiness, watch it and do that.  It's a great movie experience, even after forty-some years.",Null,1,7,12 June 1999
G.I. Jane," Hoo-yah!
","Demi Moore shines with shiners and a bit more in an often brutal film about the first woman to enter the elite Navy SEALS training. While some scenes in the movie, such as the confusing end battle, seem a little out of place (exactly who were the trainees fighting?) the film moves along with startling pace and precision.  Moore, who as everyone knows shaved her head for the role of Jordan O'Neill, is tough but feminine and internally vulnerable as a woman scorned by her male teammates. The most violent scene in the film comes during the survival exercise in which O'Neill is bashed around by the Master Chief.  It's gruesome but necessary, and O'Neill earns her fellow trainees' support during the ordeal.",Null,11,25,27 June 1999
As Good as It Gets," Acting is Everything
","So the plot is unbelievable.  So the ending's a shade too happy.  So it's highly unlikely that two people that seem to bicker without interval will suddenly fall for each other.  Right??? Actually, it's happened to me.  But I do understand where the critics are coming from when they insist 'NO WAY.  Unrealistic that a pretty waitress twenty years Jack Nicholson's junior would fall for the crusty old obsessive-compulsive.' But I don't like this movie for it's plot.  I like it because, well, goll darn it, Jack and Helen are wonderful actors!  Their Best Acting Oscars were richly deserved, and their talents are showcased in AGAIG.  As a wannabe actress, I thought Hunt's crying scene was believable to the point of sheer jealousy (how DOES she do it?) And Nicholson's facial expressions--so many of them!--are, in a word, superb.  Surprise yourself and watch it. Even if you're not crazy about the stars, Greg Kinnear's stellar and his dog, Verdel steals his every scene.",Null,1,1,12 June 1999
Citizen Kane," For all generations
","Some of my generation have pegged Citizen Kane as boring and out-dated. Perhaps it is like Crime and Punishment or some equally long and laborious book: it is important, revolutionary, but not thrilling if you aren't completely into that kind of thing.  However, as an American I thought it my duty to watch Citizen Kane, which is considered a 'timeless classic.' Incidentally, Kane is Number One on the AFI Top 100 list--bu the best movie of all time did not even receive the Oscar that year!!!  This certainly exemplifies the differences in opinion here. I enjoyed this movie because of its tragic nature: Kane's sad fall from grace and innocence, brought on by the lust for power and wealth.  At one point, Kane says, ' yes, I bought many...things.'  And he sounds regretful. I suddenly realized we do buy so many things that do NOT bring us the happiness we anticipated.  Kane lacks the one thing he cannot buy-love, and ultimately no one can survive without it.Perhaps the most famous scene in all of cinematic history, the closing shot of the Rosebud sled is at once the saddest and most riveting I believe I've seen.  In that moment we see how that young boy in the snow, ripped from his parents, succombed to corruption and greed, and died as alone as he felt when taken from his parents.",Null,6,7,17 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The wrap-up to a classic trio
","I'm an admitted Star Wars fanatic, and even though I've seen the trilogy in its entirely at least 20 times, I still thoroughly enjoy watching every film.  However, Return of the Jedi isn't my favorite of the three.  While the movie has some undeniably memorable moments (the final lightsaber battle, the Death Star raid), as a whole it fell short of its predecessors. The anticipated romance between Han and Leia practically fizzles out, Mark Hamill's limited range as an actor is more evident here than in the rest of the trilogy, and the Ewoks were just too Care Bear-like for the end of a mountainous saga. (George Lucas's fascination with the short fuzzballs makes me wonder, does he think EVERYONE adores them??  The Ewoks have at least two movies of their own, and they're awful!)But ROJ is still a marvelous film, as are all the SW adventures.  Princess Leia is lovely here (I'm a girl, so I'm not basing my opinion on that copper bikini scene, okay), and Luke finally got a decent haircut.  Of course my personal favorite is Harrison Ford, who is, as always, a thrill to watch.",Null,0,2,28 June 1999
Armageddon," Utterly Mindblowingly Awful
","Counting the two Problem Child disasters, this is the third worst movie I've ever suffered through.  At times I wondered if 'Armadgeddon' was a really a movie at all: at its heart it's simply a bunch of predictable explosions strung together by a plot thin enough to break through with a feather.  It's Hollywood at its pathetic worst. Let me back up my stern dislike for this wreck.  First, so many laws of basic science dealing with gravity, heat, and other apparently non-important ideas are broken, I will not attempt to list all the anomalies.  Second, things are constantly being blown up.  Now, that's to be expected in the typical Action/Summer Blockbuster, but it happens so many times in Armageddon we are tired by the first quarter of the film.  Things explode for the sake of exploding.  I'm curious how many of these disasters happen in the movie, but I don't have the patience to sit throught it again and count. Another fatal flaw: Everything must go wrong.  Sure, a plot requires conflict, but so many things get...well, messed up, it's actually funny. Seriously, I sat through this 'thrillride' and predicted the next scene. I was right, oh, 19 times out of 20.  My one mistake was when I didn't bother to guess.  It is sadly, sadly predictable. Then of course, we have that obligatory dramatic scene near the end when Our Hero (I will not reveal his identity if someone out there, heaven forbid, actually wants to see this monstrocity) takes a few moments to tell the world goodbye.  Hello--he's supposed to be saving them!!!  At this point, every second counts as that giant rock of mass destruction hurtles toward Earth! So there is the demise of Armageddon.  There's much more that really damns the whole movie, but I can't go into more detail or this review will span several pages.  My advice:  Don't waste your time!!! If you want a big end-of-the-world-is-swiftly-approaching-film, rent Deep Impact.  That isn't a good movie but slightly better than Armageddon.  May this movie be shoved into the darkest bowels of Hollywood demise.",1,1,3,6 July 1999
Independence Day," Fun
","ID4 isn't meant to be a thinking person's movie.  You don't hold life-altering discussions afterward.  It IS, however, a roller-coaster ride with plenty of dips and loops to make it worthwhile.  Roger Ebert described it as 'silly summer fun,' and that it is.  Much of the story remains under-developed (I wanted to know where those beastly little b***ers came from) but the triumphant spirit in the end really is something.
ID4 also boasts an impressive ensemble of big-name performers.  Will Smith demonstrates he's a darn funny guy.  Bill Pullman carrys himself and his charisma much like the ideal President should--(and whether it's formulatic or not, you've gotta love it when he takes to the skies with the rest of humanity.)  Brent Spiner--Star Trek's Data without the gold makeup, throws in a colored cameo as an underground mad scientist type.  Harry Connick, Jr. is as suave as ever.  Judd Hirsch is Jewish. And of course anything with Jeff Goldblum in it won't be a total loss.  Also, watch for the actor who plays Mr. Nubicki (Bill Pullman fires him in the end.) I swear he's the biggest character actor in Hollywood today--he's everywhere!  (Basic Instinct, The Game, several others I can't remember...)I also liked the cute tie-in to Jurassic Park.  When fleeing the Mothership, Jeff Goldblum repeats his same line from the dino-fleeing scene in JP: Must Go Faster!  Who thought of that one??A final note: Independence Day really is a decent film as far as action blockbusters go.  You do develop some caring for the characters, and the idea of all humanity teaming up against E.T. from Hell is heartening. Watch Armageddon and you'll feel like nominating ID4 for an Oscar.",Null,0,1,21 July 1999
The Game," Think you're smart?? See THIS!
","I would say, in all modesty, I am a reasonably intelligent filmgoer and yet I felt so completetly, uh...taken by this movie!  The Game leads you to believe you've got it all figured out (and perhaps you do?) but then whips around 180 degrees and shows the opposite to be true.If you're prone to finding yourself scared witless by creepy movies at home alone, rent this one with a friend in the daytime.  The Game creates such an acute sense of paranoia it's enough to make anyone scratch their head. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly--until I really sat down and thought about it afterward.  In the final moments, something...well, quite traumatic happens to Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas's skillfully played character.)  Less than a minute later he is expected to be fully jubilant and recovered.  The people who did this to him are supposedly 'good guys' in the end....and I really can't say any more without revealing the crucial points that make The Game so titulating. But another thing bothered me about the film (okay, besides the plausibility, which the viewer must fully suspend in order to hop aboard The Game.)  If this is just a game, and clients like Nicholas shell out big bucks for the 'entertainment,' if you can call it such, why was Nick almost killed half a dozen times?  Later it is revealed that the automatic guns were loaded solely with blanks.  Alright, that makes sense, but what about the sinking taxicab scene?  If Nick hadn't reacted quickly as he did and saved himself in a bizarre manner, he would've drowned.  Such a caring company, eh???  The company CRS was only counting on Nicholas to play the game as expected and save himself in situations like this.  True, the personality tests probably gave them a start...but darn it, he still could've drowned!Alright, now that I worked that out of my system...this is really a fun movie-creepy, mind-boggling, and wholly remarkable--and the rooftop scene had me completely convinced until those doors opened and guess who was really there!  The final scene left me with the question, so what's gonna happen next?  is it truly over?Then the credits rolled and I realized it was.  I wanted more!",Null,0,1,22 June 1999
Back to the Future Part III," the grand finale!??
","I'm not a fan of Westerns, so BTTF3 isn't among my favorite of films.  But since it's the finale to one of my beloved trilogies, I often watch it after the other two for a sense of closure.We aren't treated to much time-hopping paradoxes here as in the first two--and that's where the main fault lies.  Suddenly, the movie isn't nearly as inventive as the first two because of that missing element.  It resorts to cliches of the Old West (saloon hostilities, shootouts at high noon, hey, Marty introduces himself as Clint Eastwood) instead of its creative time-warp adventure.  The sense of urgency is lost here, as there's no chance Marty will run into himself. However, it's not a bad film in its own right, since we love the characters by now and we desperately want them to get themselves out of this one final mess.An interesting paradox surfaces early in the movie, and I wonder if anyone else caught it:  On Doc Brown's grave is something to the effect of 'from Beloved Clara.'  Well Doc never met Clara UNTIL Marty traveled back to meet him.  In fact, Clara originally died in an accident which Marty and Doc saved her from.  So when Marty looks at that gravestone, it's technically impossible since he has yet to go back, save her life, and introduce her to Doc.Anyway, just wanted to point that out.  One thing that really keeps the style of the BTTF series is the common use of repetition: the scene with Marty awaking to a woman he thinks is his mother (and it usually is), being mocked for his time-inappropriate attire, running into his ancestors, and generally having to solve time-related dilemmas.  BTTF3 is a decent finish to an overall outstanding series.",Null,0,0,10 July 1999
Men in Black," Thrill ride for the masses
","Who cares about a plot??  The plot is the only thing that actually slows this joyride down a bit halfway through.  MiB is laugh aloud funny, packed with whiz-bang one-liners, pokes at everyone from Elvis to Newt Gingrich, and much charm from the stars, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Smith is extremely enjoyable as the New Guy, employed to help save Earth from aliens, all in a day's work. His swaggering confidence and sass are an amusing contrast to Jone's delightfully deadpanned agent K.The wise-cracking humor here is great, as evidenced in one of my favorite exchanges:  Jones claims to be from the FBI and asks a woman to discuss her husband's transformation into an alien. The wife sullenly retorts, 'Is this some kinda joke?' TO which Jones solemnly replies, 'No, ma'am, we at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we are aware of.'",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
Titanic," I broke down and watched it!
","I once had a dream.  A vision, if you will.  I had the idea that when I died at age 92, on my tombstone would be the words 'LAST WOMAN ON EARTH TO NEVER SEE TITANIC.' I thought I could do it. But, just as the Unsinkable Ship took a swift nosedive to the ocean floor, I too, hit an iceberg, and in a moment of weakness, watched The Epic. I was the out-spoken, Titanic-bashing zealot who claimed 'it couldn't possibly be that good! It's all effects!' Well, my attitude hasn't changed much. Now, with my melted resolve, I ask, what was all the hype about? The 'I'm king of the world!' was just too much. I suppose knowing Leo was going to turn Human Popsicle sort of ruined the moment, too.  The effects were impressive, but I just didn't feel involved. Yes, Leo's a looker, and I assume men say the same of Kate, but I was looking for something more.",Null,2,3,12 June 1999
A Beautiful Mind," Wow.
","Let me tell you just how good 'A Beautiful Mind' really is. I have a kidney disorder that makes it necessary for me to visit the restroom every hour. I was on the verge of exploding halfway through this movie and yet I didn't move for fear of missing even three minutes of this fascinating event. (As soon as the closing credits rolled, I ran.) 'Mind's' greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to sane people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a sane individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible. 'Mind' does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until partway into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. The reason: His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience. *(SPOILER)* I suspected the decoding fantasies weren't real, especially when Nash began postering the walls with newspaper clippings. But his fictictious roommate threw me---and there is the point. The audience is just as fooled by the delusion as Nash is, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion. Incidentally, I came across a professional review that blasted 'Mind' for including 'all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill.' I feel badly for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality. There are some truly shocking moments in 'Mind.' When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in 'The Shining' discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering 'Marcie,' Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness--ironically, through his intellect.When Nash imagines that someone is going to kill Alicia, he lunges at her--and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless actof violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion. Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word.  Russell Crowe sure knows his trade. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character, although the accent wasn't consistant. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash---his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will probably get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. Heck, he might even win it again. Ed Harris is, as always, perfect. Harris continues to be one of my favorite actors, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and 'spying.' I hope people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is cute or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themself. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to 'pull themself together.' You will understand why they need your love--because they are just as confused as you are.",10,0,1,4 January 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," You're never immune to this
","I'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every weekend for three months or until I feel I've had enough.  Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new.  The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick.  It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.  Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!!  Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes.  But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene.  There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness.  I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a favor and rent it NOW.",Null,0,0,12 June 1999
Back to the Future Part II," Second act twist
","It's easy to get confused by the second installment in the Back to the Future series.  But if you're an avid BTTF buff and an attentive viewer, you will greatly enjoy the twists and turns Michael J. Fox's Marty encounters in this creative film.  We are treated to three different time periods, plus scenes that overlap from the first film.  (Hint: If you are attempting to watch Part Two before seeing Part One, give up.)The actors here are competent and entertaining, with the exception of Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, who acts pretty dense.  No worry, she's not important or central in the film; she only provides the set-up for the future time travel.We see the characters in different stages of life, which is amazingly realistic through expert make-up.  Fox plays himself, himself as an older man, his son, AND his daughter.  What a family.  The paradoxed start piling up at this point, but if you can try not to become too confused and stick around for the fun, it's a great thrill ride.  Biff and Marty duke it out in a surrealistic future, which is caused by Marty's own greedy negligence.My favorite part of the film are the scenes intercut with the first movie. It's interesting to watch Marty go back in time to fix his current problem while managing to not screw up his FIRST encounter, which we witnessed in Part One.  Follow???  It's a slick sense of deja vu.This movie is darker in tone than its predecessor, mostly due to Marty's efforts to thrawt the Evil Biff.  I enjoy it more with every viewing. It's the same with all the BTTF films--you simply catch more of the time-dependent details with multiple viewings.  Plus there's obvious repetition within the trilogy, and that lends to a sort of cohesiveness between the three.",Null,0,1,10 July 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," a true band geek festival
","I was still in high school when 'Mr. Holland's Opus' came out, and it was immediately popular with the 'band geek' crowd.  A band geek is someone who has made all their friends through band, dated exclusively through band, and generally loves band.  Nerdy, yeah, it is, and I was one of that crowd. But we sure had fun.  That fun is displayed nicely in Opus, through Richard Dreyfuss's career as a high school band teacher.  My friends particularily enjoyed the scenes that depicted the common, everyday tribulations in the band room: learning how to hold your instrument, much less play it, staggering backwards in muted agony after that first unison note.Near the end, the music program at Glen Holland's school is put into jeopardy.  This is, unfortunately, a sad fact that happens ALL too often in our schools.  Dreyfuss has a line to the effect of, you'll cut band but I guarantee you'll never cut football.  My former high school struggled with that very same vicious arts vs. athletics debate not too long ago.  It seems sports are always paramount to creativity.  But that is a discussion, not a review. Anyway, the subplot involving Glen Holland and his student, Rowena Morgan--the musical star, is uncomfortable because that too can happen in real life.  Although student and teacher thankfully do NOT have a relationship in Opus, this problem is latent and real in our society.  We do not hear about it all that much, but honestly, one occurance is one too many.  The movie does a good job of letting the viewer realize what is going on, yet doesn't subject us to anything further. Lastly, Richard Dreyfuss is commendable as the aging music teacher, who goes from young and unwilling to teach to silver-haired and fighting to stay in the classroom.  The make up effects here are wholly believable and Dreyfuss's performance is one of the most realistic depictions of a high school music teacher.",Null,2,3,1 July 1999
Rear Window," Hitchcock classic
","This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from this masterful director, but Rear Window generates such a tangible feeling of suspense you won't soon forget it. Plus, it's laden with symbolism--so much, in fact, that I won't go into detail here; many film review web sites offer extensive summaries of the movie. The apartment complex in which the movie is set entirely in seems so familiar, so very possible that when James Stewart suspects a neighbor of murder, you suddenly find yourself wondering, Well, what would one do?? All the so-called evidence he has is purely circumstancial: only what he witnesses in his neighbor's apartment through his window.  The best, most intense moments come near the end.  I will not reveal what exactly happens here but when one specific person looks up and realizes he's being watched, it's the creepiest moment I've seen on film.",Null,1,3,7 July 1999
The Truman Show," Genius
","I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, 'No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly.'  I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!",10,361,398,12 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The film that started it all
","It's 1999, 22 years since the original release of Star Wars, and we still have people flocking to SW conventions, dedicating entire web sites to SW, spending hundreds of dollars on posters and action figures, and generally assuring that the SW frenzy will live forever. Okay, I'm not critical of the die-hard fans, since I am one myself and very proud of that.  I am told I bear a striking resemblance to Carrie Fisher, so I dressed up like Leia for Halloween once, complete with the cinnamon-bun hair.  (I wanted to be Yoda but the costume shop said the outfit only had one ear.)  Regardless whether you're nuts about SW or not, it is a masterful exercise in filmmaking and the original movie was, of course nominated for an Academy Award.  Pretty unheard of for a sci-fi/fantasy.George Lucas famously described the trilogy as a 'three-act play.' Everyone is introduced in the first act, SW; they are placed in a dark, desperate mess in the second, ESB; and finally they get out of the hole in the final third, ROJ.  This setup works fairly well for the trilogy, although some find fault with Lucas's idea.  They say Star Wars has too little character involvement, Empire is too dark, and Return is too happy.  Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I think Lucas's strategy works well in the long-term effect.  We grow to love the characters after three movies; things like that take time and sometimes multiple movies!!!Although SW is not my favorite of the three (I find it somewhat campy and unemotional,) it was a fantastic starting block and lead-in to The Empire Strikes Back, which was one of the most anticipated sequels of all time. Mark Hamill was adequate as Luke Skywalker, although the whining was a little irritating.  The aerial battle above and around the Death Star is fabulous.  James Earl Jones immortalized the ominous voice of Darth Vader. Carrie Fisher is young and tenacious (and not as drugged out as in the second movie.  I'm not cruel, just honest!) And Harrison Ford was absolutely perfect as the rough-n-tumble Han Solo.Judging by its cult-like following (heck, even Wedge has his own fan club!), Star Wars is one of those immortal things, so you might as well love it.",Null,2,3,28 June 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Ultimate Party Movie!
","I first saw The Funniest Movie Ever at a music camp movie night.  We chose movies by voting on a pre-selected list.  Ridiculously, Search for the Holy Grail was not one the list.  No matter, it was written in and received by far the most votes.  I, rather naively, told my friends, 'Now I know you guys know this movie line-for-line, but try not to spoil the plot for me, okay?'  In unison everyone replied, 'What plot?' Ah, and there's the essence of The Funniest Movie Ever.  What it's about isn't important in the least.  It's really about finding a semi-cohesive way of stringing together some of the most hysterical scenes in the American/British cinema.  The troll and the bridge scene is probabaly the most imitated in American society today.  And yes, you will repeat most of lines along with the characters.  It's just that fun.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Second Act's the best!
","Empire is definitely the best of the three SW films, and that's the general concensus, not just my humble opinion.  The plot in ESB is much more complex than in SW, which was basically much running around and shooting the bad guys.  The light saber battle between Luke and Vader is unparalleled, as is the Moment of Truth when Vader 'fesses up to fatherhood.  The suspense builds here like in no other SW movie.  We also care about the characters and what happens to them; that is the key to creating a good movie.  Action sequences miss their mark if we don't mind if the guy fighting gets sliced or not.  Here, Han and Leia *finally* get together, Luke begins to act like a man and not a high-flying whiner, and Alec Guiness is thankfully back as the ghost of Obi-Wan.In addition to the captivating characters, the movie is enhanced by stunning visual effects that are still highly revered even after 16 years.  Cloud City is mystical yet seems real in all its splendid detail.  And it's hard to believe that Yoda's swampy home was really just a soundstage in London. I read somewhere that ESB is the best because it has the most plot elements mentioned in the opening paragraph that scrolls famously into space. That is true, now that I think about it, and ESB is the darkest and most powerful of the trilogy.",Null,0,0,28 June 1999
Contact," A thinking person's delight
","I know someone out there has seen Contact and said, 'Hey man, cool special effects, but too much talkin!'  For those who look for intellectual stimulation, Contact will connect! (pardon the cheesy rhetoric.) I loved this movie because, unlike the recent Star Wars release, the special effects enhance the movie instead of dominating it.  In Contact, SEs add to the feeling of wonder and awe of our universe.  The plot is not centered around the eye candy.  Instead, there is substance here.  A lot. The movie centers around Ellie Arroway, who is not religious but is interested in the 'pursuit of truth.'  The problem is, perhaps the truth is not what religion indoctrinates.  When Earth is given the chance to send one human to contact with another race of beings, Ellie is desperate to be the one chosen.  Her opposition is strong because of her non-religious background.  I believe this illuminates how blind religion can make people--I am a religious person but still, I can see how stubborn refusal to accept an idea other than your own can limit our future. Contact is a thought-provoker.  You won't forget it.",Null,0,1,12 June 1999
Back to the Future," The start of a very entertaining trilogy
","Ohhhh...such a great film, even after so many years!  I first saw Back to the Future as a seven-year-old, and while I enjoyed it then, I didn't grasp all the subtle implications.  The idea of a teenager accidentally mucking around in his parent's first romance is mind-boggling, but enjoyable.  In some ways, this is not only a sci-fi flick (which really it isn't) but a character drama, a comedy (at many times) and a period piece.  The contrast between the 80's and the 50's is comical in a time when both decades are part of America's colorful past. After you've seen Back to the Future at least a dozen times, you start to pick up on the attention to detail--and how one incident in the past can drastically affect the future.  The name of the mall, for instance, is changed from Twin Pine to Lone Pine in one fell swoop of an out-of-control DeLorean. Such comedy arises from Marty's encounters with his family-to-be. Lorraine, his mother, is infatuated with him, much to the dismay of her family; her father remarks, 'He's an idiot.  Parents probably idiots too.  Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that I'll disown you.'  If he only knew!!!BTTF also sets the pace for the rest of the trilogy, and you really have to watch the first to understand any of the movies.  Plus, if you look at the trilogy as a whole, one big incorporate story, it's really a very inventive, involving joyride.  Plus, Christopher Lloyd makes a very amusing nutty professor-type, and the soundtrack's great.  The costumes are convincing, as is 50's Hill Valley.  A great experience for anyone.",Null,0,1,10 July 1999
The Godfather," Award-winner lives up to reputation
","I was reluctant to watch The Godfather, as I heard it was gory and shrouded in symbolism, but my boyfriend talked me into seeing it.  I was pleasantly surprised, although I supposed I shouldn't have been since both The Godfather and its sequel won Oscars and a spot on AFI's Top 100 list.It's an artfully made movie, and Al Pacino's fall from grace was the highlight of the movie for me.  Marlin Brando's very believable don Corleone was not a hateful character--we do not see him held responsible for any civilian deaths or anyone completely innocent.  You get to like him, despite his less-than-honorable job.It helps to know a little about the movie before you watch it.  The symbolism is indeed thick here, and knowing such things like oranges=death makes it a more acessible film.  Also, Brando's attention to detail led him to stuff his cheeks with...was it cotton?--well, something, to achieve that 'bulldog look.'  That strict dedication to the character on the actors' part, as well as Copolla's taut directing style and Puzo's terrific story line make The Godfather a worthy recipient of every prize it has earned.",Null,0,1,29 June 1999
