First Man," Depressed, all the way
","I'll get right to the point. It is said Armstrong was humble, almost shy. But the Armstrong in this film is clinically depressed and somewhere between depressed and catatonic. I'll go with catatonic, all the way.The effects and realism were incredible. But too many tight shots and not enough establishing shots or hero shots.The soundtrack was hate it or love it, and it was 50ies and 60ies show tunes melodies.We follow Armstrong day in day out, year after year tragedy after tragedy, and did I say clinical depression? Even his wife gets depressed in the end. A descent into depression where everything seems to be just there and happening and so what.By the time we get to the moon it is not a climax we were building up to. It's just another day at the office.I did not at all mind that there was no flag-planting scene. The flag was there. The scenes on the moon beautiful. Armstrong still depressed out of his skull and not interested.And then, as the LEM shoots up from the Lunar surface, cut to quarantine on earth. No return trip, no splashdown, no arrival.But there is one thing more bizarre than any of the others. The completely skipped, they did not mention, we did not see nada of Apollo 8, an essential lead-in to Apollo 11.I needed to watch the Right Stuff immediately after, to return to regular brain function.If Neil Armstrong was half as clinically catatonic and depressed as in the movie he would not have been able to go to the moon. He would not have been able to hold a job or go to a store to buy a postcard of the moon.",6,2,3,24 November 2018
The Irishman," The Band, together again, worth every minute.
","The ticket of admission (or streaming fee) in this case is not to watch a gangster movie. It is to watch a Scorsese movie with De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel... The Band, together again. It's like visiting an art gallery or a museum because it shows work of a particular artist. And when you know it's 3.5 hours long, you prepare accordingly. Simple as that.The Irishman is the onscreen faithful version of a book, a book that recorded actual history and actual persons but offers a conclusion that is not proven to be as depicted. Nobody knows what happened to Jimmy Hoffa. The ending of the book and the movie is a possible version of history. The characters, each and every one is delivered in masterful portrayals. Absolutely enthralling and totally believable, interesting and disarming. Except Hoffa. Pacino does a superb job as Jimmy Hoffa but, without holding it against him, Pacino's Hoffa is not the Hoffa we know from historical photographs and documentaries. Nicholson's (1992) Hoffa was more true-to-life (sorry, Mr. Pacino).The de-aging software did not bother me any more than makeup does in any movie, to age or de-age. It's what it is. You know it's 'make-up', so, see it as part of the 'wardrobe'.Scorsese's oeuvre is true to form but there is no innovation, no auteur's new signature that was not already established in Goodfellas (1990) or Casino (1995). In fact, I do believe I would rate Casino higher than The Irishman. The several references to the Kennedys serve also as Scorsese's way of establishing that the gangster culture seen in his films is not the exception in the shadows but the norm in the mainstream of our society. Martin Scorsese, from Taxi Driver (1976) to Raging Bull (1980) to Goodfellas (1990) to Casino (1995), to The Departed (2006), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is showing us that crime, gangs and organized crime is not just somewhere out there but it is everywhere, at a every level, an integral part of how society functions. Wit The Irishman his statement uses a Union boss with mob connections that was, as the film claims, as big as The Beatles in his time.What The Irishman has that Goodfellas and Casino do not have to the extent we see it here, is the study of the protagonist's character, the look into Frank Sheeran's soul in the last sequence of the film. And yes, it was necessary to watch the first 180 minutes in order to fully feel and understand the last twenty minutes ( the film is three hours thirty minutes including ten minutes of end titles).How does this man feel about the life he led? Is there remorse? Is there introspection? Is there guilt or salvation? Is there a forgiving God? The Irishman is indeed about the last twenty minutes and I thank Mr. Scorsese and the gang for taking me through the first 180 minutes. Although all the devices and brilliant, masterful Direction were honed in the earlier movies, what is new in this latest Scorsese offering was the depth of the study of the character at the end of his life.And this is where Mr. De Niro's performance becomes the equivalent of Itzhak Perlman performing Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. Those last twenty minutes is the soloist's finest moment under the watchful eye of conductor Scorsese.",9,1,3,10 December 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Brilliantly sad
","Used to be, way back, billboards written and paid for by individuals might have read 'War is over, if you want it' but these days these same billboards seem to yell 'We're lost and there's no hope'.The acting in Three Billboards is phenomenal. Worth seeing the movie again and again to marvel at the craft of the actors lead by Frances McDormand. Truly a tour de force performance that reveals more nuance and perfection every time you watch it. Mildred must surely get an Oscar to bookend Marge Gunderson.Photography is also very good, capturing the essence of the atmosphere. The Director seems inconsequential when the actors' craft and the photography reign above, making you forget you are watching a movie. Maybe that's my compliment to the Director.But what is actually going on? What is the story? In the later part of the second decade of the 21st century, a vacant statement of a Dark Ages for the mind, the heart and the soul, of a humanity that's lost direction, purpose hope and sense of beauty.Indeed, Mildred of Ebbing is Marge of Fargo, adjusted for a post 9-11 alienated and fearful society that aims for nothing, sees nothing and hopes for nothing to the point of drifting through life in a state of indecision and, well, clinical depression and disgust for other humans.A brilliantly acted sad statement on what humanity has become.",9,2,5,10 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Force is powerless against bad editing.
","Dark things to the Force bad editing does. In fact I think everyone's gripe with this movie comes one way or another from the awkward jumps and lack of explanation for what we see from one scene jump to another. A disjointed viewing experience that makes it look like incomplete and badly started vignettes where you miss the first few seconds asking, wait! How did we get here? What's this? Where did that come from? and then you give up trying to figure it out so you don't miss what's going on with the script running at amok speed. The major problem with this 2-hour 12-minute (plus end titles) movie is that it could not possibly be told in less than 2 hours 45 minutes.So... what about the story? At this point, 42 years and nine films later, we just wanted to find out who Rey is and go home to get even older, Force willing. I don't want to write a review with spoilers, so all I can tell you is that we do find out who Rey is, and so does Rey, and in my opinion at least, the answer is very, very satisfying and takes the prize for a worthy multi-dimensional resolution of the eternal fight with the dark side, all this long time ago in that galaxy far, far away. Well done, writers! Now, go beat-up the editors and the Executives who wanted a short movie for ticket maximization.OK, maybe some of the staff we saw was a bit over the top, even for Star Wars, maybe a few too many battle cruisers in that big fleet and, not giving anything away, I want to say I may watch it again just to make sure I didn't really see lots of people running around on the outside of a space ship without space suits or oxygen...Carrie's archival footage worked really well. And the old trio we came to love did save the franchise. Even the new characters were redeemed.It was a good story that started out by making you wonder 'what the...' but it righted itself and delivered. JJ had a very deep hole to climb out of after The Last Jedi and he did, just barely.",8,2,8,1 January 2020
Dunkirk," A movie that wears the Emperor's new clothes.
","I marked my review as containing spoilers so let's get the major spoilers out of the way first: This movie has no plot, the editing utilized the concept of sticking random time-segments together, the characters have no motivation and no depth. The brilliant vestments critics assigned to this movie are the Emperor's new clothes. He is wearing nothing.So, let's cut through to the chase: If you want to see a better movie about Dunkirk, with (apparently) more extras, real characters, real story and an explanation of what it is you are watching and why, then, watch the 1958 Ealing Studios production with Richard Attenborough and John Mills.I must confess that when I was watching the few hundred people on the beaches, and the single boat coming from England, I was sure I'd see Matthew McConaughy looking for Jessica Chastain --so powerful was the connection to Interstellar created by the maddening, unnerving wall of sound that is the repetitive constant senseless soundtrack which is becoming a Nolan trademark.Finally, the single boat (OK, there was one scene with a few dozen boats that lasted a few seconds), well, when it makes its way back to England we learn that they came from and returned to Dorset. The Historical list of 750 or so boats does not include a single one from Dorset. The real boats left from Ramsgate, 39 nautical miles from Dunkirk. Dorset is 180 nautical miles from Dunkirk.Dunkirk was a great victory in defeat, with nearly 400,000 men saved and even in the 1958 English production it was true to life and proportions, where Nolan's 2017 production failed miserably and completely.I was so looking forward to watching Mr. Nolan's film and I must confess I am now quite upset at young Christopher for wasting my time and making such a mess of history.PS. At Google, the two more frequently asked questions about Dunkirk are 1) Is the battle of Dunkirk the same as D Day? and 2) Where was the evacuation of Dunkirk? Well! I guess the people who asked these questions are this movie's audience. Sorry! Really!",3,2,3,9 December 2017
Yesterday," Let it in
","A could-be game changer for the third decade of the 21st century, disguised as a sweet film. All you have to do is remember yesterday, let it under your skin and go on a magical mystery tour across the universe. Remember what it felt like when beauty meant something. And it was real.The moment 78-year-old John, from Liverpool, opens the door is the watershed moment of the movie that instantly fills you with tears of what might have been and could yet be if you only let it.It's a must see film no matter how many, or how few stars you give it.",8,1,2,2 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino, revealed.
","To understand this movie you need to know history well, as well as Hollywood history, you need to love the movies, and to love fairy tales. The warning and disclaimer are right there in the title of the movie. If you don't check all the boxes you will not get this movie and you will hate it. But if you do get it, you will be right to leave the theater thinking this was one of Tarantino's masterpiecesAll these years we thought Quentin was going to saturate us with violence forever, but look at what a sentimental pacifist he turned out to be.Just like in Inglorious Basterds, where Tarantino gave the Third Reich what they deserved by machine-gunning them all down in a movie theater, so in this fairy tale he puts the world right again, as it should have been, but now he gives life instead of taking it.It's nearly impossible to justify one's opinion about this movie without offering spoilers, but I decided not to offer any. No spoilers here.Just know that if you are very familiar with Hollywood History and are a cinephile, if you know the details of the true story of one of this movie's characters, Sharon Tate, and if you like fairy tales, then you are going to absolutely love Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood and maybe even shed a happy tear in the final scene, like I did.The acting marks high points in the actors' careers. The direction is pure and matured Tarantino. The story and the ending, the blending of real-life and fictional characters and events, brilliant and perfectly delivered.",10,14,18,23 November 2019
1917," The absurdity of war
","If one already knew war is absurd, this movie will preach to the choir. If one did not know it, the movie will not convince otherwise. And, the First World War provides the most indisputable evidence of how absurd and pointless war can be.But this movie is unique in that the stars of the show are not the actors but, instead, the unbelievably amazing skill, organization, professionalism, care and technical filmmaking excellence required to pull-off a two-hour movie in what is two long takes. I think there were three takes with an unseen 'cut' in the water halfway through the second half of the movie. There is an obvious 'cut' near the 66-minute mark that goes to black for several seconds allowing for the next long shot to start 'hours later' and a less obvious cut in the water around the 85-minute mark. But I cannot write enough, or stress the point enough, of how fantastically difficult this technical undertaking was and how brilliantly they pulled it off. The detail required and achieved, the flawless timing of camerawork versus action as it happens, takes the audience by the hand and never lets go.The flaw I find in all this is very simple. It's the question 'Why?' Why is the one-shot necessary to the film? Is the technical excellence obscuring the fact that the story and the point are in fact rather mediocre? A great actor can take a mediocre script and turn it into a masterpiece. In this case, the actor, the star is not a human, but many humans, all behind the camera, delivering the film-making excellence that covers-up the mediocrity of the story. Yes, one has to find the courage to ask 'so what?' even at the expense of lessening the overall hoopla this movie has generated.",6,1,5,28 January 2020
