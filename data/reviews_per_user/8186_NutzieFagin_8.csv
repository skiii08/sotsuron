Black Swan," The most 'tense' but riveting Ballet I ever seen! (SPOILERS HERE)
","If you are interested in seeing the underworld of ballet theater, Black Swan is the picture for you! It shows the raw exposed guts of ballet dancers who are determined to be the top dog in their world. The story is simple and very sad. Nina, the ballerina has made ballet her life's work. She lives and breathes ballet everyday by practicing endless hours to capture the golden ring of being the company's top ballerina. All the girls within the Ballet company compete with each other for the attention of the director though impressionistic dance and yes...sexual favors, but Nina believes that only hard work and determination can only get her what she wants. Suddenly to her delight, she is picked to be the lead ballerina in Swan Lake. But darker roads are ahead. Nina does not foresee the challenge of playing a duel role as a good/bad girl. She is so much a perfectionist and a girl of high morals, it adds pressure. More and more pressure added are the endless demands of pleasing her director. and Nina'a over bearing mother, who always drives the nail of guilt that she had to give up her career to raise Nina. We never see Nina's father so we can assume he left the family. Then, we meet Lily, a new dancer who like the Black Swan is a highly erotic character who charms everyone with her free spirit. Nina, who has been in the pressure cooker trying to a perfect dancer always feels threatened to the point of paranoia gets pushed over the edge.What impressed me about Black Swan is that it is a sad movie. I felt sorry for Nina because she was always driven to be perfect because I felt she was starving for acceptance. Her mother never gave it to her because her mother resented her for giving up her career. The Director of the company, whom Nina seem to have some repressed sexual feelings always asked more and more of her talent but treated her like she was a disgusting outcast when she couldn't live up to his demands. Natilie Portman finely impressed me with her acting ability. In the past Natalie played a lot of 'comic book' roles like V for Vendetta and Padma from Star Wars. The only past role that she played well under was Anne Bolelyn from 'The Other Bolelyn Girl'. Here, the character of Nina is a very meaty acting role that she handled with expertise of a acting diva. Good Luck with the Oscars, Ms Portman you got a TERRIFIC running to snatch the Best Actress!I highly recommend the Black Swan to see. The downsized is that you must be prepared for some shocking skin peeling/transformation/ and graphic sexual scenes. Not for the faint hearted",9,0,2,16 January 2011
Star Trek," Stellar Summer movie, stellar performances but I have a disability issue.
","I kinda figured that Star Trek pre-sequel was destined to be made due the Star War trilogy series. I have to say for a summer movie I was throughly entertained for the two hour duration Thanx to the performances of the actors, who had big shoes to fill portraying the original beloved TV characters. The actor who portrayed Mr. Spock looked amazingly authentic. Young Kirk, a little on the punky side, was a swaggering cowboy and the attractive Uhura was a smart sex goddess. Dr. 'Bones' McCoy did not look at all like Deforrest Kelly, but I loved the old line 'Dammit Jim, I'm just a doctor' Chekov, was probably least impressive but I did enjoy the corny 'Moose and Squirrel' Russian accent. 'We are arriving on Wulcan' Could have seen a little more of Sulu. I won't give anything away, but some beloved characters do not make it. Original trekkers might be somewhat let down because they are seen in the television series later--but I guess we need something to add spice toward the plot.* I want to discuss something totally unrelated to the movie but involves the disabled. I took three friends who are blind---one with partial site. Despite their blindness, they have followed the original Star Trek series with aids--Audio Description devices. These are headphones that are worn during the movie that give audio description of each scene. When the movie came out, we made plans to see it. I called the theater to make sure that they had the headphones--they did. However, a day before we found out that they only had the device for only TWO movies! (not Star Trek) We were told it was theater policy to have audio description for only two movies showing. In other words, we were screwed! If a person needs this audio description, the theater will insert a CD up in the projection room which transmits to the headphones and is in sync with the movie. As long as the theater goer arrives on time for the movie and the projection room is notified, it is not a problem.So again, we were told we could not have the device for my blind friends. Also, my blind friends could not see any movie that they wanted, just what they had and MAYBE with a certain show time.---Long story short, my friends were on the phone all day with managers--that this was a violation of the Disability Act. In other words, if you're blind, you have a limited time frame to see a movie in a public movie theater! Very Discriminatory! We finally came to an agreement, They got the Audio description devices at a time agreed. we showed up on time, and ALL enjoyed the flick!But I had to post this to people who are not blind and want to go to the movies. Would you like your mobility limited because nobody bothered for your service?",9,1,6,24 May 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," A must see movie, very entertaining!
","Little Miss Sunshine is a very entertaining Comedy that explores dreams, family relationships and the disappointments that we face in life trying to find our dreams.First, we are introduced to Olive, a eight year old girl who dreams of being a beauty queen. By luck, she gets in the Little Miss Sunshine finals. When she and her family travel to the pageant, they encounter disaster after disaster....the bus breaks down, Cheryl's brother encounters an old flame, and a family death. Regardless, they brave the elements and forge on.The characters in this family are very much like oddballs. But they have a couple of similarities. They each have a dream or goal--whether it's winning a pageant, living with the one you love, becoming a pilot or landing a big business deal. The other common thing is despite the fights and bickering, they really stick together despite all disappointments.The movie in this context somewhat portrays a message. We all have dreams. To quit trying to get your dreams is dishonorable. Even if you have no hope--like Olive and her brother, it doesn't look like they'll get their labors rewarded, but the main thing is that they have each other. This film also kinda offers a look into the 'scary' world of child beauty contests--how doll like and perfect (and yet they are not perfect) itis. But brave little Olive shows them what the forge ahead spirit is!The only thing I can't understand in the movie...when Olive does her talent show performance (which her grandpa showed her how to 'dance') Didn't the parents or the rest of the family ever see this 'performance' (which is funny but uncomfortable in an adult point of view) Well, no matter...a must see movie!",9,2,4,12 September 2009
Behind The Candelabra," Shameful Film devoted to 'Mr Showmanship'
","I was somewhat disappointed to the HBO showcase film 'Behind the Candelabra' The film was based on a book written by Scot Thorson, the late Liberace's ex lover. That's about all I can say about the truth of it.What is shameful is the depictions of both Scot Thorson and Liberace. Scot Thorson who is adequately portrayed by Matt Damon is shown as some innocent wide eyed young man who is smitten with the glitz and glamor of Liberace, his life and house and estates. He seems to act how he has no idea that Liberace is sexually attracted to him. When he discover Liberace has some feelings for him, he does anything for him no matter how ridiculous or bizarre it is. He even enters like a blind puppy into the world of drug addiction with no caution or qualms.As for Michael Douglas's portrayal of Mr Showmanship-he is playing more of a horny drag queen than a seasoned performer. Liberace is shown more as a lecherous manipulative man who sends out someone to pimp new boyfriends. After he gains their friendship and trust, he then proceeds to control every aspect of their lives giving them free plastic surgery (to look like him) and 'adopting' them into his family. After he is bored or tires of them, he throws them out like an old rag. Does the deceased talented Liberace deserve this? The best thing of the film is that it does showcase Liberace's remarkable talent. I've personally never been to his shows but I heard that they were very entertaining with a lot of glitz,glitz,glitz--pure Vegas acts which seem to be losing their art today. What is even more interesting about Liberace's life is how he lived like a king! Gorgeous furnishings and yes...he did have a problem with his dogs (babies) pooping on the Turkish rugs. But Wow! he was the king of Vegas Outrageous!But lastly, please remember the film painted Thorson's character as more of an unwitting victim. Scott Thorson was arrested for burglary,credit card fraud and he knew a LOT of Gang and underworld characters so I ain't buying the victim story entirely and Liberace is not alive to dispute anything of course. I know Liberace was a VERY private person about his life and sexual preferences but I often wonder how hiscfamily feels about this 'chicken hawk' character they gave Liberace.Also, as for parental guidance rating---please remember there are a LOT of explicit sex scenes....I don't care if they are homosexual or not, just not the right type of picture for the very young to see.",6,10,19,7 June 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," a Thought Provoking Tale
","When The Boy in Striped Pajamas was released, I was interested in seeing it but it was not shown in many theaters except the late night artsey fartsy Cineplex's, so I waited and caught it on cable. It is sometimes slow moving but the story indicates that the evils of the world can invade a simple childhood idyllic world itself.First, you meet one of the main central characters, Bruno, son of a Nazi officer. Bruno seems to be a cloistered child, usually in books or his own imagination. One can argue that he is somewhat naive not seeing the Jewish hatred earlier with his sister joining the Hitler Youth or racist discussions at the dinner table.Bruno out of boredom and loneliness meets Schmuel, a Jewish child who is imprisoned in a Concentration camp near Bruno's home. It is somewhat a wonder how Schmual survived the selection process when he first entered the camp (history shows that children were murdered quickly or taken for 'experiments') but a friendship eventually forms between these two. Bruno does not see him as a Jew but just another child to talk too. And it seems thru this relationship Bruno is finally opening his eyes and seeing the hatred against the Jews because he does little things to try to help Schmuel--smuggle food, listen to stories, play some games....Finally, He tries to help Schmuel again by smuggling himself in the camp and sees all the hidden horrors. The ending is very sad and tragic. All of this story is thru the eyes of two children......And the horrors witnessed thru a child's eyes brought his family to full circle by seeing their wrong racist views against the Jews",8,1,1,11 May 2010
Paranormal Activity," Well Done 'Blair Witch' type flick.
","I heard the hype like the rest of the audiences did, but I have to admit that it was very well done demon flick.Take in mind that there are no real big special effects, very little blood but it had a hellava creep factor. It deals with the subject of demons and possession, and what happens after the lights are turned out at night. Paranormal Activity plays on our night fears of monsters lurking in the dark.Most impressive are the casts of unknown actors. Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat looked like the perfect matched couple. And these two when acting terrified, especially Katie are very believable characters and I see very lucrative acting careers ahead. Micah who played the skeptic never changes but Katie is very expressive from going from good to evil.I would recommend this as a good spooky film to see. The ending is VERY unsettling as well as the subject of demon possession. However, if you like slasher flicks, or non stop action thrillers with special effects--pass it up. Paranormal Activity will be remembered as one of the low budget films like 'Night of the Living Dead' to become a horror classic.",7,0,1,31 October 2009
Life Is Beautiful," A Bittersweet Holocaust Story
","Most Holocaust movies that I have seen were very graphic, very tragic survival stories. Life Is Beautiful is a Holocaust story that has a little twist in it's story telling. It is a movie that seems to add a human drama or feeling while also focusing on the horrors within.First, understand that the story is fictional but the atrocities and crimes of the Holocaust are very real. It is the story of Guido, a middle class Italian Jew who meets a upper class Chistian woman named Dora in Tuscony Italy. Dora,a somewhat shy but well bred woman with a streak of stubbornness falls for the clownish charms of easy going, Guido. Even though Guido knows that he may never marry Dora due to his social and possibly Jewish status, he takes every ample opportunity to see her. Finally, despite the thought of being shunned by society and Dora's family, Guido and Dora run away together in grand style. They end up married and with a beautiful son named Joshua and a happy life. But alas, storm clouds keep following them in the form of Dora's scorned and rejected old suitor assisted by Dora's family and a society now fueled by World War II with hatred toward the Jews. Guido, his uncle, and little Joshua are sent to a Concentration camp followed by faithful, loyal Dora who commits herself to share their fate. Guido is concerned over his son's survival in the camp and devises a bizarre but unique plan. From then on each day, is a quest for survival for Guido and his family. Will they survive? One thing you notice in the film is the sheer beauty of the settings and surroundings. The countryside and town are absolutely picturesque and striking, the food,flowers, the richness of the hotel just show the viewer a life that full of beauty that we tend to take for granted. I think this is done to show the viewer the beauty that is witnessed in life. Each day is a lovely sunny day full of adventure until the ugliness of racial hatred, and jealousy can mar it, we should appreciate all things in life even the finer things.One other thing to note in the film for musical soundtrack buffs, is that the soundtrack from Life is Beautiful is one of the most beautifully written scores. I urge all soundtrack collectors to add it to their resumes.",10,1,2,8 May 2012
Don't Breathe," A Deadly Blind Man's Bluff
","Anyone ever wonder how a blind person 'views' a movie? I have been dating a blind guy for some years now. What you would do is get a device called 'audio description' (ask for it at the box office.) It is required by ALL theaters to have it due to the Handicap Law. But sometimes--theaters do not and it doesn't always work. It is about the size of a Walkman and descriptions are given to the wearer about the scenes and action going on in the movie. If you are taking a blind person---They definitely WILL need this device.But anyhow...my 'blind date' heard about the movie and wanted to 'see' it. Don't Breathe is a movie that contains a lot of action and plot twists. The movie action and scenes move very quickly and to the point. Three punk teens are involved in a burglary ring. They make there vocation by breaking in homes, robbing and vandalizing them. For some reason, I don't know how but because of their lives--one girl named Rocky, a struggling abused single mother, one boy named Alex who lives in the shadow of his successful father (who owns a burglar alarm business--it's how Alex gets his info)and one common thief named Money that you tend to feel that they are somewhat justified for their crimes. But Alex gets some info about some blind war vet with a lot of money in his house. Perfect score, right?WRONG! the blind vet turns out to be a homicidal maniac who is driven mad about the death of his daughter. The blind guy is VERY skilled with a gun and he uses his other senses to survive this home invasion. It I definitely no cake walk robbing this guy.My blind date was amused somewhat about this blind vet turned into a 'Super Blink' He knew just how to protect himself and he did no the basic skills they teach the blind for everyday life. (Blind people listen very accurately and count steps and doorways in homes.) The violence is there---by today's standards and the gore factor is slim but the action twists and turns are abundant. Maybe a lot of hokum --killing people and beating them and they STILL get up. I won't give away the ending--for some reason it give me a strange feeling--but I can see a sequel possibly.So I would recommend it--good summer suspense that is not boring.",7,3,7,27 August 2016
