Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not perfect but who cares?
","Since when does a movie have to be perfect to be worth seeing?  Every critique of this movie in the 'major press' that I have read has labled this movie as being a potential flop and a failure.  The opinion, as stated in these papers, is that the movie's 'flaws' detract so much from the enjoyment of the film that the average person should not spend his/her money to see it.  Well, my question is who cares?  Yes the movie has flaws.  So what? It is also an enjoyable, imaginative and entertaining experience that you would be stupid to miss.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
