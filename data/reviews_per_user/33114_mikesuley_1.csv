First Man," A Masterpiece.
","The storyline is in the title. At the least, Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy should be nominated for their performances. Mr. Armstrong has been an enigmatic figure for almost 50 years. Gosling's subdued, dial-it-back performance makes an American icon human. The flag controversy perpetuated ion social media was a ruse. I will see this film again soon. Chazelle is the hottest director in Hollywood. A great film.",10,1,3,28 October 2018
