Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Indeed, High Five!
","I have now watched Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan twice in the last two days and I am still left a bit undecided on the film. Now, I must admit that the film definitely did make me laugh and that it did make me laugh quite loudly a some points, but I wonder if the laughter was a product of the actual comedic content of the film or to what lengths Sacha Baron Cohen would go to entertain his audience and after viewing this film it is quite obvious that he will go to some extreme lengths for some laughs even if those lengths can turn out to be quite tasteless and crude.Playing the character Borat from his popular cable television show Da Ali G Show, Cohen's character embodies every stereotype held by a number of Americans for individuals from a 'third world' country: heavily accented English, unfamiliar with a number of modern appliances, and quite barbaric in issues concerning equality of women, etc. Add to that a thick mustache and black, curly hair Cohen comes across as 'Muslim' which is an image that is oftentimes synonymous with 'terrorist' in the minds of a number of Americans. To add an even stronger sense of realism to his character Cohen does in fact speak in a foreign language, Hebrew, at various scenes in the film and his partner Ken Davitian speaks Armenian adding gloss to the two men's already impressive acting jobs.The film itself is quite simple. Borat along with his producer Azamat, Davitian, travel to the U. S. and A. to acquire knowledge in order to benefit their home. These problems include economic, social, and Jew (Cohen was called anti-Semitic by a number of individuals, but he is Jewish himself). After arriving in America after a lovely tour of his home village, Borat hits the streets of New York and tries to introduce himself to a number of individuals which often result in open acts of hostility towards our lanky host. Such scenes continue throughout the film when Borat visits Washington D.C., Atlanta, GA, etc., which results in a number of people revealing their prejudices unawares on camera, and some of their sentiments can be quite harsh especially the owner of the rodeo and the frat boys.Did Cohen play fair when he and director Larry Charles or can Borat be seen as a film in which a number of Americans expose their warts and all on film for an audience of millions to see? It is hard to say, but with all honesty, some of the individuals showed a great deal of patience with Cohen's character when he was pushing them to their limits. An interesting film that could be viewed from a number of perspectives, Borat definitely is not a film intended for wholesome family entertainment, but one that might show the prejudice and bigotry rampant that hides beneath the wholesomeness",8,1,6,16 March 2007
Oldboy," Do I Deserve to Live?
","Director: Park Chan Wook Duration: 120 minutesSome films just do not allow themselves to fall into generalizations and these films pose conundrums when one tries to explain them. I've owned _Old Boy_ for a number of months now, but for some reason or another I had been able to make myself sit down and watch the film. For some reason I thought it was a horror film and being that I generally do not care for horror films I let this one sit on the sidelines while I watched other films. However, I was finally inspired to watch this film when my Korean office partner told me how much she enjoyed the film, been amazed by Choi Min Sik's acting, and how long the film stuck in her head after watching it. Trusting my friend's taste in film, last night I finally settled down to watch the film and similar to my reaction with other films that I had underestimated, I wondered: Why the heck had I had not watched this film earlier?The film begins with a drunken Oh Daesu, Choi Min Sik, sitting in the police office. He is a noisy drunk heaping abuse on the police officers and constantly trying to urinate on the floor. He tells the police to let him go because it is his daughter' birthday, but when his pleas fall on death ears, he becomes even more recalcitrant to remain calm in the police office. Eventually Daesu's friend comes to pick up his inebriated friend. However, while talking to Daesu's daughter on the phone, the friend notices that Daesu is missing.Daesu finds himself imprisoned in a room that resembles a cheap motel room. Fed a diet of dumplings and with a television as his only companion, Daesu will live for fifteen years inside of that small room. Occupying his time watching television, punching the walls, writing the names of all who might have had him imprisoned in that room, watching television, and carving a hole in the wall with a metal chopstick, Daesu grows older his youth withered away within that room. However, one day, he finds himself on top of a building finally free to hunt the individual who had imprisoned him. Daesu eventually makes a new friend in the personage of the young sushi chef Mido, Gang Hye Jeong, who for some reason seems to fall for Daesu as he consumes a live squid, who accompanies him on his search for the individual who ruined his life. This is an extraordinary film. Choi Min Sik's acting is top notch and one can really feel his anger and frustration inside of his prison. I won't go into details here, but his performance during the final minutes of the film must be witnessed to be believed. The music is grand and the special effects are nicely done. The ant poking through Daesu's skin is creepy as hell.",10,11,99,23 April 2005
Casino Royale," A Brutal Bond
","Director: Martin Campbell Duration: 144 minutesWhile I have watched a number of James Bond films over the years I have never been what you could call a big fan of the industry. Of course I enjoyed the films, but as time went on they seemed to recycle the same set of ideas with their overly corny and cheesy dialogue. However, being James Bond films most viewers were probably there in the theaters to watch massive action scenes, explosions, and the new Bond girl. What this led to was a stream of amusing but ultimately sterile and formulaic films. However the new Bond film promised to be something different something that would break the mold for the standard Bond film. Therefore, when my girlfriend suggested that we go see the new Bond film, I was quite curious to see how Casino Royale measured up in comparison to the Bond films of the past. I must say that it surpasses not only most of the Bond films that I have watched but that it also surpasses most of the action films that I have seen as well.Casino Royale opens with a scene that precedes Bond's gaining 00 status and in this scene the viewer learns that before an agent can gain 00 status one must have two confirmed kills. Soon before making his second kill, the viewer is treated to a flashback scene in which Bond kills his first man. Unlike other Bond films in which the enemy might be blown up or shot, this enemy is drowned by having his face submerged in a sink. This scene is quite well done and it shows a different type of Bond than the ones portrayed by Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan: this one has flaws. Bond appears visibly shaken by killing his enemy and through the manner of the enemy's death a more brutal aspect is introduced to the Bond film industry and the impersonality of death by projectile weapons is replaced by a more physically aspect of brutal strength. Later in the film Bond strangles one of his enemies in a very intense fight scene. Another flaw that Bond possesses is an over-inflated ego that tends to get in the way of his missions and almost proves quite costly a number of times in the film. I find this flawed Bond to be quite refreshing after seeing the nigh invulnerability of past Bonds. Also, this Bond is the most cold-blooded Bond yet; his second kill is shot in the head with nary a thought, I am quite curious to see how the character as portrayed by Daniel Craig is going to develop over the next few films. If this film is any indication it is going to be quite a treat.Besides the more brutal aspect of the film, Casino Royale stands out as a truly well-done action film with some very impressive chase scenes and, like all other bond films, some quite interesting villains. Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of La Chiffre is quite magnificent. Also, of course, the film was made in locations of great natural and manmade beauty so it is quite a delight for the eyes as well.",9,1,3,24 December 2006
Kagemusha," A Shadow
","I am slowly wading through the huge backlog of Kurosawa Akira films that I have accumulated over the last few years. Last week I watched Rashomon for the second time and now I have finally watched the three hour long epic Kagemusha. I am glad I had to watch it for a class because three hours is quite a chunk of time. However, Kagemusha is quite a beautiful and entertaining film threaded with humor and sadness so its three hour time does not seem quite as long as it is.Opening with one long static shot, the viewer is presented with three men who practically look identical sporting the same kimono, hair style, and beard. We soon learn that the center figure is the warlord Takeda Shingen, the man on the left is his brother Nobukado, and the man on the right is a thief who was saved by Nobukado from being crucified because of his uncanny resemblance to Shingen. Nobukado desires to make the thief into a kagemusha, 影武者, shadow warrior, like himself so he can act as a double for Shingen. Shingen is against the idea at first, but is soon impressed by a loud outburst from the thief so he allows the man to be trained as his double.On the verge of achieving his dream of overtaking Kyoto and keeping his enemies Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu at bay, Shingen leaves the safety of his abode to listen to the flute played by an enemy with the confines of a blockaded castle. However, Shingen is shot and subsequently dies. Yet before he passes away he tells his men to keep his death for a secret for three years. With no other option available the ranking generals of Shingen's army keep their lord's death a secret and force the thief to play the role of Shingen. However, this is easier said that done Considered by critics and fans alike to be one of Kurosawa's most powerful, if more formulaic films, Kagemusha delves into the recesses of history and asks the questions what happened to Shingen? Why did he fail when he was so close to victory? However, this is only a small part of the films appeal. It, like many other Kurosawa films, shows how modernity, in this film rifles, impend on a culture. A great film that can be enjoyed at a number of levels, Kagemusha is a film to be watched not only by those who enjoy Kurosawa or samurai films, but by those who enjoy long epic films as well.",9,0,2,6 December 2006
