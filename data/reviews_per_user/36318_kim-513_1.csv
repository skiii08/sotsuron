Mission: Impossible III," This movie rocks!
","I went to see this with my husband over the weekend. It was packed even though the theatre had erroneously stopped listing the showing times for the evening outside. I was totally entertained, the acting was great, the casting was perfect. The action sequences were amazing. It was all around a very fulfilling movie. Totally beat MI2 and I think is better than the first one! Very enjoyable! People in the theatre were laughing at the funny parts and even ooh-in at the major action scenes. At the end there was a lot of clapping including from myself. No matter what silly criticism there may be out there, this was a great movie. Good job to all who made it! And may we have another?",10,0,1,15 May 2006
