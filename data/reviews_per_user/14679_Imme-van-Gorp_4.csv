10 Cloverfield Lane," Unfortunately the ending ruined an otherwise great film.
","This movie is full of suspense. It makes you guess about what is real and what is not. It happens more than once that you have to wonder about what is the truth and who is lying.Because you are just as clueless as the main character, Michelle, you really get to experience the same type of emotions and confusion as she is. This not only makes you feel closer to Michelle as a character, but also to the overall story.They did, however, ruin this connection that they build over the course of the story by making this sloppy, rushed and just strange ending. If they had made a different ending, my rating could have been an 8 or maybe even a 9. Depends on how good of an ending it would have been.",7,102,123,30 January 2019
Aquaman," Messy story, but not unredeemable.
","I really gave DC another chance after Wonder Woman, which I thought was a wonderful movie, but they have disappointed me again with Aquaman.---MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD---The story is extremely messy: there are a lot of things happening, but the movie never seems to focus on anything. Which is strange since they had more than enough time to do so: the movie's running time is rather long and, considering the story, should have been a lot shorter.The action scenes were boring and seemed to be going on forever. Up until the last 10 minutes, Aquaman was just a guy who could punch REALLY hard and who occasionally used a trident to do nothing more than use it as a sword. It isn't until the last scene that he gains his extraodinary powers of being able to control the ocean and its inhabitants. Therefore, all the action before that moment was a snoozefest and also took forever. You just want them to go on with the story.Granted, both Aquaman and his love interest, Mera, are very easy on the eye, which makes it (at least in my opinion) more entertaining to watch, but on that alone you can't build an entire movie.The visuals of Atlantis weren't as beautiful as I expected them to be: I was kind of confused as to what it even really was. It just seemed like a big ruin (and a lava pit?) with a couple of high tech water ships floating above it. The sea did have some pretty lights in it though, but what the meaning of them was is still unclear to me..They also tried to create a villain who had absolutely nothing to do with Atlantis, but merely had a personal vendetta with Aquaman. The story doesn't pay any attention to him until he comes in handy for some action scenes though. Why the audience should even consider him a threat is still completely lost on me, but maybe I'm missing something.Overall, I did not enjoy this movie very much, but to be honest, I still have hope for the Aquaman character. Yes, this movie wasn't all that great, but they didn't ruin his story. Therefore, I think that if they would make a sequel, it could still be a good movie as long as they do things differently than they did in the first. I would consider to go see a sequel, so I guess the movie sort of did what it needed to do..",7,100,196,13 January 2019
Dunkirk," Very interesting movie.
","Dunkirk is a war movie that shows three different storylines that sort of come together at the end. Every storyline follows a certain individual in a certain situation. This makes it so that you can really see what happens during an event like this for multiple different kinds of people. It brings you closer to what's happening instead of a main character or something.The first storyline is on land and is mostly played by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Aneurin Barnard. It follows an inexperienced soldier (Whitehead) who is just trying to find a way out of Dunkirk, just like every other soldier at the beach. He then picks up two soldiers (Styles and Barnard) along the way who he stays with for the rest of the journey. I think the best thing about this storyline was the constant fear you felt for what could happen. Something I found really good was the chemistry between Whitehead and Styles, I think the best parts from this storyline were whenever Styles got on screen.The second storyline is in the sky and is mostly played by Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden. It follows two pilots, who sort of witness all the horrible events from above, while trying to help as much as they can. I think I least enjoyed this storyline out of the three of them, because it felt very unpersonal and I wasn't really impressed by anything that happened during these parts. The best thing about this storyline must be Tom Hardy, since his acting was, as always, on par.The third storyline is at sea and is mostly played by Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney. It follows a man, a son and a young assistant going off to sea to try and save some of the men stuck at Dunkirk. I was very impressed with Glynn-Carney's acting during his parts and I very much enjoyed it. I think this has to be the most emotional storyline, because you get closest to these three characters out of the whole film, but one might argue that it is also the most boring storyline, because there isn't that much fear that anything will happen to them.",7,31,52,12 May 2018
Mission: Impossible," Wait.. What?
","This movie was definitely trying hard to be smarter than it actually was. Some of the plot twists, if you can even call them that, just simply didn't make any sense.The story was also harder to follow than it needed to be and lets definitely not forget that the stunts were extremely unrealistic and over the top.Sure, this movie does also have its good moments, but that won't stop you from feeling confused during most of it.If you're a big fan of spy movies, I'd say give it a go, but if you're new to the genre, I'd suggest you start with something else first.",5,26,35,5 August 2018
