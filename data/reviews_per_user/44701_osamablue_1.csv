Scarface," EXCELLENCE FROM START TO END
",Scarface is undoubted among one of the best movies ever made in the history. It depicts the wild nature of Tony Montana and his unleashed demeanour throughout. Mr. Alpacino was born to play Tony Montana and no one could ever play that role as Pacino did!,10,1,1,9 March 2020
