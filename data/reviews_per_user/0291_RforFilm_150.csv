The Lobster," The Lobster is a surreal and funny story about the stress of relationships. It's defiantly an acquired taste movie
","Our world has been changing a lot recently. Interracial relationships, orientation exploration, people questioning their gender, and revaluation of their faith has become more acceptable in a period where the internet and social media has opened doors that have been closed for so long. Places like Facebook and Instagram have let people know more about themselves, creating something of a revolution for those that are different. Though I still feel like that there is a benefit to privacy, this has given people more of an openness to new ideals, so I can give them credit for creating new social norms. One thing that still happens to raise eyebrows is when we find people that are not just single, but those that don't want to be in a romantic relationship. Society does place a lot of pressure for everyone to try to find a significant otherand to do it before it's too late. It's not just our media that's filled with constant relationship programs, but entire industries are built upon this with wedding, family, and even travel that supports the idea that no one should ever be alone. The Lobster is a surreal comedy that explores just how forced we are into relationshipsor not. Within the rules of an unnamed city, being single is forbidden. This is the case for a middle age man David (played by Colin Farrell) whose wife leaves him for another man. Now free, he is taken to a resort where all single people go. They are given forty-five days to find someone they like (they have to say which gender they want as bisexuality is forbidden as well) or they will be turned into an animal of their choice. As with the title of the movie, David decides that he'd like to be a lobster as he likes the ocean and he would be able to live for a long time.The hotel is filled with various dances and propaganda that fuels the importance of having a companion from the ban of masturbation to stage plays on why we need someone by our side. David talks to the other people that are also there, which include a Lisping Man (played by John C. Reilly), a Limping Man (played by Ben Whishaw) and a Nosebleed Woman (played by Jessica Barden). Outside of the hotel are a group of Loners, led by their leader (played by Léa Seydoux), who are hunted by the hotel guests in exchange for extra days to find a companion.I'll start by saying that The Lobster has a lot of creativity for creating this unique world that's clearly addressing the problems of our society (not just American, but worldwide) about the pressures of relationships. But without spoiling anything, the movie intelligently shows the other side's faults on why putting a label on something like love or solitude isn't a good thing. The joke of the movie is that everything is set is place, so most of the cast has a deadpan way of communicating, even during some of the more emotional moments. Some might see this as a problem, but independent filmmaker Yourgos Lanthimos uses it to his comedic advantage. Much of the ideas are surreal, especially with how they handle the idea of people remaining animals for the rest of their lives. The Lobster, like The Tree of Life and Eraserhead, is an acquired taste that not everyone is going to like. This movie may have a three act story, it's logic falls into the emotional category on how the film progresses. My only problem is the final scene, which tries for something ambiguous, but came off as incomplete. The Lobster is a movie that deals with getting answers, and I wish the ending had gone on longer.I'll give this eight lobsters out of ten. If someone were to tell me that this wasn't their cup of tea, I'd totally understand. This is a story that you simply have to allow to let loose to see what kind of emotion it can get from you. It makes you question just why society puts stress on relationships, so see if you can gain a proper insight.",8,6,11,9 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," This won't be lost like tears in the rain. Blade Runner 2049 is an even greater movie then the original
","This era has seen a resurgence of storytelling from the 1980s. This doesn't just mean reboots and sequels from that time, but the themes of that as well. One such is the dystopian future. People tend to forget that the idea of a future in shambles was once new and fresh. Ray Bradbury once said that he wrote dystopian stories to prevent, not make the future. Once movies like Terminator, Soylent Green, and Robocop became popular, every science-fiction story had to get in on that game. One movie however, got out one of the most intriguing and impressive visions of tomorrow, Blade Runner. Based on the Philip K. Dick story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner is a heavily layered story about the moral consequences of recreating the human consciousness and whether they would even help humanity. It became a cult classic that many critics have gone to claim as one of the greatest movies of all time. I myself like it fine, though see it as too slow and dull to watch multiple times. It's a movie I highly respect for it's design, but do care about its themes. I was intrigued to return to this world in Blade Runner 2049. In 2049, human androids called 'replicants' have been engineered to obey and have become a part of society to ensure humanity's survival. A replicant named K (played by Ryan Gosling) works for the LAPD as a 'blade runner' who hunts and 'retires' the older replicant models who can go rogue (like from the previous movie). His investigation into 'retiring' another replicant Sapper (played by Dave Bautista), he finds a set of human remains. After having them analyzed, they appear to be remains of a replicant. To add on to that, it died from an emergency C-section. This is baffling, as pregnancy was thought impossible for replicants. K is ordered his superior Joshi (played by Robin Wright) to destroy all the evidence in the case. When he returns to scene of the crime from earlier, he finds a date that corresponds to something that happened when K was younger. This leads him to examine whether he may or may not be a replicant. He tracks down former blade runner Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) to find answers. At the same time, replicant creator and head of the Wallace Corporation Niander Wallace (played by Jared Leto) sends his enforcer Luv (played by Sylvia Hoeks) to go after K. Considering how things could have gone, a sequel to Blade Runner is a major gamble. Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 is the rare movie that continues to build upon the world that was established before, and even improves on the original. Yes, I think that this is better then the 1982 classic. Director Denis Villeneuve has managed to take the two things that made original memorable and expand on them here; the style and substance.I'll say upfront that Blade Runner 2049 has to be one of the greatest looking movies of all time. And I'm not just talking about the design of the tech noir architecture of Los Angeles (which actually has a chance to look larger then before), but within the cinematography. Every shot is like a beautiful painting of high technological tragedy that reflects the future of humanity and it's reliance on the dreams and fears of tomorrow. I'll say now that this movie may have won all the technical awards, but I'll bet my money that it's cinematographer will go home with an Oscar. This is a rare time that I feel like I'm seeing the two hundred million dollar budget with every penny spent well. The script builds further on the fears of Phillip K. Dick and his fascination with where we could go wrong. The themes of the moral consequences will make you question whether humanity in this world is even worth saving. Who knows? This movie is just as layered as the original, if not more, as replicants seem to be more in the spotlight, therefor throwing you off as you constantly have to figure out just how much more human are the androids? Even with the new restrictions given here. If I had any problem, is that the movie may be a little too long. I may be in the minority, but I still catch glimpses of the dull pace that I didn't like for the original. At nearly three hours, that's a lot to ask from a mainstream audience. I know that fans of the original won't care, but what about the newcomers. You don't necessarily have to seen the original Blade Runner to enjoy this, but it helps. Wouldn't it have hurt to add an intermission, just so that we can catch our breath? I'll give this ten wooden horses out of ten. Even if your not a science fiction fan, I still encourage you to catch thisin theaters at my most insistent. All that style is going to be a visual thanksgiving on the big screen. So check it out to see this is a memory that won't be lost like tears in the rain.",10,4,12,11 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Million Dollar Story probably as a better story then then movie portrays
","I'm gonna come clean. I don't like to watch soccer. I'm sorry, but I find the sport visually boring. I don't mind play with the ball, but watching the professional sport just doesn't sell well to me as well as something like baseball. I know like any sport, being able to be a pro at soccer is a gift. If I was as good as Pele was, I'd be on that field in a heartbeat. I don't understand the fandom. I know that soccer or 'football', as the rest of the world calls it, brings in a big audience worldwide.Maybe it's a cultural thing or possibly that I don't know much about soccer, but I won't fault somebody for liking something that I don't. Where I'm getting at is introducing a foreign sport can't be easy, especially if there is already some parallel equivalent. Like how us Americans have baseball while most of the world has cricket. I haven't seen enough of the sport to have a say, but I know that bringing it to the US would be difficult. I know how difficult baseball was bringing it to the UK. Million Dollar Arm is about bringing baseball to India. In the early 2000's, a sports agent J. B. Bernstien (played by John Hamm) is loosing clients to bigger firms that can promise players more money upfront. Bernstien seems to be at the end of his career until he gets an idea while watching cricket t home. After making a deal with a billionaire, he arranges a trip to India to start a big reality show called 'Million Dollar Arm'. The idea here is to scout through thousands of people signing up and trying out to possibly become the first major league players from India. Along for the ride is an Indian business partner, baseball scout Ray Poitevint (played by Alan Arkin) and an Indian baseball fanatic Amit Rohan.The contest ends with two candidates, Dinesh and Rinku, two young men who have never played baseball nor cricket, but seem to have strong arms to pitch. The two are sent to Los Angeles along with Bernstien and Amit who look to train them for a year before giving them a tryout. Though Bernstien seems to see his candidates as future stars, he doesn't see that the two guys are far from home and only have USC pitching coach Tom House to teach them about the game. Bernstien later learns about caring and such, bonding with the two and giving them the chance of a lifetime. The problem with a lot of sports stories is that they are mostly underdog scenarios that we've seen before. The Bad News Bears started this trend, you know about the misfits that nobody thinks has a chance until someone comes along to build them into star players. Million Dollar Arm is nothing that different. It two has the misfits, our two Indian guys, and a guy who learns the lesson about teamwork, Bernstien. Give me a break. Inside Million Dollar Arm is an original story, but the movie treats it like any other old sports movie. Why couldn't the movie be fully focused on the reality show and the travels in India or keep the focus on the two Indian guy throughout. Most of the movie is seen watching John Hamm trying his hardest, but having little to work with. The movie looks impressive and is acted well, but you know what's gonna happen, whose gonna learn which lesson. If you're a baseball fan or simply looking for a nice story about underdogs, you'll get your feel here. But I doubt this will rank among better baseball movies like League of Our Own or The Sandlot. I'll give this three Indian baseball caps out of five. Million Dollar Arm is what you expect if that's what you want. An underdog story. But as so, it could have pushed itself for a home run",5,1,4,21 May 2014
First Man," First Man puts you in that pilots seat for a small step, but a giant leap of a great movie
","If there's anything that my father loves talking about is spaceflight and the Apollo missions to the moon. Given his age, he lived through the sixties as a child and saw astronauts like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as idols that were able to push the frontier and visit the moon. Most people know that the whole point to get to the moon was to simply do it before the Soviets would have. Of course they never made it, but it was still such an accomplishment to be able to get people to the moon and back. Now we've had movies about this before, though the most well known is the Ron Howard film, Apollo 13. In an essence, I can see that story being more attractive as it was, to quote NASA, 'A successful failure'. Apollo 11 was a mission that went right from the beginning to the end. Like a lot of great innovations, most people don't know the work and struggle it took to reach them. In the case of space, the pressure was greater as they were working to beat the Soviet Union to the moon. First Man details the accounts of NASA's working to reach the moon and Neil Armstrong's perspective. NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong (played by Ryan Gosling) is reserved, but hard working as he is willing to push boundaries to achieve scientific achievement. He is just as willing to do everything to try and save his sick daughter, but fails as she dies from a brain tumor. This makes him more willing to dive into his work, not wanting much sympathy from his colleagues. In the process he applies and makes it as an astronaut in the Project Gemini program, causing he and his family to relocate to Houston, Texas where the other astronauts live. With the support of his wife Janet, he provides whatever help he can to get NASA further.He's assigned to Gemini 8, where they are hoping to make the possibility of docking work. The mission is a success and even manages to stop their ship from spinning when trying to make it home. This gives NASA lead way to start the Apollo program where his friend Ed White is assigned. Unfortunately, the launch fails as a fire kills all members of Apollo 1. For the new Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong is selected to command it along with Buzz Aldrin (Played by Corey Stoll) and Jim Lovell (played by Pablo Schreiber).Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land) is clearly passionate about this era, because First Man takes a part of history and takes it's audience on a thrilling adventure. Movies like The Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and Hidden Figures may have been great representations of NASA's accomplishments, but First Man does add an element not present before; gritty reality. While the previous movies list did show how hard things were, the cinematography really puts us within the perspectives of these astronauts, showing how tight and how little visibility they had when piloting these rockets and machines. It reminds me of a horror movie because being a pioneer can be scary; space is unpredictable and it was amazing that it was done given their conditions. Many of the camera angles are done from a first person perspective, giving us the audience Neil Armstrong's uncertain road ahead of him. We know he made it, but the movie does a great job of making us forget about that. My favorite has to be his walk through the NASA halls before he's strapped in for his Gemini mission. I felt that same sweat dripping from my neck that I'm sure astronauts still have today. 
I should mention Ryan Gosling and his performance. In short, it's also great. You get an immediate sense that Neil Armstrong is such a stoic and humble individual that his personality could have easily come off as boring. Ryan Gosling can often do that, but you get a sense that he's just as passionate about his job as the other astronauts. Armstrong was simply more reserved and movies rarely portray these types of people. I myself am typically reserved and hope this movie shows that we have passion; like Armstrong, were just selective about who can witness our vulnerability. I'll give this ten Apollo pictures out ten. First Man is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2018. It's fascinating, thrilling, thought provoking, and showcases another side of history that even when we succeed, we always need to be ready to fail so that we learn from it and not repeat those mistakes. The Apollo missions have always seemed like a million in one odds-type success stories. First Man was a story with those odds and pulled a happy success. Take the launch and see this movie.",9,0,1,17 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Though I would have rather gotten one 4 hour movie, Hunger Games: Mockingly Part 1 is satisfying enough to make me want to see the final story next time
","Let's face it, at least once in your life, you've fallen into a leader position for which you were either not ready or simply had no interest in. Some people want to be leaders and some would rather follow. I've heard of people wondering why some people don't take greater control of their life and to quit some dead end job that won't make them which. What the asking people don't understand is that while there is certainly a mindset to be your own person, you also need a particular personality. There are people out that simply feel better to taking instruction rather then give them. It's not that they don't want anything better in life, they simply don't feel like they need more; in another word, they're content.This leads to Katness Everdeen's position as a leader in The Hunger Games franchise. This poor teenager had never dreamed of doing anything else besides farming and hunting. She may have the survival skills that helped her win the games the first time, but it spiraled out of control when she was seen as the sign of a revolution. She never wanted to take the spotlight, but she at least does her best with the situation. This is what makes her a great character. We are going into the beginning of the end here with The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1.The previous movie ended with Katness escaping the Games into a hideout while Peeta was left behind.Living under the ruins of District 13, Katness Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) along with the other tributes that made it out, have been learning more about how a huge group of rebels have been planning an attack on the capital for a while. Katness is reunited with her mother, sister Prim-Rose and even Effie Trinket (played by Elizabeth Banks), but is bitter about leaving Peeta behind. She's introduced to the rebel leader, President Alma Coin (played by Julianne Moore) who asks Katness to be the 'Mockingjay' for their cause. She says no, but changes her mind once she's shown two horrific sites; her District 12 bombed out and Peeta (played by Josh Hutcherson) now appearing on Capital TV, with his mind brainwashed, asking for the rebels to stop. After staring in a series of propaganda commercial for the rebels, she then travels to District 8 to meet the injured, but only before the capital shows to bomb the place. Still going, Katness vows to continue fighting the Capital as she juggles being a symbol and sticking to her oath of saving Peeta. I've never been a fan of splitting stories. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 1 suffers from really only being half of a story. I would have been willing to sit through a four-hour movie, and I think fans would have done so too. Does only having a little of a story ruin it? Not totally. In fact, I still recommend this movie as a great continuation of this saga. I've warmed up to The Hunger Games more recently as it's manages to get across a grim subject to teenagers and young adults about post traumatic stress and a Soviet-like government (I can't recommend this to anyone under 12 though; too violent). As before, the cast from before takes it's story very seriously and all play the parts well. Julianne Moore is a nice welcome who rarely picks a bad role. My favorite newcomer is Natalie Dormer as the resident director of Katness's propaganda movies. She is passionate about the rebellion, but knows when enough work is enough to allow Katness to be herself. I'll give this seven hanging trees out of ten. What may throw off previous fans is that this is a slower, more political based Hunger Games story. Action fans will probably be pleased, though not as much as before; they just need to really pay attention. I'd see the other movies before checking this out. I'll be checking the final one come next year!",7,1,10,9 December 2014
Your Name.," For a romantic body swap story, Your Name is possibly one of the most beautiful, best anime features ever made
","What makes love hard to define is the connection that it develops between people. Think about the people that your with everyday. We think about friendship, love, lust, and companionship when your with those friends or lovers. The lines are drawn, but it can be blurred based on the invisible connection that you have with them. Even if you don't see them that day, you still feel their presence in your daily lives, as they feel the same in return. Not only is it metaphysical, but it's also feels like destiny when two lovers can feel that passion when their miles away. I've heard about these kinds of stories done in film and television, but I haven't seen it done in animation. I'm not talking about the countless Disney animated features that have the princess meet her man and their in love in three days; I mean a genuine romance that dives into to relationship and connection that two people have that's hard to explain. I'm thankful that a company like Funimation is willing to release such a film here in America with an English dubbing. So let's see how far a film like Your Name can push this idea. In the small lake/mountain town of Itomori, a teenage girl Mitsuha is board of country life and wishes that she were a boy living in Tokyo. The next morning, she wakes up in an unfamiliar room. She goes along with it, assuming it's a dream, and finds out that the body belongs to Taki, a Tokyo-based teenage boy who is quiet and works as a waiter. When she wakes up the next day, she's back in her body, but finds out that her body swap was not a dream as her friends tell her she was acting weird the other day. It turns out that Taki had her body vice versa. Trough a trust, Mitsuha and Taki make a set a rules on what to do when their body swaps happen. Taki ends up making Mitsuha more popular in school while Mitsuha improves Taki's relationships with his friends and boss at the restaurant. The two start to develop romantic feelings for each other, but after Taki fails to call her, the body swaps stop. Taki then uses his drawings of that mountain town to try and find it to hopefully find Mitsuha.It doesn't seem like much of a story, but I cannot give anymore of Your Name away as the majority of it is how much you don't know. It's a rare movie that not only has two twists, but is also a beautiful story of love. The script understands that true love happens over time, and the voice actors channel a lot of that emotion. Again, without spoiling it, the movie turns into an engaging mystery that made me want to see if the two would end up with each other. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about a romantic movie.For a movie that didn't really need to be animated, Your Name looks amazing. When I think of good anime, I think of Studio Ghibli. This was produced by an independent studio that may just rival Ghibli. The animation is heavily detailed and uses it's style to it's advantage to tell the story of time-crossed lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if the production had started years ago, as I cannot imagine this being done quickly. I'm sorry that I can't give more information on what kind of story this is, but if you knew, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did. Even after it ended, I told myself that I would go see this againÂ… which I will.I'll give this ten comets out of ten. Though the summer season hasn't started, Your Name may already be my favorite movie of the year. It may be also one of the greatest anime features I've seen, up on the same levels as Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies. It's poetic, Shakespearian, philosophical, beautiful and engaging. I definitely recommend that you see this, in theaters if possible. If the stars can align and more people can see this, we can get more stories like this.",10,4,8,27 April 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Relying on the little we know, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a great semi sequel that's better then the original
","In a lot of ways, J.J. Abrams has become something of a modern day Steven Spielberg. He likes to produce stories with action that are surrounded in mystery. Given how the marketing campaigns for the Star Trek, Lost TV series and the recent Star Wars film gave away very little during the previews, I almost forgot that earlier Spielberg movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Indiana Jones all sold us on the idea that we know what were getting, yet there was something else that we were not seeing. A hidden villain, a hidden prize, or a hand reaching into the unknown, stuff like this will certainly draw people into the story further.One such film of his was the found footage monster movie, Cloverfield. Rather then putting the focus on the monster, the focus was on the people and their horror as the city of New York was now the playground to some space creature. Believe it or not, the original Godzilla also had a similar focus was that was all about the horrors of the Hiroshima bombing. While Cloverfield wasn't a great movie, it did help boast the popularity of monster movies again. WeÂ…kind of return to the same world with the long awaited sequel, 10 Cloverfield Lane.Rather then a found footage movie, this is shot more like a traditional film.We open with Michelle (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who's leaving her apartment in New Orleans to head up north. She senses the feeling that she's being watched at a gas station, but she continues further down the road. After a brief phone call from her boyfriend, she gets into a car crash, leaving her unconscious. She wakes up sometime later in a room with no windows and chained to the wall. After nearly setting a fire as a means of escape, she then meets local farm boy Emmett (played by John Gallagher, Jr) and the maker of the bunker their currently in, Howard (played by John Goodman). Howard tries to explain that while he rescued Michelle, there was some sort of an attack on all the major cities and that the outside air in contaminated, but she doesn't believe him. She tries at one point to escape, but see's an older woman with burns on her face, suggesting that Howard may have been right. The three adjust to a life within the underground bunker, but Michelle still senses something may be up.In terms of it's connection to the first movie, you could say that this is a totally different movie, yet this still qualifies as a monster movie. It's a kind of monster that you'd find in another horror movie, but I don't want to give anything away. With the majority of the movie being set in the bunker, 10 Cloverfield Lane takes full advantage of it's claustrophobic environment, making for a tense thriller. The film creates something that feels homely, yet tight in the bigger moments that require wishful thinking.The acting is phenomenal. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has only had a few supporting roles in Live Free or Die Hard and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, but she shows a lot of rage from her performance, going from frightened of her surroundings, to looking for right way out. John Goodman is an actor who we've seen for a while, but has unfairly not had a chance to play a role that is as big as this. Much of 10 Cloverfield Lane centers around the role-play between the two and how much they can out smart and dominate each other.Fans of the original may be put off by the sudden change in tone and even genre. But what's making the Cloverfield franchise fascinating is how little we know about the creatures that are attacking the Earth. Maybe Cloverfield 3 can give us some more clues. I'll give this nine puzzle pieces out of ten. From the producer mind of J.J. Abrams, comes a compelling thriller that seems to be a small part of a bigger story in a good way. 10 Cloverfield Lane is the rare sequel that manages to out do the original.",9,0,2,16 March 2016
The Finest Hours," This old-fashioned sea story of The Finest Hours can't save itself from a weary tone
","Like a lot of people, I'm terrified of the idea of having to swim in the dark. It doesn't matter where the water source is (the ocean, a swamp or even a regular swimming pool), but if I can't see what's beneath me, then who knows what could be down there. In a way looking at dark water is like looking deep into space with the both environments being unknown, mysterious and could turn on you in a heartbeat. If there's nothing in the water, then I still hate thinking that if was in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. If I can't see my own toes, then there's something unsettling about that. Luckily, the job of jumping into that dark water rests upon the coast guard who are the first responders to any sea emergency. It was only before I stepped in to see The Finest Hours that I realized that very few movies that are about the Coast Guard. It's fair to say that other military branches tend to get more attention then the sea bound team. The Finest Hours chronicles one of their most dangerous rescue attempts that will make you glad to be wrapped in blanket on those cold nights.It is 1952 where Coast Guard crewman Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) makes a life for himself in Chatham, Massachusetts where he meets and falls in love with a young woman, Miriam Pentinen (played by Holiday Grainger). They set April 16 as the wedding date while winter is still upon the Cape Cod town, covering the city in a nearly whiteout storm. Bernie asks for permission for marriage from his commanding officer, Daniel Cluff (played by Eric Bana), but is insulted for having to ask to be married. It is then Bernie sees that the rest of the Coast Guard crewmen see him as a guy who only follows orders.Meanwhile, an oil tanker, the SS Pendleton breaks in half during a storm while out on the ocean. The surviving crew, which consists of engineers, cooks, and the lone sailor, Ray Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), see that their not too far from land, but still need rescue.Bernie gets called to go rescue the survivors with only a few crewmen on a lifeboat, even though the nor'easter is still fiercely rough. Despite having a small boat, his compass gone and cold weather beating him up, he still attempts one of the craziest rescues in military history.The Finest Hours has plenty of material to make a great story from a likable real life solider to a stormy sea that even Moby Dick would have found too rough. It's a shame that the final product was simply too forgettable and surprisingly dull. It seems that the tone of the story was to make this more of a typical day then a major rescue (at least until towards the end). I can understand doing that to make the Coast Guard characters more relatable, but it can backfire, and it does here. If these people don't see this as something major, then why should it's audience?The best thing about the movie are the two stars, Chris Pine and Casey Affleck who are both playing different kinds of leaders. They do their parts well enough, but it's the rest of the characters that have little identity aside from their jobs. I know I should be worried about those on the oil tanker, but the movie needed more time for us to get to know these people better. Instead, the narrative only seems to be to do it's sea job, go to the next and do the next job.I'll give this five Coast Guard boats out of ten. The old fashioned story of the coast guard has it's moments in the second half, but are not enough the fixed the deluded tone that the first half is seemingly stuck with. The Finest Hours might make for an okay history lesson, but not a satisfying action movie nor a romance.",5,8,20,4 February 2016
War Dogs," War Dogs has some shiny weapons and story: it needed more ammunition to fire off
","Funding the military is expensive. We have bases all over the world, each with facilities and housing for those solders. Each solider (over a million of them) is carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment and weaponry. I bring this up because war may be a travesty, but it's a business opportunity itself. Several companies are out and about to generate the best material for the armed forces to use, and to do so in an inexpensive way. While I doubt I could ever get into that business (personal morals would prevent me), I can see why gunrunning would seem attractive to those that want the high life. The subjects within War Dogs are gunrunners, but they're also very young. Their college aged, which would make their maturity a big question. The good news is that if your smart enough, then age doesn't matter. What matter's is how well your know your clientele and the best manner to negotiate with. The early 2000's was a period of two wars; the War on Terror in the Middle East and the Invasion of Iraq. Both would obviously require some ammunition. Let's see how the real life subjects handled these ends in War Dogs. Starting off in 2005 in Miami, David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) is a guy with little direction. He dropped out of college, has failed in a business selling sheets to retirement homes, and makes a small living as a massage therapist. While attending a funeral for a friend, he spots his middle school buddy Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill). The two meet up where we find out that the two did bad things in their youth and Efraim's parents sent him away to work with his uncle's arms business. Efraim has now returned and tells David about his new business venturethe war.Despite not agreeing with the war, David comes on board when his girlfriend Iz becomes pregnant. Efraim shows him how they acquire these contracts: the Pentagon has a website a lot like a job search site where they have thousands of listings for businesses to put a bid into. They manage to acquire contracts from Bagdad to Albania where they stay true to their word and become millionaires overnight. As Efriam's company gets bigger, his greed grows (along with a drug addiction) and tensions rise when David is forced to live in Albania to secure a 30 million deal with a terrorist watch list candidate Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).The idea of irresponsible people getting into a shady business and rising in that world is nothing new. Scarface did this (and is referenced several times. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Lord of War and Pain & Gain did this. What does War Dogs have to offer that's new? The movie brings these two guys who are played well by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. The movie shows that these guys would be smart enough to pull off these government deals by day while going to Miami nightclubs at night. War Dogs is a nice looking movie. Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy) has a way of shooting his comedies like thrillers. A lot of that has to do with how he uses lighting. His colorful shooting of Miami becomes brighter once we arrive in the bleaker and grayer Albania. For his first mature story, Todd Phillips found a good blend of political problems, comedy, and some surprising thrills. What's lacking is a closer study at the relationship between these two. With what could have been a dramatic look into these two young men is more of a party. At least what they say can be interesting at times.I'll give this six machine guns out of ten. I can't say that War Dogs is an intelligent insight into how the government acquires its weaponry, but its still an entertaining look at some smart individuals. This needed a Martin Scorsese like director to really help this take off. I can still have fun with this.",6,2,4,22 August 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Oil and fire create a floating hell in Deepwater Horizon, which creates gripping recreation of the tragedy
","In this day and age of climate change, the world still runs around the oil wheel. It's easy to see why it's called Texas gold; it powers so many elements we live on (vehicles, houses, machines, etc), and it's use only tends to grow. Because it's taken millions of years for this fossil fuel to develop, it's getting scarcer then ever and we've engineered ways to retrieve it deep in the ocean. As I learned at EPCOT when I was nine, most of the oil rigs in the ocean are taller then the Empire State Building. I can certainly admire how far we've come to make that vision become a reality.The darker side of the picture is that these oil rigs are owned by major companies and they make a lot of money off of this energy. This has made it easy for their greed to make the majority of the decisions, regardless of the environment. One of their decisions caused the 2010 Oil leak of the Gulf of Mexico. It spewed millions of gallons of petroleum making it the worst oil disaster in US history. The story of the ship that started it is retold in the dramatic disaster film, Deepwater Horizon. We start on the morning of April 20, 2010 where Chief Electronics Technician Mike Williams (played by Mark Wahlberg) is waking up with his wife Felicia (played by Kate Hudson). He's leaving for another round on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which is out on the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the other people joining his is supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell), navigation worker Andrea Fleytas (played by Gina Rodriguez) and the rest of the oil workers. Coming on board in BP (the company in charge of the Deepwater Horizon) is corporate man Donald Vidrine (played by John Malkovich).Jimmy and Mike make it clear to Donald that the ship and it's machines are in need of great repair and that it's errors have placed a lot of strain on the oil well. It seems to be releasing gas pressures higher then usual, but Donald see's this as routines and orders to run tests as scheduled. Just as history as taught us, the pressure of the petroleum proves too much, causing it to erupt and set off a series of explosions. Or that night, Deepwater Horizon became a floating Hell as the surviving oil workers get off before it's too late.Directed by Peter Berg and staring Mark Wahlberg, Deepwater Horizon has a similar feel to their previous collaboration, Lone Survivor. Again, the focus seems to be more about the experience rather then a character study. While the later felt more empty then it should have been, this style works much better here. This film is set up more like a disaster film, which means you know your going to get an exciting series of action, but not so much in character. This proves similar here as it was hard to distinguish personalities from the various people on that ship (I think they were hoping the actors playing the real life characters would fill the gaps).Much of the dialogue consists of a lot of how the oil rigs work and the controversies surrounding the age of their equipment. A lot of that was hard to follow, with the exception of the material aiming to make BP the villain here. Though I was alright with that, I could tell the majority of the audience was waiting for the rig to go off and get on with the action scenes. Had more work been put into the first half, I would have proclaimed this as one of the best of the year. But as a simple disaster movie, it was an entertaining story about survival.I'll give this six oil spill updates out of ten. Overall, I felt like the experience was genuine, but I wish the characters would have been more interesting to follow. While I'm sure they took creative liberties, this is a case in which I would have wanted more in order to make a better movie. Sometimes changes are needed to tell a better story. If you can, see this on the big screen if you really wanted to know what being on the Deepwater Horizon before that tragic oil spill.",6,2,4,3 October 2016
It," Pennywise returns after a 27 year slumber. As a coming of age story with horror elements, It is very entertaining
","Within the misty Northeast of Maine, rests a place called Derry, that seems like any other white- picket fence small town with a main street and a parade every forth of July. In the sewers, however, lies an evil that has appeared in many forms, but for the children that have encountered it, see him as Pennywise, the dancing clown. This is the description of one of the most famous Stephen King stories, It. Though the books goes into a lot of existential material on how the creatures comes from outside the universe, the story of a clown haunting a town has scared a generation a book readers. The material seemed almost like an urban legend.Many people were introduced to It through the 1990 miniseries that had Tim Curry as Pennywise. Split into two parts, it had some problems as while the parts set during the childhood was entertaining, the adult parts were underwhelming and unimpressive. It seemed that the strength of the story was about the children having to face their fears while they tried to defeat this evil clown. A movie would need extensive rewriting, but had potential. It brings Pennywise back after a twenty-seven year slumber, ready to haunt a new generationperhaps the old generation as well. On a rainy day in 1988, a young boy named Georgie is eaten by a figure in a storm sewer who introduces himself as Pennywise the dancing clown (played by Bill Skarsgård) Without a body, the adults of Derry, Maine simply report him missing, along with many other children that seem to disappear over the year. In June of 1989, the kids are out of school as they try to make the most of their summer. The overweight new kid on the block Ben tries to research the history of the town and the missing children, but has an encounter with Pennywise and a group of bullies lead by Henry Bowers.Beaten, his wounds are tended by stuttering Bill, big-mouthed Ritchie, Jewish bookworm Stan, hypochondriac Eddie, and outcast girl Beverly. The kids declare themselves 'The Losers Club' as they have always sensed something wrong with the town, as each have encountered Pennywise in a form that strikes their fear. They come to understand that the clown is powerful and may have been around for hundreds of years. Understanding that the curse will continue, they make their way to the sewers to try and defeat Pennywise.I'll admit upfront that director Andy Muschieti understand that It is not a horror story, but rather a coming of age story with horror elements; think The Goonies meets Nightmare on Elm Street. For the most part, it really work as a whole. The movie does take its time to show how each kid grows up during that eventful summer. Fear is a boundary from adolescence to adulthood, and the writing shows that with a town as crazy as Derry, just why these losers needed to go through this experience.All the child actors are very likable in their part. Like The Goonies and The Sandlot, you get a sense that they must be friends in real life to reflect this kind of honest chemistry. There wasn't a moment where I dreaded having to follow one over the other; they were interesting enough that you want to see through their troubles. How about Pennywise? Bill Skarsguåd is simply terrifying and unnerving as the clown. I won't say if he's better then Tim Curry as the performance is different. Unlike the miniseries, this Pennywise is more childlike and unearthly. His design his fantastic and better draws from the fact he's been then for a while.Does this make It a masterpiece? Almost. There were moments that the humor and drama don't match the situations. The ones with Pennywise do, but its with the kids that's a tad harder. There are moments where after an attack or something bad happening, one of them (mostly Ritchie) will try to let off a joke or swear that just doesn't fit the situation. It's something that might have worked with more thought put into the dialogue. But other then that, this will probably be Stephen Kings most watched movie in a while.I'll give this nine red balloons out of ten. Despite an R rating, I'd say that this may be a good start for older children (I'll say twelve to be safe) that want to get into watching horror movies. It may even be an interesting family outing to talk about this, the book and everything the kids just went through. If you have a fear of clowns, brace yourself. It is a lot of things, including an entertaining movie.",9,5,10,12 September 2017
Hereditary," Hereditary truly is scary. It throws you into a nightmare and understands the simple fear of mental illness
","Having a mental illness is enough to be frightening. When you're in that state in which you have no idea whether your thoughts are your own or a manifestation of the illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar, or even depression. All these can cause sudden changes that are never that of the person's character, but of the cause of a chemical imbalance. Now how about we add a supernatural element into the mix, and you have another layer of mystery. You may notice that a lot of the best ghost stories include people that usually have a mental illness or a secret background. Either elements cleverly add to unbalance of the character, making their situation and our viewpoint as an audience more frightening. Movies like The Haunting, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and The Conjuring feature characters with the previously stated attributes that added to the film's suspenseful tone without going too over-the-top. One notion that's not addressed too often in movies about mental illness is the hereditary aspect. Those of us who've grown up with a family history of that can be scared themselves that destiny will force them with the same problems. Hereditary brilliantly adds many layers to that fear along with a ghost story.A miniature artist Annie Graham (played by Toni Collette) is in the middle of dealing with her mother Ellen's passing. At the funeral, she mentions that she had a shaky relationship with her, who in return, was a private woman. Her family includes husband Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), teenage son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (played by Milly Shaprio). In addition to her daughter being a reclusive oddball, she reveals at a support group that her family has had a history of mental illness. Annie also starts seeing her mother in random spots in the house (even though no one else can see her).Another family tragedy ends up pushing Annie's mental state further until she meets a woman Joan who tells her that the dead can be contacted through a sÃ©ance. Annie then uses the tricks taught to her to show the family that it's real. Time passes by as more images of the family are heard and seen in ghostly form while the living members each go through their own trials that reveal more about Ellen. Like a lot of horror movies, what's best is what you don't know and Hereditary has those necessary layers. Let's address the most important aspect of it, the characters. Toni Collette proves again that she take the typical 'mom' trope and give it that extra weight. It helps that along with her family history and the fact she does have a lot on her belt, she still has the motivation to dig deeper on what's going on. This makes the story just as interesting to us as it is to her. Peter Wolff, fresh from the recent Jumanji, looks a little old, but he also balances the stress of being a teenager and the dilemma that he's facing. Finally, I have to give a lot of points to Milly Shapiro for playing what has too be one of the more unsettling performances of the movie.Where Hereditary shines is in it's tone and atmosphere. Walking into this movie is like walking into a true nightmare. There aren't any big fantasy-like set pieces or even a gothic house, but it takes the kind of household you might see from an upper class family and make it feel so uncomfortable and unfamiliar that moving forward is like taking a deep breath. It all relies beautifully on the story, which I cannot spoil, but adjusts to the overall mood.Finally, what makes Hereditary such an unforgiving, not pleasant experience is how much it understands the human mind above ghosts. It understands that when we lose someone, we always want to see them one more time, but shudder at the idea of them coming back. It's that genuine feeling of feeling alone in a familiar environment that makes it scary. I'll admit that without spoiling anything, the movie's distinct 2 acts will feel jarring for a mainstream audience expecting one outcome. I really enjoyed this and I think a lot of horror fans will do so too, but I can see this being disliked by people who expect something more straightforward.I'll give this nine miniature rooms out of ten. I really liked Hereditary. We seem to be living in an era where the best original ideas come from the horror genre. This adds to the originality we're capable of. If your up for walking into a nightmare, see Hereditary.",9,60,118,11 June 2018
Detroit," Darkness and tragedy of the Detroit riots come about in the incredible account in Detroit
","The city of Detroit is in a tough position. It was once a vast metropolis with several factories calling it home, making it a mecca for families looking for a quality and a safe security. Things changed when many of those car factories either closed or moved, turning a vast city into a ghost town. It's still standing and has plenty of people, but it now exists as a shadow of its own empire. Politicians and companies are in the middle of getting back a state of industry, so who knows what the future holds. It holds a lot of history, both good and tragic.In the late 1960's, race relations were at the brink of an explosion as African-Americans were crippled by poor living conditions in cities and were being provided little help from the government. While white Americans were enjoying a better life in the suburbs, the cities continued to unofficially segregate blacks into the urban environments. This anger eventually erupted in a series of riots that provided fuel for the media on the troubling issues for African Americans. Though each city riot had their fair share of casualties and damage, the one in Detroit was said to be the worst. It has been recreated in the Kathryn Bigelow film, Detroit. On the July 23, 1967, an unlicensed club was raided upon and shut the party down. This triggered a mob to start throwing rocks at police cars and they would later loot and set fire to various buildings. This was considered the start of the Detroit City riots. The second day is more of the same, except officer Phillip Krauss (played by Will Poulter) guns down an unarmed looter. Though he's told he'll be investigated on possible murder charges, he's not taken off the force. The riots become so violent that the governor approves the National Guard and the Army to provide help.On the third day, the Dramatics, an R&B group's performance is canceled when the riots come close to the theater. They try to leave the city, but lead singer Larry Reed (played by Algee Smith) gets separated and makes it to the Algiers Motel, hoping things will cool down the next day. A prank goes bad when a blank gunshot is confused for a sniper attack, causing the police to arrive quickly to find the shooter. Officer Krauss leads everyone down, including two white girls, a recent Vietnam veteran Lou, and Larry Reed for brutality-like interrogation. Though security guard Melvin Dismukes (played by John Boyega) is there to witnesses it, he watches as he tries to ensure everyone will leave alive.Taking an entire city based riot and putting it into one film cannot be an easy task, but Kathryn Bigelow developed Detroit into a magnificent, very tense look into events that identifies a lot of problems that are not only historically significant, but could be examined in a modern subtext. I love how the story is set around the tragedy of the Algiers Motel incident, which could be seen as the heart of the darkness. The script is great, the direction is great, the pacing is great, and the acting is all great. Every single person is the right choice for their character, especially to the big three, Will Poulter, John Boyega, and Algee Smith. Their performances had my eyes straight ahead to the screen as I was always curious to see what happens. I felt every emotion go through my body as I succumbed to the events projected, dragging me into the riots and of Detroit.I'll give this ten Dramatic albums out of ten. I can say that Detroit is a frontrunner for the Oscars in a lot of categories. Is it better then Dunkirk? Hmmthat's hard to say as despite both movies portraying major events, they feel different, which should say a lot about the importance of film as an art. We'll just have to wait for the end of the year to find out where it places on my scale. I can say that this is an engaging movie that completely sucks you into the madness. Detroit will continue to survive, though movies like this need to be seen to understand its darker moments, so don't miss it.",10,47,88,8 August 2017
Rocketman," Rocketman is a real 'Rocket Man', as it soars for a fun musical and shows that will 'Still Stand' for a while
","When going to a concert, are we seeing the 'singer' or the 'show'? This may seem like an odd question, but it makes sense when considering what exactly were watching. We're not there to listen to some songs, but there to experience them as done by it's creator. Chances are their not just going to sing them, but also incorporate dancers, videos, lighting, costume, and perhaps more. A lot of singers/bands will do this to make their fans feel like their witnessing an experience. I've been to plenty myself that have included Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Metallica. One of the biggest proprietors of this happens to be pianist Elton John.While I'm not a regular listener of his music, I will say that Elton John is a talented singer/rocker who's created some songs I like, including 'Crocodile Rock', 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', and 'I'm Still Standing'. I've always seen him as the modern day Liberace, who happens one of the few famous piano players and also loves to incorporate a lot the theatrical costumes into his shows. I recall learning about him when I first saw The Lion King in 1994, but knew very little about the singer himself. It all comes front and center in Rocketman.At a rehab facility, a fully costumed Elton John (played by Taron Egerton) admits to being addicted to a lot of things and proceeds to tell his life story. Cut back to his childhood, he was raised as 'Reginald Dwight' by his mother Shelia (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) and grandmother Ivy, as his father is largely absent and uninterested in his son. It's apparent right away that 'Reginald' is a prodigy with a perfect musical year and becomes good enough to receive a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. He trains further and further while gaining an interest in rock artists like Elvis.He joins a variety of bands until he tries to make it on his own. Inspired by on of the bands he plays for, he changes his name to Elton John and forms a partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (played by Jamie Bell). The two get along, but Elton realizes that he himself is gay. Regardless, his first show in Los Angeles makes him an immediate star. Elton eventually starts a romantic relationship with his new manager John Reid (played by Richard Madden), but starts his addiction to drugs, sex and alcohol.I'll say that Rocketman is the movie that I had hoped Bohemian Rhapsody was going to be. It's informative, emotional, and most importantly, very entertaining. The biggest difference is that unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a traditional biography, Rocketman is more of a fantasy-like musical, which incorporates his songs into his life story. The result feels like as if it's Elton John' story as told by him. I have no idea if this is close (this feels like it has to be) to what happened, but the filmmaker understood that it was more important to make a unique movie then anything.A lot of that is on Taron Egerton who does a fantastic job playing Elton John. Along with understanding the pressure the real singer went through, he also translates the flamboyance into something that resonates two meanings: escape and expression. Another screenplay probably would have made him one note. Rocketman allows Taron to express the various sides to come out just to show how complicated Elton was. I'll bet a million dollars that he'll get an academy award nomination for his performance. Perhaps we'll have two years of actors playing musicians winning awards.Is the movie grand? I though it was certainly very good. When the movie drifts into the drugs and alcohol territory, it does stray a little longer then needed. While I know Elton John did go through a lot of abuse, it's something I've seen a lot of rock star movies already do a lot. I might have been kinder had it focused on his sex addiction, which is rarely seen in movies. At best, Rocketman needed at least fifteen minutes trimmed so that the pacing feels a bit quicker. Regular movie goers probably wont see this as an issue and should have fun regardless.I'll give this eight flamboyant glasses out of ten. Rocketman is a real 'Rocket Man' as it soars and shows it's audience an experience they could never experience at any of his shows. It's a fun musical and it'll 'Still Stand' for a long time.",8,3,6,17 June 2019
A Star Is Born," This is a story about the stars unready to accept or lose fame. A Star is Born will shine forever
","Most people will never have an idea with the pressure that celebrities are put under. Their put under the spotlight to showcase their talent and to face another popular face similar to theirs and have to find ways to be unpredictable, but great. This is why the music industry and Hollywood have been known for being unkind businesses. You ever notice that when asked about being famous, a lot of celebrities reply, 'don't'? Is it because they'll have moments where they were once godlike, only to be cast aside because their not 'hip and cool'? I can't imagine the hurt they receive. I can only hope that those people have something or someone to turn to when that feeling becomes unbearable.The tragedy of the fading star had been showcased before in the original A Star is Born with Judy Garland and it's remake in 1976 with Barbara Streisand. I haven't seen either of them, but are constantly said to be great movies. Perhaps I'll look at them at another point, but in the case of the current A Star is Born, this is another great story of the modern celebrity and his pressure to both keep a lasting career and help the girl of his dreams. Country/blues singer Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper) sells out constantly with his popular concerts and good looks. He plays a mean guitar and has an 'Americana' voice. He's hiding a drinking and drug problem, which helps him cope with the pressure of pleasing his fans and finding new inspiration. He has his fair share of people working for him, but the only one who tries to care for him personally is his older brother/manager Bobby (played by Sam Elliot). It's clear that while he does fine financially, he's still more alone then most normal people.We also have a young woman Ally (played by Lady Gaga) who gets by as a waitress while singing in a drag bar. Though she seems to have friends, she is constantly told by her father Lorenzo (played by Andrew Dice Clay) to take it further. One day after a concert, Jackson stumbles into the drag bar, simply looking for place to drink. It's here he sees Ally singing 'La Vine en Rose' and is memorized by her beauty and voice. After meeting her backstage and a night of hanging out, she is flown to his next show where he brings her on stage to duet with him. As the two become an item, the world is drawn to Ally.I'm going to stop there as A Star is Born is not only a great look at the tragedies of celebrity, but is also one of the best movies of the year. It may be a remake, but this film is just full of honest chemistry by the two leads, along with some beautiful looking cinematography. I swear, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have to be one of the best onscreen couples in a while. Screen chemistry is often hard to describe, but if showing how these two people need each other without explaining does the job, I don't know what does. I'll start with Lady Gaga who is not only a natural beauty (it was said that producers told her she would be too ugly for film), but convoys a lot of her side of acquire fame and learning how to deal with it. Bradley Cooper is her best friend going into this and he nicely shows a Kurt Cobain-like lifestyle in which you know he has a lot of demons and could take down a lot of people with him. He's just so likable and friendly with how he is with Lady Gaga that you really find yourself sympathetic for him.While I don't know if I would go as far as calling this a musical, but A Star is Born does have a lot of good music. They all seem like songs I'd hear from Lady Gaga or a blues-like singer. I don't know if it's something I'd listen to all the time (it's not my thing), but the important thing is that it feels authentic. It's honest enough that I'm sure it's going to receive awards. I'll give this ten Grammys out of ten. A Star is Born is what you call a perfect remake of a great movie. It's beautifully shot, beautifully written, beautifully acted and beautifully performed. It's just a beautiful movie. But along with it, it's also an honest portrayal of being a celebrity and what happens when your not ready to either receive or lose the fame. The stars shine bright enough to recommend this for everyone.",10,1,5,8 October 2018
Fury," Ravaged? Yes. Bloody? Yes. Different? Fury Recycles Old Messages About War but Delivers High Action
","Passing down the street, I see all sorts of people, young and old. They present themselves as how they want the rest of the world wants to see them. For guys like me that enjoy walking, I often pass by folks with caps that say they were veterans of some sort. They don't seem to be asking for a lot of attention, but they want people to know that they worked hard to protect us from villains. They took the risk that could have gotten them killed, but had managed to put out enough to take themselves home. They may have been able to return to a normal society, but some of them may not come back with solid minds.I have only seen people killed in the movies and television, and I don't have the stomach to look up death footage, but from what I hear, the real deal is nothing like the Stallone that can gun down a bunch of bad guys and return home with a smile. The armed folk that have seen how severe and bloody a war can become only see the world for what it can be; a savage place where only the strongest survive. The sick minds that fill the ranks in Fury will make you question just how damaged a veterans mind could be.Our crew is in the last months of World War II as Army sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (played by Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury', working to make the final push into Nazi Germany. It's crew consists of Boyd 'Bible' Swan (played by Shia LeBeouf), Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (played by Jon Bernthal) and Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (played by Michael Peña). During the opening segment where an assistant driver is lost in an attack, an enlisted typist, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is unfortunately transferred to fill the vacant spot.What Ellison finds is a crew that would rather have their old driver back then someone who has never even killed a Nazi. During a gut-wrenching scene, the poor boy gets his bitter taste of blood when Wardaddy forces the trigger of his gun upon a German who may have been innocent. Ironically, Wardaddy is the only one who seems to be keen on making Ellison a full- fledged tank driver, by giving him the privilege of joining him for food in a captured town. The stakes are put to test when the tank becomes immobilized after driving on a land mind and has be ready to aim and fire upon hundreds of incoming Nazis.Fury places itself in the ideology of something like The Dirty Dozen where a group of solders are pitted against absurdly huge forces. But it comes off more like The Expendables where the action becomes so over the top that it nearly becomes senseless. I can tell that the movie was trying to mix in the bloody (and I mean really bloody!) along with the message that war can damage to the human mind and it nearly works. The effect of war on people in film has been done several times before, so what Fury does have to offer are some good performances. Brad Pitt plays the total opposite of his Inglorious Bastards character, becoming someone who has become so scared by the war that he is more machine then human. Logan Lerman is really evolving into the serious adult actor that he wants to be, as he displays the only traces of humanity left in an Evil Germany. The best part of the movie is the final act of the stuck tank and it's last stand, but you need to get through the roughest trenches of gore and slow pacing that could turn away some folk. Fury is an interesting case of being too gory for an award audience and possibly to highbrow for a mainstream crowd. I'm sure there's a middle ground that going to enjoy this more then I did.I'll give this six-damaged tanks out of five. It's best to know that Fury is not fun action movie, but an action movie at least. If that's enough to persuade you, this is probably for you. Maybe the next round of World War II ammo can fuel me better.",6,1,7,21 October 2014
The Maze Runner," The Maze Runner would have been a fun puzzle had it's main actor been a better performer.
","Let's paint a familiar picture: your sitting at a diner, sipping on a Coke through a straw while mom and dad talk about plans for whos going to meet up with grandma. Your only eight years old with no cell phone; so how did you pass the time? You played with that paper placemat that every restaurant that was family orientated had. Some had that easy word search that hid easy messages like 'fries' and gumball' and some had an unfunny cartoon that was printed with the hope that the child would laugh anyway. What most had was the classic maze.I myself have a couple of memories of holding a free crayon offered by the waitress and tracing my way though an uneven pattern that would lead me to the exit. These were easy, but I had fun solving them, giving me a sense of accomplishment before I dived into a hot dog. What makes the maze puzzle so unique is that I think this may be the first example of a virtual game. Despite only using a pen to guide the way, you were thrown into network where your only goal was to get out. Solve the maze and you feel like you could take on another to prove that you were such a master. Let's see you solve the death trap that is in The Maze Runner. Sixteen-year-old Thomas (played by Dylan O'Brian) wakes up to find himself in an ascending cage which opens to a lush field and several other boys around his age. They collect the other boxes that came with him and the second in command Newt (played by Thomas Brodie- Sangster) tells Thomas about the way of life and their positions. Most of the boys farm and gather but a few select venture into a large maze that surround them. They are called the runners.As Thomas begins to accept the community way of life, he accidentally gets left out in the maze when trying to save the others (the maze closes it's gates at night as monsters fill the track). He manages to survive the nightfall and save his friends life. This grants him status as a runner, to the dismay of the group's leader Gally (played by Will Poulter). As Thomas starts to learn about mapping the maze, a girl arrives in the cage along with a note that reads 'the last one ever'. This puts more pressure to find a way through the treacherous puzzle before they run out of food and time. The Maze Runner is another young adult novel getting it's turn at a movie adaptation. What certainly separates this from the others is that this one is more boy orientated. Sort of a cross between the lost boys of Peter Pan and The Prisoner TV series, The Maze Runner was a lot better then I thought it could have been. The situation is more interesting and easier to follow then this year's Divergent and it's cast of young men shape it to be a better performance piece.Exceptthere's only one problem with the characters and it's a major one; the main character. Thomas is really bland and forgettable and is just the generic nice hero. I don't know if the actor Dylan is the issue as he does have a regular role on MTV's Teen Wolf (I can't justify this as I've never seen the show); but you know it's a problem if the side characters are more memorable. As is, Thomas Brodie-Sangster makes for a good sidekick (so much so that I wish he were the focus) and Will Poulter is starting to show more acting skills (proven before in We're the Millers).I'll give this seven hard mazes out of ten. The Maze Runner could have been as good as The Hunger Games had it casted a better performer or simply had a better character to put the focus on, but for a fun Friday night at the movies, I'll take it for entertainment's sake. This could have been worse.",7,0,2,23 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rouge One lacks memorable main characters, but fights back it's force of fun side characters and fantastic action
","A long time ago (a co) in a galaxy not so far away, Disney acquired the rights to the George Lucas- created Star Wars stories. Not only did they want their hands on the characters and famous movies from before, but they also wanted to kickstart a whole galaxy of new movies. Not only did they want to create a new trilogy to continue after the events of the original Star Wars movies, but to also develop spin off films that honestly have even more potential. As great as the old movies are, it's a fascinating idea to expand upon the characters and events that were happening within. I'd personally would like to see several spin off movies. A movie about Yoda might be cool, if they expand upon the little mentor to look into his early days as a jedi. Boba Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi also might have potential with their own stories. Fans of the comics and video games have campaigned for a movie set within the events of the Knights of the Old Republic (which would be a prequel to the prequel trilogy!). Todays movie is set not too long before A New Hope with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Years ago as a young girl, Jyn Erso escapes the empire when they come to her family farm to take her father back to help build a super weapon with the capability to destroy planets. Now a young woman, Jyn (played by Felicity Jones) being taken to a prison, but the rebellion helps her escape. The rebels offer her a clean slate for her previous problems in exchange for help to finding her father. She agrees and with Rebel officer Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna) and droid K-2 (played by Alan Tudyk) head to the desert planet of Jedha to look for the one person who would know where her father is. They run into a blind monk-like warrior Chirrut (played by Donny Yen) and mercenary Baze (played by Jiang Wen) where after a conflict with Stormtroopers, find Gerrera (played by Forest Whitaker). He reveals a hologram with Jyn's father that reveals his love for his daughter and that the Death Star was designed with a flaw that could easily destroy it. They are also informed that blueprints for the Death Star and it's flaw are in a secure data bank on the planet Scarif. Jyn Erso, her band of mercenaries, and even some of the rebels, plan an attack on that world against the empire and Darth Vader (played by James Earl Jones)For it's first outing into a spin off story, Rogue One is entertaining. I say this because I think it's better at giving people what they want out of what to expect from Star Wars then delivering a genuine movie. That doesn't make it bad, but it does contain flaws. I'll say from the start that Rogue One is shot better then The Force Awakens. Almost every frame could be captured and placed as a picture on my wall. Director Gareth Edwards really understands how to make his audience truly feel a part of this universe without 3D.The action (especially in the final forty minutes) comes closer to the original series as they make everything feel large in this ironically small story. Seeing the X-Wing ships battle the AT-AT walkers almost felt like a scene right out of Empire Strikes Back.What prevents this from being a great movie? Unfortunately, it's a big problem and it's the main characters of Jyn Erso and Cassian. Both actors are trying their hardest and make certain parts work, but there's not a lot to their personalities aside from tough loners. At least the side characters were there to pick up a lot of their slack. K2 got more laughs then he deserved. Even though Darth Vader's scenes are short, his presence is dark and frightening. That's all I can say without giving away any major spoilers.I'll give this seven K-2s out of ten. While it's not the best of the Star Wars series, it's certainly the best prequel. I might pop this one again, but only on a large screen where the action looked the best. It has a good story, but it needed stronger characters to make an impact. Maybe this is why this story of Star Wars wasn't a major part of the original trilogy. Take what you can get, check it out, and may the force be with you.",7,1,6,20 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel is no marvel herself: Boring and uninspired is the best way to describe this
","When Wonder Woman came out two years ago, it got a step above Marvel with one aspect; DC was about to produce a solo female superhero movie before Marvel did. Marvel had managed to make use of Scarlet Witch, Gamora, and Black Widow, but they were all a part of teams. Wonder Woman made her debut in Batman V Superman, but had not only shown a good origin story in her own movie, but made something that was entertaining, could make audiences happy (not just comic book fans), and made a Greek goddess human.While not perfect, I really enjoyed Wonder Woman. I had always wondered why Marvel had not gotten around to making a Black Widow or Scarlet Witch movie. If I had to guess, it probably has nothing to do with any sexism. It's more about having a semi-known name on the screen to ensure people that would come. As hinted in Avengers: Infinity War, it looks like Captain Marvel is the one that's going to get her shot at a solo movie first. This isn't a bad thing as it does take us back into the cosmic part of Marvel, which is my favorite aspect of the MCU. Let's see if Disney can pull off something similar to Wonder Woman in Captain Marvel.On a distant planet, a member of the Kree starforce Vers (played by Brie Larson) goes on various missions with her commander Yon-Rogg (played by Jude Law). She has been trained to not use her emotions in order to channel her cosmic abilities. While going after Skrulls, she ends up getting captured by their leader Talos (played by Ben Mendelsohn) who probes her memory. This triggers images of her in the Air Force and having friends. Without any idea of this, she manages to breakout and escape, but also crash lands on Earth in 1995.Her arrival is met by S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (played by Clark Gregg) who have a ton of questions for this woman who came out of the sky. She's also met by Skrulls and Taloes who can shapshift into anyone. Vers and Nick escape, but she wants to know more about her vivid images she keeps having. After investigating the information of Dr. Wendy Lawson (played by Annette Bening), she's comes to understand she used to be Carol Danvers. This puts her position as a human and starforce warrior into question.
After a lot of anticipation, I found Captain Marvel to be incredibly...meh. Given it's story and charecters, this is a movie that's clearly trying to be a lot of things. An origin story, a science-fiction, a coming-of-age, a buddy-cop, and a superhero story. The problem lies in a lot of area, but the movie does have a lot of good things as well. A lot of it is on the supporting charecters. Not only is it nice to see Samuel L. Jackson play a bigger role in an MCU movie, but the digital effects to make him younger look cool.Ben Mendelsohn, Lashana Lynch, and Annette Bening all do well given their material. I thin my favorite was Jude Law, who takes a lot of command with his character. I won't spoil what direction they go, but it made sense and it's always nice to see him play slimy. I didn't even mention the cat Goose, who gets plenty of time to shine, though his big moment comes towards the end, in which I also won't spoil.So what's wrong with the movie. Two things; first is the script. The story tries to juggle around it's plots from the various characters, but it becomes so jumbled that some characters disappear for a while and comeback without any segway. When we do get back to Captain Marvel's mission, once we do realize their goals, I found myself not caring to the point where much of it became boring. This mainly seems to be a filler story until the next. The other problem is Captain Marvel herself; Brie Larson. I've mentioned before that she can deliver a good performance, but it requires good direction. In many scenes where she needs to appear commanding and intimidating, I just wasn't buying it. Her performance happens to be more stoic and robotic that I can't figure out how this was meant to be an interesting personality.I'll give this four Captain Marvels out of ten. I remember seeing this in a packed theater where the theater mostly sat in silence except for the ending. I don't know how this is going to play out, but I can't imagine this being a future major player. I'm sure Captain Marvel will have her fans, but I can't see them saying that this is the favorite of the MCU. Even with her cosmic powers, I found this boring and unoriginal. I'll wait for Avengers: Endgame instead.",4,3,11,8 March 2019
Zootopia," Funny, heartfelt, creative, and teaching a strong lesson in prejudice, Zootopia roars as one of Disney's strongest films.
","When one thinks of animation, walking and talking animals come to mind. Even at the start of animation, characters like Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat were human-like animals that were the stars of the genre as they could speak to everyone and still be as entertaining as any human. Warner Brothers has the Looney Tunes, which is full of anthropomorphic animal-characters that perform vaudeville routines like a regular human comedian. MGM has Tom and Jerry, the ultimate battle to the death as a cat and mouse should, yet still make their slapstick comedy relatable enough for people to connect with. Now Disney has an interesting note with walking, talking animals.Despite having a mascot that's anthropomorphic, Disney haven't made much content with human- like animals. 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book has such creatures, but live in a world full of people that are the dominant species. In the case of an entire world of animals, I can only think of Robin Hood (which I really like) and Chicken Little (which I consider one of Disney's worst) that have pulled that off. Zootopia takes that same idea, but really takes advantage of the environment it creates to create something really unique.Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has always wanted to be a cop. She's constantly told by everyone, even her parents, that bunnies cannot be police officers due to their size and cute look. She proves them wrong and passes the police academy first in her class and a position in the metropolis of Zootopia. Though promised that she would receive the same treatment like her fellow officers, her police captain Chief Bogo (played by Idris Elba) assigns her parking duty. Rather then complain, she takes her new assignment with excitement, hoping her work effort will lead to something better. After arresting a thieving weasel, she given a chance to find a missing otter within forty-eight hours or risk having to resign. The only clue she has is a photo from where Emmet Otterton was last seen. She finds a clue that leads her to a sly, con artist fox Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Though she has a prejudice against foxes (due to her past), they team up to find the otter. Their various clues take them to a nudist club run by a Yak (played by Tommy Chong), a DMV run by sloths, and even a crime boss shrew named Mr. Big in order to discover the bigger mystery within the city.When I heard about Zootopia, I wasn't sure if more could be offered to the anthropomorphic animal setting. I was not only proved wrong, but this blew me away. The folks at Disney should be city designers as Zootopia feels like a legitimate city with it's various sections. From the desert to the tundra and even a section for rodents, the city could rank up with Los Angeles in Blade Runner or Gotham in Batman. I'll be surprised if something from this movie is not incorporated into the Disney Parks.The voice acting is simply perfect with Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a good set of buddies in this cop story. Speaking of mysteries, the case to be solved was very intriguing and manages to pull off a moral that's perfect with the recent news stories of racism and gender discrimination. I assume that Disney had wanted to tell a story on racism and prejudice for a while and Zootopia should get the adults to think while keeping the children entertained with some great slapstick that remains fast and essential to the plot.I'll give this ten Nick Wildes out of ten. While Frozen may have been the major Disney movie that people wouldn't stop talking about, Zootopia has a chance to divert that attention as it already has for me. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for adults, even if they claim they don't like animation.",10,10,23,8 March 2016
Us," Whether your with others or just your shadow, Us is a fun ride through darker shadows
","All of us have problems. I might wake up with a cold, making me more tired then usual to do what I love. You might be worrying about how to pay an expensive medical bill when you don't have health insurance. Parents might be worrying about how their going to put their kids through college when the tuition keeps getting more expensive. The point is that when we have problems, the last thing we want is to make them such a big deal we cannot function. This is why we suppress these stresses rather then confronting them. Often, this will come back in bad ways. Perhaps as a bigger issue or a darker part of you personality.I believe that we are often our worst enemy when were not honest with ourselves. This also happens to be a theme of Jordan Peele's newest movie. For a guy who originally came into the business with his comedic skills, he sure is showing hick knack for suspense. Even though I really enjoyed Get Out, I count that more as a social thriller then a horror, kind of like a Twilight Zone story (considering that he's about to reboot The Twilight Zone). Let's see how that compares to Us.A mother of two Adelaide (played by Lupita Nyong'o) is on vacation with her family, but cannot shake her memories of running across a clone of herself back in the mid 80's. This makes visiting Santa Monica beach hard, but she puts up with it to please her husband Gabe (played by Winston Duke) and her children Zora (played by Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Played by Evan Alex). Their beach trip goes fine, even meeting with friends of theirs. The only slip up is when Jason finds a random guy standing still with blood dripping, but tells no one about it.When they return home, things seem to be going fine until four random people show up in their driveway. Gabe tries to call them out, but they don't respond. When he threatens them, they run off, but later return. To the family's horror, the four people are all clones of themselves, only to be wearing red jumpsuits and seem crazy. The only one that can talk (though slowly and with a raspy voice) is Adelaide's that calls herself Red. Throughout the night, the family tries to outsmart and escape the clones, but there may be something bigger facing them.I can say without a doubt that Get Out was not a lucky situation, as Us is just as entertaining and fun as the latter was. I'm more convinced that Jordan Peele really understands what scares people, not just black people. This is probably the most literal example of 'the past coming back to haunt you' I've seen in a while. It's a staple within a lot of ghost and horror stories, but what this does different is that its more layered then you'd expect. I won't spoil how, but it takes the home invasion thriller in a different direction then you'd expect.The acting is top notch with Lupita Nyong'o doing great as both Adelaide and Red. In fact, I also realized that since the plot calls for each main player to have a clone, everyone had two sides they had to play; themselves and their darker reflections. This is a gamble, but I couldn't see anyone that was weaker then the other. I think it's success comes from it's script, which was also written by Jordan Peele. He's a guy who certainly knows how to make good comedy out of these moments, but it's drama and suspense are still just as real.Now when comparing this to Get Out, is Us better? I'd say the two are even, but for different reasons. Get Out showcased a darker story that probably scared me more then Us did. Us will probably have more of a rewatch, mainstream value as it's scares were a bit more expected, but it's story was simply larger. If I had any problems with the movie is that I wish the bigger twist was different. I won't spoil it here, but let's say if you've seen a lot of movies about clones, then you may already know what the twist is, as it's been done before.I'll give this eight red jumpsuits out of ten. Horror and thriller fans will love this. If you liked Get Out, then I could see you also enjoying this. Whether your with someone or your shadow, Us is a fun ride through darker shadows.",8,0,3,27 March 2019
Creed," Getting strong now! Gonna Fly! Creed is a welcome addition to the Rocky Saga
","As Rocky says in this movie, 'You have to be stupid if you want to be a boxer'. That is true given that the sport of boxing guarantees that your gonna get hit in the head plenty of times, and continue getting hit until your brain damaged enough that you have to retire. I once brought up the idea to my parents when I was in high school, around the same time I saw the first Rocky movie, and they told me they would hear none of it. Boy, am I glad was I told otherwise. It's not for everyone, but for the likable Rocky Balboa, it's a life.Rocky just may be the greatest sports story of all time, giving the chance of a lifetime to an underdog who never thought he'd amount to anything past the slums of Philadelphia. What drew people to this was how relatable Rocky is, being a tough guy, but also funny enough that we really want to see him get with Adrian and possibly win the heavyweight championship. Each sequel gave Rocky more opponents, new financial and health challenged, and something to morally fight for. This time, Rocky steps aside as a manager for a new boxer in the latest of the Rocky saga, Creed. It seems that Apollo Creed (Rocky's opponent/friend from Rocky I though IV) had a child through an extramarital lover. Young 'Donnie' Johnson Creed is found in a juvenile hall center by Apollo's widow Mary Anne Creed and takes him in.Years later, Donnie (played by Michael B. Jordan) is boxing in the underground fights, while working for a successful securities firm in LA. He finally decides to leave his job to become a professional boxer, much to the displeasure of his mother, who remembers her husband getting killed in the ring (from Rocky IV).He moves to Philadelphia where he tracks down an older Rocky Balboa (played by Sylvester Stallone) who still runs his restaurant. Though Balboa at first says no to returning to the world of boxing, he changes his mind once he see's how skilled Donnie is. From training at Mighty Mick's (under new ownership) to fighting small matches, Donnie makes a killing. Once his identity of being Apollo Creed son is discovered, heavyweight champion 'Pretty' Ricky Canlan wants a match before he retires/serves his jail sentence. Donnie not only struggles to embrace his father's legacy, but finds out that Balboa may have a life threatening illness. Having seen six previous Rocky movies, I expected this to be totally predictable and a retread of the original movies. What's amazing about Creed though is that even though it does tread through familiar boxing territory, it's still a knockout of a personal story. Unlike the Rocky movies where Balboa was dirt poor and came from the slums, we have a guy who had every privilege and is trying to go through the same path that his mentor did. He discovers a lot more about himself and his father then we realize and the movie end's up becoming a fascinating personal story for our hero.Michael B. Jordan is both very likable and relatable as Apollo's son. He represents everyone that has wanted to follow their dream, yet is afraid to risk what they have now. Sylvester Stallone tackles a new part of Balboa that we haven't seen before; older and weaker then he was in Rocky Balboa who's questioning his own mortality now that all his loved ones are gone. Though the boxing material is easy to guess, it's just done and shot so well that it feels fresh.I'll give this nine Rocky statues out of ten. Creed isn't just the best sequel to the Rocky movies, but is a guarantee favorite of 2015 of mine. Like the classic training song, you should be 'getting strong now and fly' as you see this new chapter of the Rocky saga and see that is has more punches to throw.",9,1,4,15 December 2015
Aquaman," Aquaman does not blow the man down. It's a visual spectacle and an entertaining superhero story.
","I've said before that the difference between Marvel and D.C. is that Marvel is humans becoming gods and D.C. is gods becoming humans. If there was a character from D.C. that embodies this type (at least on Earth), that would be Aquaman. Not only is he the king of Atlantis, but like a lot of people within the D.C. universe, he already has god-like powers. His story seems more classical then Superman or Batman; one in which he may have grown up amongst humans only to find that his connection to the sea makes him a king. Tell me this doesn't sound like something that fits along with Homer's Odyssey.Aquaman had already been featured in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League, but he had never gotten his own movie. Come to think of it, he's a character that hasn't been seen within a live action. Given how expansive the comic books have shown Atlantis and the majority of his powers, I can't imagine how this guy would have been portrayed without computer effects. It almost seemed that the D.C. universe was doomed after the negative reception to Justice League. Let's see how things have improved in the standalone movie Aquaman.As shown through a flashback, a lighthouse keeper Thomas finds the queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (played by Nicole Kidman) washed up on shore. The two fall in love and have a child, Arthur. When Atlantis comes looking for them, Atlanna returns to the sea, leaving Thomos to care for his son. Cut to years later when Arthur (played by Jason Mamoa) has gained reputation as an 'Aquaman' who stops pirates on the high seas. After coming home one day, he's approached by Mera (played by Amber Heard) who asks that he return to Atlantis to dethrone his stepbrother Orm (played by Patrick Wilson) who is ruthless and wants to become Ocean Master of all kingdoms. Arthur declines, but agrees to accompany her to find his mother's trident.From here, Arthur and Mera return to Atlantis, meeting with his old teacher and a confidant of Orm, Nuidis (played by William Dafoe). While getting information, their ambushed and Orm attempts to fight him, but they escape. Traveling to the Sahara and Sicily, they figure out where the trident is, but the battle rages on as Orm wants to declare war on the surface world and Arthur has to fulfill his destiny as the Aquaman to stop his brother from becoming Ocean Master.For the most part, Aquaman is the movie that Warner Brothers had needed to make in order to compete with Disney's Marvel brand. Is it a perfect comic book movie? No, but it was a lot more entertaining then I expected it to be. Director James Wan (The Conjuring, Fast 7) seems to have thrown out the brooding darkness from the previous movies and embraced the more fantasy elements of the DC universe. Aquaman is not a bad movie to do that with, given that the majority of the story is set underwater and the kingdom of Atlantis.Environment is one thing, but it's all for nothing if the characters aren't interesting. The good news is that Jason Mamoa is not only charismatic, but he's also a welcome change to the typical, all American or strong women we see. He's more like the former jock from high school whose at least nice and willing to make a friend. Mamoa not only fits in well with his position as the son of a lighthouse keeper, but has a noble pose, giving him more of a royalty ambiance then I felt with Chadwick Boseman from Black Panther.His journey is also interesting, as the goal is not only simple, but is genuinely fun. When we see him in Sicaly fighting high-tech pirates, im invested. When he's in Atlantis talking to his brother, I want to see where things so. When Arthur has to fight, I'm curious to see how the movie will incorporate the various elements of the ocean. Most of it is played out well, though if I had a problem, its that the movie is a tad too long. Without giving anything away, there's a second villain they could have cut, as the story is mainly setting him up for a sequel. Not to mention there are exposition bits of dialogue that could have been shortened.I'll give this eight Aquaman comics out of ten. It's crazy to think that while Superman and Batman were not done well, its Wonder Woman and this that are the better movies within Warner Brothers. This is likely to help those who've been dissatisfied with the previous DC movies. All I can say is that Aquaman does not blow the man down. Go check it out.",8,3,5,30 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Chimichangas! X-Men! Cable! Peter...and of course, Deadpool. Check out this review of Deadpool 2 written by the Merc with a Mouth.
","What's up suckas! It's your friendly Deadpool again with a bona fide sequel ready for your pleasure. You all probably remember the Oscar winning Deadpool (Fine! There were no nominations, but I should have won 'Best Actress'). It was a movie we'd tried to make for a while, but Fox wouldn't agree with the direction and the R rating that's the only way to do me justice. After much arguing and bedfellow time, Deadpool was finally made and was a big hit. That wasn't it for me. We then had shirts, cereal, a Christmas rap album, elementary school textbooks...you know, the stuff that appears everywhere!Whatever, even if one or two of those things didn't happen, Deadpool proved that there is an audience for an R rated super hero story. So now we got more money and more freedom to do what we want with our sequel. So where do we go from there? In the previous movie, I teased that Cable would finally show up. It's not Keira Knightly, but I'm happy with what we have. We've also got more meta stuff, a full team, and plenty of the gory good stuff you want. Let's explore Deadpool 2 and see if it's just as good. Just as I, Deadpool (Played by Ryan Rynolds) am settling into a nice lifestyle of sword slashing and target hunting, something awful happens to me when I nearly get myself killed...or blown up. It's only when Colossus brings me back to Xavier's (Stewart or McAvoy, take your pick) mansion where I agree to join the X-Men as a way of healing. When I try to help out a young mutant Russell Collins or Firefist (played by Julian Dennison), he and I get arrested where our powers are stripped as we try to do what we can. But that's the least of my worries.Just as prison starts to look cushy, a cybernetic solider from the future Cable (played by Josh Brolin) breaks in to apparently kill Russell. I wasn't going to let this maniac get him, so I manage to separate us, but leaving Russell still in that prison. To prevent another strike, I finally decide to start a team I call X-Force. Joining this team also includes Domino (played by Zazie Beetz), Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand), Shatterstar (played by Lewis Tan), Bedlam (played by Terry Crews) and I think a guy named Peter; no powers, but seems like a team player.What's best about Deadpool 2 is what you don't know. That's why I'm glad to say that the sequel is just as good as the first. Not better, not worst, but just as entertaining as my last outing. What's fascinating this time is that while the original Deadpool was a love story, the sequel is definitely a family story. Not that it's appropriate for children (which I'm sure they'll catch at a friends sleepover), but it's willing to dive deeper into my complex nature.I have to say that aside from Ryan Reynolds doing another phenomenal job playing me, Josh Brolin makes for a fun Cable. Like a good buddy cop story, his grizzled (but understandable) nature is a fantastic contract to my anarchy ways. Perhaps if he's lucky, he'll get his own movie. I have to give kudos to young Julian Dennison whose not only a rare big kid whose not here to make fat jokes, but carries a lot of pain from his time before. Yet, I can't give away just why, but it involves more mutant discrimination. So where does my movie not shine. I think it's from the fact that I seem too quick to the idea of joining teams even though my last movie was a tribute to why I wouldn't. That makes for a slight departure in character who only cares about himself and his close ones. That's not to say he gains new friends, but it could have used a bit more quieter moments to let it sink in. How about that humor? It hits well. My constant jokes, puns, and occasional forth wall breaks don't overshadow the movie's intent, but rather builds on that tone that people like.I'll give this eight pictures of me with super soakers out of ten. What can I say but you know what your getting if your seeing my movie. So check it out if you want an X-Force movie...or at least a Deadpool 3.",8,20,41,21 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Cosmic, funny, and fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a god of thunder that is the best of the Thor series
","By the Gods! We got another Thor movie in the mix. For a character that's the Norse God of thunder, you'd think he would be a favorite for a lot of people. For most, however, have admitted that out of all the avengers, Thor is rarely a favorite. Maybe not the character, as Chris Hemsworth carries a lot of the charm and naivetÃ© needed for this type, but more for his movies. Perhaps he works better a part of a team, but other heroes like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and even Captain America, once considered to be the most boring avenger, are capable of operating on their own. So why have the Thor movies struggled to find their own identity? I think it has to do with how soon they brought him into the Marvel cinematic universe. At the time, the current heroes were manifestations of science and Thor was something more cosmic. The first movie tried to bridge that gap by saying Thor's 'magic' was science evolved. Yet future Marvel stories like Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange have been capable of producing more fantasy-like scenarios. Let's see if Thor: Ragnarok can fully embrace a more 'cosmic' journey that can make the character entertaining.Since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) has been trying to find the Infinity Stones away from Earth and his home of Asgard. When he's made aware that his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) has been masquerading has their father, he returns to demand that they go get him. Thor and Loki are led to Norway where Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) is dying. Upon that moment, the goddess of Death Hela (played by Cate Blanchett) is released. She not only reveals that she's Thor's older sister, therefore rightful heir to Odin's throne, but that she once led armies across the realms of the universe.Thor and Loki attempt to get back to Asgard, Hela sends them into space where both land on a garbage planet. Thor ends up captured by a bounty hunter Scrapper 142 (played by Tessa Thompson) and is taken to the ruler of the planet, the Grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum). Though Thor is forced into being a gladiator to try and win his freedom, he's relieved that his opponent is none other then the Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) whose been missing for two years. Thor has to figure out how to get back Bruce Banner, get off this planet, and stop Asgard from the Ragnarok destruction.I stand by that the first two Thor movies were good. Thor: Ragnarok is great! This is a fun cosmic adventure that may be just as good as those Guardians of the Galaxy films. It's clear that Thor has fully embraced just what his character can go through in his kind of situation with new planets, creatures and powers. But what separates it from the previous movies further is a sense of self aware that adds a lot of much needed humor. In fact, many of the scenes on the Grandmasters planet reminded me of Big Trouble in Little China.As before, the casting is good, but it's almost all the new stars that nearly steel the show from Thor. Cate Blanchett is definitely having a ball as the villain, bringing a lot of class, yet a bit of insanity that fits her in to the Marvel universe. Jeff Goldblum is a joy, though a lot of has to do with that he's playing himself. Though it's a shame we aren't getting any more Hulk movies, Thor Ragnarok is clearly evolving the character the more Bruce Banner is in the Hulk state, and Mark Ruffalo does well, just as much of a fish out of water.But the main reason that Thor: Ragnarok may be the best of the Thor series is that we really feel like that Thor himself went on a major journey. Without spoiling anything, He finds out a lot of dark truths about his father and the past of Asgard that makes him question what's worth saving. Just how can his people survive? Should his home survive? It all comes together and feels earned. I'll give this ten Thor helmets out of ten. 2017 has been a successful year for Marvel and if you needed a reason, this should justify that. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have seen the other Thor movies or even the other Avengers movies before watching this, but I don't think it's totally necessary. This feels the most separated from The Avengers in tone (though that's because I'm only counting Marvel heroes that are a part of the Avengers) and should cater to science fiction and fantasy fans that wanted the series to take bigger chances. Let's just say that Thor: Ragnarok is a defined thunder god in form and should be watched.",10,12,23,8 November 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player One is a high score. A fun video game adventure that will satisfy gamers, movie fanatics, and those looking for an escape
","Why do we love video games? They have gone from an electronic novelty to multi-million dollar industries that practically have the same clout as major movie studios. And yet, what are we really doing? Some might say were sitting in front of screens doing nothing but playing with meaningless games. People who make that analogy are probably not the target audience for video games. Guys like myself who do play, play for a variety of reasons; to relax, to be entertained, but more importantly, to feel like we can escape. Whether your gunning down aliens in Halo, jumping pipes in Super Mario Bros. or eating pellets in Pac-Man, video games have given people the ability to feel like their taken to another world.As technology has gotten better, virtual reality or VR gaming has gained popularity. I haven't had much experience with it, but I'm blown away with how much more it can transport those people into the games. Today's movie is all about VR technology at it's grandest. It's also about capable it is at creating anything they want for people to experience. So I guess if you wanted to be a Ghostbuster or play 8 bit golf, you could. It's all possible in Ready Player One. In 2045, society is at an economic low as many people are forced to live in slum-living spaces, like the Stacks, an area where many RVs are stacked on top of each other. To curb life's disappointments, many people log into the Oasis, a giant VR experience created by James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance) where they can engage to play games, educate themselves, and even work. Because of what's offered to gamers, Halliday's death is seen as a loss to the tech industry. Regardless, the Oasis is seen as an amazing thing. For the past five years, players of the Oasis have been a part of a quest that Halliday had set up after his death, in which whoever can find three hidden keys in the Oasis will acquire a golden egg, plus total control of the Oasis. Young Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan) has been playing, studying all the potential clues, hoping his avatar Parzival can be the one to win. He manages to get the first key, making him an instant celebrity. While he's working with Art3mis (played by Olivia Cooke) and Aech, he's also being followed by Nolan Sorrento (played by Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of another company, IOI, who also wants to win to acquire the Oasis.The big concern that most people had with Ready Player One was that it was going to rely too much on references to eighties nostalgia. Thanks to the direction by Steven Spielberg, he balances out the heavy references with fun adventure. Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline (who also wrote the script), the movie keeps it's reference-heavy scenario, but tries it's hardest to be sure it never overshadows the overall character development. The good news is that despite having mostly unknowns, the casting works out good. Both Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke make for likable leads. Though I put a lot of question of whether they really resemble gamers, their personalities made them work just enough. Honestly, the real stars were the side characters. Ben Mendelsohn makes for a fun villain as a corporate suit who is only interested in the money with little care about gamers. Mark Rylance gives the best performance as the quiet VR founder who carries a lot of pressure for a guy who dislikes his own creation and even what it's brought to the world. Now for the overall story and plot, there were things improved on from the book and elements I think could have used more thought. While I won't say how he wins the race for the first key, I find it hard to believe that it would have taken gamers five years to try it. But there is a film recreation done for the second key that makes for a fascinating visual effect that I'm still trying to figure out if it was real or digitally recreated. While every part of the journey doesn't make a ton of sense (half the time when they were chased by IOI, I kept wondering why they didn't just remove the VR goggles and respawn elsewhere), the overall journey makes this for a fun movie just to be entertained by.I'll give this eight eight-bit keys out of ten. I can definitely say I had fun seeing a lot of characters from Street Fighter, Iron Giant, Batman, The Shining, Mobile Suit Gundum, Sonic the Hedgehog, Back to the Future, King Kong, and much more all being thrown into a VR experience that I'm honestly glad doesn't exist in the real world. This is Steven Spielberg giving us an adventure film that will probably entertain most people (he had already done his Oscar bait movie The Post last year). If the references in the previews bothered you, you'll probably not like this. But for everyone else, this is one of the nerdiest movies made...and I mean that in a good way. Log in and see this this Easter Egg hunt is worth following.",8,0,1,2 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's brilliant writing and oddball characters make The Hateful Eight a great western thriller
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers with a unique voice. Most of the time, you could find one of his movies like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained and identify that it's a Tarantino movie right away, even if one were to start watching it in the middle. A lot of it has to do that he clearly writes his characters before the story. It's just that they are so well built as oddballs that are capable of anything given their circumstance that you'd probably want to watch them regardless of what they were doing. Even watching the characters of Reservoir Dogs play poker would be interesting.By looking at his movies, you'd see that they are slow stories that rely on the characters dialogue then the actual action. That inspiration comes from spaghetti westerns like A Fist Full of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which contain the same slow pace. Impatient people may see that as a bad thing, but when I go to the movies, the best stories are the ones that are being told by the most fascinating people. Django Unchained had it and so does today's movie, The Hateful Eight. Some time after the Civil War, bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is trying to get his set of dead bodies to the next town of Red Rock, Wyoming so that he can collect his money. It's cold and a blizzard is approaching, so when a stagecoach arrives, he asks for a ride. Inside the stagecoach is another bounty hunter, John 'The Hangman' Ruth (played by Kurt Russell) who has captured fugitive Daisy Domergue (played by Jenifer Jason Leigh) and is taking her to town to hang. They take Warren, along with a man Chris Mannix (played by Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, and make it to a cabin before the blizzard catches them.The cabin is a lodge for stagecoaches called Minnie's Haberdashery that's being looked after by a Mexican Bob (played by Demián Bichir) while the owner is out visiting her mother. Also in the Haberdashery is British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (played by Tim Roth) quiet cowboy Joe Gage (played by Michael Madsen) and former Confederate General Sandy Smithers (played by Bruce Dern). The eight individuals are all in for a hard couple of days as the blizzard rages while they discuss the post Civil War and maybe fire off some guns.Just like Tarantino's previous movies, The Hateful Eight's biggest strength are the characters. They had to be good characters, given that the movie is primarily set (for the most part) in it's one cabin location. Every one of these people are so well constructed that they seem like they have come from other stories and that they have managed to find themselves in this one. I think my favorite had to be Kurt Russell's Hangman bounty hunter as he seemed to be the one most comfortable in being in a western.With the characters comes a sort of a classic 'who-done-it' mystery that's so much of a nutty scenario that I'd rather not give it away. I can say that the movie feels like two halves; the first being the introduction and the back stories while the second half is bloodier and the reaction to the reveals. Parts of the first half felt a little too slow (perhaps a few minutes could have been cut from it's three hour running time), but it all pays off later on when things are revealed and were in our seats trying to find out who's going to make it in the end.I'll give this nine stagecoaches out of ten. The Hateful Eight is definitely not for those that are too squeamish by the violence and language level, but I promise that this is one of the best of 2015. I have yet to see a truly bad movie from Tarantino and this proves he's nowhere close to slowing down.",9,17,48,30 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," Is Tonya Harding a tragic figure skater or an airhead who went too far to be the best? I, Tonya is great at never clearly drawing a line
","In the world of sports, there's a level of concentration and motivation that most athletes reach in which they have to decide when far is too far. Like any job, there's always going to be individuals who will want to be the best (only to encounter someone whose probably better). How to proceed from there depends on the people asking themselves that. Do they try to be friendly? Or is there no room for friends and must remain competitive? If you think that everyone is going to play fair, then your wrong. The world is full of people that will stoop to such lows that you'll question their humanity. Life's not fair, plain and simple.Going back to the sporting world, there are many horrible people that become famous anyhow. Whether people will know of their actions varies, but it seems that even the public is aware of the things that are done. One such case considers the former ice skater, Tonya Harding. In the late eighties and early nineties, she was a promising athlete who would become a media sensation for what she did off the ice rink. Regardless of whose the bad guy, I, Tonya takes a look at the controversy and those with her. As a young four year old, Tonya is encouraged by her tough and abusive mother LaVona (played by Allison Janney) to pursue her interest in ice skating. Though local coach Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson) doesn't want to teach someone that young, she is impressed and agrees to help. By the time she reaches sixteen, Tonya (played by Margot Robbie) has won several competitions and is seen as one of the best in America, but can't seem to win the national competitions due to her music choices, white trash background, and more rebellious attitude. When her mother goes too far, she moves out with her boyfriend and later husband Jeff Gillooly (played by Sebastian Stan) and continues her skating. Her routine at the 1992 Olympics goes well, until she fails to stick her landing, blaming her blades. She's encouraged to try again for the 1994 Olympics. Things get scary when she receives a death threat. In retaliation, her husband, whose convinced that competing skater Nancy Carver (played by Catlin Carver) sent it, arranges for her to get hurt. Once the FBI make the connections, Tonya is constantly questioned whether she knew about the attack or not, while hoping to proceed with the Olympics.Now doing a movie on Tonya Harding would seem difficult as someone with a controversial background is not a person that too many people are going to sympathize with. This is why I, Tonya does the smart thing, and sets the story like a character study. You certainly get a better understanding of her background and her personality, but it never takes a side. In fact, the movie almost seems like a troll, giving you the typical sports story for the first half, before going into the skater attack in the second half. This all works together thanks to the cast, which was selected perfectly. Though the roster is filled with mostly unknowns, the main stars suited nicely. Sebastian Stan makes for a good airhead with potential fame going to his head. Allison Janney plays a bit of herself, but still pulls off Tonya's mother LaVona whose a monster, but at least a human monster. Of course, Margot Robbie is great as Tonya. While she too is an airhead, she shows that there's a difference between that and her passion for the ice. In a way, she is a tragic character, but your also not sure if you want to feel sorry for her. I'll give this ten 1994 Olympics posters out of ten. The best kinds of biopics are the ones that focus on grey characters; those who do questionable things that you'll question for a while. I, Tonya does that and portrays the working American in a world of wealthier athletes. It may not be new, but her character makes your want to go through this trope. I'm glad I caught it in time for the award season. I recommend this, so get on the ice for your fair chance.",10,6,11,1 March 2018
Moana," Moana has plenty of fun moments, even if doesn't have much new to find with it's Disney formula
","Disney has a long history of making family animated features that feature your princess, a comedic side character, villain, and of course, memorable songs that the children are going to sing for their school pageants. The majority of them are very good, though it wasn't until twenty years ago that Disney expanded the diversity of their characters. I think the first princess that wasn't white was Pocahontas. The bloated roster has introduced Mulan who is Chinese, Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame who is gypsy, and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog who is black. The next animated tale from Disney now gives us a Polynesian princess. While adding her to the long line of princesses may not seem like a big deal, her presence marks something progressive for the company. We happen to live in a society that only has expanding minorities and to acknowledge that is a smart choice. Given how a few people have said so, people are willing to accept new kinds of characters; especially ones that kids can look up too. Moana is the name of our new character, and the newest animated film from Disney. In the prologue, we learn about how all life was created by the goddess Te Feti and became an island. But when demigod Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) steals the islands heart, a spiritual stone, dark forces come after him. He looses the stone and his magical fishhook that gives him his shape shifting powers. Hundreds of years later, on a small island in Polynesia, Moana Waialiki (played by Auli'I Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief. She's discouraged from going near the water, as is the entire tribe, to keep them safe. The dark forces I mentioned earlier, start to invade her island with no fish in the ocean and the fruit growing becoming rotten. At the encouragement of her grandmother, she not only discovers that her people were voyagers, but she takes one of the boats and the heart of Te Feti, and goes out to find Maui.After a storm, she finds Maui on an island where he's been exiled all this time. Upon meeting him, she finds him egotistical and very selfish who is only looking to return to being a hero for his fans. The two eventually agree to help him find his fishhook in exchange for him returning the stone.As far as Disney movies are concerned, Moana is very good. Good, but not great. Disney shouldn't have anything to worry about as the main character is a lot of fun to follow and is very likable. Dwayne Johnson, though bringing a lot of his similar traits from other movies, gets a lot of good lines and even manages to sing his song well (he's not a strong singer, but he puts a lot of emotion into his performance). Animation again looks amazing. The best thing here is the music, as the songs are composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (responsible for the Broadway hit Hamilton). They are very catchy and may have something that can finally knock off Frozen's 'Let it Go'.So what's wrong with the movie is everything sounds good? I think its more what Disney is giving us as apposed to what the movie is giving. Moana has A LOT of the elements that you typically see in their other movies (they even joke about that in the movie). I'll give credit to Zootopia, as that not only offered more new twists, but took more chances with its material. Moana feels a tad safe when compared to the latter. That shouldn't stop people from having fun with this Polynesian set tale. I'll give this seven fishhook weapons out of ten. Moana has a lot to keep the family entertained, even if it's not offering much new. I still recommend it if you're a fan of anything Disney related. Set sail and see what you can find!",7,7,21,30 November 2016
BlacKkKlansman," A truly bizarre story that really happened, BlacKkKlansman reveals how a black man managed to infiltrate the klan
","What can I say about the Klu Klux Klan that hasn't been said before? They're an awful group that only exists for the point of hurting people. This is a group that I don't like talking about as it's painfully obvious why everyone should have a problem with them. I'm still baffled that they even have a platform in 2018. The good news is that they are not popular, have been barred from most social media, and are met by an army of counter protesters when they march. The other good thing is that they are more bark then bite. That is except from the Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally in 2017, where one woman was killed in a vehicle ramming.I won't deny that we still have racists, bigots and white supremacists. But I also won't deny that as people, we've done well in moving forward in blurring that line of intolerance. We're always going to have disagreements, but the further we go, the more we as people can experience more love then anger. I'm glad there aren't that many people dumb enough to be registered members of the Ku Klux Klan and if BlacKkKlansman shows anything, that they'll always have a negative image. In 1972, Ron Stalworth (played by John David Washington) is the first black detective for the Colorado Springs police. Like a lot of places, he does face prejudice from fellow officers and is sent to records. When he stands his ground and request to go undercover, he's given an assignment to a black student union rally that's being held by Patrice Dumas (played by Laura Harrier). This goes well enough for him to be reassigned to intelligence. It's here where Ron places a call to the local president of the Ku Klux Klan and asks to join (given their on the phone, they have no idea he's black).Though baffled by this, the chief agree to let Ron keep going, though someone has to go in Robert T. Nickerson his place. Detective Flip Zimmerman (played by Adam Driver) is thus tasked with meeting the Klan members to clarify his Caucasian race. While Flip continues to infiltrate the meetings to note whose in the group, Ron continues to make constant phone calls asking about upcoming events for potential attacks. At one point, he even talks to Grand Wizard of the Klan, David Duke (Played by Topher Grace).I have to give director Spike Lee credit for creating a lot of style in BlacKkKlansman. Though this could have easily been presented as a typical, Oscar-style drama. Instead, BlacKkKlansman is more of a comedic, Blaxploitation film that you'd expect out of the seventies. This could fit well along with Shaft, Cleopatra, and Superfly (there's a great moment where those movies are brought up for a discussion about black cops). The film's subject matter is still serious, but given that you see some of these characters have fun with the ridiculous setup that was a real investigation (the real Ron Stalworth even wrote the novel that was the basis).Though he doesn't look much like his father Denzel Washington, John Davis Washington does contain that same charisma. While he does also carry that fear that the Klan could kill his friend Adam Driver, he has a confidence that lets him have enough that he's having as much fun as we are. The movie's focus on his struggle between inequality and maintaining the image of the police is fascinating. Yes, he has degenerates that make fun of him and a girlfriend whose convinced that all cops are bad, but he never lets any of the ideology get in the way of his goal.The best parts of the movie come whenever Ron has to phone in and interact with members of the Klan or David Duke. It's comedic goal to see a group of people that hate a race only to be blindsided by a black man who takes this in complete joy. It's something I haven't seen since Cleavon Little in Blazing Saddles. If there was anything to criticize is the ending montage that pays tribute to the victims of the Charlottesville attack. Not that I don't disagree with that, but given how the film already has an ending with the main characters and their continuing fight against prejudice, this seems tacked on and forced, as it's dramatic dark tone doesn't match the rest of the movie.I'll give this eight Klan hoods out of five. This film isn't looking to take sides of a political spectrum, but rather present a historical event with a comedic tone. If the movie trailer didn't persuade you, then your not going to like this. I had fun and I think a lot of people will too. Join the group of movie fans and go see this.",8,8,18,15 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Homecoming is right as Spider-Man: Homecoming is an awesome return for the web-slinger into the MCU
","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become 'The Vulture'. Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of 'Homecoming' is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.",9,46,84,7 July 2017
Black Mass," Black Mass is by no means an original gangster film, but I still enjoyed this workingman's Godfather
","I have never lived in a metropolis-like environment, so I can't say I've had the experience of living in tight corners and nearby Chinese food places. The idea of living in high rises certainly doesn't frighten me or even annoy me, but it's certainly nice to look at a forest rather then brick and steel. The only time in my life that comes close in my one year of schooling in Tucson, but it's more of an extra large town then a metropolis (that's what Phoenix is for). Cityscapes come along with the stereotypes. The bums, the workaholics, the rich yuppies, the underprivileged artists, and of course, the mafia. One continues plot in many city police stories is going after the mafia. It's rarely set against the Italian mafia or Irish mafia, but just THE mafia. The best movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas and The Departed have drawn exception to these standard in order to project realism. What's frightening is that the more real these gangster movies become, the more your optimism for the city deflates to be replaced by the image of organized crime running the show, What's worse are the stories that show the armed forces involved. Black Mass tells the real story of the Irish mafia in Boston. The movie is told from the various flashbacks of criminals that have worked for main character, James 'Whitey' Bulger.Starting in 1975, Whitey (played by Johnny Depp) is a small town crook in South Boston who has a small crew and works his numbers, but still isn't a kingpin yet. On the other side of the law is John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent who was friends with Whitey as a kid growing up in Boston. Connolly gets the idea of having Whitey coming on board as an informant for the FBI in order to eradicate the Italian mafia. Whitey's brother William Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) isn't enthusiastic about the idea and neither is Whitey. The later gets on board to protect his family, though dismisses the idea that he's 'ratting'. Though given rules against killing and committing crimes, Whitey does so any way, but provide enough information just so that he still technically helping the FBI. As Whitey become further detached from his humanity and Connolly brushes off all the violence as 'getting closer to the enemy', the FBI starts to debate what's ethical to catch brooks with more crooks.The story of James 'Whitey' Bulger is an interesting one; so interesting that many movies, including The Departed were inspired by this criminal. Does that mean that there's room for the real life story? Yes, there is. Black Mass is an enjoyable crime thriller that's more about the crimes then so of the character. Johnny Depp still gives it all to play a scary man that would have had me running out of the building. Even though were given a more over-the- top design then an over-the-top personality, he's still fascinating enough of a character to see him as he rises in the crime world. Now unlike something like Scarface where our criminal is wealthy, Black Mass is more of the workingman's godfather. It's not a bad thing, but since we've received movies like this before, Black Mass feels like it could get lost in an ocean of more iconic criminal stories. I can't feel like that this kind of story has been given to audiences hundreds of times before It's not bad, but it's a movie that came a little late or at least put a different spin to make it stand out more. I'm not sure if the answer were to have gone darker, but it might have helped.I'll give this seven welcome to Boston signs out of ten. Black Mass isn't good because it's a fantastic gangster story; it works because it's adequate. I think I respect the history more then I do for the final product. If you like gangster or crime thrillers, then you'll probably like this.",7,2,6,23 September 2015
Suicide Squad," A laughing matter it is not. Suicide Squad has some colorful baddies, but gives little for them to do
","Disney seems to have the market down on superhero movies ever since they bought Marvel. With the numerous Iron Man, Captain America, and Avengers movies, mostly all receiving positive phrase from critics and audiences, how is it that the idea of a cinematic universe is so hard to do in another fashion. Disney is about to do the same with the Star Wars stories, and yet Warner Brothers seems to be having trouble with the DC comics' stories. Man of Steel started with a well- intended Superman, but fell due to story issues and regard with simple logic. Batman V Superman made even bigger mistakes when it tried to combine five or six movie ideas into one. One of the biggest problems is that director Zack Snyder had set up those previous film as so dark and brooding, that they lack much fun. The action scenes are good, but both movies had an identity crisis of it's own by not knowing how take it's dark tone and make it more fun. Warner Brothers was smart enough to understand just how colorful the villains are. Batman, Superman, The Flash, and the rest of the Justice League are full of baddies that have worked with each other in the comics. Suicide Squad seems like a proper step to take to try and give DC fans something different. Set after the events of Batman V Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Walker (played by Viola Davis) is worried that the next 'Superman' being could be a force of evil rather then good. Knowing that most military would not be a match for powerful beings, she proposes a team of villain and criminals to be used as a disposable asset in high risk missions. When an archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne) becomes possessed by a witch called the 'Enchantress' and sets on destroying the world, the team is brought out of the prison and into the streets.This Suicide Squad consists of assassin/marksmen Deadshot (played by Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie), mouthy Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), pacifist but fiery El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez), cannibalistic Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and sword wielding Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara). Their all being led by Army officer Rick Flag as they make their way closer into the center of the city to stop the Enchantress. If that wasn't enough, the Joker (played by Jared Leto) is coming in to take Harley Quinn back to Gotham. The good news is that Suicide Squad is better then Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The bad news is that it's not by much. I'll say that I'm glad the this DC movie finally tried to evoke more fun into it's universe. That idea shows a lot within it's players. The best here are Will Smith and Margot Robbie who sport out the best one liners and really embrace the insanity that I wanted more of. Jai Courtney actually found a role that works to his advantage. Viola Davis does well with the material given. Jared Leto manages to bring a new and unique Joker, though we see very little of him.I liked the team and the movie does a fine job setting things up in the first thirty minutes. What Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel's equivalent to this) got right was they allowed their party members to go nuts and interact with each other. There's not much of that in Suicide Squad as the dialogue between each player is minimal in favor of action scenes that are alright, but nothing to brag about. One of the bigger problems is that the villain is incredibly bland and uninteresting. With the talent available, why couldn't these guys be fighting Joker? The Enchantress gives little more then 'I'm Evil!'. Warner Brothers may have the bad guys ready to go, but the story doesn't give them a place exciting to go. I'll give this five Harley Quinn mallets out of ten. If Warner Brothers expects a big cinematic universe with the DC characters, they really need to make some management changes to those behind this creatively. These are good ideas, but they need more madness then what Suicide Squad has to offer. A laughing matter this is not.",5,3,6,10 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Why is there no 'Star Spangled Man' in this? I don't know but Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still a great addition to Marvel's Cinematic Universe.
","Freedom is something that we all want; the freedom to work, freedom to play and freedom to live life. But now that the NSA has been exposed to having been tracking your social media pages, email, and phone, there has been a split debate over whether we still have personal immunity. Some say that they don't mind the extra eyes as long as there being used to catch potential bad guys. But a lot claim that if we're being spied all the time, then doesn't that defeat the purpose of having private lives? How can we sleep knowing that the government could be looking at you or me as a threat to the country?I've always felt fine with the extra security as I have nothing to hide, but I can understand why others could feel compromised by their computer trails being tracked. They could hit the wrong link and that web history would forever be imprinted on you; maybe not on a computer, but in some possible super computer hidden is a military/government building. It's only conspiracy theory, but it's reasonable theory. The Marvel studios decided to take a stab at the whole government surveillance controversy in its latest superhero story, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Like the previous sequels of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, we see where Steve Rogers 'Captain America' (played by Chris Evans) is after the events of The Avengers. He's currently residing in Washington D.C. where he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. as he struggles to adapt to a modern society. His latest mission has him, agent Natasha Romanoff 'The Black Widow' (played by Scarlett Johansson), and other S.H.I.E.L.D. representatives to save one of their ships from Algerian pirates. The assignment proves successful, though the Captain finds Romanoff extracting information from a computer. He was not reminded of this objective and he starts to question the purpose of the mission.Top agent and leader of the avengers Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is ambushed by assailants as led by the mysterious Winter Soldier. Fury's seamless death leads the Captain to be question by senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford). This causes the Captain to become a fugitive target from the agency he swore to help. He escapes from the headquarters to meet with Romanoff. They use information from a USB drive given to the Captain from Fury to lead them to an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D facility that reveals that Hydra, the evil organization from the first Captain America movie is alive within S.H.I.E.L.D., secretly operating within the ranks to take over the world.When you really look at Captain America compared to the other heroes, all he really does is lead the others that have real super powers. The Captain only has enhanced strength, which made me question whether his films could work on their own. Captain America: The Winter Soldier crushed those assumptions by proving that the Captain just may be the most interesting avenger of all. He may be a strong fighter, but he's still scared and out of place within the modern world.Chris Evans proves again that he is the Captain; patriotic but never over the top and conservative, but open to letting people making an impression on him. Scarlet Johansson and Samuel Jackson deliver their promised performances with fun and chemistry. Redford takes a great turn in character that I can't give away. Unlike the first movie that was a nostalgia trip of WWII movies, here we have more of a modern espionage thriller turned blockbuster with a hint of political commentary.Captain America: The Winter Soldier took more chances with it's scenarios then the previous film, making this one much superior. It also delivers on the action, giving incredible fighting sequences that's more then shield throwing; it's good old-fashioned blunt fighting and martial arts. It goes with what it knows and finds ways to make them better. Get ready for two amazing sequences that are on par with The Avengers.I'll give this ten winter soldiers out of ten. Marvel and Disney continue to prove that they know their comic boo movies and I'll be ready to be watch the next one, Guardians of the Galaxy, on the opening night.",10,4,8,21 May 2014
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange has put a spell on us with a fun hero, amazing visuals, and a new door to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","I was at Disneyland the other day and saw that the line to meet Spider-Man and Captain America had stretched to over an hour at the busiest of times. If someone were to tell me that before Disney bought Marvel Comics, I would have honestly laughed in their faces. But who would have thought that the mouse house working with the capes ended up being the best thing for each other? Had it not been for Disney, we would have not gotten some of the recent output of films like The Avengers, Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man, and my favorite, Guardians of the Galaxy. For the Marvel cinematic universe to continue, they have to keep going into areas not yet explored. Most mainstream people are not going to read the comics, which details not just a universe, but a vast multiverse that makes the movies seem ant sized. Ant-Man gave us our first glimpse into the multiverse when the title hero shrunk himself smaller then molecules. What we're not shown is the dimensional side of the Marvel Universe, which contains elements of magic, fantasy, and even existentialism. That bridge is finally crossed when we're given our newest hero, Doctor Strange. Stephen Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a successful neurosurgeon, but a very arrogant and egotistical person with little compassion for those around him, including coworker and former lover Christine (played by Rachel McAdams). He gets in a car accident that severs both of his hands. When experimental surgeries and rehab don't seem to be working, he's lead to a paraplegic who somehow regained his ability to walk. Strange is told by this guy to go find Kamar- Taj. In Nepal, Strange finds his way to a monastery where another sorcerer Mordo (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) takes him to see his teacher.The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) reveals her power to Strange, showing him an infinite cosmos of other dimensions and of the astral plane. Despite his arrogance, she agrees to teach him. He reads several books about the mythic arts and practices daily, hoping that he will regains the full use of his hands. Strange's abilities are advancing at a quick pace, giving question to the Ancient One on how he might have what it takes to become a sorcerer supreme. A former student of the Ancient One, Kaecilius (played by Mads Mikkelsen) summons an entity from the Dark Dimension called the Dormammu to destroy the planet, leading Strange into battle.Where was this during the summertime? Doctor Strange feels like that blockbuster that everyone had been waiting for in the summer but never got. As a Marvel movie, not only does this stand alone (I didn't see that many references to the other heroes), but it has a very different feel from the others. I'd say that's on the hands of director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who manages to create some of the craziest visuals for a super hero story. Some might compare a lot of the imagery to Inception, but this does enough to make it it's own.Everyone's been saying, so yea, Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect person for this role who reminded me of Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man; he has a similar ego and sense of humor. I can't wait to see this guy join in with the Avengers. The majority of the cast is great too, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is being set up for something bigger. Like a lot of the other Marvel movies, the villain again isn't that memorable (why do they keep having this problem!) and we can only hope that we'll eventually get a good one besides Loki from Thor, Kingpin from Daredevil, and Killgrave from Jessica Jones.I'll give this nine levitating cloaks out of ten. Doctor Strange is a fun door into Marvel territory that is probably the best adaptation of the character. I haven't read his comic stories, but seeing this movie made me want to go down to see what other adventures the Doctor has been on.Note- This was spectacular in 3D and I highly recommend you catch it in this format, though you'll still get a fun experience in 2D.",9,3,7,4 November 2016
Interstellar," Interstellar strives to be a human driven tribute on space flight, but lacks the humanity to launch
","Like the iconic 2001: A Space Odyssey, the furthest universe is best when it's portrayed as an uncharted ocean; something that's so mysterious that the imagery we see is never still. Dimensional and unexpected are the words that come to me when I try to consider what's out there. While I think that extraterrestrials are possible, I was one to never believe in creatures that would visit us to attack the earth or study humanity. We have evolved to learn more about space and what we have understood is that the Earth is more special then ever; there is only one of us within our galaxy and it's up to us to keep our home habitable.I can understand why people are keen to saving our planet; you destroy our place and you destroy our species. Interstellar really emphasizes how important it is to make sure that humanity will forever have a place, even if Earth cannot forever be it's home. It also pushes how little of the universe we have really tapped. We may have looked through telescopes and developed theories on how everything works, we will never understand until we can continue going up. Interstellar shoots for the stars in the latest Christopher Nolan feature.In the future, humanity it at the brink of collapse as the Earth has been ravaged to a point where weather in cumbersome and farmers are seen as ideal careers. One of them is Cooper (played by Mathew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot who lives in a dusty home along with his father Donald (played by John Lithgow) and his two kids Tom and Murph. Murph convinces her father that a gravitational anomaly is occurring in her room. This leads them to an underground facility where former members of NASA including physicist Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) have been scooping a newly opened wormhole near Saturn.They tell Cooper that a mission is being planned as the last hope for the future of humanity. The goal is to send astronauts through the wormhole to examine the three Earth-like planets that people could settle on. For his skills years before, Cooper is selected to pilot the mission, but this requires him to be away from his family for years (decades!). He makes the promise to come back, but Murph refuses to hear it and only considers that she may never see her father again. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He took something like Batman and has given us The Dark Knight; a movie that changed super hero movies forever. I was hoping that Interstellar would do the same for science fiction. I'm sad to say we do not have the next masterpiece. Interstellar keeps boasting that it's a story about humanity, yet I found very little of it here. McConaughey, Caine, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain all talk more like professors then identifiable beings. Sure they will talk about their emotions related to the story, but they seems to love talking about it's meaning and philosophy more.Speaking of story, it tries hard to emulate 2001 by crafting it's story in separate parts. The first third, set on Earth and going through the wormhole, has it's moments. The second part, all about the various planets and the state of Earth, is overlong and stuffed with relative physics, and comes off more boring. The final act however is so good that I cannot even say why, though it matches 2001's ending. Aside the story's pacing, I can't say it's a total waste as there is a clear mission for our heroes and their goals. Blockbuster seekers will probably get their fill, but they need to pay attention. Though I was disappointed story wise, Interstellar was a nice movie to look at. If Nolan does something in his movies that never go wrong, it's the cinematography. The farming scenes look eerily close to Dorothea Lange 's Dust Bowl shoots, the space scenes are phenomenal (I want that shot of the spaceship flying under the rings of Saturn), and as I said, the third act blew me away for reasons that I cannot spoil. I'll give this five wormholes out of ten. Again, sorry to diss a Christopher Nolan film, but Interstellar is too bound by it's own ambition and science. It gets high marks for is notes, but fails in it's final presentation. I do think that a lot of people will be moved by this, but this makes me move to the theater that's screening Inception or The Dark Knight.",5,2,6,8 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a prime example of a character study and why crime is rarely black and white
","In most crime cases, there are not just two, but many sides to the story. Let's say a thief was caught steeling someone's wallet. The victim and the police would agree that what he did was wrong and was damaging to the owner. The thief, in return, may say that he's dirt broke with a starving child and only needed a few extra dollars for some food. Are any of these people in the wrong? Yes and no. It all depends on the people and what it is their doing. A stolen wallet case is a simple wrongdoing, but what about an emotional scaring murder?In the case of a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, we get the case of a death of a teenager, and yet the scene was so clean that the authorities are hard pressed to even go after any suspects. So her mother decides to take action. Now what she does paints one picture about how the response has been. yet we do get another side about the complications about following the rules and not wanting to make false assumptions. So let's see how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri looks at it's though situation.Single mother Mildred (played by Francis McDormand) is grieving over the loss of her teenage daughter Angela who was killed, raped, and burned. The local authorities have been investigating to find the culprits, but have yet to find any good leads. Having run out of patience, Mildred rents three billboards on a rural road with each one saying 'RAPED WHILE DYING', 'AND STILL NO ARRESTS', and 'HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?'. This draws immediate attention from the locals whose reaction is quite negative. Mildred's son Robbie (played by Lucas Hedges) doesn't like the attention, her ex husband Charlie (played by John Hawkes) is furious, and the majority of the town sides with the chief.Chief Willoughby (played by Woody Harrelson) is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration and even talks with her about his complications and how he's suffering from pancreatic cancer (the reason the town is siding with him). She nevertheless keeps the billboards going, which only make town folk even angrier. She and her son are harassed and she even attacks her dentist when things get violent. It doesn't help that fellow officer Dixon (played by Sam Rockwell) is high tempered, not that bright, and takes the billboards as a personal insult. I find it amazing that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was not based on any incident and is an original story. It feels like something that could have happened, because of the characters involved. It would have been easy to make this story a corrupt police and show Mildred as a hero, but like that TV show Game of Thrones, almost everyone here is within a gray area. Including Mildred and Chief Willoughby, they have their strength, but heavy flaws that don't just affect the case, but their own lives. This is another example of a character study.Because this is a movie that relies on it's characters, the actors are phenomenal. Francis McDormand plays a woman who had already had life beaten her down, but with that extra death on her conscience, makes her a storm cloud of angst. She carries a lot of stress, but also seems to believe she has nothing more to lose. Sam Rockwell plays a different kind of...stupid that you don't see too often. He's in his own lazy bubble with the concept that as long as things stay status quo, then he'll be fine. As the movie goes further, you see everything he understands falls apart and what that does to his personality.I'll give this ten red billboards out of ten. Sorry that the review is short, but there's a lot in this movie I cannot give away. It's an engaging story that's not even much of a mystery. It's a character-driven drama at heart and knows how their actions will dictate the plot. Go see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and understand why even with all sides of the story on the table, it's hard to tell whose right.",10,6,13,18 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," In a galaxy far far away, The Rise of Skywalker presents a dull finale that feels more like fan fiction then a final chapter
","Have you watched The Mandalorian yet? This is something I get from not only Star Wars fans, but just from people in general who have said that the new streaming series is closer in tone to the original Star Wars movies then the new sequel trilogy has been. I took a look at the first episode and I did find myself more engaged then I though I'd be. It's also the first thing Star Wars related that people seem to genuinely agree is amazing without another side claiming it to be the worst thing. The expected anger would have come from the same group of people who also said so of The Last Jedi.I had originally phrased The Last Jedi and saw it again before I saw the next chapter, and though I don't dislike it like a lot of people do, it is more flawed then I remember. I won't go into too much detail, but it feels like the first part of another trilogy rather then the second part of another. So now that J.J. Abrams is back for another, will he be able to follow up on two different stories to bring things to a proper conclusion? Let's see in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Sometime after The Last Jedi, the resistance is once again hiding from the First Order. Having killed Emperor Snoke before, Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) manages to discover a still living Palpatine (played by Ian McDiarmid) who is aware of Ray and how she carries the last of the Jedi legacy. Kylo Ren is in search of her, but is unaware she is in Jedi training by General Leia (played by Carrie Fisher). Poe (played by Oscar Isaac) and Finn (played by John Boyega) return to reveal that Palpanine and a hidden army are located on Pasaana. Now they need to figure out where that is.They uncover through Luke Skywalker's notes that a Wayfinder can locate Pasaana. While Leia stays behind to continue leading the resistance with R2-D2, the rest of the crew, along with Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO, all head out on the Millennium Falcon to find the Wayfinder. Throughout the mission, they find Lando Calrissian (played by Billy Dee Williams), encounter flying Stormtroopers, and continue to fight for the resistance. With there be starship fights and lightsaber duels? You probably know the answer.Rise of Skywalker has a lot to live up to. It's meant to close bother the original Skywalker story and conclude the sequel trilogy. On it's own, it's only okay at best. As a part of a bigger picture, it's bad. I can't blame J.J. Abrams completely as the last two movies felt like setups and they have to somehow figure out where everything was going to lead. I can say that a part of the story, some things are addressed and some others not.I'll say that Adam Driver's saga is the only one I really liked. Along with the actor being charming, you get a lot of sense of conflict with this guy. He reminds me of Ewan McGregor from the prequel trilogy, who was one of the best elements in a so-so series of movies. It seemed like there was a lot of potential for Daisy Ridley as Ray, but I'm not sure what her arc was other then denying the past. Finn becomes a throwaway character as does a lot of the newer characters. Even the older characters like Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2 and Emperor Palpatine either seem tired or don't offer much new. The only one that did something unique is C-3PO, which I wont spoil.The actions sequences are neat and the special effects are cool, but you kind of expect that at this point. Maybe if this was done ten years ago it would be groundbreaking. Now it just seems like every other blockbuster movie out there, even when compared to other science-fiction.My main gripe with the movie is it's overall place within the Star Wars saga. Unlike the other movies, which had an episodic chapter tone, this feels like it's throwing a lot of fan theories at us to see what sticks. It's clear that nothing was planned, as a lot what happens in Rise of Skywalker is never hinted at in the previous movies. I'll bet a million dollars that there was no plan...or if there was one, it wasn't built as well. Perhaps they should have taken notes with what Marvel has done with their property.I'll give this four star destroyers out of four. The more I thought about it, the duller is was and less I remember. The second half does has some good action, but chances are, ill be watching it in clips rather then the full movie again. It's not the worst Star Wars story to come out and it'll have it's fans. But I don't know how many would pick this over the original movies or even The Last Jedi, which at least tried something new. I'll be going somewhere far far away from this movie.",4,8,13,26 December 2019
American Sniper," As a story about a man and his gun, American Sniper shows an innocent whose years in the blood and sand scar him
","The war on terror has been accomplished by determined soldiers that were willing to stay as long as necessary to put an end to it. What kind of ending was everyone's question, but the goal seemed to be common; kill those with a gun and try to get to the next level until we know who their leader is. One question that we have been trying to figure out is whether it's our army that changes the person or the enemy that does. According to my mother, my grandfather has always been the same person even before he enlisted in World War II. So perhaps it'd more on the soldier then anything.Like how youths react different to education, it seems to depend on the person. Those that tend to take charge quickly will probably not be as affected by warfare then most. Those that have taken a military job somewhere that's not on the battlefield are more likely to feel something should something happen. The front line infantry however is a different story. The folk here usually join because they need a sense of direction that they didn't receive in life. One such guy is the result in American Sniper. Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) proudly enlists in the U.S. Navy after seeing the 1998 embassy bombings. His experience in handling a rifle gets him into SEAL training where he becomes a SEAL sniper. Before shipping out, he meets a young woman Taya Renae (played by Sienna Miller) who warms up to the guy and marries him just as fast. Even with the training, his personality seems unchanged that is until he carries through his first set of kills; a woman and a boy who were ready to take out a tank with a grenade launcher. He earns the nickname 'legend' due to his many kills that he continues to rank up. The catch here now is that he returns home a new man. His happiness is short lived as he spends a lot of time watching war footage from the news and even starts arguments over that with his wife over it. He takes on several tours of duty which originally start out as true reasons (wanted to help his brother or catching a deadly terrorist) but seems to take a forth one just because. He grows increasingly distant from his family as the only thing that seems to be real is what he's targeting. American Sniper is based of the famous memoir of the same name and though I haven't read it, my dad was with me at the screening and claims that it's pretty close. That's something that I should expect out of director Clint Eastwood who tends to do well with the dark side of humanity while still staying traditional. American Sniper relays both elements that seem to show Chris Kyle as war hero while properly showing the affect of his duty. Bradley Cooper is perfectly casted into this man's role that show him playing both the war torn military guy, but also the innocent of who he is before the guns changed him. I should warn most that while the movie is great, it is not for those that are prone to violence and blood. This goes beyond a couple of guying getting shot down as we see their scarred faces and even the torture of women and children. I guarantee that this is what probably went on over in the Middle East and Eastwood knew how to shot it (especially through an impressive sandstorm sequence that I will not dare spoil I'll give this nine Special Warfare insignias out of ten. American Sniper says a lot about those that have gone over to Afghanistan and Iraq and may make a good companion piece to Zero Dark Thirty. I your ready to dwell into a world of sand and blood, then get ready to deploy.",9,7,20,25 January 2015
Ant-Man," There's nothing wrong with a smaller adventure as Ant-Man fills his small stature with plenty of the Marvel wit
","One movie that was a frequent rewatch in the house was Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The journey of these kids as they tried to make it through their backyard (due to their micro size, it's now an elaborate jungle) and back to the house captured my imagination on what the world can hold depending on your size. As a tall man, I get constant stares from children and any small spaces like airplanes and bathtubs are miserable. Though I like my large stature, I do imagine what being a foot shorter could hold. I might be able to take a bath. I could sit anywhere on an airplane without my knees scrunched up to the folding tray. Of course, there's a difference between being only five foot six and one inch. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a technical marvel, but for the most part, I rarely see shrinking stories as that interesting. At leas the Disney movie took an existing environment and created a new world. Other existing stories like The Incredible Shrinking Man and Epic are just the same places in a different size. That doesn't create an interesting atmosphere. Ant Man reimagines the micro world much better then the latter two.Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) is a thief whose just been released after serving a jail sentence. He tries to go straight in order to pay child support and see his daughter, but that proves hard as any criminal record would do. He turns to another theft job as tipped off by his best friend Luis (played by Michael Peña). He manages to break into a house and open a safe, but instead of money or valuables, he finds a suit that he initially mistakes for a motorcycle suit. He takes it any way and tries it on, only to discover a button that alters his size.After a scary introduction to the micro world, he tries to return the suit only to discover that that suit's maker, Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas) had intended Scott to steel it. He reveals, along with his daughter Hope (played by Evangeline Lily), that they are working to stop a scientist/business man Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll) from developing his own shrinking suit, as the latter intends on selling it to Hydra. Scott works on using the suit to his advantage, which increases his strength in the micro world and allows him to communicate with ants, in order to plan the ultimate heist to stop Cross. Marvel Studios is continuing its streak of interesting superhero movies, as Ant Man does not disappoint. To make it clear, Ant Man isn't much of a crime-fighting story and sticks to more of a heist scenario (Much how Captain America: Winter Solider was a spy story). That makes for a nice change of pace and allows a darker hero to take hold.Speaking of which, Paul Rudd is likable as Scott Lang. He gets some good jokes about his crimes while reacting to the micro world. He shall be a welcome member to the Avengers. Michael Douglass, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Peña (he steels the comedic scenes) all add their charm to this more comedic Marvel story. The only character who gets the shaft is Darren Cross as the villain. I liked him on House of Cards and hoped he would bring more depth to this antagonist. Oh well, at least he gets some good 'bad guy' moments.The star of the film is the micro world. This is a very experimental looking world that looks both intimidating and fun. It's clearly CGI, but it's really spectacular on the big screen.I'll give this eight Ant Man helmets out of ten. Though not as epic as Avengers: Age of Ultron or as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant Man gives us a smaller (no pun intended), different marvel story that I'm open to seeing more of.",8,1,6,20 July 2015
Rush," Like the awesome machine it is, Rush is both a great Formula One movie, and one of the best sports movies.
","Turbo is a movie I really detest more then ever, because of what it did to Indy car racing. Nothing intense was blown over into the racing sport, but I think that my making a snail the better racer, this will actually prevent any interest in children to look into the actual human racers. I've said before that even though I don't follow much racing (I find NASCAR a total bore), but the Indy car circuit is something that holds a lot of nostalgic memories. I've attended the Long Beach Grand Prix almost every year ever since I was five, and I already have my ticket for next year.I can understand why a lot of other people don't find the same passion that I do. It can be just as boring as NASCAR and being that it's under stricter rules then Hogwarts, then where's the sense of rebellion? I tell those folks the following<ul><li>Driving an Indy Car is more dangerous then NASCAR</li></ul><ul><li>The track is more difficult to navigate and requires more focus</li></ul><ul><li>I find the high-tech design of the vehicles fascinating</li></ul><ul><li>The races are not as long</li></ul><ul><li>Watching the dialogue of the sponsor leaders is like watching senators fight each other</li></ul><ul><li>There's more pressure on the driver to impress with their racing and their instinct.</li></ul>This all happens to also be the rules of the Formula One circuit in Europe in the historical drama, Rush.James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Nick Lauda (played by Daniel Brühl) in 1970 are both skilled drivers that build a rivalry at the start of their careers in a Formula Three Race in England. Hunt is a very brash, philandering playboy, while Lauda is more focused, determined racer who uses his own technical genus to develop a better car.Lauda goes as far to get a large loan from the bank so that he can buy his way into the Formula One circuit. He later becomes discovered by Ferrari and joins them, where he wins his first championship in 1975. Hunt spends time on and off his team when they fail to secure a sponsor, but manages to get a spot on the McLaren team when another quits. Each driver manages to rack up points from each race, furthering their revelry through the 1976 season. During the German Grand Prix, Lauda meets a terrible demise as he ends up in a critical crash that leaves his face heavily scarred with burns and terrible pain. He decides to race two months later, not wanting Hunt to win the points as easily. Both guys may have more respect then hatred when the final race in Japan proves to be more treacherous then ever.I came in knowing I was going to watch a good movie. I didn't think that this would be great. Director Ron Howard must be a fan of Formula One car racing, as Rush just looks gorgeous. This is a beautiful looking movie, as it's doing a mix of a seventies television style tint along with a stylish tone.Both Hemsworth and Brühl both work out great as these two rival drivers. What I like about the story is that even though that the racing audience loves them, they are both two different kinds of jerks. Hunt may have more of a likable appeal to the cameras with his quick skills, Lauda is the better racer, knowing his own car better then his mechanics. The pacing here manages to flow just as well as one of the Formula One machines, knowing when to be loud and when to slow down and allow it's story to be told.I'll give this ten Formula One helmets out of ten. This could be the best movie about auto racing around (I don't care for Days of Thunder). Rush is thrilling, tragic, and respectable; just like the two racers of the movie.",10,1,2,9 June 2014
Nightcrawler," Seedy and Sleazy, Nightcrawler Exposes a Dark Thriller About Television Reporting
","I'll tell you; I really hate those that film concerts on their smart phones or tablets. Not only to they obstruct the views from others trying to capture the event with memories, but the filmed footage can never do the outing any justice and will likely never be viewed again. Focusing on capturing the event more or less creates a new intention. Rather then going to listen to the music and talking about what the songs meant or even the artist themselves, the idea now is to bring proof that you were there; to say that you attended the Nicki Minaj rather then enjoyed and had fun at it. I compare those that film concerts in whole similar to the camera crews hired by studios to capture the grittiest of news. For cases like a mass murder, it means trying to find footage of the victims or at least something that was affected by the weapon used. For something unimportant like a DUI, it might amount to shooting the poor sap getting arrested and making a buffoon of him later on. The television studios that show this stuff know that people will watch because they know that most are addicted to anything grizzly happening in their part of town, even if it has nothing to do with them. Nightcrawler examines one such camera guy who takes advantage of the situation.Louis Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a sociopath who doesn't work, but makes money as a thief. He's well read as he shows in one scene where he talks to a construction guy about a job and what he can offer him. Louis is turned away, not aware that he probably scared the guy more them impressed him. On his way home, he witnesses a car crash along with a camera guy, Joe Loder (played by Bill Paxton) shooting the mess. Inspired, Louis buys a camera and a police scanner to get himself in the business. Though he comes to several dead ends, he eventually captures something worthwhile enough for a local TV station to notice. A morning news director, Nina (played by Rene Russo) buys the footage and tells Louis to continue. This gets him to hire an intern, Rick, and starts turning to altering the crime scene to make things more interesting. Nobody else sees Louis doing his dirty deeds, so he is able to become a hit for the station. Rick is the only one in on Louis' actions and might be the only one to turn the tables.Nightcrawler fits right alongside Network and The Truman Show on great movies about the dark side of television. What got me was that it made clear that media companies may know us a bit better then we know. They know we follow patterns on what time we tune in and what to expect. Nightcrawler exposes what people really want; something important to talk about at work, whether it's really a big deal or not. Jake Gyllenhaal has always been kind of a filler actor; a guy that can do a good reading, but has never managed to surprise me. He finally does here, giving a performance that's not only worthy of an Oscar, but may be setting himself a place in the scariest characters on screen. Like Norman Bates or Alex DeLarge, Gyllenhaal delivers a character that is absolutely terrifying because we can never understand what goes through his head. There's never any sympathy for those he invades; he shoots and makes money. The nights of Los Angeles are the perfect backdrop for this setting, filling our characters with unnatural lighting and ideas. I'll give this ten camera flashes out of ten. Nightcrawler is seedy, sleazy, and a great thriller for those that want to see something held besides a gun. How about a camera?",10,2,6,6 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," The Lonely Island get a funny movie out of Popstar: Never Stop Never Stoping, even if the joke runs out too soon
","The best movies about show business are usually done as mockumentaries. Somehow, the style feels more real when ironically, nothing about the characters are real themselves. A lot of it comes down that the people making the mockumentary probably understand the most about troubles and tribulation on what goes on behind the curtain. They know that the biggest stars are the craziest people around. They've figured out how unforgiving that show business world can be. They especially know how hard life can still be with the fame (or without it). Though there are plenty of regular feature films that have parodied the show business world fine enough, the mockumentary style somehow makes it look more unsentimental.At the top of my head, the best movies about entertainment are A Hard Days Night This is Spinal Tap, and the lesser-known Waiting for Guffman. All three portray the world of show biz with some really funny characters (or in the case of the Beatles, exaggerated versions of themselves), and a relatable story on the hardship of trying to make it and how they manage to continue onward. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a modern day look at the music industry. The mockumentary is a look at the fictional band Style Boys and their frontman Conner Friel (played by Andy Samberg). Conner is a musical prodigy and has always counted on his friends to support his dreams. After years of working together and making a mark on the charts, they break up when one of the members Lawrence (played by Akiva Schaffer) is not given credit for a song nor is even thanked when Conner wins an award for it. His other friend Owen (played by Jorma Taccone) stays on and moves into the background as Conner's DJ, while Conner reinvents himself as a Justin Bieber-like singer called 'Conner4Real'.His first album Thriller, Also is a hit and advances him to massive stardom. His ego (and low intelligence) pushes him to make reckless choices and surrounds himself with yes-men who only encourage more bad ideas. His second album Connquest is met with critical bashing and a bad publicity stunt that causes massive blackouts (I can't tell why, it's too funny). He attempts to continue a world tour with opening act rapper Hunter the Hungry starting to gain more popularity then it's main star. The movie is filled with interviews from real life icons like Simon Cowell, User, Carrie Underwood, Seal, Pink, Arcade Fire, and even Ringo star.When you really get down to it, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a film version of Andy Samberg's parody band Lonely Island. Though comedic, Lonely Island has generated real hits, real concerts, and has even been nominated for an academy award. Andy Samberg clearly understands the world he comes from, as he makes some sharp criticism about the music industry. All the songs featured here are very funny, catchy, and oddly sound like something that I would hear on the radio. What Samberg also understands is how guys like him could make it in the world. Though obviously exaggerated, I can't help but think that some real life musicians are as naive as Conner is here. As funny as the joke is, I'll admit that it does start to run out of steam sooner then it should. Though running short at an hour and twenty minutes, it still felt way longer then it should be. Perhaps if we saw some more fake musicians that Conner is up against, we might have seen some justification to go on longer. Though this will probably play well on the digital market, it barely makes it as a movie. I'll give this seven Lonely Island albums out of ten. The joke is funny, even if it's not as substantial as it wants to be. Most music fans and those that have liked Andy Samberg will probably enjoy this parody. I'd say give the Lonely Island music a listen too first and them maybe check this movie out.",7,0,13,6 June 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Another one bites the dust? Nah, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine enough to proclaim 'We Are the Champions'
","Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. These are just a few lyrics of the famous Queen song, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' that is still one of the greatest songs of all time. In fact, there are a lot of songs by Queen I can recite including 'We Will Rock You', 'Radio Ga Ga', 'Under Pressure', and of course, 'We Are the Champions'. Along with very catchy melodies, the bands prominence could not been without the vocal range of Freddy Mercury.That combination of an amazing voice and the right players is so prominent, that it was like catching lightning in a bottle. I can hardly come up with one good song let alone an entire catalog that still holds up. I had a lot of their stuff growing up, and even now, I still find myself going to Queen's music whenever I wanted some uplifting rock. Again, I think a lot of it rides on Freddy Mercury, who was one of the few people in existence who was destined for greatness. If a genius like Mozart has a great movie like Amadeus, perhaps Freddy Mercury can be replicated with the biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody.In 1970, we open with an Indian-British man then known as Farrokh Bulsara, before he became Freddy Mercury (played by Rami Malek) who works as a baggage handler at an airport. He goes to a nightclub where he sees a band called Smile playing. When their lead singer leaves the group, Freddy meets guitarist Brian May (played by Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Played by Ben Hardy) and offers to be their new lead singer. They agree, get a new bassist John Deacon (played by Joseph Mazzello) and rename their band Queen.They play nightclubs, and Freddy's voice and onstage persona get the bands fame to quick success. At the same time, Freddy even gets engaged with Mary Austin (played by Lucy Boynton). Even when their original label refuses to release 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as a single, they manage to make it a hit and their fourth album A Night at the Opera is their biggest. During this time however, Freddy questions his sexuality when he begins an affair with his manager Paul. This pushes Freddy away from the band in favor of him looking for 'Somebody to Love'.You'd think that a movie about Freddy Mercury would be a grand, almost operatic like experience. For what it is, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine. Its not a great movie, but it was entertaining. It was said that the real life band members wanted the movie the focus on them all, but most people really want to know Freddy. We get some idea, thanks to the amazing performance of Rami Malek. Even if his makeup can look a little off, he still captures the excitement and flamboyance while making him human. I'm glad they dubbed him instead of trying to recreate his singing voice, as most people would have spotted it immediately.So if the actor had got it right, what's wrong with the movie? Its not that the movie is bad, but that it's like any other music biopic. We see the group form, try and write and record music, get it on the radio, perform tours, see people come and go, see them return and settle their differences. I know the movie wanted to show the story of Queen, but we've come far within telling those stories. I was happy and satisfied, but something still felt missing. The best I can describe was that while it does a good job imitating Queen and Freddy Mercury, it always feels like an imitation.Think back to other music movies like Love & Mercy and the remake of A Star is Born. Both movies showed the trials of being an artist, what that means for the people around them, and the pressure of living up to that fame. Part of me still deosn't know much about Freddy Mercury other then he was bisexual and loved to throw parties. In fact, the furthest I got was that most of the members of Queen were college nerds who formed a group.I'll give this six A Night at the Opera albums out of ten. The movie has good moments (including an amazing recreation of Live Aid that was the highlight of the film) and even give you the story of Queen. While I think Queen fans are going to want more, most people will probably be happy. It does deliver what it promises and does so fine. So I do recommend this anyway if you like Queen. The show must go on, so see it and see if it's worthy of singing 'We are the Champions'",6,8,11,7 November 2018
Baby Driver," Baby Driver is one of the best of 2017. It's musically-synced story to car chases are perfection
","Let's talk about Edgar Wright. He is clearly a fan of the movies, given how much he references them in his own work. Heck, his Cornetto trilogy films (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End) are love letters to various genres while telling good stories about friendships. But his work has come of the best editing that I've seen. Not only is he good at creating speed and pace, but his use of sound (and not just music, but little sound effects) makes his work rewatchable just so that you can catch every little joke he threw in. Baby Driver continues his plight to pay tribute to his favorite American movies. In the case of driving movies like Smokey and the Bandit and thief movies like Heat and Reservoir Dogs, their legacy is felt, along with more hits as a comedy. This also happens to be Edgar Wright's first American movie, so you could tell he wanted to make something that would please his fans and a mainstream audience, likely hoping that this will lead to bigger things. I for one have been excited to see Baby Driver and how entertaining it could be as a car movie. Getaway driver 'Baby' (played by Ansel Elgort) works for criminal mastermind Doc (played by Kevin Spacy) as the best driver for bank robbers in Atlanta. Baby seems to get himself in the mindset by constantly playing music, depending on his mood and situation. This extends to his home life where he cares for his foster father, but also mixes his recorded conversations into songs. His recent mission with robbers 'Buddy' (played by Jon Hamm), 'Griff' (played by Jon Bernthal) and 'Darling' (played by Eliza González), gets him closer to settling whatever debt he has with Doc. Baby seems to be finding some new happiness with waitress Debora (played by Lilly James) who has a similar interest in music. To top it off, after performing a mission with 'Bats' (played by Jamie Foxx), Baby thinks that his life of crime is finally over. Doc quickly visits him to tell him that is far from the truth. Baby agrees to be the getaway driver for a mission involving the US Postal service before secretly escaping with Debora. Like any good movie, several things go wrong and it's now a chase for Baby to escape his fellow robbers and the police. Baby Driver is exactly what I think about when I define 'cinematic fun'. Like a lot of Edgar Wright's previous movies, it's all orchestrated in musical perfection. While this is not a musical, the constant songs are almost like a character in the movie, giving us a reminder how music can make or break a film. The first five minutes perfectly set up the comedic, but badass tone with the use of 'Bellbottoms' by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The movie keeps up it's fast pace throughout the hour and fifty minute runtime. Think of this as a modern day American Graffiti if it had bank robbers. The casting is a rare complete perfection. I cannot think of one person that was not right for the part. Ansel Elgort is very likable and charming as the young driver. He manages to carry the weight of this character's ear problem that makes him listen to his music (which I didn't mention before, but didn't want to spoil too much of). Performances from Kevin Spacy, Jamie Fox and Lilly James are good, though my favorite was of Jon Hamm for reasons that I can't give away without spoiling. Let's just say that the role of the main villain is not who you think. You may be surprised to learn that while there are a lot of car chases, a majority of the action does not happen till the second half. The first takes a great deal of time getting to know our characters, and the relationship that happens between Baby and Debora. If I had to make any criticism of some sort, I wish that Lilly James would have been given a little more to do, even though they make her a good 'damsel in distress' type for the purpose of the story. Aside from that, I can guarantee that Baby Driver is already on my future list of favorite movies of 2017.I'll give this ten classic IPods out of ten. I have a hard time imagining that anyone will hate Baby Driver. It's very entertaining that's timed to perfection, like our story's bank robbers. I can only say to get in the car and see thisin the theater. We need more original content like this.",10,34,70,28 June 2017
Justice League," Though Justice League is a mess, it has good moments that don't make it a total loss
","Boy has DC Comics come a far way when it comes to its cinematic adaptations. For years, we've gotten a lot of Batman and Superman movies. It wasn't until Man of Steel when Warner Brothers decided to follow Disney and Marvel's footsteps and create their own cinematic universe. Man of Steel was split for a lot of people, but it had managed to establish it's own identity that actually fairs well with DC's image. The difference between to comic giants was that Marvel was humans becoming gods and DC was gods becoming humans. So why has it continued to split people?A lot of it has to do with how Warner Brothers has been handling it's property. Like a lot of people, I blame that rather then doing the work of making several movies before they get to a major crossover point, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice tried to jump five steps ahead by having too much of a good thing. Now that were looking at Justice League, it has a lot to live up to. For many of these characters, this is the first time were seeing the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg on the big screen. Let's see if Justice League can live up to it's expectation and be heroic. After Supermans death, Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) has decided to atone for his mistake of misjudging and build a team of metahumans or fellow super powered humans in case another threat comes to Earth. With help from Alfred (played by Jeremy Iron) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Played by Gal Gadot), they talk to the quick willed Barry Allen (played by Ezra Miller) from Central City, the legendary fish man of the Scandinavian Arthur Curry (played by Jason Momoa) and the half human half artificial intelligent living computer Victor Stone (played by Ray Fisher) into joining their new league. Meanwhile, an alien villain Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds) has returned to Earth to try and reclaim a set of 'mother boxes' in order to start an apocalypse. One of then is in Atlantis, another is on Diana Prince's home island Themyscira, and one more is hidden within the human world. Though the team of heroes, now called the Justice League, manage to retrieve the final mother box, Steppenwolf has built an army that has proved difficult for everyone. Will Superman make a return to help his fellow metahumans?Justice League is a messthat happens to have good things within. Let's get into the positives first. It's clear that director Zack Snyder (and Joss Whedon) has understood the mistakes from Batman V Superman, and have done things to improve. The plot is tighter and focused on one goal; stop the villain from taking over the world. The overall look is going in the right direction with brighter colors taking fold, thus making guys like Wonder Woman and the Flash seems more like beacons of hope. Plus, the relationships between the characters are more defined and are used to it's entertaining advantage. The two favorites here are Miller as the Flash and Gadot as Wonder Woman. They have a fair amount of screen time that establishes Miller as inexperienced, but with a mouth that's as quick as his actions. Gadot is showing more vulnerability has her connection to the humans has evolved since Wonder Woman. Affleck is great as Batman, but looks constanly disinterested as Bruce Wayne. Momosa does okay with his material (though with not enough time to show more of his personality) and Cyborg seems to have gotten the shaft as he's only in to do computer stuff for the sake of the plot. The problem is that Justice League feels like the tenth film in a series that seems to have skipped ahead (again, that blame is on Batman V Superman for rushing the cinematic universe).Now for the negatives. Steppenwolf is a surprisingly boring villain as he's your typical one- dimensional villain bent on destruction. Nothing new and even worse then Lex Luther's poor motivation in the last movie. A lot of the humor adds a bit more of a necessary lighter tone, but it doesn't always mesh with the Snyder-tone already established. Though it's been well publicized that Joss Whedon took over for the reshoots, it's painfully obvious when he came in, given that his are more humorous when compared to some of the fight scenes and other development scenes that are more grim and serious. I'll give this five Justice League comics out of five. This movie is learning as it's going, but it still has a lot of rough spots. I hope that future DC films lay off on the crossovers in order to give characters like the Flash and Aquaman a chance to shine in their own movies. I doubt I'll return to this like I do for Tim Burton's Batman, but I can see a lot of people overcoming this mistakes for the films more entertaining parts. If your just looking for your heroes fighting, you'll get plenty of it. You'll even get a lot of laughs and entertainment. I just don't think it's for me. Take it in perspective and see if the DC cinematic is worth saving.",5,14,27,17 November 2017
The Thing," The Thing cannot be described. It is simply John Carpenter's best work, combining all elements of suspense, horror, and special effects
","One thing you may notice about some of the best horror films is that they know how to portray the feeling of being alone. Nothing is scarier then knowing that no help can or will come when darkness is taking fold. Either you have to figure out a way to defeat it or you have to accept that your end is about to come. You simply have to hope. The Haunting, The Exorcist, Evil Dead, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are great examples about the terror of being alone. Even modern movies like Saw, Paranormal Activity, and Get Out use the same element to create that same level of suspense. I've said before that I considered John Carpenter's Halloween to be overrated as I found the premise slow and poorly written. While it too has the feeling of being alone, today's movie, The Thing, is a better example of that. The only thing worse then being in the middle of nowhere is having to be there with something you have no understanding of at all. That should really be the case for a lot of alien movies, as if an extraterrestrial being was going to attack, how would we know what to do? The Thing makes great suspense around that. In Antarctica, a group of American scientists are holding up for the long season as they do whatever they do. They see a Norwegian helicopter flying in, trying to shoot a dog, only for it to land and start shooting the Americans. They manage to defend themselves before the Norwegian accidentally blows up the helicopter, killing him in the process. Helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady (played by Kurt Russell) and Dr. Cooper (played by Richard Dysart) go to the Norwegian base, only to find the place abandoned with dead bodies and video tapes. The Americans keep the dog, unaware their making a big mistake.When the dog is boarded with the sled dogs, it attacks them, metamorphing into a hideous monster. MacReady manages to use a flamethrower in time with friend Childs (played by Keith David). Fellow scientist Blair (played by A. Wilford Brimley) performs an autopsy on one of the dead Norwegians, to discover that the monster can imitate anything. This creates paranoia amongst the group as they know the alien's cells are still circulating around the camp and that if it gets into civilization, it's the end of human life as they know it. It's a race to see whose lying and which member is now the monsterthe thing.I'm stopping right there as this movies is at it's best when you don't know much about it. The Thing may be not just Carpenter's best work, but one of the best horror movies. It all revolves around the constant feeling that the environment is a ticking time bomb (like Assault on Precinct 13), but adds on the idea that no one can be trusted. I was concerned as I didn't get into his previous horror movie, Halloween, but Carpenter has found the right thing that makes it work; interesting characters.Kurt Russell is once again a great lead, playing the leader-hero you'd expect, but now that he has that heightened sense of fright, your with him, not sure just who to trust, even though you'd like the believe those that say their alright. That's because the movie takes time to show that this is a group of guys that have been there for a while and are friends. The dynamic is tested to the limit when all gloves come off to see when the alien will stand. Which one is lying? Whose got that element that's slightly off? Is it the fear? Is it the alien? The Thing goes into that. Once the alien shows itself, you get an impressive looking set of practical effects that gives it an unnerving appearanceall kinds. I can't describe the creature, as it's made up of the victims it's killed, all melded together to make something very gross, yet is still able to do anything to add on. As the story progresses, it only gets bigger and uglier, making it more of a challenge to destroy. It all leads to a fantastic standoff that sums up how well built a movie can be.I'll give this ten thing creatures out of ten. The Thing may be my favorite John Carpenter film, as it contains most of his elements, while having a lot of that suspense that I originally thought I was going to get with Halloween. This is not a duplicate or a copy of another horror story (despite being a remake). This is the read deal. Check out The Thing.",10,1,3,21 November 2017
The Revenant," The Revenant goes through bear mauling to Indian attacks to push Leonardo DiCaprio through this interesting dark western
","The biggest distinction between older westerns (made before the 1970s) and the more current ones is how they portray the atmosphere. Both establish well enough that it was an unforgiving environment, but there is something safer about the older ones; an idea that you could at least get a drink from the saloon without a chance of getting shot. Now of course, we know that even a walk down main street was never a guarantee as there were a lot of deaths due to idiots with guns or greedy individuals who have surrendered their humanity in order to survive. We're lucky that we live in such a time period where we've found treatments for so many injuries and diseases that the lifespan has spun out of control. Back when even reaching sixty was a stretch is becoming more of the common middle ground. Back then, if you were lucky enough to make it through the madness that was the 'survival of the fittest attitude', you still had to last through horrible diseases, attacks from unfriendly Native Americans, and of course, the forces of natures. The story of one frontiersman and his trek through the wilderness shows no mercy in The Revenant.In the early days of conquering the west in 1832, a military party of hunters and trappers are ambushed by the Arikara tribe. The attack leads to two thirds dead and the escaped survivors weary and trying to make their way back to civilization. Under the command of Captain Andrew Henry, it's agreed by fur trapper Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) to ditch their only boat to hike the rest of the way, in order to avoid any more Indian attacks. Glass gets mauled by a mother grizzly bear and is wounded to the point where the rest of his party is convinced that he's going to die.Two men stay behind in order to wait for Glass to die so they can give him a proper burial, John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter). Fitzgerald grows impatient and convinces Bridger to leave Glass behind so they can get to a nearby fort sooner for warmth and food. Even with the broken leg, broken ribs, and exposed wounds from the bear attack, Glass regains conciseness and proceeds to head in the direction that Fitzgerald was going to get his revenge for leaving him behind. Glass faces cold temperatures, his own wounds, and still hostile Indians in order to get to safety.Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Birdman), then you'll see that not only did he create a dark western, but wanted to make sure his actors would understand how harsh the environment was. The Revenant is self aware of how uncomfortable and gritty it is (even more so then The Hateful Eight) as is Leonardo DiCaprio who is the one to suffer the most. He gives everything he has for this nearly silent (yet still speaking two Native American languages) frontiersman who goes through hell, literally and figuratively, for the performance that looked to be so hard, that if he doesn't finally get an Oscar, is clear proof that the academy hates him for no real reason.Tom Hardy and Will Poulter manage to stand out in their own scenes, even knowing that there's no way they could have outshined DiCaprio. The Revenant makes for a very interesting journey that unfortunately is plagued by it's own tone. Since were following one guy's journey home, the two and a half hour running time is a lot to ask of it's audience. It worked better for Cast Away as the environment constantly changed, while we're stuck in this grim, snowy setting the entire time. I'll give this eight bear skins out of ten. Aside from being the major justification to finally let Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant happens to be a pretty good journey into the harsh west. It's understandably not for everyone, but if your can stomach the worst from animal guts and broken bones, then this journey into hell is an interesting one.",8,1,6,12 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks strikes again with the fantastic political-legal thriller, Bridge of Spies
","As a child who grew up during the late nineties through the mid 2000's, I was part of the first generation to be raised in an era where there wasn't a second great power on Earth. Being born in 1987, I was living within the Cold War for only a few years, during the last moments of an interesting generation for America; a generation that once thought that a third World War with the Soviets was possible and that any day could be the last before the bomb was dropped. It was the last of an era were today's movie perfectly says was a war of information.Given how many WWII movies are out there, I'm surprised that nostalgia and our obsession with history has not produced more movies about the Cold War. Though there are plenty before the Soviet Union was dissolved (Including Dr. Strangelove, Rocky IV and my favorite of the bunch, WarGames), you'd think that more stories about the era would have opened up allowing for plenty of entertaining options. Steven Spielberg is a director that has tackled WWII plenty of times (1941, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), so Bridge of Spies should seem like a literal and figurative bridge to connect that transition. In 1957 Brooklyn, a middle-aged painter Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) is seen picking up a secret message and reads it before FBI agents burst into his apartment. He's arrested and prosecuted as a Soviet spy, sparking a media and public demand for his death. As per rule by the court, Rudolf is given a lawyer for his defense, which turns out to be James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks). The interesting thing is that James is an insurance lawyer with little experience in criminal law, but takes the case anyway to show that he's loyal to his profession.James receive hate mail and accusations from people, his own children and even get's approached by the CIA, but stands on his ground that he's simply doing his job, helping the soviet spy. Though Rudolf is found guilty, James convinces the judge the give a jail sentence rather then death in case of needed collateral. That moment comes soon enough when CIA agent Francis Gary Powers is shot down and jailed by the Soviets. Both governments agree to an exchange, but not only does James actually have to go to East Germany to negotiate the deal, but when another American is jailed, he tries to get a two for one prisoner.Steven Spielberg has a track record that's easy to rely to when defending his movies, yet I wasn't sure how I'd respond to the political-legal thriller that Bridge of Spies is. I'm proud to say that it s engaging in a most unexpected way. While the subject doesn't seem too remarkable, once you get to know both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's (who I hope gets an awards nomination for his portrayal) character, you get a good idea of what both sides are hoping to achieve, both as a stance on what it means to be loyal to your country and doing what's right.Aside from being a strong character piece, Bridge of Spies has a different look then you might expect from the more whimsical Spielberg. This fits right along his darker material as most of the movie is shown is greyer tones and surprisingly gets greyer once the story shifts to East Germany. With that said, the recreation of a Cold War Berlin looks great, especially when you see Tom Hanks riding the train to the other side where the wall shows what the difference is in one moment (which I won't give away).I'll give this ten cold war posters out of ten. Bridge of Spies is guaranteed one of my favorite movies of 2015 and deserves at least one watch from not just cold war fanatics or even history fanatics, but from the mainstream crowd. Bridge of Spies will get least start one conversation going once the end credits roll.",10,5,9,27 October 2015
Split," Split is intentionally frustrating and crazy...right for a thrilling look at multiple personality disorder
","I think it's safe to say that everyone must have some voice in their head. Most would say it was their conscience, but what if it were another real person. If you didn't know who they were and what was going in their head, you'd probably run and get the mental hospital down there a.s.a.p. But if you understood what multiple personality disorder was like, then you'd understand that the person with two people on the inside is telling the truth. Taking insanity out of the books, it needs to be understood that ones identity is already complex with tangents of owns thoughts. Now picture having another complex mind in your body. While the idea has been done in other movies (The Three Faces of Eve, Fight Club, and Me, Myself and Irene), I cannot recall it at the extent that director M. Night Shyamalan is going for in today's movie. I feel bad for the guy as he scored with two great movies (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) yet has become a Hollywood laughing stock with the majority of his resume not being that hot. After making a better comeback film with The Visit, Split seems more like a spiritual redemption for the man's career. Teenager Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) is quiet, introverted, and doesn't seem to be enjoying a birthday party of a fellow student who was probably forced to invite her. As Casey and the other girls, Claire and Marsa, are sitting in the car waiting for their dad to drive them home, a stranger enters and knocks them out of conciseness. When they wake up, the women are now in a windowless room with a bathroom and a locked door. Entering in at first is the stranger, who calls himself Dennis (played by James McAvory) who tells them that they have been chosen.Sometime later, the girls see a woman through the keyhole of their room and try to alert her. To their shock, this is the same man who is presenting himself as 'Patrica' who assures them that 'Dennis' is not allowed to touch them, but they are being saved for something great. More so later, Casey find the guy sitting at the door, now saying he's a nine year old named Hedwig. It's revealed that not only does this guy have twenty-three personalities but another called 'The Beast' is coming and will do horrible things.I need to stop here as the majority of the second half of Split is spoilers. What makes this really good is that not only is the multiple personalities fully fleshed out people, but that some are stronger and can even impersonate the others. I can only say that actor James McAvoy may have already given one of the best performances of 2017. Aside for being frightening, he carries the weight of several people and makes you both hate and sympathize with him. What your going to feel for in the end cannot be spoiled with. What I can say is that on it's own, Split is really good. Is it great? I don't know is I can go that far. My problem is not with McAvoy nor the young women, but rather the subplot involving McAvoy's therapist. It's not that Betty Buckley is bad, but given how she's trying to say that his personalities are a part of something bigger (again, cannot give away), it's somewhat campy and even a little campy. And give in mind, her side story is supposed to be taken seriously. It does add up in the end, but I felt that could have been portrayed better. At least Split still makes for a thrilling ride through ones mind.I'll give this eight pictures of windows out of ten. I can see this not just doing well for a mainstream audience, but for previous fans of Shyamalan who have felt let down by the man's previous work. Without spoiling, I'll say that a lot of people are going to want something of a follow up. I really can't say more, but they'll want it. Trust me. See if this stories' personality makes sense and give this redemption a chance.",8,2,11,21 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Even with a large story and five different Spider people, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an entertaining movie with a story and look that's all it's own
","We've got Peter Parker. We've got web-shooters. We've got a group of villains called 'The Sinister Six'. Yep, we've got a Spider-Man movie again. It used to be we would go several years between the further adventures of New York's web slinger. Now were going months. In fact, Spider-Man had a big part of the MCU epic Avengers: Infinity War back in May. So what's going on in December that requires an additional movie? You'd be surprised by how vast the comic world is that does justify another movie.Like how many people have played a particular superhero, many people have played Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. One popular addition is of another New York kid named Miles Morales. He garnered phrased for being the first half African-American, half Puerto Rican character to play a superhero. He was also noted for taking Spider-Man back to a youthful demeanor as Peter Parker in the story was getting a little old. But it doesn't stop there. There's also Spider-Woman, Silk, Spider-Noir, and even an anthropomorphic pig called Spider-Ham who operates on cartoon logic. While we don't exactly get all of them, we do get a bunch of them, along with an origin story for Miles in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Young teenager Miles Morales (played by Shameik Moore) is adjusting to a new life at a prestigious boarding school academy, at the insistence of his cop father Jefferson (played by Brian Tyree Henry) who wants a better life for his son. Miles wants to impress his parents, but finds comfort in his more free spirited uncle Aaron (played by Mahershala Ali). One night, while the two of them do some graffiti art in a hidden area of the subway, not only does Miles get bitten by a spider, but also witnesses a battle and death of the popular Peter Parker Spider-Man while spotting Kingpin (played by Live Schreiber) working on a large machine that takes affect.Like Peter Parker's story, Miles starts to notice changes like sticking to walls and spider senses. He visits Peter's grave to think about what to do next. Its here where an older Peter Parker (Played by Jake Johnson) meets him and asks for help to help him return to his own dimension. While uncovering plans from Kingpin to open several dimensions, Miles also comes across Spider-Gwen (Played by Haile Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Played by Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (played by Kimiko Glenn) and her robot, and Spider-Ham (played by John Mulaney) who all help figure everything out.As you can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse juggles a lot and almost makes the mistake of cramming too much for one movie. Amazingly, the script not only keeps every character listed above in check, but also makes it a great story for young Miles Morales. If your worried that this is another origin story, this is one that puts a lot of focus of Miles and his relationship with his father and uncle. I can't disclose why, but it really creates new pressure that Peter Parker never had to face.In terms of the rest of the characters, I really like this side to Peter Parker that we had yet to get from the other adaptations; a Spider MAN. A man whose gone through so much and had his heart broken several times, that he's more of a broken hero that needs fixing himself. His story balanced out well with Miles. He also gets a good scene involving the aunt May of this universe, almost like seeing a living ghost that was very sweet. While I don't want to give too much away, each Spider person gets their own arc as they navigate their way through Mile's world.Let's talk about the animation, which looks great. Rather then going for a Pixar/DreamWorks look, this Spider-Man story has a comic book-look that takes advantage of that fact, along with that it's also animated. Unlike a lot of live action movies where use of computers can occasionally be distracting if not done well, it all blends well, especially with the action sequences. The angles remind me of the comic pages I still turn, given the use of color and word bubbles, that never become annoying, and are used accordingly to amplify the drama and comedy. This is a movie with the rare distinction where it's all it's own.I'll give this ten Spider-Man comics out of ten. This was a fun and different Spider-Man movie that we needed, even more then Spider-Man: Homecoming. It could come off as too weird for some, but given the story's focus is still on this kid's growth as a hero and a teenager, it never felt overwhelming. It was an odd example of everything accidently fitting into piece. This is an absolute recommendation. Swing in and go see it.",10,10,19,17 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Even with a weak villain, Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation makes up with grand over the top stunts and an ageless Tom Cruise
","At this point, I may have to dub Tom Cruise the immortal man. I was watching him being interviewed on the John Stewart Show and he may have had the experience of a Hollywood acting master, yet he has the enthusiasm of an aspiring actor. He answered every question about his career with a smile and would go on about how each experience from The Outsiders to Rock of Ages to Mission Impossible would be his favorite. He also happens to remain one of the few international stars that can carry a picture by being himself. The new millennial Hollywood wants to escape into a story rather then watch a reenactment from their favorite celebrity. If you look at older movie stars like Gene Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, Carry Grant, or even john Wayne, you can rely on their charm to carry a story you want to see them in, but not so much with their character. Today there seem to only be a few actors that have that kind of charm. Men like Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kevin Spacy are people that can play characters, but most people just see the actors. It's not a bad thing as I still enjoy Tom Cruise in movies like Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation. Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) has been on the trail of a rumored underground elite called the Syndicate. One mission in London has him captured by the group that proves their existence, but a disavowed British agent Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson) lets him escape. Back in Washington, agent Will Brandt (played by Jeremy Renner) and CIA director Alan Hunley (played by Alec Baldwin) appear before a Senate committee to justify the IMF's actions from now and before (like the previous movie missions). Unable to reveal operational details, the group sides with Hunley, disbanding the IMF into the CIA, also making Ethan Hunt a wanted man.Six months later, intelligence analyst Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) is sent tickets to an opera in Vienna. He flies over there to find that Ethan actually sent him there to recruit him for a mission to continue to track the Syndicate. They happen to find the man they are looking for, Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris), who has sent someone from the Syndicate to assassinate the chancellor of Austria. The mission goes wrong, sending Ethan, Benji, and Ilsa on a globe trotting adventure to see if the Syndicate has greater intentions, whether Ethan may be losing his mind, and whether the CIA can find the team.The problem I had before going in was knowing that Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was already one f the best movies from 2011 and one of the best spy movies of all time At least Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation manages to be just as exciting as the last film. These movies tend to have more of an over-the-top and comedic edge against the Bourne and James Bond movies. The stunts are just as awesome as before with too many to count scenes that could easily be watched on YouTube for a quick rush. Speaking of over-the-top, watching these characters interact happens to be a highlight of the series. Tom Cruise is just as cool and Simon Pegg brings a lot of quirkiness to the picture. Rebecca Ferguson has some good scenes as our 'go to double agent'. Our heroes may have been set up to fight (and fight they do!), it's unfortunate that the villain is not as interesting. Sean Harris seems to be only set on 'monotone hiss' with his voice and doesn't have much of personality. At least there were plenty of enemies for Cruise to fight, and if the Syndicate is here to stay, maybe they can find a more interesting villain for Mission Impossible 6. I'll give this seven diving stunts out of ten. Had the film's villain been more interesting, this might have been better then Ghost Protocol, but seemed more focused on setting up a group of villains instead. The stunts and banter though make up plenty and at least allow for a fun watch. So see this movieshould you chose to accept it.",7,4,6,31 July 2015
Dunkirk," One part suspenseful and two parts engaging, Dunkirk is the loudest silent movie I've seen (it's also incredible)
","History has proved that war is Hell. Soldiers that have been there and back will reveal that they were in constant fear that any moment could be their last. There was no such thing as a safe haven. The moment they would retreat to their tents and shut their eyes for the evening would be treasured as they were never sure if they would ever wake up. Sure, having their hands on a gun or even knife might give them some reassurance, but the cloud of death is felt by everyone, with the acceptance that they're okay with sacrifice. There are too many war movie to name, but how many of them deal with the actual fear that came with it? Even I'm hard pressed to fully name one. I think it has to do with the ideology that's similar to how the American government wants the public to see its military; fearless. Vulnerability seems to be seen as more of a sign of weakness then humanity, especially in film. It's always about trying to be the hero. It's all about showing that your have to stand and face the enemy. What if I were to say it's okay to run? Dunkirk let's you know that it's alright to dream of home within hopelessness.The film opens with some history exposition informing the audience that it's 1940 and very early into WWII. We are then introduced to three different stories that seemingly blend together as the film progresses. First on the land is about a young British private Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) who (along with the rest of the troops) is being pushed closer and closer to the ocean. He joins with fellow private Gibson (played by Aneurin Barnard) and later Alex (played by Harry Styles) as they simply hope to catch a boat that will take them home.The second story on the water is about an older mariner Mr. Dawson (played by Mark Rylance) as he and his son Peter join with several sailors in transporting their ships to Dunkirk to help with the troop rescue. They later pickup a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) and deal with him wanting to turn the boat around.The last story in the air, centers around three spitfire pilots on the English Channel to provide support from the Nazi attacks. Though one of the pilots Farrier (played by Tom Hardy) gas gauge breaks, he continues to fight as long as he can.If film has been about immersing audiences into new worlds, then Dunkirk will transport you to the terror of WWII. Right from the opening scene (which I will not DARE spoil), I found myself flinching to gunshots and explosions, as if I was in a VR experience. Director Christopher Nolan again extends his belief that cinema should be an experience and Dunkirk is an incredible suspenseful war movie that gave me an idea of what fear I would have felt had I been in the military. It's been said that real veterans of the Dunkirk event felt like they had returned. I can say that this movie looks and sounds incredible. For such a story that shot in a wide scope, you ironically feel that claustrophobia that each of the men in France felt when they thought they were going to die. Sometimes its right on the beach and sometimes it's on the sailboat in the little rooms where that may have been the only safe place. I saw this in IMAX, and I can say that it amplifies the sound to a level that added the number of times I jumped from my seat. Will Dunkirk receive a best picture nomination? It's tough to tell, but I'm sure it's already guaranteed all of the technical awards from effects to sound to especially score by the great Hans Zimmer. The music, like the movie, all feel like a ticking time bomb that will eventually go off, yet you never see the timer. If I had any issue is that the movie does feel a little long even with it's hour and forty minute running time. A lot of that has to do with that you listen to very little dialogue and all the focus is the reaction of the characters. This makes for what has to be the loudest silent movie I've seen.I'll give this ten Dunkirk flags out of ten. Watching Dunkirk on the big screen will feel like a historical roller coaster, so if sound volume doesn't bother you, spring for the IMAX screening if you can. While I can't say this is Nolan's best work, Dunkirk justifies his claim that we need cinema for movies like these.",10,6,17,24 July 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," With a great story of time travel, alternative history, super powers, and finding wisdom, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the smartest and best of the series.
","The idea that we could have an alternative is fascinating. If the multiverse theory is correct, in which there are an infinite amount of parallel universes, how many kinds of possibilities would you want to know. I love the idea of alternative timelines, given that when we make one choice, the alternative would have done the opposite. What would have happened if you never went out on your first date? What if you went to school in a different country? What if the smallest decision you made over a lunch break was actually a universal change that you would never have guessed?In the world of fiction, especially fan fiction, it's interesting to see how our favorite characters would have evolved, given different circumstances. Alternative stories will usually happen when the original idea has its own flaws. The X-Men franchise has been given plenty of sequels, spin- offs and the recent X-Men: First Class that unfortunately causes this universe to be kind of messy. I like the X-Men, but I'll admit that X-Men: The Last Stand took a lot of directions that did not properly portray it's heroes and taking away ones that could have interesting. X-Men: Days of Future Past attempts to undo those actions.This X-Men movie is both a sequel to the 2000 series and X-Men: First Class, blending the older actors with the new. It's not as complicated as it sounds. It starts in a dystopian future where robots called Sentinels have nearly wiped out the human race, hunting mutants and regular people. The X-Men have done their best to defend themselves, but both Professor Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) know that the only way to stop this is to prevent the war altogether. With Kity Pryde's (played by Ellen Page) ability to send a person's consciousness back in time, Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) wakes up in his younger body.Now in 1973, Wolverine travels to a younger Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy) to discover a broken man and a mutant who has lost his powers in favor of a serum that allows him to walk. Wolverine persuades Xavier to join him to find Raven/Mystique (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and prevent her from killing the creator of the Sentinels, a brilliant scientist Bolivar Trask (played by Peter Dinklage). It all seems to go well, until they realize they need the cooperation of a young Magneto (Played by Michael Fassbender), who still seems bent on making mutants the superior race.Without a doubt, I can say that X-Men: Days of Future Past is the smartest and most thought provoking of the X-Men series. The previous movies have ranged from being great to mediocre. Most of them felt like crowd pleasers, but this one really takes chances and had one goal in mind; to stop an event that may erase previous events before. Getting there is not a chore as it both gives us plenty to digest about the views on mutants and how one must find wisdom to make the right choice.While this is an amazing X-Men story, this is not the most action orientated. Oh there's a lot of fighting, but most of the story is all about Wolverine working his way around 1973 and convincing younger characters that their older selves sent him there. Because it sacrifices superhero action to quality story, this may not be the ideal superhero movie for kids. What about non X-Men fan? Will they be able to enjoy this as much as I did? It's not a hundred percent necessary to know the X-Men, but it helps to know the situation their in. Give the franchise a skim before watching the best. You know what they say, save the best for last.I'll give this ten Magneto helmets out of ten. The X-Men have gotten the movie they deserve, even if it won't please all audiences. I hope people will this this a chance, and they may find themselves becoming X-Men fans.",10,1,4,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," With two big sides taking place, Captain America: Civil War sets up for an awesome superhero movie and story about friendships.
","Though we're still a few weeks into the release, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seems to be setting itself into the position on 'how to NOT make a superhero crossover film'. While I didn't hate the movie as much as some are really making it out to be (some are even calling for director Zack Snyder to be booted from the upcoming Justice League movie that is still good to go), it was still overstuffed with a ton of stories that either needed to be their own movies or cut entirely. Warner Brothers will need to try and model Disney with what the latter has been doing with Marvel Comics and their heroes.Not only does Marvel allow their stories to pace themselves over several movies and bring in a more playful tone, but they seem to try and actually bring in modern day issues that have been controversial. Captain America: The Winter Solider managed to mirror the real life events that have surrounded the NSA and their surveillance on the general public. The American people are split over the upcoming election with extreme rights and extreme lefts about to burst into an electoral civil war. The Avengers too burst into their own struggle in Captain America: Civil War. It seems that the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Utron have become a bit of a nuisance to the Untied Nations with the amount of damage caused by our heroes. While Captain America (played by Chris Evens) is leading some of the avengers on a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion strikes a building, hurting many people. This seals the deal for U.S. secretary of state General Ross (played by William Hurts) to set up a UN panel that would oversee the Avengers and decide when to be called upon. This is called the Sokovia Accords. This puts the entire team in a divide. Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) feels that U.N. intervention is necessary as that they need boundaries and that this could prevent further villains from emerging. Steve Rogers sees the Accords as a bureaucratic headache that would keep them from helping everyone. When the Captain rescues Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) from UN's arrest for a bombing in Vienna, this creates sides. The Captain gets the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man to join his side while Iron Man gets War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man to join his side. Both sets of heroes fight while a Sokovian terrorist Helut Zemo (played by Daniel BrÃ¼hl) plans for a bigger attack.With all the heroes shown in Captain America: Civil War, there is a lot of hype to deliver. Amazingly, it manages to both satisfy those that wanted to see an all superhero melee and paints a great story about friendships. There was a huge risk trying to put in all of these heroes yet remain a story for Steve Rogers.The focus is where it needs to be as it shows a guy who's got to figure which friendship is more important; Bucky or Stark. Both newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man are welcomed warmly into the Marvel Cinematic universe as they get plenty of scenes. The actual battle in the civil war is twenty five minutes of pure joy that show why movies were made; to see moments like that come to life!Now how is the rest of movie supposed to go on after that scene? It's difficult to say because the third act does falter towards the end. We get one more big fight between Captain America and Iron Man that's great, but does not top the civil war sequence. I'm not sure if the solution is to make the final fight bigger or tone down the middle fight. I think that after such a rush of amazing, it's difficult to even continue. I'll give this nine battling heroes out of five. Captain America: Civil War makes for a great start to the next phase of Marvel movies. If not uneven, it's at least exciting. I'd hate to be the one that misses this hero epic in theaters, so don't miss out and pick a side.",9,15,30,10 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's fantastic in plenty of scenes, but Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them needed more magic in it's atmosphere
","'Where's my letter for Hogwarts!' I kept thinking to myself as I sat in my seventh grade science class as I wished more interesting things were being taught. Like most twenty-somethings growing up in the early twenty-first century, I became a part of the Harry Potter phenomenon having read the books, bought a bunch of merchandise, and of course, saw the movies. Harry Potter has the distension of where I consider all the movies good. With the exception of maybe Star Wars (if you don't count the prequels) or Lord of the Rings (if you don't count the prequels), have you heard of another franchise where the entire series has been consistently good?When I left the theater after watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2, I thought we were done with that whole world of wizards and witches. But in that short time, the Hollywood industry has made a big change where franchises can build on it's universe with new characters and different environments. If Disney can do so with their Marvel and new lineup of Star Wars movies, then Harry Potter can do the same thing. Let's see if Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can continue to bring magic to the wizarding world.In 1926, wizard zoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) has arrived in New York to study the animals in America. While walking through the streets, a money-stealing creature escapes his suitcase with Newt trying to catch him. He eventually does, but accidentally doing in front of a muggle (or no-maj as their called in the States. The muggle who escapes before his memory can be erased is Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Folger), a WWI vet who is trying to open a bakery. Newt is captured by Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston) who reveals herself as an auror who works for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA).He taken to MACUSA's offices where fellow auror Percival Graves (played by Colin Farrell) examines Newt's suitcase only to discover donuts; Newt had accidentally switched bags with Jacob. Newt and Tina leave to retrieve the proper suitcase only to arrive at Jacobs place too late. With several magical creatures running around New York City, Newt takes Jacob, Tina, and her sister mind reader Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) to retrieve them.I don't want to give away all the details of this highly anticipated movie, so I'll stop there. With a script by author J.K. Rowling, you'd expect Fantastic Beasts to be as strong as the previous Harry Potter movies, right? It does has great moments, but it's being juggled around in a script that's having a hard time introducing these new characters. I think part of the problem is that we don't get enough time before the action takes off to really know Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is perfectly fitting for this eccentric character, though I wish he didn't mumble half of his lines. Otherwise, I thought that everyone worked great.The story of capturing the rest of these creatures while balancing along with American prejudice seems fine enough, so what's wrong? Id say that even though we do get a good look at how American wizards work in this universe, I would have liked to seen more of it. What the Harry Potter movies did was that the muggle world was only featured when it had no choice. Here, were spending it mostly in 1920's New York (which is designed really well!) which is interesting, but fans really want to see more of the wizards. I'll also say that the action seems to be bigger then before, which is also fine as this is supposed to be a more adult story.I'll give this six nifflers out of ten. It's an good but not great start in a new series. Let's hope that J.K. Rowling can show off more of how the American wizarding world works in a sequel. Fans of the book will probably be satisfied. Those that weren't fans of Harry Potter are not going to be swayed with this one. I think Newt Scamander needs to continue searching for more interesting elements in his story, even though he does has some good things to show here.",6,4,12,18 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," The crooked man and demons make The Conjuring 2 a rare horror sequel that's better then the original
","The case of whether ghosts exist or not has been a fittingly eternal debate. Some say that it's simply a trick on the mind whenever we feel a cool chill. Others say that the presence of these spirits is the key to finding proof on the afterlife. Because of this debate, ghosts and the search for them have never been more popular. Their a constant subject of stories and movies. They even have their own reality show on the Travel Channel titled Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters on Syfy. Some cases, like the one portrayed in the movie, are examples of haunted houses that are covered by real news agencies, yet are still questioned by scientists for their academic basis.What were also looking at is a sequel for 2013 hit The Conjuring. Like many people, I was surprised by how much I liked it, having phrased it for a likable pair of ghost hunters, diving into the personalities of those being haunted, and some genuine good scares. Sequels to horror movies are tough as they tend to repeat stories, loosing much of the unpredictability the original story had. With James Wan returning to his franchise, let's see if The Conjuring 2 can bring us some new scares. We first open with our same husband wife ghost hunting team Ed (played by Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (played by Vera Farmiga) who are examining the Amityville murders (yes, the same one from The Amityville Horror). Loraine attempts to contact the spirits during a seance, but a vision of a demonic nun and of Ed getting killed scares her into convincing she and her husband to retire. We then head across the pond to London where a single mom is raising her four children. Like any horror movie, small things start to happen such as the television set reacting oddly and chairs moving by themselves. Even when they leave an stay at a friends house, the poltergeist follows them there. Various news outlets take in the constant photos and even interview the youngest daughter Janet whose often possessed by that poltergeist. The spirit reveals himself as an old man who had died in the house before the family moved in. The local church hires Lorraine and Ed to investigate. They originally decline, not sure if the events are true or just a hoax. But when they uncover more facts about the house and other demons, this just may prove to be their most dangerous case. The Conjuring 2 is a rare example of not being just as good as the original, but it might even be better. Like before, the story places most of the focus on getting to know the family that's being haunted and of the new tension between our ghost hunters. You feel bad that the family is going through these spooky events, and yet you understand why most academics would consider the hauntings a total fake. There's even a clever moment that makes you question everything that young daughter Janet was doing. Of course I won't spoil that here.Director James Wan is a horror maker who understands how important it is to not just scare people, but to help earn those scares. Anyone can pick up a camera and flicker a few lights to make a scary movie, but he's too smart to fall into that easy trope. He can lead his stories into a spooky symphony that plays so elegantly that you wish he's take charge of all horror movies. The only issue that can be bothersome is that the film's formula is very similar to the first movie. I defend this by saying that James Wan was able to improve on some of the story elements, but some of the suspense is taken away when you realize where things are going. I'll give this nine zoetropes out of ten. The Conjuring 2 is an entertaining sequel that took the best elements from the original and took it another step in storytelling and scares. Fans of the original will defiantly like this movie and maybe even some that didn't watch the first. The good news is that you don't need to see it to enjoy this movie. If your looking for hot summer bump in the night, then The Conjuring 2 is a pretty good choice.",9,0,2,15 June 2016
Inside Out," Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time!
","Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended. I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it. A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move.Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone. Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen.I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that.I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this.",10,48,105,18 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Call it Marvel's last stand. Avengers: Endgame is an awesome finale to the Infinity Saga
","Has the Marvel Cinematic Universe surpassed Star Wars when it comes to cultural icons? I would make the argument. I see more people wearing shirts of the Marvel heroes, kids are playing with the toys, adults still read the comics, and have several theme park attractions (at both Disney and Universal!). Even when it comes to content, Marvel has made more movies then Star Wars (compare Star Wars to its nine and the MCU's 23). The other piece of magic it has that no money could ever buy is its staying power. A lot like how Star Wars will continue to be introduced to new generations, the same will go for the MCU.Marvel also gave us one of the most talked about movies of last year, Avengers: Endgame. Most people I know, even my parents who don't watch superhero movies, were blown away with how much was thrown at them with action humor, and a shockingly bleak ending with half of life being erased and the villain winning. So how was Disney going to top it off in the next part? It's safe the say the Russo brothers did a phenomenal job showing where to go next in Avengers: Endgame. Is it perfect? For the most part.After Iron Man and Nebula are brought back to Earth by Captain Marvel, the surviving Avengers manage to track Thanos to try and undo the snap. Though they kill him, they also see that the stones were destroyed with the snap, thus making the snap permanent. Five years passes as the Earth and the rest of the universe cope with half of life gone. Some have moved on while others haven't. Iron Man has settled down with a family, Wakanda is without a king, many of the cosmic characters like Rocket Raccoon and Captain Marvel are dealing with the problems of space, Thor has become a fat drunk, Bruce Banner and Hulk have merged, and Captain America continues to cope with the fact he's more alone then ever.An new way to fix things comes in the answer of Scott Lang/Ant-Man who reveals that even though he was stuck in the quantum realm for five years, it only felt like five minutes to him. Seeing that time works and manipulates different at that level, the avengers convince Stark to help build a machine to shrink everyone. The goal is to split into teams and get the stones before Thanos does. It's a time heist to restore life and maybe get a second shot at defeating Thanos.Without revealing too much, Avengers: Endgame delivered more then I anticipated. This brings the infinity saga to a proper close that was started in Iron Man. Is it flawless? I wouldn't say that. But let's get to the good stuff first.The story and tone of the movie is great. This is a true epic that despite running over three hours, it doesn't feel like it. They could have added another half hour, but I probably wouldn't notice. Yes, there are a lot of slow burn moments like when the characters go through their struggles of lost friends, time travel, and fights, but all of it feels earned. I give credit to the script for still having some of the best 'tongue-in-cheek' jokes in the series, and putting them in the story that's the most dramatic and somber.Like in Infinity War, the action is phenomenal. In fact, I don't even want to give it away, but with how the final act is set, it is a moment of movie magic that'll be remembered as much as the Death Star run in Star Wars and the ring being destroyed in Lord of the Rings. Every hero gets their shot and each one feels epic.
If the movie is flawed, its with the pacing. I don't mind a time jump, but not everything feels like an impact as the movie thinks it does. For example, when we see the Hulk, even though the effect is funny, I would have liked to have seen how he got there. Same thing for Hawkeye, Iron Man, and the cosmic characters. This is an instance where an extended cut would be welcome. Things flows better once the time heist plot starts and keeps it for the majority of the movie.I'll give nine infinity gauntlet comics out of ten. This is the moment where the orchestra plays it's big number. This is level eight of the Super Mario Bros. This is an awesome finale to a story that I don't know how Marvel and Disney are going to top this...nor do I think they ever will. If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, be sure to do before watching this. Endgame serves as a nice bookend to the series and I think everyone will be happy with this.",9,1,4,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Playtime is a bit messy. Toy story 4 has a jumbled script and side characters set aside, which makes this more of a 'meh' story
","I can say now tat one of my favorite memories of going to the movies was when my dad took my brother and I to see Toy Story back in 1995. It was the first all CGI movie ever, but that wasn't why I loved it. Unlike a traditional movie from Disney was old fashioned in a good way, Toy Story felt like a modern, fresh breath of air that gave us a unique perspective of the world. It did help that both Woody and Buzz Lightyear were such memorable and likable characters, that toys of them were requested in my letter to Santa.Toy Story 2 built on Woody, Buzz and the theme of being a toy and their purpose. Toy Story 3 catapulted to deep, emotional levels as the toys had to figure out what to do now that their child had grown up. These three movies make up a rare perfect trilogy that gave us a harmonious saga and the world of movies seems better with this. So when a new movie was announced, I immediately got the feeling that this was more of a cynical cash grab then a needed continuation. But I'm open to seeing what can happen. Let's look at Toy Story 4.Now that the toys have moved on with Bonnie, Woody (played by Tom Hanks) still tries to look out for her and her well being, despite not being a favorite toy of hers. She'll play with Buzz (played by Tim Allen), Jessie (played by Joan Cusack), Rex (played by Wallace Shawn), Hamm (played by John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (played by Blake Clark), but Woody is usually left out. But this doesn't stop him when he tries to introduce a new toy, a handmade spork figure named Forky (played by Tony Hale).Forky has an existential crisis when he feel like he's trash rather then a toy, and keeps trying to throw himself away. He almost does when he throws himself out of an RV when the family goes on vacation. Woody goes to retrieve him while telling the others to hold on. Woody and Forky try to make it back, but make a detour into an antique shop. Here they encounter a broken Gabby-Gabby (played by Christina Hendricks). Along with her, they also encounter Duke Caboom (played by Keanu Reeves), Bunny and Ducky (played by Keegan-Michael Key & Peele) and even Bo Peep (played by Annie Potts). This throws Woody into his own existential crisis over what to do.I shocks me to say that Toy Story 4 is only an okay film. It's certainly not a bad movie. It's a movie that still tells a Toy Story tale fine, but it's also a complicated one based on what it's trying to do. It obviously wanted to not only give Woody a new arc, but to bring back an old element. The hearts in the right place, but it needed another rewrite to make it happen. But let's go into better detail.The problem with Toy Story 4 is that it's a movie with very little at stake. At first the goal is that Forky is cared for and to help him through his crisis. Not only is he not that funny of a character (there is a gag about him throwing himself away that goes on a little too long), but his arc is kind of abandoned midway through in order to focus on Woody. I'd might have been okay with that, but Forky rarely is ever contributes to the story or even as a character.Not to mention that the other Toy Story movies kept giving the side characters a lot to do. Most of them including Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, and even Jessie are stuck on an RV, so we don't get to see them that often. Even Buzz, who does get plenty of screen time, seems too out of character by being unconfident about his decision making, even though he had no problem with this in the other movies. Though I got a couple of laughs from Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, Key & Peele voices feel too modern and out of place. I think it has to do with how their playing themselves and not characters.I'll give this five Woody the cowboy dolls out of ten. I'll be curious to see how families and kids will respond to this. I'm sure it'll have plenty of fans, but not too many saying that Toy Story 4 is the favorite. Perhaps to Infinity and beyond isn't always the best way with making more movies. Perhaps Disney should have stopped with Toy Story 3.",5,115,236,21 June 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," The Fault in Our Stars in a cute love-sick story that's funny, sad, and satisfying a cure for a good romance.
","Nobody likes getting sick. It's unpleasant, it changes our daily routine, and we're brought down to a level in which our souls have been weakened by the disease, making us feel bad about ourselves and giving us an everlasting fear that sickness can strike at any moment. No matter how healthy we try to live, we aren't invincible and we could drop dead at any moment from something that scientists have yet to discover. That's what's troubling about the universe; the air and land we breath has so much we don't understand that were still young at fighting. One such disease is cancer. This has been around forever and people to this stay still get sudden announcements from their doctor that they too have become one of millions of people with a disease they have yet to find a cure. Technology has gotten better, but most cancer victims are stuck to taking chemotherapy as a treatment, but it's no guarantee. I think that people with cancer or any other kind of sickness wants the world to know that they are regular people like us with interests, family and love. Two teenagers reveal their love-sick story in the adaption of the critically acclaimed novel, The Fault in Our Stars. Hazel-Grace Lancaster (played by Shailene Woodley) is a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who has had this curse ever since she was a little girl. She has gone through many treatments and has had a couple of encounters with death. Fate has kept her alive as she struggles to live a normal teenage life. At the insistence of her parents, she attends a support group for teenagers like herself, yet doesn't find much that interests her. This changes when she gets stares from a new addition to the group, Augustus Waters (played by Ansel Elgort)He has a rebellious spirit that many of the other cancer stricken teenagers lack that intrigues Hazel, yet she writes off his affections and ask that their relationship only remain friendly. As the weeks pile on, their texting sessions become longer and the two get to know each other, including Hazel's dream of meeting her favorite author, Peter Van Houten (played by William Dafoe). Augustus uses his wish from Make-A-Wish to take her and her mother to Amsterdam, where romance finally draws the two to each other. The trip goes well and they continue to prosper their relationship, until one of them hits further complications (I won't be the one to say who).The Fault in Our Stars could have gone a million ways wrong from adding a dumb misunderstanding to having them instantly fall for each other right on the spot. Love stories are like horror films as few of them are any good, but this one is a very good love story. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have some excellent chemistry that makes them look very precious together. It's a real relationship where they're seen talking to each other about this stuff and how far is too far for this kind of love.It's a rare mix of funny and sad. Just how sad is The Fault in Our Stars. It never reaches a point of phony smultz, but rather heartbreaking facts of life that our characters have no choice but to face them. I'll say that I enjoyed 50/50 a little better then The Fault in Our Stars as it is missing something that was needed; more scenes with Augustus on his own. We get a lot of scenes of Hazel watching TV or reading, but I never got more out of Augustus then that he used to play basketball and he's a rebellious amputee. The best way to describe the movie is something that I also used with Her had last year, cute. It's a cute story that I sure plenty of people are going to bring tissues with before they watch.I'll give this eight and a half cityscapes of Amsterdam out of five, as both characters would have loved this. The Fault in Our Stars is a nice love story that the books fans are gonna love and will become as much of a valentines staple as 500 Days of Summer and Love Story has become.",8,0,3,8 June 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a high flying example on how a sequel should be told; with matured elements that continue to be built upon.
","DreamWorks Animation was at one point the only major competitor that Disney had. Occasionally there was a Warner Brothers or a Fox movie that could attract attention but from the late 1990's through the early 2010's, Disney and DreamWorks were neck to neck in crafting stories that everyone could enjoy. Not every film was a ballpark, but the Shrek and Kung Fu Panda series were seen as the flagship characters from DreamWorks that everyone could recognize. Shrek's face would appear on clothing and popsicles while anything Kung Fu Panda related had been made to every kind of toy. While I like both movies, neither are my favorite. My favorite DreamWorks animated movie has to be How to Train Your Dragon.Having not written a review on it before, I'll do a quick summary. For every reason, I should hate How to Train Your Dragon as it contains many of the clichés that I cannot stand such as the dopey kid who becomes the hero, the hiding the pet, the parent that won't listen to reason and the liar-revealed plot. Yet despite all of that, all of those seemed very new because the movie allowed itself to pace enough to get an idea of every emotion the character went through. Great animation, a fantastic story, and even a great dragon battle made How to Train Your Dragon a masterpiece. So I had a lot of hype for How to Train Your Dragon 2.Set five years after the first movie, the Viking village of Berk has settled into the idea of having dragons as full pets. Our hero Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel) has matured into a twenty year old, taking plenty of time with his dragon Toothless to explore new worlds. His father Stoick the Vast (played by Gerald Butler) feels that his son is now ready to replace him as chief of the village. Hiccup flies off to think about the offer, with his girlfriend Astrid (Played by America Ferrera) for emotional support.Hiccup and Astrid encounter a dragon poacher named Eret who reveals that he's gathering as many dragons as possible for his chief, an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist (played by Djimon Hounsou). Hiccup and Astrid get away in time to tell Stoick, who thinks that Drago wants a full war. Hiccup would solve the situation with peace and flies off to try. On his way to Drago's lair, another dragon rider captures him, only to reveal herself as Hiccup's long lost mother, Valka (played by Cate Blanchett). Hiccup hears the explanation for her disappearance and more information about Drago that could make Hiccup's war much darker then expected. Along with who I mentioned, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wigg, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse all return as Berk Vikings.Talk about a sequel that doesn't rehash the first movie! How to Train Your Dragon 2 matures the story and characters in a way that brings in more comedy, more action, and even some gripping drama. The movie knows what it wants to give to it's audience, and shows us plenty of time with Hiccup, his mother and his father becoming a family.I love seeing how much Hiccup has really aged and how he has to come to grips with finding a way to become the leader his father wants him to be, while continuing to fill his position as a peacekeeper. His road is much darker here where simple reason is not enough to stop an enemy. We get to see a Viking war with many dragons that is so intense and so well shot that this battle is up there with Game of Thrones and Lords of the Rings.Like the first movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2's animation is stunning, really expanding the Viking world we thought we knew and even throwing some creative dragons not seen before. I hope we continue this franchise as this series could become one of the all time great fantasy stories. Let's just hope the DreamWorks can achieve a hit with this one.I'll give this five Toothless dragons out of five. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the rare sequel that improves upon the first, soaring high like the dragon it wants to be. It's hard to write about this movie without spoiling anything.",10,6,14,24 September 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand indeed! The Grand Budapest Hotel amazes me with a mix of style and witty writing.
","What is the goal of a hotel? Some might say it is to make you feel at home. Some may say that it is supposed to be a place of convenience where our vacations are easier. I think that the goal of every hotel, grand or motel, is give something that guests can't have in their ordinary lives; a sense of royal treatment. It's unlikely anyone reading this is a grand princess from a European nation or something. But when we stay at a Marriot, were not going to stay in one of their rooms, we are given the key to our room where for the next couple of days, we are to be serviced as much as possible.You could say that because were already paying the hotel, were going to receive special treatment anyway. But even if we only throw fifty-five dollars for a room on the side of a highway, were still given the privilege of having a room to ourselves with our own cook, cleaner, and someone at the front desk to answer our questions. We don't go on vacation for the room; we go for service and for people to wait on you for every move. The chronicles of a most interesting hotel butler and his student are captured by Wes Anderson in The Grand Budapest Hotel.This is a story within several layers. It starts in the present with a girl reading a book, when it cuts to the author (played by Tom Wilkinson) telling the audience his inspiration for his stories, which cuts again to the author as a young man (played by Jude Law) speaking with the current owner of the failing Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham). Despite the hotel falling a part in the movie's fictional nation of Zubrowka, Zero can't let the place die. When asked by the author, Zero then starts to tell his days as a young man when he started working.The owner's story starts in 1932, where Zero is a quiet Lobby Boy working at the Grand Budapest that's about to be stuck in the middle of a war in Zubrowka. This does not bother the devoted concierge, Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) who takes pleasure in serving the richest guests, including Madame D (played by Tilda Swinton). She's murdered one night and Gustave and Zero travel to the funeral, where the concierge finds that he's inherited a priceless painting. This pisses off the rest of Madame D's family; so many of them are sought on revenge. To make things worse, Gustave is accused of murdering Madame D.This may seem like a lot of story for a mystery, but The Grand Budapest Hotel is actually a very intriguing movie. Though the story is a good story, it's not the big focus. It's intentionally structured in an uneven manner going from Hotel study to art to communist war to a who did it mystery. Like a lot of other Wes Anderson movies, the overall style is the best part.This director is one of the few in Hollywood who have a distinguishable look for their movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel is just beautiful from it's old-fashioned sets, models, and even ratio. It's hard to describe why I like it in writing, but it's very lovely. The writing may be odd, but it still got plenty of laughs out of me. We have the actors to thank who all fit their parts well (including other parts from Edward Norton, Bill Maury, and Jeff Goldblum), never playing themselves. It's a grand trip from check in to check out. It's a visit that people will want to make over and over.I'll give this nine lobby boy hats out of ten. The Grand Budapest Hotel is keeping a good place on the top ten box office hits, and I'm glad. This deserves to be a hit.",9,3,7,21 May 2014
The Favourite," The Favourite is so odd that you'll either love it or hate it. It's characters and relationships make it good
","In any high-pressure position (political, business, entertainment, etc...), power is the most addictive drug anyone can succumb to. Most can tell that once your at the top of something, it's hard to imagine your life before that or after. It really has to do with that subconscious instinct in which all people want to feel important. Once they do become important, it's scary for them to think that no one would want to listen anymore. They have more authority and can feel like a king in their own domain. So the longer they retain that power, the harder it becomes to accept should they lose it.Today's movie deals with a interesting situation involving three people that are addicted to power; one who is starting from the bottom, one whose been at the top for a while, and another at the top whose mental state is becoming worse. Putting two together is bad enough, but a third one can only create chaos. The situation happened more often then not in a monarch, especially an older one. For the situation within The Favourite, we find a mad queen, her lesbian lover, and a woman who sees potential in a declining crazy person.It's the early eighteenth century where Brittan is at war with France. Queen Anne (played by Olivia Colman) is suffering physical ailments and is losing her interest in politics in favor of wealthy parties and caring for her seventeen rabbits, which also represent her seventeen children that have passed on. Because of her disconnect with parliament, her confidant and lover Sarah Churchill (played by Rachel Weisz) has so much influence that she pretty much runs the country from ideas she passes onto the queen. At the same time, a new state tax is initiated from a landowner Robert Harley (played by Nicholas Hoult) that proves to be unpopular with the rest of parliament.One way, Sarah's younger cousin Abigail Hill (played by Emma Stone) arrives in the queens court for a job. Abigail once came from a baron family, but lost it when her father lost her in a gamble. She's hired to work as a scullery maid, but ends up winning the queens approval when she offers herbs that soothe pain from gout. Abigail becomes the queens lady-in-waiting and soon learns about the affair between Anne and Sarah. It becomes a power game when the younger cousin starts to gain a friendship with the queen while Sarah's power is challenged.The Favourite is the kind of movie that is the example of divisive. People are either going to like this or hate it. I personally liked it enough to say that it works more as a comedy then a historical retelling. The historical aspect is good, but ill get to that in a bit. The reason this works is because of the characters and the relationships their a part of.This is a movie that belongs to all three of the main stars; Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. I'm not sure how accurate everything was, but these feel like oddball, but dangerous people I could see within government. Olivia hits the points of carrying a lot of nobility and worsening mental state, yet never leaning too far to one side. Rachel Weisz is great as a serial manipulator whose had years of experience pulling off the job. And of course, Emma Stone is one of the better two-facers I've seen in cinema; playing herself as delicate when she needs to be, and then back stabbing the next. Her performance is almost on par with Scarlet in Gone With the Wind.As far as the movie goes, this is where people are going to come at a crossroads. Director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) knows how to make the palaces and costumes feel big with the constant use of wide angles and fisheye shots. In fact, there isn't too much use of movement, even though everything still feels fluid. This is either going to pull people into the story or detract them. It can sometimes be a little distracting as it does try to be more 'artsy' then it needs to be.I'll give this seven racing ducks out of ten. The Favourite fits in the same category of Baroque historical movies like Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. It's clear that a mainstream audience isn't going to be as invested as they would for a blockbuster. But that's why I give this more credit; it knows it's audience it's trying to reach. If your hungry for power and a more oddball royalty movie then your used to, then check it out.",7,5,13,7 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," With most of The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy ready to play, Avengers Infinity War is an exciting crossover event that'll satisfy most Marvel fans
","We've spent ten years with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether you think it's a groundbreaking character driven story or a corporate cash cow, the MCU has managed to not only adapt the famous comics of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (yes, I know there were a lot more people involved, so let's say all of those creative artists and writers of Marvel), but has managed to change how super heroes are seen on the big screen. They can have grey lines, they can be anti heroes, they can have moments where they don't even trust the government. I've personally love the MCU movies and will keep coming back to them to see where our heroes end up next.Ever since The Avengers, the MCU has been teasing the upcoming villain Thanos. He had spent a good chunk of these movies on a throne, hoping that one of his minions can acquire certain stones, such as the power stone in Guardians of the Galaxy and the reality stone in Thor: The Dark World. Time has finally come for the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to team up in the major crossover event movie that is Avengers Infinity War. What I won't do is list all the actors, but I'll give a brief look at the story without going into spoilers, as much of the film's enjoyment is what you don't know.We open on Thor's ship where Thanos and his children has caught up with them and have acquired a couple of the stones. Thanos understands that if he can collect the rest of the stones for the gauntlet, he'll have the power to control the universe, time, and the fate of every living creature within his grasp. A last ditch effort sends Hulk/Bruce Banner back to Earth where he meets up with Dr. Strange, Iron Man/Tony Stark and Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Meanwhile, Thor manages to get a distress call out where the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Racoon, Drax, Groot, and Mantis, respond. Their fully aware of the danger that Thanos possesses and agree to help. Back on Earth, Vision and Scarlet Witch are attacked by Thanos' children, but saved by Captain America/Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Falcon/Sam Wilson who all sense the danger. They make it to Wakanda to meet up with T'Challa/Black Panther. Together, all of these heroes end up in different areas as they try to stop Thanos from getting the rest of the Infinity Stones.While Avengers Infinity War has a lot to live up to, I decided to not keep my expectations too high as I know that this is a tough movie to pull off. The good news is that I was very happy with what I got. You get your favorite superheroes and a lot of action that's warranted from the film's villain and his scary desire. I'll start off with. Josh Brolin finally gets to shine as one of the most complex villains of the MCU (which has not had a good track record of villains).The heroes face a villain who is genuinely scary, thanks to several scenes of them fighting which I won't spoil and a lot of his view of the universe, which I also won't spoil. He is beyond powerful, smart, and does have a moral compass; just not a traditional one. We get more time with him and his relationship with Gamora and just what his children mean to him compared to the bigger picture. The other villains too, prove to be powerful, even if their not as memorable. It's made up with their overall impression of worship and how a lot of that driven emotion can generate into persuasion.For a movie with a lot of characters, Avengers Infinity War has a lot of work juggling them. I'd say that one of the bigger flaws is that the editing around that is not done well. It'll spend a good twenty five minutes in space with dazzling effects, but then suddenly cut back to Earth in Africa. While we definitely see the consequences for the heroes, it doesn't give us enough at how the rest of the world would deal with such a threat. Why couldn't have more of the marvel heroes from ABC and Netflix also get involved? I can't blame them for this, but the movie might have benefitted from being longer, making the editing of the longer sequences feel justified.I'll give this eight Infinity Gauntlets out of ten. I think most Marvel fans will be happy with the movie and the surprises it throws (yep, there are a lot of them here). If your not as well read and haven't seen the other movies, I'd recommend watching the other Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange first. Again, I was happy with everything, given that I wasn't asking for too much. More might have been done to really make this an epic masterpiece like Ben Hur, but for a lot of people, this will be a Marvel to sight.",8,2,5,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's tribute to the golden era of Hollywood is a lot of fun in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
","In the age where digital streaming from Netflix and Amazon are filling entertainment voids, where are movies leading. Many people have argued that major studios are relying too much on established properties be either continued or remade. I can see where their coming from as these are not only likely to make money, but big money. It used to be that an original movie was made, and that over time, people would come back to so often that it would set a long term probability. If Netflix and Amazon has taught us anything is that their shows like Stranger Things and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel can also obtain long term popularity. So why can't movies do something similar?A lot of it has to do that major studios have fallen behind on what it means to be popular. It's good to see that some filmmakers have not succumbed to this mindset. In fact, Quentin Tarantino is very open about rejecting that way a lot of movies and TV shows are made. He's clearly a man who loves the craft and how movies used to made, whether he's doing tributes to martial arts, grindhouse, or exploitation movies. Movies like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood make me more grateful for Tarantino.In 1969 in the fading light of the golden era of Hollywood, western star Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is lambasting that his career is already on the way out, as most of his roles are of Western TV shows like Bounty Law. His best friend and stunt double Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt) hangs with him and even has a second job as his driver. The two talk about the changing state of the industry, along with Dalton's alcoholism that seems to be harming his career.Dalton lives next door to rising film director Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) who all represent the new blood incoming to the industry. Regardless, Dalton takes what he can get and gets casted as another villain to a pilot western called Lancer. Since he couldn't get stunt double work on that same show, Booth picks up a girl and he gives her a lift to Spahn Ranch owned by the blind and senile George Sphan (played by Bruce Dern), unaware it's also home to the Manson Family.For spoiler reasons, I don't want to give the rest away. Though that would be hard too as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood doesn't really have a story. But that's typical of a Tarantino movie...and this also makes for another fun movie. It's clear that Tarantino holds their period of Hollywood close to his heart. This may be the first movie from him where the environment plays a character itself as the main cast will wonder around where the plot takes them, and yet none of it felt boring. Whether it was Sharon Tate's home, a western studio or the Sphan Ranch, it all has personality that plays a different effect on these characters. An aging star could feel out of place while a Manson family member has more control.Speaking of which, both Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt make a great team thanks to their chemistry and good dialogue. Both actors have worked with Tarantino before, but never together. But both also have the kind of chemistry that's lacking in a lot of new talent in current Hollywood. It's hard to explain, but the best way is that you take your eyes off of either actor as they each have their turn at exploring a part of 1969 Los Angeles.Whether or not this is Tarantino's best movie is debatable. It's not heavy on action (go watch Kill Bill or Inglorious Bastards for that), but it's dialogue and scenes are fun to watch and listen to. This is why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood belongs in the same category as Pulp Fiction; where it's more about where these characters are going and what their doing. They aren't as flashed out and original as Pulp Fiction, but I was still happy with these Hollywood-types taking stage. It's like seeing an old-fashioned gossip magazine from my parents closet come to life.I'll give this nine western TV show advertisements out of ten. Be sure to get comfy as the movie is well over two and a half hours. As I said, it's never boring, and offers an environment that's so rich in detail, that'll it warrant rewatches just off of that. The fact it's also a fun movie is the cherry on the top. Go see it and have an old fashioned ball.",9,14,33,26 July 2019
Gone Girl," Gone Girl May Not be Fincher's A game, but Provides a Bender of Marriage Troubles and Media Creationism
","If there's one life lesson that is more important now, especially with the advent of social media is that appearances can be deceiving. Your over at a friends place and you might see a set of photos on the wall. What's portrayed in these memories? A happy wedding? Possibly a Halloween where the kids have smiling faces and a bag full of candy? We come to accept the information given to us from the evidence that everything was fine that day. We don't think about what really goes behind those scenes such might question the material itself. Maybe the kids weren't as excited on that Halloween or maybe the couple getting married was never happy to begin with.It's becoming harder for optimists like myself to see the world in a better light. We come to expect bad news when we tune to CNN, but when were struck with shocking revelations from our close ones, we'll do everything to deny it. We never want our wholesome images broken down, but when we hear something about a rape or a burglary, depending on the draw, we'll either get an immediate sympathetic human being or the darkest mind to set on foot that becomes the victim of a witch-hunt. Suburban identity and bogus media assumptions are such subjects of Gone Girl. Bar owner Nick Dunne (played by Ben Affleck) returns home after an outing to discover the scene of a struggle and no trace of his wife Amy (played by Rosamund Pike). The police arrive and start to trace small clues and bring Nick to the station for all information about Amy. His first press conference goes well until a photo of him smiling next to a missing persons poster makes him out to be someone wanting attention. Nick's twin sister Margo (played by Carrie Coon) allows Nick to stay with her as he tries to piece together what happened. Through the course of the movie, we get flashback's from Amy's journal about how she and Nick were writers living in New York until his mothers illness forced them to move to Missouri. Further evidence has suggested that the marriage had become bitter and Nick had increasingly become more aggressive. Several news outlets, including a morning host Ellen Abbott (played by Missi Pyle) make Nick out to be a psychopath and starts to create more hate for the guy. Even after speaking with Amy's ex boyfriend Desi Collings (played by Neil Patrick Harris) and attorney Tanner Bolt (played by Tyler Perry), were not so sure how much of a reliable narrator Nick may be.What I've described was about the first half of Gone Girl, as I won't spoil the second. The best part about the movie is that it goes in directions you would not expect. Each idea about our two leads constantly shifts from how we want to see them to their exposure of who they really are. Gone Girl dwells into several territories including identity within a suburban setting and how media can have more control then we realize.As in most David Fincher movies, this has the familiar dark and stylish tone we've come to expect. In terms of subject matter, I don't consider this his best work. The film perhaps takes a tad too much time building out our two leads and I honestly got board before we learn more about Amy. For a movie that already makes it clear were not going to get a clear answer, it likes to stay put. As is, both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike excel as our doomed couple. At first I questioned about why Affleck was casted to play himself, until I realized that most people on the news that are accused of killing their spouses have a smug look upon them. Affleck fits the role perfectly as someone who would have a hard sell as a honest Joe. Though I cannot give away why, Pike may have now given us one of the most frightening personas of the year. Here's your latest Hollywood monster for your Halloween parties.I'll give this eight breaking news notices out of ten. Though I wish Gone Girl was trimmed and structured a tad smoother, it's actors carry the unnerving scenario all the way to make you consider married couples and the sacrifices they make to keep up with status quo.",7,1,9,3 October 2014
Get Out," You have to get out for Get Out. It's an effective thriller about being alone with people
","Have you ever felt out of place at a party? Perhaps a friend had taken you for the evening or somebody from the office invited you over thinking that their group would click with you. I get that feeling a lot. A lot of it has nothing to do with the people hosting or the food, but I've been more comfortable in situations where I have control. Without something to latch onto, I become that guy at the table whose going to look up something to read on the Internet rather then socialize.Today's subject deal with that kind of fear that I think a lot of people have; when they suddenly feel alone when ironically, when there are people. It usually has to do when they feel the most different, so it does make sense when people of different color are around those not the same. That's not to say the people hate this guy, but it does express how some communities don't entwine with more a mixed race mindset. During these situations, I try to make some casual conversation hoping I can find one person to stick to for the rest of the evening. That's not an option for our hero in Get Out. Photographer Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) is getting ready for a weekend trip to his girlfriend's parents place. Rose (played by Allison Williams) is white while Chris is black. They seem like a good couple with the proper chemistry. As he's packing, he does ask whether Alison's parents know if he's black. She responds no, feeling that even saying 'I'm bringing my black boyfriend home' would seem morally wrong. On their way over, they hit a deer which prompts a cop to stop. After a bit of racial profiling, Chris and Roe finally make it to the parents estate. Upon driving in, Chris sees the groundskeeper whose black. He also sees their maid who is also black. When Chris finally meets her parents Dean (played by Bradley Whitford) and Missy (played by Catherine Keener), things seem to go well and both act very nice. One the first night over, Missy uses hypnosis to not only break Chris of his smoking habit, but manages to reveal personal information. He dismisses the hypno session as a dream, but faces more of Rose's family the next day at a party. They're friendly, but something about them being over accommodating towards Chris makes him uneasy. He continues to see just what the family is about in the next couple of days. Director Jordan Peele (yes, that guy from Key & Peele) has a clear understanding of what makes a good horror movie; by exploring one's true fear. He takes advantage of the art by not only staging several scenes as intentionally uneasy, but even showing the more horror-like tropes impressively (the entire opening sequence is all done in one take with no edits). He manages to carry that tone pretty well, though it does become slow once thing unravel.The best thing about the movie is Daniel Kaluuya as Chris. Had I not seen him on a talk show the other night, I would have had no idea that he was British. I also like that his character's personality seemed like a guy I would run into rather then making him a stereotype. He can carry a movie, even through the darker parts when his backstory is revealed. Though I can give away much, I can say that this films falls in the same category of the original Straw Dogs in one's feeling of loneliness in an odd environment. I'll give this eight deer skeletons out of ten. I don't know if I can call this a game changer, but it was still a fun movie to watch. I defiantly recommend this for those looking for a good thriller. Step out of your comfort zone and get out for Get Out.",8,6,20,26 February 2017
Aladdin," For my final wish, I wish to set you free from seeing Aladdin, which is so close to the animated classic, it's pointless
","What person doesn't know the story of a thief named Aladdin who comes across a lamp and unleashes a genie? Not only did the story become mainstream from the 1992 animated movie, but his story also relates with people who dream that they can make their wish come true in a heartbeat. Of course I've never heard of anyone finding a magic lamp and getting supernatural abilities to get their desires. It's part of the magic of thinking that you could get the treasure and power without having to work hard. Aladdin is the story that reveals that even with a cosmic being providing those gifts, life never really offers an easy answer.Going back to the Disney animated movie, what made the movie were a lot of elements; beautiful animation, likable characters, a fun villain in Jafar, but probably the most important element, Robin Williams finally fully realized in comedic potential as the Genie. This has made arguably one of the funniest and unbound performances from a comedian who was already full of energy. In the recent trend of taking Disney classics like Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh, and The Jungle Book, and making them live-action, Aladdin now gets it's turn in that format.Within the kingdom of Agrabah, a street rat thief Aladdin (played by Mena Massoud) and his monkey Abu 'eat to live and steel to eat' within the poor village as they strive for something more. Princess Jasmine (played by Naomi Scott) also strives for more as she's treated more like an object as her father, the sultan wishes to marry her to a prince of another kingdom. Jasmine's only companions are her tiger, Rajah, and her handmaiden Dalia (played by Nasim Padrad). Aladdin meets Jasmine, but realizes when she's the princess, he realizes he can never be with her.This changes when the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, Jafar (played by Marwan Kenzari), takes Aladdin out to the desert where the Cave of Wonders is. He's instructed to not touch the treasure and only go for the lamp. After the cave collapses, Aladdin rubs the lamp and releases the Genie (played by Will Smith) who tells him he gets three wishes. Knowing that he can finally be with Jasmine, Aladdin wishes to be a prince. While staying in the palace, Aladdin learns more about the Genie, how money can't buy love, and that Jafar is planning his takeover of Agrabah.Director Guy Ritchie made the decision to stay as close as possible to the animated original...and that ends up being the main problem. While I can't say Aladdin is a 'shot-for-shot' remake, it goes through the same story, same plot, same emotions, and same songs all over again, just within a live action realm. While I understand Disney knew that moments from Aladdin were so iconic they couldn't have been changed, they should have known that by constantly evoking the look of the original, I kept asking myself 'why am I not just watching the original?'.So what is different? The biggest is one of the few positives, and that's Will Smith. He thankfully does not try to copy Robin Williams and instead plays the Genie like the Fresh Prince. This also makes him more of a guy whose had several masters and Aladdin is just next in line. I liked that Aladdin and Genie had do build a friendship instead on an instant one. The movie tries to expand Jasmine's role, that only ends up seeming forced and unnecessary. This is no better shown through her song 'Speechless', which could be cut and nothing would be missed. The worst is the casting of Jafar, who has no grace and is so generic looking, that he looks like a random person from the grocery store they just put into a Jafar outfit.Other then some nice costumes and sets, not much is really different. The moments from the animated movie play out the same here which can make it easy for you to guess what happens in the end. Aladdin fights palace guards, Jasmine wants more in life, Genie does his magic, and Jafar tries his big takeover. This is a movie that while made alright, it feels completely pointless. I can't say it's as bad as the shot-for shot remake Psycho or even as bad as the live action Beauty and the Beast or Maleficent, but all it did was make me think about the animated Aladdin and made me appreciate how much better it was then this.I'll give this four Jafar cobras out of ten. I'm sure this will have it's fans, but whether a parent should take their kids, they can. It's just that it's so similar to the animated version that I would recommend wasting their money to see something they probably already own. For my three wishes, its to erase this, erase the majority of live action remakes, and to set you free to see something else.",4,25,42,28 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Through the stars and cosmos, comes the romance of Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking in the surpassingly good The Theory of Everything.
","The understanding of us is a pursuit that great minds like Newton, Galileo and Einstein have gone after for generations. Their the ones that always asked 'How did the universe begin?' and 'Is there an ending or a boundary for the universe?'. They are seen as people the people that can take mankind into the next steps through science to get a better understanding of life. They also face controversy as some of their ideas contradict religious beliefs and even the existence of God. I don't see much of an issue myself as I'm a Christian and I see much of the ideas as searching how the universe works and not the universe itself, therefore allowing my belief in God to be justified.One such person to be recognized in the field of physics is Stephen Hawking. His bestseller A Brief History of Time has opened up the door of complicated mathematics and ideas of the cosmos to the mainstream public. What people love about this guy is that even with the complication of a motor neuron disease, he has been able to continue with his scientific journey and that he remains an active lecturer. His early life and romances are revealed in The Theory of Everything. While a young man, Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) is a very intelligent student who is taking his steps into earning his doctorate at Cambridge in England. He is also socially awkward and likes to shut himself in his room as he studies. That changes when he meets Jane Wilde (played by Felicity Jones) who takes a liking to the young man despite their academic and religious differences. Hawking is a cosmologist while Jane is a literature student. Hawking is agnostic while Jane is a Christian. The two still manage to enjoy their time with each other and start a relationship.A fall at his school sends him to the hospital where it's revealed that he has Lou Gehrig's disease and that he only has about two years to live. Jane decides that she loves him enough that she will stay with and care for him. they marry and they have three children together. As Hawking's condition deteriorates further into a wheelchair, he finally allows more help. This results in a man Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox) into becoming a caretaker as Jane struggles with her feeling towards him and her love and beliefs for Hawking, When I saw the first preview for The Theory of Everything, I thought that the movie was going to be too schmaltzy. It's clear that this is a romance and not a full biopic. So in a way, its probably more romanticized then it was before. But as stories go, this one isn't bad. The Theory of Everything rationalizes that true love is always sticking with your partner and with both of it's leads being very likable, I can see that working. Eddie Redmayne fires away one of the best acting performances of the year as Stephen Hawking. He portrays him as a ambitious scientist and even a bit selfish in his later years, but still make him relatable when it comes to sticking with his principle. He really wants to be seen not as a cripple who succeeds, but as a great mind who triumphs. Felicity Jones is also great, giving us a young woman who may be peaceful with her mind, but no nonsense with her actions. She's the only one that can get through to her husband, even against doctors and other scientists. I'll give this eight and a half A Brief History of Time books out of ten. This one is more of an acting piece then a great story, but this is what I would have liked to have seen from last years August: Osage County.",8,4,7,1 December 2014
Room," Emotional and rewarding, Room is a beautiful coming of age thriller that is one of 2015 bests
","Today's movie shares a big trait with True Grit that was debated when the awards season came out; with who the main character was. True Grit's marketing pushed that Jeff Bridges was the main actor of the movie even though the story really shows that Haliee Steinfeld was the focus. Once the awards season came, she was given plenty of supporting actress accolades even though most people felt that she was more in the reigns of best actress. Room will probably have this same issue with one of it's actors.I think the reason the studios tend to put great child performers into separate categories away from the big A-listers that are nominated for other movies because their afraid that they either won't have a chance at winning or if they do win, no one would take the award seriously. Children need to be taken seriously.Today's movie Room may be a mother/son bonding story, but it's really about the psychology that goes through their minds when after years of being together, are going on a journey that separates them physically and emotionally. It's about two people growing up despite being different generations as Room portrays. Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson) is a young woman that has been living in a shed converted into a small home for the past seven years by her kidnapper she calls 'Old Nick' (played by Sean Bridgers). In the time since, she gave birth to a child (fathered by Old Nick) that she named Jack. In the years growing up there, Joy tried as hard as she could to be a good mother and protect Jack from the situation and raise him like any other child. Now turning five, Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) only sees the Room they live in as the world and that anything outside is 'outer space'.Joy finds out that 'Old Nick' has lost his job and is low on money, which will mean fewer resources for food and heat. It is now that she tells Jack about the outside world (the only thing they had for information or entertainment was television that was mostly tuned onto Dora the Explorer for Jack) and that they need to get out. She knows that the only way out is if 'Old Nick' realizes that Jack has to get out due to illness. The first half of the movie is planning on the escape and the second half is about what happens after wood.I can barley say anything about Room as most of the movie contains major spoilers. All I can say is that even though this is a thriller, I count this as a coming of age story. A really good one as well considering that we have both a young woman and a little boy who know little about the world around them. Brie Larson does phenomenal as Joy who has the hard task of both remaining forever frightened of 'Old Nick' and being a proper mother.Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age.I'll give this ten imaginary dogs out of ten. Room is an emotional, but rewarding coming of age story that may be hard to sit through the first half. But once the second half starts, you'll realize how strong bonds are between parents and children. You'll realize that in order to move one, part of your old self has to go away. Room is one of the 2015's best.",10,2,12,18 November 2015
The Lion King," The new The Lion King is 'Hakuna MaNADA'. It's practically a shot-for-shot remake that's pointless other then for the visual effects
","If you were to ask me what I listened to as a child, I would have been quick to say the soundtrack to The Lion King. It was one of the first CDs I owned and I used to annoy my parents when I asked constantly to play it again and again on car rides. By the fifth rendition of 'Hakuna Matata' or 'Be Prepared', my dad would be ready to throw it out. A lot like how kids today wouldn't stop singing, 'Let it go' from Frozen, I was on a Disney high from The Lion King, being the right age at eight back in 1995.If there's a lesson to learn from current Disney, it's that if there's nostalgia, there's money to be made. I've made it clear (with the exception of The Jungle Book) that I'm not a fan of the live action remakes, but because they're box office monsters, Disney will continue making them. It's a good plan to make a billion right away, but I'm sure it'll be bad strategy in the long run. Rather then creating new nostalgia, these movies are relying on borrowed nostalgia. But who knows, perhaps the remake of The Lion King can provide something new.After the birth of a new lion cub Simba, the Pride Lands are overjoyed with the arrival of the future king. Current king Mufasa (played by James Earl Jones) scolds his brother Scar (played by Chiwetal Ejiofer) for not attending, but he could care less. Simba grows into a curious cub whose excited about the notion of being king, even if it means stiring up some trouble and almost getting killed by the hyenas like Shenzi (played by Florence Kasumba) and Kamari (played by Keegan-Michael Key). Though watched by Zazu (played by John Oliver), Simba can't be protected forever.When a wildebeest stampede causes the death of Mufasa (of course with help by Scar), Simba thinks he's responsible and is encouraged to run away and never return. Simba eventually comes across meerkat Timon (played by Billy Eichner) and warthog Pumba (played by Seth Rogan) and learn about 'Hakuna Matata', which means no worries. When he grows up, Simba (played by Donald Glover) lives a carefree life while Scar had taken the Pride Lands throne and desicrated the environment. Former friend of Simba, Nala (played by Beyoncé), sets out to find help and maybe find Simba to help dethrone Scar.Director Jon Favreau does a good job recreating the original animated classic...too closely in fact. The Lion King is so close that I might say this is a shot-for-shot remake. This makes me wonder the purpose of this. The answer is simple; money. Disney already knows their fans will return because of nostalgia, and it seems that The Lion King takes the steps necessary to ensure their basically getting the same movie. It's the same songs, same locations, same character, and in some cases, most of the same lines. I couldn't believe how lazy the film came out.Some might already throw out, 'what about the updated animation?'. I'll admit the photorealistic-like animation was impressive in The Jungle Book and it's the same here. It's amazing how the animals look real and how they move and behave. It can even look like a documentary. This also creates another problem in which it explains why the original animation was better. With the hand drawn style, the characters can express emotion more and the colors really leapt off the page and into my mind. The animals now react like real animals, which means little facial expression. Even the color here seems drab (which it has to be since it's supposed to be set in Africa).The impressiveness of the visual effect wears off after an hour and you just waiting to relive the moments from the original; the 'Circle of Life' song, the stampede, the 'Hakuna Matata' song, and Simba seeing his father in spirit. I know that remakes need to follow the story, but you'd think The Lion King could have taken a chance to explore other sides, like Scar's reign as king or new animals point of view. The original isn't flawless, but it now looks like a masterpiece thanks to the soulless remake he now have to live with.I'll give this four stars out of ten. I have a feeling that despite my complaints, this is going to earn another billion dollars t the company that's showing no end. If I had kids, I probably would have shown them the original instead. My only theory is that most kids have seen the hand drawn original and probably remember that over this one. For me, The Lion King is a 'Hakuta Manada'.",4,12,18,19 July 2019
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place shouldn't be silenced. It's an effective thriller that understands the rule of what you don't see is scarier
","One of the most important tips to creating horror is that 'what's not seen is the scariest thing'. While I'm not sure who said that, I first read it from a book on Alfred Hitchcock and how he implemented that philosophy to his works like Rear Window, The Birds, and most prominently, Psycho. Tension featured in those movies was very high and it was accomplished all without showing the monster. It's not to say it didn't, but Hitchcock understood that fear does more then create a barrier. Fear clouds judgment and can even turn the rational irrational. Filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and James Wan have all used this tool to their storytelling advantage. The only rules are that they can either never show the creature or they have to deliver on what's gotten people so frightened. Much of what's been done is what we could see. Today's movie focuses on what we can hear. Alien invasion stories are popular and the idea of creatures that hunt based off of sound is actually intriguing. How would society or even people continue to live in a world of forced silence? Can we be completely silent? Let's see if A Quiet Place can deliver on that idea.In the near future, the world seems to have already gone through an invasion of aliens that can't see, but have extreme sensitive hearing, and therefore, hunt based on sound. We get the idea that a mass extinction has happened and that people try their best to live in silence to avoid being eaten. The struggle is such for a farming family, the Abbott family. This consists of father Lee (played by John Krasinski), mother Evelyn (played by Emily Blunt), daughter Regan (played by Millicent Simonds), and sons Marcus and Beau.During one scout for food, Regan gives Beau a space shuttle toy, in which it's noise unfortunately, causes him to get eaten. A year passes and the family seems to have set itself up well with everyone speaking in American Sign Language and taking every precaution to make no noise of any kind (I guess this means no potato chips!). Regan still blames herself for Beau's death and starts to become more rebellious. Her father Lee does everything to help everyone survive, including making a soundproof basement for radio contact and his future newborn son. You may have noticed that while described the world and characters of A Quiet Place, I didn't fully explain the story. That's because the plot, while small, is actually well done and would spoil the movie if I did. A Quiet Place is actually very entertaining. Is it a masterpiece? Almost...if more questions would have been answered about these aliens. Now while the plot does implement the 'what's not scene is the scariest thing' element, I don't think it delivers completely. Some of the questions I had included, 'if they can't see, how could they have found Earth?' and 'wouldn't the loud noise of gunfire and missiles and scared them away?'. I expected answers to these that would have given these aliens more credit, but I didn't get it.How are the humans? They are all great. Like the recent The Shape of Water, these actors have rely on body language and facial emotion to communicate. Both John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are expressive enough to pull off the unseen tension while raising their children. The breakout star here is really Millicent Simmonds. Not only does she look like a 'real' teenager, but she uses her real deafness to her advantage, giving her not just a honest look into a world of silence, but how to respond to people who could never understand her.It's said that the movie has an underlying theme of parenthood and the responsibilities that it comes with. I wouldn't say it's underlying, and much of the plot is about accepting responsibilities and understanding that no matter how bad things look, your parents will always care for you. This in turn, does make A Quiet Place more family friendly then you'd think. It's certainly a scary movie first, but this is something that I think most families could watch together and I think that was director John Krasinski's plan all along.I'll give this seven hearing aids out of ten. As far as a movie, it's entertaining. I can't call it a masterpiece like Jaws or Psycho, but if this does get people to talk about it, then A Quiet Place is doing something right. You can't silence this review; go and see A Quiet Place.",7,1,2,10 April 2018
22 Jump Street," 22 Jump Street is a funny bromance/meta comedy...but it becomes old quick
","Creating a sequel to a fantasy like How to Train Your Dragon has to be easier then a comedy. I know that a lot of work already goes into an animated movie, but there is one reason why How to Train Your Dragon has the simpler job then something like 21 Jump Street; the element of surprise. A lot of writers assigned to these movies could spend hours on story and character development, which is fine, but their sequel can only work if they bring in something new and unpredictable. Continuing to stay unpredictable in a comedy is tough. Take something like Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's one of the most famous sketch comedies shows of all time, emphasizing heavily on taking scenarios and taking it into a crazy direction. It threw off peoplefor a while. The final season proved that even the randomness can become predictable as we now know that going from point A to point B is not going to happen; it's going to be just as nutty as the early seasons were. Yet while the earlier shows were new, the later seasons resulted in sketches that simply were not as funny as we have picked up on the shows attitude, making it harder to give us something that were not expecting. So let's see if 22 Jump Street found us something new. If you saw the first movie, then you know that it ends with our heroes Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) being told their going to college. And that exactly what they do. Their sent to a college where they go undercover as undergraduates to find a new drug that's hitting the scene called WHYPHY (pronounced the same as WiFi) that already caused the death of another student. Just as in the first movie, they assume the same identities and ask other students for clues and possible drug dealer suspects. The switch up here is that Jenko becomes the big man on campus when he makes friends with a frat house jock named Zook (played by Wyatt Russell) that becomes a prime suspect. Schmidt on the other hand makes friendly with an art major, Maya while dealing with having to work on his own. The boys police captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) occasionally comes in to help and even help fight in the final battle that takes place in Spring Break in Mexico. As I said, this is basically the same movie all over again, so this must be a really bad film right? Not exactly. The joke of the previous movie was that 21 Jump Street ripped off of 1980's cop movies, so 22 Jump Street instead makes fun of itself and movie sequels in general. This may be the most self-referential movie comedy, even more so then satires that know their movies. For the most part, they are really funny, though unlike Blazing Saddles and Scary Movie that seem to be in a better mind frame to keep calling out that it's only a movie, 22 Jump Street is still keen on keeping it in a real world. This causes the meta references to get old really fast and even a touch out of place. So along the meta material, does the movie have the same wit as the first film? I expected 22 Jump Street to be a lot wilder and a lot funnier. A lot of the wit is still there, but I wasn't laughing as much. When I was trying to figure out why, I think it maybe that I realized that neither leads have really learned anything from the first movie except to stay friends. How to Train Your Dragon 2 was not afraid to mature their characters and still keep them funny, so I was hoping Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum would have at least matured a little bit.I'll give this six football helmets out of five. It delivers what it promises, but like our heroes, I wish it had more ambition to go crazier with it's scenario. Let's see them in classes or clubs or something. 22 Jump Street is a passable comedy, but it makes me want to reexamine the first film.",6,4,10,16 June 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a tired rehash of the previous adventures that make this series closer to sinking
","'Yo ho, yo ho, a pirates life for me!'. These lyrics came from the popular Disney attraction, Pirates of the Caribbean and as of the past couple of years, the popular movies that came from them. What surprised most people was that pirate movies could not only be big bucks, but could also add elements like undead skeletons, cursed treasure and even rock star-like characters that could end up with Academy Award nominations (yep, Johnny Depp got that honor for a movie based off of a Disney ride). While I still consider the first movie an action masterpiece, the films that followed had never caught the same accidental perfection.After the mega hit that The Lord of the Rings series was, Disney tried to replicate that with the Pirates of the Caribbean. The problem with that is that unlike Lord of the Rings which had a ton of characters to follow, Pirates only had a few I could name like Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Will Turner. Still, each movie has managed to generate success and it seems that people cannot get enough of Jack Sparrow and his pirate adventures. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continues the hijinks that our pirates get into. Sometime after the events of On Stranger Tides, Henry Turner (played by Brenton Thwaites) is looking to lift his father, Will Turner's curse aboard the Flying Dutchman. He has spent years looking for clues that will lead him to Poseidon's trident, which is said to not only control the sea, but also has the ability to end all curses. He manages to find Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) for help, but is disappointed by how much of a drunken buffoon he is. Meanwhile, a young woman Carina (played by Kaya Scodelario) is also looking for the trident to prove that women can have an academic career in astronomy. She and Henry bump into each other and agree to join Jack Sparrow to try and find it.But it looks like that Jack Sparrow has a couple of people following him. Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) has become a wealthy pirate since the previous movies and later becomes involved when he encounters the Bermuda Triangle and the ship full of ghost pirates as commanded by the undead Armando Salazar (played by Javier Bardem). Both end up following Jack Sparrow while our heroes try to find the trident. While the new directors gave a promise of hope that new life can be put into the series, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is more of the same that has been done before. True, the story is different, but it's still about pirates going to break a curse (which was already done in Curse of the Black Pearl). It feels redundant on top of the story's major problem; we're not sure whose story it is. It seems to be between Henry Turner, who wants the treasure to help his dad, and Carina, who wants to prove her scientific research (even though she says she doesn't believe in the supernatural).I can't say much about the acting. Johnny Depp at this point can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep, and seems to be doing so as half of his performance seems drunk. He's still the Jack Sparrow people love, but something here feels missing. I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with the fact that Depp was going through his divorce or if wasn't as invested in the story as before. Javier Bardem does has his moments, but his CGI makeup felt overshadowing (which wasn't even the well rendered). While the majority of the cast was bland, I did like Kaya Scodelario who does bring a lot of likability to her character. I'll give this four Jack Sparrows out of ten. Again, I got the feeling that this adventure had a 'been there, done that' vibe that made the whole thing feel redundant. If your simply looking to get lost in a pirate adventure with Johnny Depp, you'll get it, but I'd still recommend Curse of the Black Pearl first. I hope that Depp can get onto another franchise, because this pirates series, as shown by this movie, is without a paddle.",4,3,9,31 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: Apocalypse makes up for a dull villain by providing a new batch of mutants and some fun action
","What's fascinating about history is that even though the Ancient World had claimed large empires from Rome to the Greeks to the Egyptians, we still know very little about it as much of the evidence is either lost, destroyed by time, or is still under the sand waiting to be rediscovered. I took a trip to Scandinavia a while back and learned about the Norse gods that the people worshiped and said to have built the lands. While it's easy to dismiss the images and ideas of these 'gods' as morality created for Scandinavian society, part of me does believe that the ancient world may have worked differently then the modern world does. Perhaps there was some magic centuries ago.The X-Men are a series of characters that you could argue are like modern day 'gods' with their mutant powers. Like the gods of the old world, they could take either side of good or bad, and were controversial with the government. Their movies have done well (especially First Class and Days of Future Past) to reflect this while making it a fun blockbuster for everyone. The young mutants face their biggest challenge yet when the first mutant returns in X-Men: Apocalypse.We begin in Ancient Egypt where the world's first mutant En Sabah Nur, or better known as Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac) rules as pharaoh, along with four other mutants as his 'four horsemen' until he's betrayed by fellow worshippers. He's trapped in a tomb for centuries, until he's accidentally woken and uncovered in 1983 where he decides that the human race has no place in this world. He recruits a young Cairo pickpocket, a then unknown Storm (played by Alexandria Shipp), along with a man with bird-like wings Angel (played by Ben Hardy), and telepathic energy manipulator Psylocke (played by Olivia Munn), and eventually, a heartbroken and cold Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender) to become the new Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Meanwhile, Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy/Beast (played by Nicholas Hoult) has been successfully running his school for mutants, but is reluctant to call them into action. He's put his focus on students like Scott Summers/Cyclops (played by Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner) and Jubilee. So it comes as a surprise when Raven/Mystique (played by Jennifer Lawrence) comes to the school along with a teleporter Nightcrawler (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee). They see how much of a threat Apocalypse is and join together to stop this guy from destroying everything.This movie had A LOT to follow up with, considering that Days of Future Past is one of the best super hero movies around. X-Men: Apocalypse does provide a bigger world that's taken advantage of. The introduction of Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Jubilee, and Storm are welcome to this younger franchise, as they bring some new insights on what it is to be a mutant from different perspectives. I even liked the newer villains that were usedexcept for Apocalypse. They try to give him these big powers and a cool make up design, but he is a dull and boring to hear from. You'd think that a centuries old pharaoh would have more to him then evil.The best performances are still the original four (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jenifer Lawrence, and Nicolas Hoult) who continue to evolve their characters.The action scenes do provide a lot for the X-Men to play around with. The final battle itself goes on a little long, but it did give us plenty of different mutant powers at use. Much of the story does rely on knowing what happened on the last couple of movies, so I'd defiantly say to start with First Class before coming to this.I'll give this seven Julilees out of ten. While the scope and weight isn't as large as Captain America: Civil War, X-Men: Apocalypse was a fun addition to the growing franchise. I'd say give this a watch, but if your not familiar with the X-Men, then go back and watch the others first.",7,3,8,2 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The crowded story in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 shoots an unfocused mess of cobwebs.
","The modern summertime at the movies has developed a tradition where a superhero movie or two is released that can please both a general audience looking to be lost in a fantasy and a comic book crowd that's counting to see if everything is properly represented. Before the 2000's, most of these adaptations took two different paths that separated these crowds; either something that's more playful with bright colors like Superman and the original Spider-Man that's self aware that it's campy and silly. And there's the dark and dramatic route that Batman and The Crow took with an atmosphere that's cold but stylish, and bolder character development.Most superhero movies today tend to go with the latter. The idea behind this is that with every caped crusader, there has to be some big epic story with how they got there and the dilemma they must be going through, doing their typical 'saving the day' routine. The previous Spider- Man trilogy had more of a campy route with occasional scenes of dramatic character arcs. The recent reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man gave our friendly neighborhood hero a reimagining that was darker, but still the same wisecracker we loved. It took me by surprise, so it made sense that I was hyped to see where the story would go in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.So what's going on? The real question is, 'What's not going on?' as the movie tries to put a lot into it's story. Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) has settled into his role as New York's favorite son as he catches thieves, thwarts dangers, and saves an occasional life, including that of an electrical engineer Max Dillon (played by Jamie Fox). What Spider-Man didn't know was that Max was a big fan of the Web Slinger, and dreams of being just as important and wanted.An accident with electric eels causes Max to mutate into a living electric generator. His debut is met with disgust and horror. In a spectacular action sequence, Max calls himself Electro and starts to destroy Time's Square, finally releasing his personal anger with the world. You would think that Spider-Man would have enough trouble with this guy, but Peter also has to deal with discovering that his father may have been hiding top secret research work from evil, his best friend Harry Osborn (played by Dane DeHaan) returning to take over his dad's company, a relationship with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and even the beginning of submitting photos for The Daily Bugle newspaper.There's a lot more plot to tell, but I don't want to lose focus. That's the biggest problem with The Amazing Spider-Man 2; it tries to tell a lot of story. Since they got the origin story out of the way in the previous film, I thought that this movie would be ready to give us something that was different from the previous trilogy. In truth, I found myself making a lot of comparisons to the okay-received Spider-Man 3.It shares the same problem of adding in too many villains and rushing most of the development in place for uninteresting story and jokes. I can only blame the less then average screenplay, as the acting here is really good. The material with Electro, with his back-story and the battle sequences, was so good that I don't know why they simply didn't settle on that for a movie. There's nothing wrong with a superhero film that's only ninety minutes long. I can tell that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a result of a director's vision clashing with Sony's corporate idea of setting up a franchise. It never meshes enough for a solid story.I'll give this four comic book electros out of ten. This movie has impressive acting, impressive visuals, and impressive cinematography, but it's badly put together story lacks true excitement that I got from the previous franchise. Ughit was close.",4,47,98,2 May 2014
Ex Machina," Ex Machina is that Stanley Kubrick-like robot thriller I wanted with Artificial Intelligence
","The first robots I saw in person were at Disneyland in the form of the famous audio animatronics that you see as pirates, ghosts, or whatever the park wants them to play in their attractions. As a little boy, I actually thought that pirates were really pillaging and that ghosts were haunting a mansion. Once I learned more about how the world works, the curtain opened and exposed how the trick worked. From that point on, I knew that the magic that was once there had moved. I appreciate the park more for what it is rather then what it has, but it still pleases a lot of children into thinking their about to go into a world of characters. This was probably my first example of a Turing test.The purpose of a Turing test is to determine whether a human cannot identify that what it is their communicating with is a machine. Artificial intelligence seems to be getting closer and it probably wont be long before we see several people being deceived into marriage thinking that their bride is a human, without knowing what's really inside of her. Ex-Machina takes it's own Turning test, but with a different idea. Young programmer Caleb Smith works for Blue Book, witch is like the Google of this cinematic world. He's lucky enough to win a company sweepstakes that will take him to meet his boss. He flies to the mountains where he enters the home of Nathan Bateman (played by Oscar Isaac). The house itself is built underground and has the look of a concrete hotel. Nathan at first does not fit the role of a recluse, who seems friendly with Caleb, simply wanting to talk about life rather then work. That all changes when Nathan offers to show Celeb his latest work.After signing a non-discloser agreement, Celeb finds that he'll be the guinea pig to an artificial intelligent robot to pass the Turing test. Nathan decides that Celeb needs to see the machinery inside the robot, as to prove that if the programmer can have an emotional and physical response, then the test is truly successful. Celeb waits in another room where a robot with a human face walks in. She introduces herself as Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) and while she is shy, she does show signs of a personality and even comments on the English language. Celeb goes through a whole week of tests with this girl and whether she truly is a created human being. In 2001, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was a widely marketed movie about the same philosophies that Ex Machina is trying to get across. The big difference here is that Ex Machina not only feels more intelligent on how it presents it's robots, but it even feels more like the Stanley Kubrick movie that Spielberg was trying to mimic. The slow pacing and creepy tone (trust me, it becomes unnerving in a good way) seemed to call back to The Shining and 2001: A Space Odyssey. First time director Alex Garland (screenwriter of 28 Weeks Later and Dredd) presents himself as a wise beyond his years master that makes it hard to believe that Ex Machina is his introduction work. The casting feels perfect, considering that this is basically a three- person story. They all fit the triangle of symmetrical acting that made me forget I was watching a movie. The story is perfect as not only is the setup right for an artificial intelligence story, but we receive interesting examinations on each motivation with the characters. I love stories that keep me off guard with what's going to happen.I'll give this ten Ava robots out of ten. The eyes of the machines here gave me the same fear that I felt when the HAL 9000 tried to kill the astronauts of 2001. Given what these things can do, perhaps I might be better off just enjoying the pirates at Disneyland rather then waiting for a machine to confuse me.",10,3,7,30 April 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," As a historical recreation about a Chess match, Pawn Sacrifice plays it's game well
","Pawn to C4. Rook to H5. Knight to E6. This might seem like an odd set of references, but they are chess moves. Chess is a game that I have little experience in actual playing, but have seem everyone else in. My two best friends are adequate enough to play a good round and show how their better then me at something. I also see plenty of people, children and adults playing out in a park or inside a bookstore. What their saying to the world is, ' I'm a respectable intelligent person that knows enough about chess that I can be seen as aggressive'.I might take up chess later on in life when I feel like I need another hobby. It's not that I have no interest, but my current interests take a lot of time already. So you could imagine my surprise when my dad told me that the 1972 World Chess Championship was a big deal. Both names Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky were spoken like they were sports stars or even political figures. In a way, it's true as each represented the USA and the Soviet Union. Pawn Sacrifice plays it's game and tries to expose Bobby Fischer for who he really was.As a boy growing up in Brooklyn, Bobby Fischer is a total introvert, choosing to ignore his mother's Russian heritage and communist ways, completely immersing himself in a world of chess. He'll play against himself if he has to, but he's always seen trying to make his game better. Eventually his mother takes him to a local chess club that already knows that Fischer will become a great player. He becomes the youngest grandmaster and wins countless U.S. Chess Championships, while the rest of the world has to put up with his arrogant attitude and his never ending hunger for the world championship. The problem is that the Soviet Union has the best players and one such player, Boris Spassky (played by Liev Schreiber) has been the face of the world champion for many years. Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) wants nothing more then to prove that he's better then the entire Soviet Union. The problem is that the late sixties were an era that started to show that Fischer was suffering from paranoia and delusions, often believing that the Soviets were spying on him. He even gives crazy demands that might have prevented him from playing in the 1972 match. The Soviets agree and the famous match is on.Strictly as a movie goer, I though that Pawn Sacrifice was a pretty good historical story about a famous match. The best moment of the movie are the chess matches, which are few, but still manage to remain exciting thanks to the film's cleverness to keep the look tight, but tense. It also does well to explain the game for non players, but I'm sure that should be little issue. What the movie doesn't do well at is to try and tell us who Bobby Fischer was.Don't get me wrong. Tobey Maguire plays him very well. It's more on the scripts blame. Sure we know that Fischer was a great chess player, had a lot of psychological problems and said some strange things, but it's all stuff that's been told. Something like Lincoln showed more about the personality of the president and Saving Mr. Banks dwelled into the stern personality of P.L. Travers. The pacing can also come off as a little slow ironically as the filmmakers probably didn't want too many chess games. I think they could have used some more. I'll give this seven chess knight pieces out of ten. Pawn Sacrifice is more likable as a historical recreation rather then an engaging narrative, but I'm glad I saw it. It reminded me that plenty of people play chess and that Tobey Maguire is an underrated actor. Consider playing this movie if you want to know more about a famous chess match.",7,0,4,1 October 2015
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures launches as a entertaining, hopeful movie about race relations and the space race
","The journey to space has been a daunting one. Even in this day and age, the physics and mathematics have only gotten us to the edge. Having the Voyager satellite exit the solar system may seem like a major accomplishment (which it is), but it's still small compared to the size of the universe. Who can blame us considering how we've come within the world of transportation. Even getting to space took some time to figure out. It's something we've been trying to do for a while, but everything was set on a hurrying motion once the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. The 1960's had us racing against the Soviets for everything; power, technology, and especially the accomplishment of space. It was all about being the first and the US government wanted to make sure that NASA could make that happen. Like I said, the problem was solving a lot of problems that it took to get people to space and making sure they could get back. NASA had hired some of the most intelligent people around, yet they were still having trouble finding the right solutions. The answers seemed to be found within the minds of outsiders as shown in Hidden Figures. In the early 1960's, racial segregation is still an issue. Things seem to be a bi more progressive at NASA as they have employed several African-Americans to do a lot of the computing that complicated things. Here we focus on three individuals; mathematics genius Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Monáe). They seem to be doing well at NASA, even though they still face some discrimination from their white superiors. Once the Soviets get the first people into space, NASA is looking to get an astronaut to orbit the Earth.Katherine is hired up to help compute launch and landing numbers for the Space Task Group, being directed by Al Harrison (played by Kevin Costner) and his assistant Paul Stafford (played by Jim Parsons). Meanwhile, Dorothy sees that her and her fellow computing workers are about to be out of a job now that new IBM computers are being installed. To ensure work, Dorothy takes it upon herself to learn to new computer and see if she can get her coworkers to understand it. Also, Mary is being recommended to become an engineer, but company regulations require a certain course from a college that's white only.Unlike Moonlight, which was a bleak and human look at a struggling African-American, Hidden Figures is more upbeat and hopeful portrayal of changing times. Does that make it better then the latter? No, as Moonlight is something that'll be studied in a lot of college courses in race relations, Hidden Figures is more general with it's approach and will be played in the high schools as a history lesson. That is definitely not a bad thing as this movie is still entertaining, especially considering that the majority of the plot is solving a complex mathematical formula.All three main actors (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe) are fantastic and carry their own stories well enough that your never disappointed that the movie is cutting away to their segment. I was curious about how all the of them were going to proceed, given the unfortunate rules of the time. I liked the majority of the cast around them (with the exception of Jim Parsons, who only seems to be playing a version of his Bing Bang Theory character). The film can get a little slow towards the hour mark, but it all picks up towards it's finale which I wont give away. I'll give this eight Mercury rockets out of ten. If you have any interest of the space program and it's history, then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Hidden Figures has a lot energy and passion of portraying this real life story. Like Rudy, I think this'll make people want to follow their goals more. So see if this rocket story launches in your favor.",8,11,26,13 January 2017
Coco," I'd recommend Coco just for it's creativity, but it's combination of story and song make it one of Disney & Pixar's best
","Once a year in Mexico, people bring treats to a graveyard where they hope to contact the dead andwait a minute, isn't this the Christmas season? What's with the sudden Halloween ideas? Actually, this is a special day called Dia de Muertos (in English, that would be the Day of the Dead) where the dark reality of death is suddenly made colorful and an embraced part of life. Death is not seen as an end, as the connection to our loved ones is how they still remain a part of us, even when their gone. The Day of the Dead remains a celebrated day in Mexico, and even the United States.There is something to those who say that they feel the spirits of their loved ones. Perhaps it's the connection of the memories or maybe it is their ghosts that are there to remind them that they'll always be watching. You could argue that these people are the closest to their families if they still consider their ancestors a vital member of the family. The Day of the Dead for this reason, stresses the importance of togetherness and family, which is why I have to recommend Coco for everyone this holiday season.Within the Rivera family, a group of shoemakers, music is outright banned in the household, even though 12 year old Miguel (played by Anthony Gonzalez) wants to follow his hero Ernesto de la Cruz (played by Benjamin Bratt) and become a famous musician. It's explained that about four generations ago, one of the Riveras became a musician and never returned home. In turn, the now abandoned wife become a shoemaker, and the rest of the family followed suit. Regardless of ban that's heavily enforced by his grandmother Imelda, Miguel constantly watches Ernesto's old movies, performances, and listens to his most popular song, 'Remember Me'.When Miguel wants to enter a local talent show, he tries acquiring a guitar by steeling the one within Ernesto's tomb. As soon as he strums it, he suddenly finds that he cannot be seen by the living and can now see skeletons visiting their families during the current Day of the Dead. His skeleton ancestors tell him that they can get him home, but under the condition that he can't play music. Not wanting to accept that, he travels through the land of the dead to find Ernesto in order to get a non-binding blessing from him. I will flat out say it: Coco may now be one of my favorite Disney movies. This is a film where everything happens to be beautiful. The story is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. The animation is beautiful. The voice work is beautiful. But why is it all beautiful? A lot of that falls on the overall story and plot where everything the child goes through feels warranted and earned. It's almost never predictable and kept me going on trying to figure out where everything was going to lead; not just for our hero but for his family. Coco has one of the most original designed worlds in a while, fitting in with other imaginative worlds like Metropolis, Blade Runner, and Batman. It is huge, looking like it could hold the population of the dead, with every part of it looking lived in. It blossoms in color, turning a world of darkness into a work of art. Coco took advantage of an underworld that has a majority Mexican inspiration and ran with every direction possible. Seeing this on the big screen made it all seem like a dream I never wanted to leaveand this is from someone who didn't see it in 3D.Of course I have to address the music. It represents everything fun and spiritual that Mexico is capable of. Though the movie is not technically a musical, it does come close with how songs are sung and just how their placed. I can already bet that 'Remember Me' will get the phrase through it's sweeps at the award season. But without giving away how that song progresses, I'd like to address 'Un Poco Loco' which I'd love to know if it was an original song for the movie. It's a funny little but that seems fitting for it's moment. Composer Michael Giacchino gives the movie an extra sound that makes me convinced that he's the next john Williams. I'll give this ten special guitars out of ten. Coco is a special movie that is meant for whole families, not just kids or even adults to watch alone. I have to recommend it alone for it's creativity, but all of its elements together make it a must. Please see this movie and find what a beautiful song it is.",10,10,26,1 December 2017
1917," 1917 recruits you to experience a war journey done in an impressive 'one-shot' style that I can't say i've seen before
","Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U.S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself.",8,12,18,17 January 2020
Big Hero 6," With parts of creativity, design, and fun, Big Hero 6 becomes a functional film of excitement and fun
","Talk as much as you want about what kind of future we're leaving our children, I want you to consider how much we have now. We are in the middle of the biggest transition into machines (even more so then the industrial revolution years before) with more computers, more robots, and more information built into an interconnected system that is assessable to everyone. While I can't say this is making people smarter, it is certainly giving us a bigger chance to help others. The trouble with introducing new technology is that the inventor will assume that everyone will use it correctly. That is never the case. A good example is robotics. By skimming some old Popular Science magazines, I see many sketches and prints of robotics acting like our personal servants. We are now in their future (or our present) yet the majority of the tech is related to industry or toys, but no robot friends. I think the big issue with human-like robots is cracking the idea of programing the emotions of a human. How would you program love and hate in the simplest of terms. For now we're just going to have to step back and enjoy the newest cinematic robot creation in Big Hero 6.In the futuristic metropolis of San Fransokyo (a creative combination of San Francisco and Tokyo), a fourteen-year old prodigy named Hiro Hamada makes little fighting bots in street matches to make money as he's already gone through high school. He's rescued by his older brother Tadashi and taken somewhere where he can be appreciated; the robotics college where Tadashi goes. He meets some other students and is introduced to their Professor Callaghan (played by James Cromwell) who encourages Hiro to enter a show that could admit him.Tadashi introduces Hiro to Baymax; a inflatable health care companion whose duty is to help the sick and injured. For the college competition, Hiro invents a bunch of nanobots (robots that are really small, but work together to do big things) that catches everyone's eye. The excitement is worn off fast when a building fire destroys the nanobots and kills Tadashi.Hiro sulks in his room for a while and gets to know Baymax's abilities more. This causes the robot to accidentally discover that a villain in a Kabuki mask is making a ton of nanobots. This gets Hiro the motivation to build armor for Baymax to search for the man that may be Tadashi's killer.Big Hero 6 has the distinction of being the next Disney Animated movie after Frozen. It's a bad spot to be as most people are going to expect another major hit. Big Hero 6 managed to entertain me, but I doubt it's going to be Disney's most memorable. The best thing about the movie is the setting. San Fransokyo has a very awesome look that my inner child is screaming 'I WANNA GO!'. The balance of the American and Japanese cultures work well to the futuristic story of robotics.Speaking of robots, Baymax has so much of a nonthreatening and huggable design, I have a hard time imagining someone hating him. He's curious, gentile, and always wants to help people. He plays the pet to Hiro whose story is a good one; accepting loss and finding new purpose. He's smart, but not yet fully mature to understand the need to have friends. His friends consists of the other college students that Tadashi worked with and eventually become heroes with Hiro and Baymax. They have fun personalities, but were not given enough time to know them more. This story belongs to the boy and his robot. I'll give this seven Baymax robots out of ten. Though more time with the side characters would have been nice, Big Hero 6 has the mechanics to be an exciting, fast paced action that most families should see.",7,7,22,13 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: The Last Jedi's force is strong, as a great story, great character arcs, and great action make this movie a true jedi
","Ever since Disney bought the Star Wars franchise, a lot of consideration has been put together from the fans about whether the output of more content will make the popular series less special. It's safe to say that Star Wars is more then a fun space opera; it's a story that changed how Hollywood defines blockbusters. I've gone over this more in my Force Awakens review, but I mentioned that before Star Wars was made, most science fiction films were scene as fun little B movies that, while having an audience, didn't have a lot of respect when compared to classics like Citizen Kane and Ben Hur. Of course, things are different.For a while, most people seemed to be happy with the original trilogy. Then in the late 1990s, George Lucas returned to make a prequel trilogy that had gotten a mixed response. Even with that, people seemed to be content with that, along with a galaxy full of novels, games, and content that expanded on the universe of Star Wars. Now whether more movies like Force Awakens, Rogue One, and more will make it less special seems like an odd question. People already seem to be used to them, and if The Last Jedi shows anything, that it's not stopping anytime soon.General Leia (played by Carrie Fisher) is evacuating the Resistance from a planet when the First Order tries to take them out. Hotshot fighter Poe (played by Oscar Isaac) takes down a destroyer, but ends up getting fellow fighters killed doing so. Though the Resistance escapes, they are followed by Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) who sends several TIE fighters to take them out for good. In this process, Leia is injured, leaving Admiral Holdo (played by Laura Dern) in charge. Not agreeing with her strategy, Poe, Finn (played by John Boyega), BB-8 (played by Bill Hader) and ship mechanic Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran) embark on a secret mission to find a code breaker that could get them in to the First Order Battle Carrier. Meanwhile, Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) and Chewbacca have found Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) on an isolated world where they see that he wants nothing to do with the current fight. Rey eventually gets him to train her on the Force and the ways of the Jedi. While doing so, she learns some things about Luke and Kylo that questions just who is right and whether Luke can even help the resistance.The Force Awakens, though I liked, did borrow a lot from A New Hope. I can say that while The Last Jedi does take a little from Empire Strikes Back, it mostly feels like a more original story. A very entertaining story to say as this had to be one of the few Star Wars stories that I didn't know where it was going to go. This finally found the right balance of good story, great action, and of course, strong characters.If the last movie proved to be phenomenal for Harrison Ford, this movie reminds me of how good both Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are. It's fascinating to see a more distraught Luke Skywalker given everything he's gone through. You get an understanding of him, but he pushes himself further away to make you question if he's the hero you've always seen him as. Carrie Fisher would be glad to hear that her final performance may be her strongest as Leia. This time, we get a sense that even she doesn't know if hope isn't coming this time, thus a sadder, but interesting kind of Leia.I can say that both John Boyega and Daisy Ridley continue to prove why their personalities and charisma make them ideal Star Wars actors. Their likable and both characters go through character arcs that I won't spoil. Both Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac, who didn't have a lot of screen time in Force Awakens, not only have a lot more to do this time, but they too have large character arcs that are just as fascinating as Darth Vader and Han Solo's in Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Again, not spoiling anything.I'll give this ten blue lightsabers out of ten. Director Rian Johnson has not early improved on the mistakes of the pervious movie to craft an amazing Star Wars movie, but an amazing movie in general. I didn't even mention that that cinematography and special effects are just as good as the story, but what you don't know make this a great movie. I'll simply say go see it, and may the force be with you.",8,1,14,18 December 2017
The Imitation Game," Alan Turing's story of early computer tech and lifestyle struggle is one of 2014's best
","The twenty-first century has seen a dominance in computer technology. We use these machines in our lives for work and play, yet we keep saying that were going to further push what they can do. They can already play video games for us and instruct us how to cook pasta. Maybe they'll be the ones doing the cooking for me (it would save me a ton of time until I can hire a chef)! Most textbooks will show people using computers at home as early as the mid eighties. If your were to turn to war history, then you'll be surprised to find that computer history goes back further.Turning to World War II, an early model for the processing system was built into order to crack the hardest code of all; the Nazi Enigma machine that changes patters daily to throw off code breakers. Though I'm not a programmer or even that proficient as a computer user, this is where a lot of pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee (Internet creator) and Larry page (founder of Google) found inspiration that pushed what computers can accomplish. Finally given justice for his accomplishments, the story of Alan Turing is expressed in The Imitation Game. The British Military has been trying to break the Enigma device that the Nazi's have been using for communication to no avail. The current code breakers simply can't keep up with the daily changes and deadlines. What results is the hiring of a mathematician Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who claims that he can build a machine that will beat the Germans to the punch. His only insistence is that he gets to work alone, a demand that is denied. He struggles to work with a few scientists who never seem to understand Turing's attitude. The movie seems to hint Aspergers Syndrome.He eventually turns to hire another accomplish; a woman Joan Clarke (played by Kira Knightly) who was able to solve a crossword faster then anyone in the group, Turing included. He continues to build his Bombe machine with the goal of getting to be able to process millions of possible data in a matter of minutes. Clarke meanwhile helps Turing to become more sociable and even strike up a romance. She doesn't know that Turing is a homosexual, something that he's been struggling with since he had feeling for a friend as a teenager. Though Turing manages to build his machine, the British government is not so kind on his homosexuality. Compared to the recent Unknown, The Imitation Game is a different kind of war movie. This one is more behind the scenes and dialogue heavy then on explosions and artillery. What follows is a very chilling tale not of a man who help the British win the war, but about a country that was so unforgiving because of his lifestyle. What The Imitation Game really wants to emphasize is that the government's punishment on Turning was wrong then and it's wrong now. The good news is that rather then being a sexually fueled story, it's a genuine human story simply about this one guy doing his job.A part from the controversy that the movie is trying to address, The Imitation Game is one of the best of 2014. I think that this is one of the few movies that I had no problems with. Benedict Cumberbatch, Kira Knightly, and everyone is casted perfectly, the story and editing all play out like a wartime melody and the look of the era looks great. The Imitation Game is a movie that everyone, even is their not computer, World War II, or LBGT fans, should still see.I'll give this ten Bombe Machines out of ten. Riveting on all circuits, The Imitation Game remains one of my favorites and truly deserves the critical phrase it's receiving.",10,2,8,13 January 2015
Jurassic World," Jurassic World is probably the best sequel were going to get from Jurassic Park. Nothing could have topped the original
","The nineties was a big era for anything prehistoric related. Encino Man, Super Mario Bros., Dino City, Theodore Rex, We're Back: a Dinosaur Story, and even The Dinosaurs TV series all have marked that anything dino related was the trend, and they all have one movie to thank; Jurassic Park. If you ask over a thousand people to name the best dinosaur movie is, I promise that they will all say Jurassic Park. Michael Crichton penned the original novel that brilliantly conveyed the subtext on what happens when science tries to tinker into nature and gave the cinematic feeling of reading about people trying to survive a real life dinosaur.In 1993, Steven Spielberg released the movie adaptation. Not only was the film a blockbuster; it became a landmark. It become the highest grossing box office movie for a while and recaptured the majesty of dinosaurs. The story was fun, the characters were likable, and computer technology was finally showing off with what it could do. Nobody had seen movie creatures to this extent. From that point on, every blockbuster would see what new fields computer effects can accomplish and use them as much as possible. Over twenty years later, we can finally go back to the park in Jurassic World.Sometime after the events of the first movie, the InGen corporation went back to the ruins on the island of Isa Bublar and built a fully realized theme park that John Hammond would have been proud about, Jurassic World. The movie opens with a pair of brothers, the younger dino-obsessed Gray, and his older smart phone-obsessed Zach, who are going on a free trip to Jurassic World as their aunt Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is the parks operations manager. The boys arrive and seem to have fun with the high tech exhibits and creatures, even though Claire seems to have too much work to spend time with them.Her focus is on the parks first genetically modified creature, the Indominus Rex, which is like a T-rex, only bigger and more intelligent. She calls upon dino-expert Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt) to look into the creature's enclosure to make sure it can't get out. As a Jurassic Park movie does, it gets out. Owen and Claire mix trying to find the dinosaur and trying to get the park evacuated while the boys try to survive in a land 65 million years in the making. I went into the theater figuring that no matter what this movie did, it would never be able to top Jurassic Park. Jurassic World is certainly not as good, but it is also the best sequel we're probably going to get with this franchise. The other sequels tried to steer the dinos into another direction that didn't seem to go anywhere, so it made sense to go back to where it all started. The result is that Jurassic World may have a different look, it's story is a lot like the first movie; it has children in danger, a dino-expert clashing heads with business suits that would rather exploit it and plenty of dinosaur action. The focus is still on the characters, and the film takes plenty of time to establish them. Owen and Claire are a pair that I would love to see get into other situations and the boys manage to use their smarts to out wit the creatures. Speaking of which, CGI technology allows the creatures to look better, though I wish they still would have mixed it in with a few animatronics. It certainly doesn't get in the way too much as the animals are appealing to look at and the fights are good old fashioned blockbuster fun.I'll give this eight velociraptors out of ten. On it's own, Jurassic World makes for a good blockbuster. It's no Jurassic Park, but it would have never had a chance. It took what it had and made it good. And that seems to be enough to satisfy me. It should hopefully satisfy those that have been waiting a while for that one sequel. As long as you know the original can't be topped, then buy your ticket and go back to the park.",8,9,24,11 June 2015
Silence," To watch Scorsese's Silence is to go through a tough, but beautiful exploration on spirituality
","To quote the Bible from the book of Peter 5:10, 'And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast'. It may surprise you that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese wanted to become a priest before he settled on a filmmaking career. While that doesn't say much about him now, it does show that the church was a big part of his life as a youth and makes you wonder about how he sees the world. Martin Scorsese is the one filmmaker from the French New Wave era of movie makers who has managed to remain consistency great. Even his lesser work like Shutter Island is still a very good movie is the least. Scorsese has put his two cents in every genre from family (Hugo), to gangster (Goodfellas), to biopics (The Aviator, The Wolf of Wall Street) and many more. His most controversial film came in the 1980's when he made The Last Temptation of Christ, which was said to be his most personal (and is also a film I love). Silence is his next foray into religion and to holding onto ones belief. In the fifteenth century, jurist priests Sebastiāo Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (played by Adam Driver) receive word that their mentor Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) has committed apostasy in Japan. Christianity has been outlawed in Japan and the Jurists have been trying to change that. Knowing their teacher wouldn't do such an atrocity, ask and get permission to go and find Ferreira. Once they are introduced to Kichijiro, a Japanese fisherman who claims to renounce Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are taken to Japan via boat. In several small villages, Rodrigues and Garupe see that the local Christian population has been driven underground, for the sentence is usually death. Both men ask, but few seem to know who Father Ferreira was. In the meantime, both priests do their best to help the Christians while remaining hidden from the Samurai army. At one point, Kichijiro betrays Rodrigues and has the priest captured. Rodrigues is told by 'the inquisitor' that Japan has no use for the Catholic Doctrine and that Christian prisoners will continue to be tortured until he too commits apostasy. It is here where he faces a lot of questions about his faith, selflessness, and the nature of humanity.Silence is a movie that Scorsese has wanted to make for decades, and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. This is an example on how to make a great religious movie. Now only is it a story that is never boring, this truly pushes the audience as much as the priests are being pushed for their beliefs. It may be a long movie (nearly clocking in at three hours), it's all intentional for the benefit of feeling just as isolated as out main character.Coincidentally, this happens to be the second religious story for Andrew Garfield this year along with Hacksaw Ridge. However, this also proves that this young man may be one of the finest actors of our generation. All of his moments, from staring at himself in the water to his struggle to step on a Christian picture, all feel earned and never once feel phony. It is beautifully shot and edited as all Scorsese movies are. Something about Silence makes it's clearly large world feel so isolating. It really feels like that your going on a spiritual journey. How you come out in the end is up to you.I'll give this ten pictures of Saint Peter out of ten. Silence is a movie that while maybe not for everyone, is something that I implore every fan of film to check out, even if their not following a religion. This is more then holding onto spirituality; its about your principles and holding out for what you DO believe in. This'll probably be too polarizing for the award season, but this is a work of art that needs to be seen at least once (preferably on the big screen). Silence will hang above you like a cloud for a while like I expect it to do for me.",10,4,9,23 January 2017
Logan," The Claws are Drawn for One More Time. Logan is an Amazing End for Wolverine
","With a set of metal claws, an ability to heal from wounds, and a Clint Eastwood-like attitude, you get the superhero animal known as Wolverine. Within the X-Men comics, Wolverine has become one of the most iconic and popular characters of not just that team, but for Marvel in general. While some of that comes down to a neat design, the character of feels the roughest of personalities. This has allowed him to confront his enemies with more of a street-smart mindset that the other X-Men lack. It also helps that his regeneration practically makes him the perfect shield for the other heroes.His cinematic outings have worked thanks to the casting of Hugh Jackman. He manages to carry the necessary roughness with the combination of the actor's charisma. What this makes is a Wolverine that remains popular even though he has never worn the famous costume from the comics. This is simply excellent direction. It makes sense that the actor wouldn't be able to play the character forever and had to exit at some point. Had it not been for the critically acclaimed Old Man Logan comic, writers might still be searching for a good idea. What comes for Wolverines final cinematic story is Logan. Set in 2029 sometime after X-Men: Apocalypse, the mutants are close to being extinct due to no new ones being born in a while. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) has aged considerably now that his healing is much slower and the metal that's attached to his skeleton and claws is poisoning him. He works as a chauffeur and caring for Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) who is retired and suffering a disease that causes him to lose control of his telepathic abilities and memory loss. A nurse approaches Logan asking for safe transport to North Dakota for her and her child Laura. Logan agrees for a payment, but finds that nurse murdered the morning they were supposed to leave. When he returns home, he finds Laura in the trunk. Not too long later is when Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) comes with a security team to kill Laura. During the battle, it's discovered that Laura has a similar set of claws and a similar regeneration power like Wolverines. Logan, Xavier, and Laura escape and hit the road to drive north. What they're hoping for is the last chance for mutants to continue. Not only does the movie contain a lot of story elements that I don't want to spoil, but it contains a lot of acting moments that are also worth keeping secret. It's rare to find a 'three' movie that's the best of a series, but Logan seems to be that specialty. Not only is it the darkest and most violent (it takes full advantage of the R rating), but it's also the most mature. What I mean by that is that this feels like a very adult story regarding aging, politics about minorities, and even genuine drama between Wolverine and Laura. Out of all the X-Men movies, Logan is the least superhero of all, and that's a good thing. Hugh Jackman's Logan plays off more like a cowboy as his character practically refuses to be the hero that most audiences have identified him as. He's more weary and damaged then before, and his performance reminds you of a scar that contains a good story. By the end, you'll not only be fighting off tears, but feel that the song use of Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around' is worth it. Logan is without a doubt, the best of the X-Men series (yes, even over Deadpool).I'll give this nine Wolverines out of ten. In the ages of capes and super villains, it's refreshing to see something that's more grounded. It takes inspiration from the right places (Shane, Children of Men, etc) and uses it's action to it's full advantage to make the perfect last ride for good old Wolverine",9,4,10,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Ultron again brings our favorite heroes into action, even if the story is a little overstuffed
","Though it's only the beginning of May, it's already feeling a lot like summer! Not because of the warm weather, kids being out of school or even the public pools already being filled up with families. Tis the season of the summer blockbuster! For the heavy film going audience, the year has two major seasons, the summer season, which is filled with the big, epic popcorn films that tend to be the most anticipated movies of the year, and the winter season, which is where all the award winners and performance features debut (if they haven't already at a film festival). Though the blockbuster summer season started in the seventies, it has had the most change from the early nineties through the early 2000's. Super hero movies tended to be big draws, but they started to pick up further steam when Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were released and no one could have anticipated the plans that Marvel had put into play. Captain America and Thor came along before they would all cross over in The Avengers, which I still stand by as one of the best popcorn summer movies of all time, right up there with Jaws and Star Wars. Earth's mightiest heroes return to take on a deadly threat in The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Like a lot of summer movies, the film opens up with the Avengers in the middle of a mission in Sokovia; raiding a Hydra terrorist outpost. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and The Hulk each get their turn to show off their powers and strength as they break through to retrieve Loki's staff from the previous films. Though they are successful, they put up a goof fight with two new powerful beings; the really fast Quicksilver (played by Aaron Taylor-Thompson) and his twin magical sister Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen).The Avenger celebration is put on hold when one of Tony Stark's newest creations, the artificial intelligent robot Ultron (played by James Spader) awakens, and has a more homicidal agenda with his mission to 'Save the Earth'. Ultron and some drones escapes back to Sokovia to build a large machine made out the same material as Captain America's shield. Attempts to go after Ultron fail and the Avengers find themselves fugitives as their actions create more destruction then save lives. Even with the help of a newly created Avenger, Vision (played by Paul Bettany), out heroes may have finally met their match.The Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot riding on this matching is predecessor; it had to up the action while keeping it's legendary tongue in cheek attitude as director Joss Weldon is known for. The pressure was also on to keep this cinematic story going for those that have seen the previous ones. The film succeeds in both, but falls within it too. The good news is that the action is really good. I never felt tired by the fights and it built itself up to an explosive finale like any good action movie should (please learn this lesson Michael Bay!).We also get plenty of the great banter between our heroes when their just sitting around and building a plan. I just wish we had a little more of that. Between the action and the signature debates, the movie had to fill in the exposition of Ultron which got excessively complicated along with the discussion of the infinity stones, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch's intentions, Thors Vision, the Vision being created, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if an extended cut surfaced on DVD later on that paces this stuff better then this shorter cut does (It's already long at two and a half hours, but it didn't really feel that long).I'll give this eight Ultrons out of ten. It's not as well put together as the first and you kind of need to see the other movies before seeing this one, but The Avengers: Age of Ultron should make most Marvel fans happy and should continue bringing them back. Let's see what happens with Earth's mightiest heroes next.",8,3,8,1 May 2015
Everest," With a great cast leading a tough climb and a sad end, Everest is true to it's hardship
","After climbing a simple mountain, it's easy to imagine that your suddenly qualified to be a mountaineer and scale the tallest peaks. It's easy to think that you can buy a good backpack and take the next plane to Nepal to take on the beast that is Mount Everest. But nobody knows what their in for until they take on another mountain. Maybe not Everest, but something smaller that would still be hard.While one could imagine themselves scaling Everest, once they look at the money and the health risks involved, they then look for a new hobby. It's not that taking on the mountain is impossible, but only the most experienced should be even trying. Tour groups know though that if people have money, then they are willing to go anywhere whether or not they even have experience. Even with the money, there's no guarantee that you would even make the summit; the physical strain is enough to make anyone cry for their mommy, but the window to scale the peak is so narrow that there have been years in which there were no successful summits to the top. Everest is an enduring story on why better planning is needed when issuing the right to climb the mountain. In 1996, Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke) is the leader of Adventure Consultants, a tour group that promises that they will try to get you to the summit of Everest, with little experience needed (though he highly recommends experience). In his tour this year is Texan Beck Weathers (played by Josh Brolin), mailman Doug Hansen (played by John Hawkes) and experienced mountaineer Yasuko Namba who has climbed the six highest mountains of the world. They fly into Nepal, make friends and get the expedition spiel from Rob who warms about the mountain and certainty of death.The group makes the long hikes to base camp where the meet up with the base camp manager Helen (played by Emily Watson) and competing leader of another group, Scott Fischer (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). The two groups agree to team up to avoid delay so that they can make their planned May tenth ascension. The majority of the group makes it to the top against altitude sickness in the death zone, but hit an unexpected blizzard that strands most of the climbers in the whiteout and frostbite. The goal is no longer for everyone to get down, but for anyone.Everest is based of the real life 1996 tragedy and the films does not light foot around that. I'd say that this is a two part story; the first being about the climb and the other about the blizzard and the sadness around those that died. I'd say that I really enjoyed the first half more then the second. The cast here is perfect. They manage to make themselves distinct in a surprise large group of people. I give extra points for Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin who carry a lot of the climb in this story. It's clear the most the climbing was real as the conditions I've witness only make me want to stay away from the mountain. I wouldn't last more then three days on Everest.The first half makes for a thrilling adventure, so what happened with the blizzard scenes? It's not that their thrilling, but the pacing is strange; thirty minutes of wondering through the cold, and then everything is all about the sadness of the tragedy. While it is important to acknowledge the sadness, Everest practically steps into soap opera territory. They really should have cut it down and toned that out better.I'll give this five Everest summit flags out of five. The last half is so uneven and long that it could have ruined the picture, but the first half was just so enjoyable that it wasn't a total loss. Everest is not an easy watch, but if you're at least curious about the climb, I'd recommend it. Just be ready for a hard second act.",5,0,1,13 October 2015
Midsommar," Overlong, pretentious, and unoriginal, Midsommar is a dull and boring followup to Hereditary
","Why is it that we have no problem of watching people on Instagram having the vacation of a lifetime by themselves, and yet get squeamish whenever we think doing the same solo trip. It because a lot of us share the same fear of being alone, especially in an environment that's alien. We've all had the situation in which we're at a party we don't want to be at and you latch on to a friend so that your not sitting alone in a corner. It's a part of the natural boundary we set up whenever the bubble we've chosen to live under becomes challenged.Unsurprisingly, a lot of horror stories have tackled the idea of being alone. This could be a slasher killer coming after someone or a group of travelers coming to a castle not knowing a monster lives there. Don't tell me you would be in further agony knowing you were the only one facing this. Today's movie deals with a group of people coming across a cult, which isn't new, but can still be scary if done differently. So let's see if director Ari Aster (Hereditary) can bring something new to the table with Midsommar.A young woman Dani (played by Florence Pugh), who already has depression and anxiety, is pushed further to the mental brink when her sister commits a murder-suicide on her parents. Her boyfriend Christian (played by Jack Reynor) has been under pressure from his friends to dump her, but he doesn't want to leave her while she's this vulnerable. It's no secret that he is uncomfortable with what's going on, and is unsure about a trip to Europe. To help her get away from her problems, he invites her to come along, much to the chagrin to the rest of the group. The Swedish student inviting them, Pelle (played by Vilhelm Blomgren), has no problem and they all fly over.The group, Dani, Christian, Mark (played by Will Poulter) and Josh (played by William Jackson Harper) arrive in northern Sweeden to Pelle's commune home which consists of farmers and families who seem nice. Their all getting ready to celebrate a midsommar celebration that only happens every ninety years. From the start, things go bad with a drug trip, along with creepy rituals that the commune say is normal and a part of their traditions. As the ceremonies go further and further, can Dani keep her sanity long enough to make it through?I was looking forward to Midsommar as I really liked Hereditary. But not only is it bad, it was really bad. This is a prime example of no matter how interesting the visuals and imagery is, everything goes back to story and character. It's overlong. It's pretentious. It's dull. It's a downer in a bad way. It's... ugh, let's go through the problems.The story is nothing new. Cults are a good source for stories and study on group mentalities. The Wicker Man, Sound of my Voice, Mandy, and The Sacrament are examples on how secret societies can make an idea scary more then the people themselves. Midsommar taught me little about cult other then typical Pagan stuff that's been done already. As I said, much of the attention is put on the rituals and ceremonies, which are shown...so...slowly. This can be done to dip audiences in a pace to throw them off, but the group of people already seem so creepy that any human, especially a college student would have taken off in the other direction.Even the history around their commune is dull enough that I felt like I was in school.
This might have been forgivable if the characters were at least interesting, but their no more developed then your typical slasher story of the 1980s. At first, it seemed like they were going to play different parts within the rituals and each of their personalities were going to be challenged. But the movie not only pulls a 'bait and switch', but goes down the path that you could predict before walking in. I'm not sure if the creator thought this would be seen as new, but it's an even bigger insult when it takes forever for anything to happen.I'm gonna give this one Swedish tapestry out of five. If there's anything I'm scared of, it's the idea of having to sit through Midsommar again. I already saw Hereditary as a polarizing movie, but I can't imagine this appealing anyone other then people who like sick images, sad people put through sad things, and a pace slower then Heaven's Gate. Otherwise, this is going to be a definite skip.",2,19,33,8 July 2019
La La Land," La La Land is an impressive, magical experience that shows that movie musicals are capable of
","A lot of major cities have a lot of hidden history. The majority of it can be found in books and the Internet, but there are some things right in front of you. Take a city like Los Angeles, that has plenty of history with Hollywood and the impact that it's made on the film industry. Buy a map to the starts and you'll probably be able to find the Chinese Theater, Paramount studios, and the Brown Derby hat. What a lot of those maps don't show is that many elements from Hollywood's heyday are still around like certain theaters, homes, and even murals. You just have to look for them.Today's film pays plenty of tributes. Old Hollywood is just a part of that. La La Land is like a wave of nostalgic feeling from a time where musicals were part of the movie going season; and I mean an original musical. When's the last time that you remember a musical that was not based off of a Broadway play (not counting animated movies)? It's been a while and to sell one in today's time, it would have to offer something we've haven't seen before. La La Land brings back the original musical. Mia (played by Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who works as a barista for an on studio coffee shop. The few auditions she's given are either stopped after one line or interrupted by someone who clearly feels more important then her. At the same time, jazz musician Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) is having problems with money and trying to get work that'll allow him to play the improvisational music that he prefers. A gig at a restaurant only allows him to play Christmas music, but he tries his hand at a beautiful melody that doesn't catch the eye of a lot of people. It does so of Mia who happened to discover it by chance.The two are initially not introduced that evening, but they encounter reach other months later at a party. The two strike up a friendship which ranges from Sebastian taking her to a jazz bar to curve her interest in the genre to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause. This eventually blooms into a romance as the two move in together and continue to chase the Hollywood dreams of making a mark within the world of entertainment. I'll say right off the back that La La Land is one of the best, most entertaining movies of 2016. I expect this to be a major hit with everyone, even those that don't typically watch musicals. This is a rare musical where I can recall all the songs being great. 'City of Stars', 'Another Day of Sun' and 'Start a Fire' are all candidates for the best song Oscar. Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) clearly loves older music as jazz is given a bigger spotlight here then before. The tunes plays by Ryan Gosling and John Legend (who also plays a part in the story) are just delightful.La La Land is also one of the best made movies of the year. It takes several cues from Martin Scorsese as many of the scenes, especially the musical sequences, are done with long takes. This made me realize just how too often modern-musicals rely on editing to make the shooting easier. La La Land shows the hard work the actors went through to make each step and tap flawless. When editing is present, it pays homage to movies of the 1950s. How does it do that? I really don't want to give anything away.I'll give this ten old Hollywood murals out of ten. If 2016 has brought down your spirits, then La La Land will bring them back up. I highly recommend this to everyone! This is a fantastic work of art that justifies much of the hidden history and beauty our world holds to us. Dance your way to a screening of this and sing a long if you wish.",10,4,9,31 December 2016
Woman in Gold," There's a lot of gold here; historical and acting gold in Woman in Gold
","I've never really thought about it much, as a lot of people who visit art museums, but maybe I should consider the history of art a bit more. It's not that I want to know how something was painted or who it was by (the museum description usually takes care of that), but just with how it made it's way on this particular wall. Sometimes they'll make it clear that it was a donation, purchase or that it might be on tour, but let's say you find out that a beautiful renaissance painting was stolen from someone years ago. Something that would make me question not just the value of the work, but with the practices and standards of the museum that collected it. A story like Woman in Gold relies an interesting tale of getting back not just any art, but a piece of work that's so valuable that no one would want it to leave their country. This may be a story about art, but it's also another story about the travesty of the actions of the Nazis and how their actions are still being foxed in today's time. In that case, Woman in Gold may be more important then we may realize.An elderly Maria Altmann (played by Helen Mirren) is living in Los Angeles when her past comes back in the form of some letters written by her recently deceased sister. Her sister tried to make a case to get back some artwork that was taken from the Nazis during their rise in Germany. Through flashbacks, we find that Maria came from a wealthy Austrian Jewish family that had lost most of their property during the persecution, and that while Maria and her husband were able to escape, her parents were unfortunate victims and dies in a Death Camp.Through a friend, she hires Randol Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds), a lawyer who has no experience within the law of art, to help her get back her families most loved portrait, 'Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I'. The big problem though is that the country of Austria regards this as one their 'Mona Lisa' and will do anything to make sure that they don't lose it. Maria and Randol fly to Vienna and after meeting with a reporter Hubertus Czernin (played by Daniel Brühl), they begin their big case to retrieve back what's rightfully theirs. With it's focus on a WWII story and that our hero of the movie is elderly, it's obvious that it's target audience is not the same as one that's going to watch a summer blockbuster. So rather then to put any large stars in here, Woman in Gold only cast a few well knowns and embraces it's more play-like feel then something cinematic. What I mean is that the dialogue is heavy and requires you to pay a lot of interest in art history. In the case of myself, I liked it as I do follow the world of art; maybe not as much as the movies, but I found the subject matter fascinating enough that it made me want to know more about this old lady and her wanting her families property back. Helen Mirren is great as Maria, giving us a no nonsense but likable personality that I may have seen before, but Mirren always gives good performances. As much as I rant on Ryan Reynolds, he's better suited here then he was for roles in Green Lantern and Turbo, being able to play a more quiet and reserved guy then he can cocky. Woman in Gold may not be two hours, but it does feel a little long when we get that cliché of one leaving the party even though we know their going to come back and face their fears. Had this been rewritten into something more out of the box, this would have been an academy award movie that should have been saved for the end of the year. But even had it been shorter, nothing in The Woman in Gold really says 'revolutionary', but it is likable enough to enjoy as a story.I'll give this eight portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer I out of ten. Most history fans should like this as those that are into art. I doubt I would see it again on home video, but then again, maybe I'll give it another rental",8,0,2,22 April 2015
Love & Mercy," Love & Mercy knows how to pick up good vibrations and make itself one of the best music bio stories
","The world of music has plenty examples from the classical Beethoven to the rocker Elvis Presley to the modern day Miley Cyrus from suffering from mental disorders while trying to contribute their works of art. People have asked if their work has been affected by their insanity or if their work is their insanity. It's tough to decipher as all have proved to produce tracks that people seem to enjoy and continue to buy, without understanding how much work and talent it takes to be great. What's even more unfair is that if the music is a major hit, then it's hard for them to climb out of their illness.It's kind of a sad look on how the music industry works, but it is what it is. It doesn't help that drugs have played a big part in the change of musical tastes. Just look at the sixties when guys like the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones were experimenting with heroin and LSD to find a different creative spark. When Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the latest craze, people are going to want more of the same thing. In the case of the Beach Boys, Love & Mercy shows the darker side on an artist trying to create a masterpiece while falling into insanity and trying to get out. In the late sixties, lead singer of the Beach Boys Brian Wilson (played by Paul Dano) retires from concert performing to spend more time in the studio to create an album that takes more of a artistic risk like the Beatles did. The problem is that the majority of the band would rather create more of their bubblegum tunes that their famous for, guaranteeing them more money. Brian proceeds with the Pet Sounds and Smile albums where he starts to dwell into LSD where voices start to debut in his mind.While exploring the beginning of the illness, Love & Mercy occasionally cuts forward to the late 1980's where an older Brian Wilson (played by John Cusack) is a broken version of himself who is managed and under the guardianship of his therapist, Eugene Landy (played by Paul Giamatti). Brian meets with a Cadillac saleswoman Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) who loves Brian's look at the world, but hates the way Landy seems to have total control over the singers life and the medication that's being taken. Love & Mercy could have easily been a typical rise and fall story that countless music bio movies have been before. Luckily, what's here instead is a artistically amazing look at one man's genus being taken away by an illness. Some might say that A Beautiful Mind already did this story, but not quite in this fashion. Now there's a doctor that's in control and not to mention that to be a genius in music is different then in mathematics. Both Paul Dano and John Cusack are just amazing playing the duel ages of Brian Wilson. I'm glad they didn't try to use only one star and make then younger or older. Love & Mercy also happens to be an interesting legal story about the malpractice of doctors. Without spoiling anything, we find out that Brian Wilson's career could have gotten an earlier restart had it not been a bad diagnosis. With all this going on, I will say that music still plays an essential role. One of the best scenes shows Brian working with the studio and a full orchestra trying to create Pet Sounds, showing a young genius in his happier times before his sickness. Much of that abstract sound from the Beach Boys fills in as the score of the movie and I would have not wanted any other way.I'll give this ten good vibrations out of ten. Love & Mercy is already one of the best movies of 2015 and may be a potential candidate for the awards season. This is a movie that picks up good vibrations all over the place and places each one that makes this Beach Boy story into a beautiful symphony.",10,2,5,15 June 2015
Don't Breathe," The dark of Don't Breathe helps make this a scary but fun thriller about blindness
","2016's summer seems to be a swell year for horror and thriller genre. The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, The Witch, and The Shallows found audiences that seemed to push away from the many reboots and sequels that filled the blockbuster season. A lot of that has to do with how these stories felt original, even though these kinds of stories have been told before. With the summer dealing with sharks, haunted houses, evil spirits and magic, what else could the horror genre bring? How about home invasion in reverse?The film in question may contain some similarities to David Fincher's Panic Room, but Don't Breathe has some major differences. Rather then the main character being the homeowner fighting burglars, we now have the robbers in focus trying to get away from the homeowner. Oh, and the landlord happens to be blind as well. So this movie seems to have a bit of Wait Until Dark in it as well (If you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it as a great thriller with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin). What's funny is that with a lot of those film elements, Don't Breathe happens to be a thrilling adventure, all confined in this one house with the goal of getting out.In the slums of a ghost town looking Detroit, three twenty somethings, Rocky (played by Jane Levy), Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), and Money (played by Daniel Zovatto), are robbers who only take small cash and information, thanks to Alex's connection to his father's security who seems to handle most of the local houses alarm systems. Rocky has been looking to get her little sister out their broken home and make it to California to start a new life. She may finally get that chance with their latest tip about a resident who has hundreds of thousands stashed in his home. When they get a glance at the blind guy's house, they see that he lives in an abandoned neighborhood with a mean rottweiler has his seemingly only defense. On the night they attack, their break in seems to go well, putting to the dog to sleep and finding an entrance through the basement. Just as the burglars seem to find where the money is, the blind man (played by Stephen Lang) is awaken by the noise and fights back hard. While hiding, the blind guy blocks all exits, leaving the robbers in a battle to see who can get out alive.Don't Breathe is a very exciting thriller/horror that kept my theater quiet except for the occasional scream or gasp. Director Fede Alvarez (2013's Evil Dead) and producer Sam Rami have given us an interesting perspective of sympathies and earned scares. A lot of that is all on the performers, so let get into that. Stephen Lang was probably the perfect choice for a role like this, who must be the toughest blind character I've seen in recent years. I also enjoyed the chemistry of Rocky and Alex's characters as they do their best to stay alive in a true zone of darkness. While film cannot recreate blindness well, Don't Breathe pulls of a number of tactics to do so from night vision to the use of sounds that one would hear better when they keep their eyes shut. The story may have you confused over which character you want to feel for, the script does give you enough backstory for you to make the decision. I'm also glad that the movie kept it's length short. It may seem like a bummer for those that want to be in the theater longer, Don't Breathe knows when to keep giving you scares and when to stop. It all falls into sync.I'll give this nine white canes out of ten. Don't Breathe adds to 2016's list of original movies that people will come out too. Not that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies, but I hope their at least seeing that people want more original content. Close your eyes, and experience the dark and light of Don't Breathe.",9,11,23,30 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," The look and production of Beauty and the Beast lets everyone be their guest, but this tale as old as time is better animated
","When I was helping my parents move a couple of years ago, I came across a bunch of old photos, including an old Halloween picture of me dressed as Lumière when I was five. Yes, Beauty and the Beast was that wonderful animated movie that everyone has pretty much seen. It's my all time favorite of the traditional fairy tale stories from Disney, and for good reason. The characters are perfect, the animation is perfect, the songs are perfect, and the story is perfect. It was also the first animated movie to receive a best picture nomination at the Oscars and has a long running Broadway show.It remains one of Disney's most popular and profitable movies of all time, so it made sense that they would want to return to it. Given how Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book live action remakes have done incredibly well, it seems that this tale as old as time would be eyed for that same fate. Whats difficult about adapting this story in this manner is figuring out what to expand. The other movies had a lot of areas from their stories to explore into, but how do you expand the world of Beauty and the Beast? ...let's see.Like in the animated movie, a vain prince turns away an ugly old woman from his castle, despite being warned about inner beauty. When he dismisses her again, she reveals herself an sorceress and transforms him into the Beast (played by Dan Stevens) and a curse is placed on the castle and everyone inside. Cut to twenty years later where a book obsessed young woman Belle (played by Emma Watson) makes the best of her life within her small french village. Former army captain and hunter Gaston (played by Luke Evans) eyes her as a wife, but she wants nothing to do with it. When Belles father Maurice (played by Kevin Kline) ends up locked up in the castle that he stumbled upon, Belle goes there to get him out. Though the Beast frightens her, she agrees to take her fathers place. This makes her a prisoner, but she gets a nice room. Helping them out is candlestick Lumière (played by Ewan McGregor), clock Cogsworth (played by Ian McKellen) and Teapot Mrs. Potts (played by Emma Thompson). A romance seems to bloom for Belle and the Beast, but Gaston and help from his friend Lefou (played by Josh Gad) are trying to stop it. It's amazing just how close this movie follows the original Beauty and the Beast. Unfortunately, it follows it way too close. While it's not completely shot-for-shot (like the Psycho remake), there are plenty of moments when it feels like the idea was to take many of the famous images from the animated movie and do it again. I guess I can say what's different is the look. A lot of that has to do with the fact that it's live action, but the production value is gorgeous. I'll bet a million dollars that this wins a lot of the Oscars next year for costume, makeup, and production design.How does the cast stack up? They seem to do alright. The best newcomers are Kevin Kline and Josh Gad as they seemed to be the only ones to really bring something new to their characters. The rest like Ewan McGregor, Luke Evans and Ian McKellen do fine, but the worst has to be the films main character Belle, Emma Watson. Not only is it clear that they auto tuned her voice for the songs, but she still looks too much like a girl while I had pictured Belle as a woman (Olivia Wilde would have been my choice).I'll give this five Lumière candlesticks out of ten. On it's own, it's okay to sometimes good. I can see a lot of people getting swept up in the world more then the characters. It's just that I'll always be comparing this to the superior animated movie. I see this as totally pointless, but my theater clapped at the end, so I'm sure it'll make a lot of people happy at least. Your invited to be the movie's guest, but I'll decline the next invitation.",5,2,6,22 March 2017
Sicario," Though it's look at the Mexican Drug War is gritty, Sicario feels like a lot of other political force stories I heard before
","Mexico is having a bit of an identity crisis in recent years. It may be been hidden from me when I was still a child, I still recall when I saw the 'South of the Boarder' country as a place people go to on vacation. My parents had taken several trips and I finally went on a cruise in 1997. The countryside and the beaches were beautiful, though I thought the cities looked liked the result of an outhouse taking control of a metropolis. It was sometime in middle school that I started to see the place as an almost third world that produced drugs.The Mexican Drug War has become a nightly ritual on the news as we hear more reports about the cartels bringing their business over the boarder, how they may be helping with the smuggling of illegal immigrants and how they may even have ties with the Mexican government. It is becoming a serious issue that I still think the U.S. is not taking more control on. The big concern is that with the further influx of immigrants, more drug people are making their way to the states. Emily Blunt joins a group to take on a threatening cartel in Sicario.An FBI agent Katie Macer (played by Emily Blunt) is with a group of other agents during a kidnapping raid in Arizona where they find many dead bodies in the walls and a bomb in the shed that kills two officers. Her actions lead her to be recommended to CIA agent Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) to join his team that are searching for a cartel boss that was connected to the house. She accepts, excited that she can finally make a difference on the drug war. Her first trip takes her to El Paso where they meet up with Matt's partner, Alejandro Gillick (played by Benicio Del Toro) and find out that they will be going over the boarder to Juárez to extract a prisoner. Despite a bloody gun battle with a cartel interception, they take Guillermo, one of the cartel's top men for questioning. Katie, while impressed with how much information she's getting, is shocked by the CIA's lack of concern for the citizens of Mexico. They find out of a tunnel that's been a major use for illegal immigrants and drugs. Katies also learns about Alejandro's shady past with the cartels and that the CIA is actually going after a major drug lord.Sicario is a movie that I was excited for. I knew that I was going to get a dark movie and got plenty of action, yet I felt board while watching it. The first half with Emily Blunt learning to ropes of the CIA and going into Mexico were thrilling while the second half that belonged to Benicio Del Toro and his confrontation with the drug cartel moved at such a slow pace that I almost felt like that I was in school and not watching a movie.Don't get me wrong. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro give off some good performances and I wanted to see them serve some justice, but the story felt very familiar. Part of that has to do that the film feels structured in a similar format to Zero Dark Thirty. The big difference is then ending. While Zero Dark Thirty paid off with the government's hard work, Sicario's result felt more empty and bleak, like that no matter how much you care about making a difference, the real world only proves that it's unlikely. I know that film was trying to be realistic, but I found it too unpleasant to fully recommend.I'll give this three tunnels into the U.S. out of ten. I wish I could say that Sicario was a favorite of mine like the rest of the critics, but I honestly don't see why their phrasing it as unique and original. It's just as gritty and black as a lot of other political force thrillers. I can also see Sicario getting lost within the mix, but I can understand that people may find the action satisfying and even new. I'd say that this film defiantly portrays the Mexican Drug War actually; I just didn't enjoy going in this deep.",3,3,10,13 October 2015
"McFarland, USA"," McFarland, USA benefits more from the environment and cinematography of the run rather then the characters
","If there was anything I hated more then P.E. class, it was running the track. Nowadays I probably wouldn't complain as much, but being a fifteen year old was something else. I was overweight in my youth and that made me out to be a slow kid on the track. Each morning (or afternoon in my senior year), after we change into our gear, our teacher would have us finish four laps, gaining a full mile under our feet. We weren't required to run those laps, but still, nobody wanted to walk it as they would never hear the end of the ridiculing. I did my best to jog them, but nothing would have persuaded me to do a marathon. My biggest question when running the track was simply, 'how can those guys manage to run five miles and barley crack a sweat?' Even when I pass a group while driving, I still can't understand their strength. Perhaps it's not just the training. It has to be the psychological core as well that needed to be develop. The kind of kids that participate in cross country training also tend to exceed well in academics and go on to Ivy league schools. For a lot of schools, this is probably the case, but for the team in McFarland, USA, it's a different situation. In 1987, high school football coach Jim White (played by Kevin Costner) has anger issues that cause him to job hop many times. An incident with a player getting his head cut causes the most damage to his career, leaving him with little options. He settles for a life science/coaching job in the Latino town of McFarland, CA. Most of the residents either own farms or work on those farms, with many of the high school kids working as fruit pickers in the morning and day. White, his wife Cheryl (played by Maria Bello) and two daughters have a hard time fitting into the intimidating community while Jim tries, but can't seem to help the schools really bad football team. While coaching P.E., he notices that the boys are very fast runners, with a young man Thomas Valles clocking in at twelve miles an hour. White decides that the boys are right for cross-country running, despite that the school doesn't have a team. The principal approves and White learns more about the sport while teaching these kids about good ethics and how they can achieve in anythingyour typical sports stuff. On paper, McFarland, USA sounds like every other sports story and it does follow the formula pretty safely. You've got your bad boys that are likely going to learn their lessons, the coach that will change himself and the kids, and the town is going to laugh at the crazy idea until it works. This movie has all of that, yet I still recommend this.What won me over firsthand is the sport being shown, cross-country running. It's repetitive to watch, but the film plays it's California environment to its advantage and the running actually looks good with the hills and farms that each competition is running around.McFarland, the small town in question, reveals to have a lot of personality. We learn very early on that the folk here are resilient, but can come together to show homeliness. The cinematography has fallen in love for this place as the movie looks beautiful. The kids aren't as well developed, and the film could have been more moving had it been from their perspective, but Costner does well in his spot as coach Jim White. I'll give this seven running shoes out of ten. There's little new here in terms of sport movies, but McFarland, USA has a lot of charm and gumption to prove otherwise. It's not for those that are tired of the sports movie cliché, but the rest might be surprised.",7,4,19,23 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an awesome mix of goofy fun and emotion in this great sequel
","I'll admit that the Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014 was and still is one of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in years. Director James Gunn took a big gamble on adapting a Marvel comic that few people knew about, and made a movie that could only be described as 'fun'. Like a lot of the best comedies, Guardians of the Galaxy seem to be an accidental masterpiece where each actor was casted correctly and that their delivery of a good script was spot on. The movie represents the kind of space opera that gave me a spectacle that I had not seen sense Star Wars (yes, even over the new ones).As much as I've wanted to see a sequel, I also couldn't shake the feeling that it was going to suffer the curse that Marvel has on their subsequent follow-ups (except Captain America). Neither Iron Man, Thor and even The Avengers could outdo the originals. A lot of that has to do with the fact that while the situations become larger, the characters don't evolve. A sequel needs to bring the character into a new area that will help them grow as people. Let's see if Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 can do so for our space heroes. Since the events of the last movie, Peter 'Star Lord' Quill (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (played by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Bautista) and Baby Groot (played by Vin Diesel) have become something of a renegade-for-hire team whenever needed. They defeat an inter dimensional monster for the Sovereign race of gold people in exchange for Gamora's half sister Nebula. Things go well until they leave and Rocket reveals that he took some valuable batteries from the people. A drone army attempts to destroy the Guardians but an unknown ship fends them off and leads them to a planet.While the crew examines the damage to their ship, the person that helped them reveals himself to be Peter's father, Ego (played by Kurt Russell). He talks about how he's been searching for his son when he was never returned. Ego takes Peter, Gamora and Drax to his heaven-like world while Rocket and Groot fix the ship and guard Nebula. Meanwhile, the gold people hire Yondu (played by Michael Rooker) to catch the Guardians in retaliation from before. Though Peter is overjoyed to finally find his father, Gamora gets an uncertain feeling about the world, but can't quite put her finger on it. I can say that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues it's goofy, space fun while giving us an emotional connection with our heroes. The movie has it's fair share of battles and fights (this is the kind of movie where we see Pac-Man and an arrow kill hundreds of people), this is a sequel that does the job of taking our heroes to the next emotional step. Each one goes through an arc, though the majority of the story is on Peter and his father/son relationships with Ego and Yondu. What might disappoint some fans of the last movie is that the story is almost set on Ego's planet. The action does feel larger, so the movie has the distinction being both bigger and smaller then before. Some people may see that as a rip off, though I felt the jokes and story kept things interesting. If anything, the biggest problem is the final battle which does go on a little too long. Perhaps if they cut ten minutes, you may have a perfect sequel on par with The Empire Strikes Back or Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even the ending seems to be a nod to Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn. I'll give this nine Sony Walkman cassette players out of ten. Guardian fans should get plenty to digest with this sequel. It's a fun time at the movies and recommend that you catch it on the big screen. Kids and adults should be walking out of the theater with the same fun spirit that Starlord has. This sequel is an awesome mix.",9,2,5,12 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Part Cold War and part Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Shape of Water is a beautiful adult fairy tale
","Today's movie deals with a love between a human and a monster. Many should immediately shout, 'Beauty and the Beast!', as that's the most well known fairy tale of that same kind of love. When you come down to it, it's seen as bizarre, considering that it's practically two different species that have declared a love between each other. It's a connection that falls off the radar, but you could argue we have connections to a lot of things that are not human. Children love their electronic video games. Pet owners love their dogs. What's different is that those connections are not romantic, but rather mutual. Cinematically, we've gotten a lot more love stories between creatures then we realize. Shrek had an ogre in love with a human. Splash had a man in love with a mermaid. But the biggest example, oddly enough, are monster movies (more specifically, the universal monster classics). Dracula, The Mummy, and even the Phantom of the Opera pushed the boundaries of the connection that love is. The biggest example, though touched lightly, was The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Though I can't say it's a full remake, The Shape of Water seems to tell a story about a gill man who makes that connection with a human woman. It's the early 1960s. Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives a quiet life, working as a janitor for a government research facility in Baltimore. Her two friends consist of neighbor Giles (played by Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay man who teaches her about old music and film, and coworker Zelda (played by Octavia Spencer) who is also her sign language interpreter for their employer. Her life is changed when colonel Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) brings in a creature he captured in South America.When Elisa comes to clean the room the 'asset' is, she sees that it's a gill man. She starts to bring it food and even music to show that she means no harm. Slowly, the two become friends as they connect without ever speaking (considering that Eliza is mute and the gill man can't speak). Things look bleak as Strickland, obsessed with the cold war, want's the creature dissected and studied for the space race. At the same time, Soviet spies want the creature destroyed so the U.S. can't get ahead. The race is on to see if Eliza can outwit both sides of the war for her love. While there does seem to be similarities to Creature from the Black Lagoon, I can assure your that The Shape of Water is not only a different film, but a pretty good one to beheld. It's strengths lie within it's story and cast. Despite being very cold war orientated, this story has a fairy tale quality to it. It's director Guillermo del Toro directed a similar project called Pan's Labyrinth, but the goals were similar; to bring tales of beauty and hope within dark times. The Shape of Water is a love story first, and while I won't spoil anything, I can guarantee that I really wanted to see our two characters live together. You really feel for Eliza (who Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as playing), who is figuratively and literally a silent character waiting for her moment to present her voice. That all comes within the gill creature, whose effects are not only amazing (an example at how practical and CGI can work together), but you get a lot of personality from him. He's shy, but open to trying new things. He's a lot like a powerful child who is learning about the human world. These two do make a great couple.Even the cold war elements are really good. The film smartly presents both sides as wrong...yet with people that do want to see good come out. This is also a secret I'll let the film reveal, but it makes me realize how black and white many modern movies about Soviets usually are.I'll say now that The Shape of Water also happens to be a sexual story. I can see a lot of people turned off by this and simply too weird of a love story, but the movie makes it palatable enough that people should see through it's inner beauty.I'll give this nine gill men out of ten. It's definitely a well written, well acted, well designed, and well directed. Fans of Guillermo del Toro, monster stories, and fantasy will like this. Will mainstream audiences get into it? It's hard to tell, but if people can love a beast from Beauty and the Beast, I don't see why they can't also love this gill man. Go see it, and find out if this story of silent beauty floats.",9,80,171,29 December 2017
American Made," American Made has a nostalgic tone and along with it's comedic storytelling, make it a fun drug smuggling movie
","You have to admire the people that will do anything to provide for their family. There are those that work the long hours and ones who steal to feed their starving ones. I understand one has to do something in order to be sure that you kids can sleep soundly knowing they'll have breakfast in the morning, but if someone is breaking the law or getting involved with the wrong people, is it still about the family or does it become a selfish need? A lot of that depends on what it is your providing. I guess that line should be drawn if you know there's a chance that your own choices can get the people close to you hurt. Today's movie focuses on a real person who originally went to work for one thing, only to end up with more from the other side. It may have meant a bigger home, more cash, and a happier wife, but like a lot of darker stories involving a crime family, eventually gets too over their own heads. What makes these stories fascinating is how much is explored of their personality that gives them the impression that this is okay. Let's see how American Made can do with this.In 1978, airline pilot Barry Seal (played by Tom Cruise) is put into contact with the CIA through agent Monty Schafer (played by Domhnall Gleeson). Seal is asked to fly missions over Central America to take pictures of rebels and possible Soviet guerrillas. He accepts, and is given a fast plane with cameras. Though he ends up getting shot at half of the time, Seal is a good enough pilot to fly there and back. During one of his flights, he's taken by a Colombian cartel who offers him big cash to smuggle cocaine to the states. The greed gets the best of him and he accepts.When the DEA starts to track him, the CIA moves Seal and his family to Arkansas, giving him a home along with a airport and two thousand acres. As the years go into the eighties, he ends up doing more such as exchanging information with rebels and even flying some of them to the states for military training. This gives Seal so much money that even the banks are running out of space to put it. How long will the CIA continue to turn the other cheek as Seal continues his mission? I will not dare reveal that.Though I've seen drug smuggling stories before (I'm not even a big fan of them), American Made is not only very funny and informative, it's actually a smart parody of the 1980's obsession with materialism and Yuppie lifestyles. The film is shot a lot like a documentary, which gives it an edge to sell this guys story, which sounds like a Hollywood story (though it seems to insane to be made up). Intercut is a lot of explanation with ties to the White House and how this even connects to the Cold War and Gulf War. Typically, Tom Cruise is the kind of actor who is rarely playing a part, and lets his charisma become the character. American Made doesn't slip him into a role, but he seems perfect anyway as this kind of guy would have to be a Tom Cruise-type. As a matter of fact, I liked a good chunk of these actors like his wife, the cartel leaders and the CIA agent. They all sync in line with Tom Cruise and the comedy that this story entitles. I'll say though that as interesting as the story is, it suffers a lot of the same issue that I have with stories of people on top that eventually fall; them enjoying the riches. Had the movie cut at least fifteen minutes, this might have been one of my favorites of the year, but a lot of the movie is Tom Cruise using his money to build his home and the Arkansas townand that's it. It doesn't show many of the characters questioning him (though it does get a subplot going that continues the film's story) nor does it even show his character devolving. Despite the pacing, I can say that I still had fun with this.I'll give this seven beta cameras out of five. American Made feels like a documentary from the eighties that was just found now. It has a nostalgic feeling, but is cinematic enough to feel a bit timeless. Tom Cruise fans and history fans should have a good time with this.",7,3,8,30 September 2017
The Witch," Understandably slow and with a total feeling of creepiness, The Witch embodies everything scary about an unknown world
","Today's movie The Witch finally addresses two things that aren't just scary, but terrifying; historical prejudices and a trapped location. The early seventeenth century marks the earliest of American history, not too long after the pilgrims made a home for themselves in the New World. With a land that was mostly unknown and passage back to Europe taking weeks, that's a great example of a location where you have no choice but to face it head on. Even without the possibilities of something supernatural, there's still animals and Native American attacks that could prove forceful and frightening.At the time, the pilgrims left England as they felt the religious standards were too lose and wanted to practice without ridicule. The last thing you want is to be stuck with pilgrims as their moral beliefs steam from the ideal that if someone is acting out of the ordinary, then they must have made a pact with Satan. This would even lead into the famous Salem Witch trials that persecuted several people that were have thought to have practiced witchcraft. While this film is set decades before those trials took place, The Witch paints a scary picture that would make any fundamentalist into a pilgrim. Within the early days of the New World, William (played by Ralph Ineson) is even more religious then his fellow pilgrims, deciding that he and his family need to leave the plantation and search for their own home. He settles on this parch of land where he builds a farm and try to make a life for his wife Katherine (played by Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), eldest son Caleb, twins Mercy and Jonas, and baby Samuel. Things get creepy right away when Samuel is taken while playing a game of peek-a-boo with Thomasin.Katharine spends her days crying to god while Caleb and William do their best to hunt to feed their family. Thomasin overhears that her parents want to send her to another family now that she's approaching womanhood. This put more tension within the family as crops are failing and are not even sure they will have enough food during the upcoming winter. Caleb then goes missing during a hunting outing with Thomasin's twin sibling accusing her of being a witch. When Caleb is found close to death, more eyes from the family blame Thomasin for the bad things happening, despite her innocence.The Witch is film that scared me more then half of the horror movies I've seen in the past three years. A lot of it has to do with the setting as the entire story feels unsettling. The dark imagery of the forest, the farm and even a simple dinner feel threatening as if there is no escape from any danger. Anya Taylor-Joy is a total breakout as she represents the last of innocence that any girl would have, regardless of that time period or now, within this circumstance. She carries the movie well enough that we wanted to see whether she'd escape.The story manages to remain more layered then it needs to be. With little explanation on what the monster is here. The filmmaker understands that the scariest ideas may not be the unseen force, but rather the people that start to look at you at the first sign on trouble. I would love to watch this again, though subtitles would be a welcome addition. Everyone talks in an older, Middle-English tone that makes the setting more alien, though a little hard to understand. Slasher fans may find this too slow, but it freaked me out.I'll give this ten black goats out of ten. The Witch is everything I want in more horror movies; a total feeling of creepiness, a defenseless set of people, and a unique setting. I'm sure that more horror writers will take inspiration from this.",10,6,12,22 February 2016
Jersey Boys," My eyes adored for this musical, so walk like a man and see how fun Jersey Boys is.
","I'll tell you a high school story from only a few years ago (okay, more like eight, but why count?); In an American history class in the eleventh grade, I had a teacher who wanted put as little pressure on his students as possible, even though he had everyone stand in military fashion, being a Vietnam veteran himself. So almost every morning before the bell would ring, he always had his favorite group playing on his stereo. This is where I was first introduced to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Sure, I heard 'Walk Like a Man' play in my dad's car every now and then, but my teacher really liked these guys. He always had a new song playing to gives us something to snap to and even told us a little about the band. There's not a memory that flashes by with that class without a Four Seasons song playing in the background. I too fell into the music of this group. They may not be a timeless band, but their sound is so unique that it's impossible not to identify them. Clint Eastwood decided to take a stab not just at the biopic genre, but also the musical genre with his latest, Jersey Boys.Like most musical movies these days, this is based off of the popular Broadway musical of the same name, yet I have not had the privilege to see it yet. But I can guess that it follows it well. Fittingly enough, our story starts in the early fifties where Tommy DeVito (played by Vincent Piazza) speaks to the audience about how growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey is tough and only the roughest can survive. Rough is being kind to this young man as Tommy has a bad habit of getting himself sent to jail many times. He also has some musical talent as he, a friend Nick Massi and young Frankie Valli (played by John Lloyd Young) like to perform as a trio.They all have dreams to take their voice to bigger places and manages to get a forth guy, Bob Gaudio so that they can get work. It starts with them being backup singers, but eventual hits like 'Sherry', 'Big Girls Don't Cry', and 'Walk Like a Man' make them one of the biggest groups of all time. Besides giving plenty of chances for the group to serenade us with many of their hits, we get insights on the band members lives from Frankie Valli's daughter running away to Tommy's further troubles with debts and mobs.The Broadway show's gimmick was that you were watching four actors become the Four Seasons and enjoy their songs while the historical stuff is more of a side event. Making a movie out of this isn't difficult, but changes had to be made to make the material more interesting. With Clint Eastwood in the director's chair, the historical stuff has been expanded upon, taking more focus then the songs themselves.It's a big gamble, considering that the men playing the Four Seasons are the same actors from the stage show. The good news is that all of these guys are good film actors. This is something I would like to see from more big budgeted affairs, but because they're using really good unknowns, I only saw a young Frankie Valli and a young Tommy DeVito, rather then impersonators. In fact, the only big name is this movie is Christopher Walken as a mobster, but he even settles into his role fine, without giving in to his unusual mannerisms. The songs themselves are a lot of fun to listen to and are staged really well. Some of them are being sung in a recording room, some of them are simply heard on the radio, and my favorite moment was watching them perform on a recreated Ed Sullivan show that just seems too genuine to be a film production. If I had any problem here, it's with the expanded behind the scenes material with the Four Seasons. While its not really bad, it can come off as really formulaic and almost made-for-TV like in quality. I think it's simply because I enjoyed the songs and recreations so much that the rest of the bands troubles just aren't as interesting. They could have cut some of it out. In fact, I usually fault musicals for having one too many songs, but I think Jersey Boys didn't have enough. There are a lot of songs here, but couldn't there have been a scene of Frankie Valli singing, 'Grease' or something.I'll give this eight Broadway Jersey Boys posters out of ten. In the end, if your going to see this movie, chances are you seeing this for the performances of the songs and not for the story behind the band. I can see this being a problem for people who want something meatier, but I had fun. Just simply tell yourself to have one of those 'Oh, What a Night' nights and enjoy the Four Seasons.",8,13,21,22 June 2014
Steve Jobs," Like the beautifully designed Apple products, Steve Jobs is a fascinating look into the man behind the Macs.
","Today is the greatest day as we have the advantage of having computers within the hands of anyone. This was the ideology of the late Apple creator, Steve Jobs. It was the goal of Jobs to take the technology of computers, a type of machine that only a few people knew how to work, and find a way to give it to the people. He was smart in realizing the true potential of the electronic machine and what people would do with it. He saw as the modern canvas that could turn the everyday Joe into an artist. To quote him again, 'It's not about putting it in the right hands, but in everybody's hands'.We already had an independently produced story with Jobs (which I got to play a small part) that most people found too standard in biography stories and not up to the high quality of the real Steve Jobs and Apple. What was really desired was an adaptation of the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs. I agree that it's a fantastic book, but the book required a unique look at the man behind Apple. Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours) plugged in for his crack at the original Apple genius in Steve Jobs. Rather then to adapt the entire life story (I don't even know if that's doable in film format), the movie takes a perspective by exploring three different product launches. We first begin in 1984 where after the successful '1984' ad had caught a lot of attention, Steve Jobs (played by Michael Fassbender) is trying to make sure that the launch of the Macintosh goes smoothly. Besides getting his fellow engineer Andy Hertzfeld (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), he's also juggling the decisions of the old Apple 2 computer of fellow Apple creator Steve Wozniak (played by Seth Rogan), the newly hired CEO John Sculley (played by Jeff Daniels) and his relationship with an ex-girlfriend and their daughter Lisa.While all these people seem to have a hard time getting through the stubborn 'conductor of computer engineers', marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (played by Kate Winslet) is the only one that's willing to challenge Jobs on his choices and behavior. She's the one who tries to get through to him on treating his friends better and to acknowledge his daughter. We also explore Steve Jobs at the unavailing of his NeXT computer in 1988 and of the iMac in 1998. As I mentioned before, Steve Jobs had to go further then the typical biography. Only focusing his story on three events might seem like a major gamble, but the script of Aaron Sorkin allows you to really get to know the Apple genius. Danny Boyle seemed to have never been afraid to portray him as arrogant and pretentious. Steve Jobs is a fine example of a character study where you, the audience is suppose to decide on whether he was a good man. It's structure allows for several layers to unfold. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Boyle took a lot of inspiration from Citizen Kane.Honestly, the casting is near perfect. Michael Fassbender was someone that I'd thought would stick out, but he looses himself within Steve Jobs and there were times I forgot I was watching a movie. Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg are all casted perfectly within their roles as well, though the one really tying them all is Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman. What may surprise most people is that Steve Jobs feels like a small movie as most of the film takes place within theaters on the product launches. It honestly feels like an excellent play that I'm sure will get it's own adaptation in some form.I'll give this ten Macintoshes' out of ten. Some people are builders and some are idea people. Steve Jobs was an idea guy that knew how to lead. Even if his attitude was questionable, I'm sure you'll draw your own conclusions on how far one goes to change the world. Steve Jobs is like an awesome Apple product that everyone should touch at one point.",10,1,4,29 January 2016
Sausage Party," Sausage Party has it's delicious moments, even if the crass novelty becomes repetitive
","Animation has the ability to give live to things that we previously would have never considered. Disney and Pixar in particular have brought cars, toys, rats, bugs, fish, and robots a humanized life and a study on what their purpose is, now with thoughts and feelings. There's a magic within that, so it's not uncommon for other things we could explore to see what their perspective of the world would be like. For toys in Toy Story, it's a joy land of children and imagination, but with a dark side of childhood eventually ending. For bugs in A Bugs Life, it's more of a survival of the fittest as their several kinds of insects out there. How about food?Today's movie shows that food may have the worst when it comes to their purpose. Writer and actor Seth Rogan not only wanted to explore what that world of humanized food would be like, but to do in his adult context. R rated animated movies are a rarity, but it's nice to see a studio like Sony take a chance on a risk. You could even argue that because adult cartoons are more popular on television now, R rated animated films could have a bigger opportunity. Let's see if Sausage Party invoke more adult animated stories. In a market called 'Shopwells', each morning opens with the food signing (it's made clear in the beginning that people cannot see them move or talk) about their desire to be chosen by the 'gods' to be taken out of the store into the 'Great Beyond'. One area with all the forth of July food, contains sausages and buns. One sausage, Frank (played by Seth Rogan), along with Carl (played by Jonah Hill) and Barry (played by Michael Cera) are hoping to be chosen with a set of buns next to them, which contains Frank's girlfriend, Brenda (played by Kristen Wiig).When a jar of honey mustard commits suicide, this causes the shopping cart where the sausages and buns were chosen to collapse. This causes Frank and Brenda to slip out of their packaging, leaving them behind in the store while everyone else goes to the 'Great Beyond'. Frank and Brenda are told to go to a set of imperishable foods to learn the truth about their existence. Along the way, they encounter a taco lesbian Teresa (played by Selma Hayek), a Jewish bagel Sammy Bagel Jr (played by Edward Nortin) and bottle of Liquor Firewater (played by Bill Hader).I cannot stress enough of how important it is to understand that Sausage Party is not for children. I'm twenty-nine and I'm not old enough for this. I'm not even sure if my parents are old enough for this. There is so much swearing, violence, and sexual content (including a three minute food orgy somewhere), that Sausage Party has earned it's R rating and them some. Within all the crass is a well-written script that is sort of an analogy to real life religion. While I wouldn't call this movie an atheist story, I can understand that many people would be turned off.I can defiantly say it's a smart script, though I'll admit that the constant crass does wear off after a while. It's funny, but when your dialogue is almost nothing but swears, it makes for a repetitive attitude that I doubt the film is aware of. Story wise, it does feel a little stretched (and this is an eighty minute movie). Part of me thinks this might have worked better as an hour long special on Netflix, but you can still tell by the number of comedians in this along with some great animation that Sausage Party has it's moments.I'll give this five hot dog sausages out of ten. Sausage Party is an acquired taste movie, and though I might watch it once more, I can see a lot of people playing this at parties. Speaking of which, Sausage Party is an ADULT PARTY ONLY. LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME!",5,3,11,15 August 2016
Joker," As a cautionary tale on mental health, Joker's take on the clown prince of crime is great
","In the dark and crime ridden streets of Gotham, Batman may be fighting for justice, but the Joker is waging his own war. The way he sees it, the Joker considers himself the hero of his story; a world that is naturally prone to violence and chaos and he's the only one who finds the joke of it. Also unlike Batman who dresses in black to use the darkness to his advantage, the Joker is bright and colorful to not only be seen, but to be the star of his crime show. This is what makes the dynamic of these two the ultimate hero versus villain setup.Most people know Batman's story of his parents slain which makes him want to stop others from having the same tragic events, but what about the Joker? When you really think about it, the movies have not tackled the backstory of the clown prince of crime. Batman and The Dark Knight certainly gives you an idea of their psychopathic characters, but not their roots. The closest we got was The Killing Joke graphic novel, which is still a critically phrased story. With Joker, we now see if film can deliver a worthy background.In the early eighties in Gotham, a lonely man Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is trying his hardest to 'bring joy and laughter to the people of Gotham' by working as a clown for hire and aspires to be a stand up comedian. He also suffers a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at random moments. Though he's told to 'put on a happy face' by his mother Penny (played by Frances Conroy), the city's high crime and decay from graffiti and rats only make things worse for him. In fact, he finds that due to budget cuts, he won't be able to get any more medication to treat his problems.While dressed as a clown, he gets into an incident where three people that work for Thomas Wayne get killed, several people in Gotham see him as a symbol to go after the wealthy establishment. Since nobody knows it was Arthur, he carries on with his standup. A botched performance ends up on the TV show of Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro), who invites the latter to explain. As the city seems to be hitting a boiling point of anger, combined with more problems for Arthur, he starts to realize just what kind of clown he is.Joker is inspired by a lot of Martin Scorsese movies like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. While I don't know if it reaches the same heights, I still enjoyed Joker a lot...or as much as you can get out of this kind of story. The first half of the movie really stands on it's own about a guy whose already broken and is getting worse by a world that doesn't seem to be listening. Despite some reports, I don't think were supposed to sympathize with this guy, even though we do see everything that happens to him, and can imagine why a guy like this would end up doing the things he does.It works well thanks to Joaquin Phoenix who pulls off one of his great performances. A lot like De Niro in The King of Comedy, he starts off as a bit off, but not dangerous until he's pushed to his limit. But as I said, the movie does have him as the main character, but not one your supposed to side with. His evil deeds have merit within his mind and you understand why, especially after his scenes with his mother, other clowns, Thomas Wayne, and even De Niro.The first half before he transforms is phenomenal. The second half is where things start to slip. It's not because it isn't good, but the tone does start to shift back into comic book territory. A lot of it comes when it makes it's connections to the Wayne family that the movie didn't need. It's easy to ignore a large chunk of that as the final movie was still satisfying. If I had any other problems, it would be that there are several spots where things could have ended upon. I won't spoil it, but get ready to think that the movie is going to end only to go on another ten minutes.I'll give this eight clown noses out of ten. In terms of it's story, Joker does make for a good psychological look at the famous Batman villain.",8,1,1,7 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," With great action and a good sense of humor, Edge of Tomorrow is that surprise of the summer that needs to be seen!
","I love the creativity of what alien invasions can do, but a lot of movies tend to go with the same formula; we'll get a signal from space that turns out to be extraterrestrial life, they'll come to our planet and kill us to either take the Earth or take a resource. Just stroll through your library in the science fiction section to see just how unique something from Ray Bradbury and Lovecraft can be. When Hollywood tries it's hand at alien invasions, their more out to make a disaster movie then they are science fiction. It's easy to understand why as disaster movies are more likely to make money. Even the marketing of the recent Godzilla was mostly disaster influenced. There's an understanding why we don't get a lot of movies that try some crazy science fiction material; the audience of film is different then of books and comics. Reader tend to pay more attention to the detail that's transcribed to them while watchers have shorter attention spans that needs the visual storytelling to engage them. Movies like Aliens and Avatar were hits because the visual imagery were enough of a sale to persuade a non sci-fi audiences. Material like Edge of Tomorrow has to combine it's complicated ideas with captivating imagery to tell an awesome alien invasion/time travel story. In the near future, mankind has been fighting off a creature called the mimic for over five years, preventing it from escaping Europe. Every army has taken occupation in London to make it's latest attack successful thanks to new exoskeleton tech called jackets. Major William Cage (played by Tom Cruise), a high-ranking officer for the US military finds that he's been summoned to cover the combat of the big D-day attack on the mimics in a few days. He tries to decline but he is arrested and knocked out, only to find himself stripped of his rank and about to deploy the next morning with other recruits, under the command of Master Sergeant Farell (played by Bill Paxton).To his horror, the mimics were anticipating the attack and have the edge. He manages to kill an alpha mimic, but dies when it's blood comes in contact with his face. He wakes up back where he started, arrested and told to fight on the beaches the next day. Cage finds he's stuck in a time loop, having to relieve the same battle over again. When he manages to prove to Sergeant Rita Vrataski (played by Emily Blunt), she tells him to find her again and again. Each loop gives Cage and Vrataski more time to prepare and find the Omega, the central nervous system that's causing the time loop and the heart of the mimic, and destroy it.Every summer has that movie that turns out to be the unexpected surprise that's glanced over. Edge of Tomorrow is that movie. The seemingly complex story never gets that hard to figure out as the scenario is explained in great detail, not to mention allows itself to throw in some good jokes that were missing from the Tom Cruise movie from last year, Oblivion. As is, Tom Cruise does well here, giving the likable performance that an action hero has. But despite his stardom, this movie belongs to Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. Blunt really shows off how much of a badass she can be, really reminding me of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Bill Paxton seems to have a lot of fun, channeling the drill sergeant stereotype and also throwing some good dialogue about war being Tom Cruises destiny. If there's anything else to note, is the design of the mimics. I'll admit that this is as alien to me as these creatures are to the military. They move really fast and seem to have a metallic-tentacle structure that ensures quick kills and fast reflexes. The CGI really works to the aliens advantage, but never becomes a distraction from the real military actions of Cruise and Blunt.I'll give this nine mimics out of ten. Edge of Tomorrow may have been a tough sale here in the States, but I'm sure it's going to be a hit in the foreign markets. Science fiction movies like this deserve recognition, not just with the kind of aliens it has, but with the story and how it uses time travel.",9,1,3,9 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Acha-entertaining, but Pitch Perfect 2's story is very acha-familiar
","Singing is only for the brave! As a drama kid in high school, it was clear that if you were at least a passable singer, then you were one of the cool kids of the group. I myself was not talented enough to achieve the high notes of something like Donny Osmond, but I knew of several kids who voices were so good, that I had hoped that I might see them signing along side a big celebrity or at least move up to a high level on American Idol or The Voice. Besides simply singing, the cool kids were able to a capella sing in unison.Now seems to be the high point of a capella singers with the sleeper hit Pitch Perfect. Ever since that movie came out, almost every teenager, boy or girl, seems to go nuts for that movies or anything related to a capella song related (like the current hit band Pentatonix). While I agree that the movie was fun to watch, I just never thought it was the comedic masterpiece that everyone says it was. It had some good performances, though the story was predictable in my book. Pitch Perfect 2 now has the chance to redeem itself with a second outing with the bella singers.It has been 3 years since the girls had won the national competition from the last movie and most of the women including Beca (played by Anna Kendrick), Chloe (played by Brittney Snow) and Fat Amy (played by Rebel Wilson) are both juggling being seniors in college and going on their national tours as the acclaimed group. During one concert with president Obama in attendance, Fat Amy has a wardrobe malfunction that humiliates and disgraces the group, ruling them suspended from competing in the national competition again. Chloe rounds up the girls to move on to the international competition to restore their status as the best. As told from a capella experts Gail (played by Elizabeth Banks) and John Smith (played by John Michael Higgins), no one has ever been able to beat the German team, Das Sound Machine. The team seems so focused on winning the contest that they don't know that Beca has taken an internship with a record label, hoping to push her career aspirations forward. This causes a revelation that none of the girls seem ready to move on from college and away from their close group of friends. With the new addition of freshman Emily Junk (played by Haliee Steinfeld), the Bellas will need to find their voice again and figure what's important after college.Pitch Perfect 2 has a lot of the same humor from the first movie; maybe not all great jokes but enough to get a couple of laughs out of me. This movie also borrows a lot of plot elements from the first movie; a mistake that causes the team to be humiliated, a leader whose too focuses on winning rather then the groups own singing and learning the value of friendship.In a way, I felt like that I was watching the first movie again, though I guess it is different enough that it will please fans of the original. Fat Amy is still a character favorite of mine and the singing is still entertaining. I'm guessing that despite the fact that it ends with the Bellas graduating, this won't be the end. I'll bet a million dollars that Pitch Perfect 3 or Pitch Perfect: The Next Generation will continue the same story but at least contain different song sequences that make the franchise a popular one. I'll give this six microphones out of ten. I liked this as much as I liked the first, which I still only see as okay movies. I doubt my opinion will change it's hardcore fan base, so take it for what it is and enjoy the voices.",6,2,11,21 May 2015
Whiplash," The rhythm and beat of Whiplash only got more intense as the film continued
","As a part time actor, I understand how competitive the world of creative arts is. The biggest and most fulfilling goal is to find something we love doing and being able to make money doing so. Some have a passion for the office life, but plenty others would rather do something creative. Who wouldn't like to make a living by singing and dancing? The problem here is that there are more untalented then there are prepared. It's not just that they come to make it, but it's that they stay without an epiphany that would send them home. The new goal is to show why you're better then the bunch.So that's when we turn to education to not only improve our abilities, but hope that some connection or showcase might give us something once we've finished. There's no guarantee, but the ones that work hard are likely find something to do. But to make it to the end, we have to prove to our teachers that were capable of handling the workload and pressure. The biggest question we face is why we need to prove our peers? There teaching because there not performing, so are they even the right people to prove? I guess it depends on the teacher, but the question gets bigger when we consider Whiplash.Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller) is an aspiring jazz drummer who is in his freshman year at the Shaffer Conservatory, the best music program in the country. He strives to be one of the greats and hopes to catch the attention of the schools infamous conductor, Terrence Fletcher (played by J. K. Simmons). Neiman knows of Fletchers reputation as a tough educator, but still aspires to be noticed as he continues to practice and juggle a new girlfriend.A surprise in-class audition finally gets Neiman a spot on Fletchers orchestra. At first, Fletchers seems calm and encouraging to the young man, telling him that everything will be fine. But once Fletchers anger is revealed and a chair is flung, Neiman breaks down in the middle of class, never having dealt with someone as intense as this conductor is. At this point, he knows that he has to impress him mentor, so he makes the decision to break off his relationship and all social life to focus on drumming. He gains bloody knuckles and blisters on his fingers, but Neiman strives to show that he has the potential to be the next great drummer.Whiplash is intense. Nope, that's not even the right word here. Whiplash goes beyond horror film intense. The lengths that our characters will go to play jazz is just surprising. This film breaks down upon the principle that practice makes perfect. Practicing helps, but does that create a genius? It seems to hint that it's all a croak and that were are either great at something or not. I can see the angle here as I'm aware of several people that read monologue daily, hoping that they'll be better actors. That helps improve their skill, but they can't be born gifted. They simply are better at it or not. This film works well because of our leads, Miles Teller and J. K. Simmons. Teller must of gone through a crazy preparation for Whiplash as they clearly show him playing these up to ten minute drum solos that would have made my own hands fall off. Perhaps the actor himself should be a real drummer. Simmons on the other hand, is the kind of teacher that no one ever wants. Sure he's passionate for creating the next great players, but you really question how far he'll go to get that out of his students. The relationship between these two is something that's never been done to this extreme between student and teacher. I'll give this ten bloody drumsticks out of ten. As I said with Nightcrawler (the same company behind that also produced Whiplash), sanity is all over the place and that just makes for a better movie. It's all very fascinating and something that everyone who wants to go into the creative arts (especially music) should see.",10,0,2,25 November 2014
It Chapter Two," It Chapter 2 makes for a good second half, even if its too long
","You know why something like the Boogey-Man and Dracula are scary for children and not so much for children? It's about perspective. When your younger, because you don't have that understanding of the world, something like monsters seems plausible and hiding in the dark. The older we get, the more we realize that there's nothing dangerous in the dark except for our imagination. By the time we hit our twenties, it seems that the monsters have disappeared in favor of real life fears like criminals, work, and even of ourselves. The Boogey-Man isn't going to have the same effect on a thirty-year old.In a way, the monster of It, Pennywise the Clown, is a representation of the childhood Boogey-Man; it makes itself into whatever children find scary, it hides in the dark and it only follows children (but it is willing to eat adults). Plus, taking the form of a clown is the best way for it to lure children into it's trap. I think this is why a lot of adults do have genuine fears of clowns. As a follow-up to the It movie of 2017, It: Chapter 2 brings the Losers club back to Derry to face Pennywise again.Instead of the late 1980s, the story moves forward to the present day where a gay man missing (no thanks to Pennywise) and the only Losers Club member Mike (played by Isaiah Mustafa) who remained in Derry, discovers that they didn't kill the clown. So he makes the call to the rest of the losers to come back and finish the job. This consists of writer Bill (Played by James McAvoy), fashion designer Beverly (played by Jessica Chastain), now skinny architect Ben (played by Jay Ryan), risk analyst Eddie (played by James Ransone) and standup comedian Richie (played by Bill Hader. The only holdout is Stanley (played by Andy Bean) who commits suicide after getting the phone call.Everyone meets up in a restaurant where Mike reveals that as the town Liberian, he's done the research to figure out how to kill Pennywise. Part of it involves them collecting items from their past, thus splitting them up to explore Derry once more. As they each go to their old stomping grounds, each has an encounter with Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgård). It's here their confronted with new fears, along with the possibility that Pennywise just may be too powerful.The original It was a fantastic horror movie that I still highly recommend. Does It: Chapter 2 serve as a good companion piece? It does, though it's not as good as the original. A lot of the first movie was the fact that the main characters will children (all of them acted very well) and that we feared for them a lot more. It's not that I don't fear for them as adults, it's just not as interesting. I'll say it still works as all the actors playing the adult counterparts are really good. Of course the knockout is still Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise who remains just as scary.As far as the story goes, it's also good. I've read the book It, and I was okay with it being split into two movies. It does allow the characters to explore their old hometown without it seeming like a rehash. They make it clear from the beginning that the losers forgot about Pennywise and their childhoods (likely a supernatural cause by the clown). It leads into a good encounter with the clown in his true form...that I wished would have been designed better. Without spoiling the look, though it's different, it's heavily reminiscent of the final creature from the miniseries. I think they could have gone further.If the film has any major faults, it's with the running time. At nearly three hours, it definitely feels a lot longer then it needs to be. A lot of scenes will drag on really for no reason then to extend it. Along with that, the pacing can feel off (the first film had this problem too) when trying to combine the comedy and the humor. It's not bad, but it can also feel repetitive in spots where they encounter monsters they've seen before.I'll give this seven Georgie boats out of ten. Despite its long running time, I was still satisfied with the end result and how this connects with the first movie. I'll be curious if they make a super edit of both movies together. It goes without saying that you need to watch the original before watching this. Otherwise, it's safe to float to the theaters.",7,2,6,6 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," It may not be as iconic as the 1933 classic, Kong Skull Island is a fun monster movie that has a roar
","It's safe to say that out of the many iconic moments in cinema (Dorothy discovering herself in a world of Technicolor in Wizard of Oz, Charles Foster Kane saying 'Rosebud' before his death in Citizen Kane and the entire finale of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), many people can recall the image of a giant gorilla attacking planes off of the Empire State Building in King Kong. Though it may sound like something out of a B movie, people tend to forget that King Kong was once the true king of the world with some of the most impressive special effects of the time. I highly recommend the documentaries about the making of the 1933 film.Aside from a couple of sequels and remakes in 1976 and 2005, there hasn't been more exploration of the world Kong lives in. Sure, we know he's a large ape, but the island that he called home had dinosaurs, giant spiders, and various monsters. That itself is a goldmine for more fantasy-like exploration. With the popularity of the American remake of Godzilla, it made sense that Warner Brothers would want to revive the eighth wonder of the world. The world is given more exploration in Kong: Skull Island.In 1973, government scientist William Randa (played by John Goodman) gets approval to lead an expedition to an uncharted island that had been blocked by bad weather. He hires a military group in Saigon called the Sky Devils, a former Vietnam helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson) for escort. He also hires a former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston) and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson). All together in a helicopter convey, they make it through the island, but are quickly brought down by a gorilla standing over a hundred feet.The survivors are split into two group with both planning on heading north to the rendezvous point where there only hope for rescue is in three days. While Randa, Packard, and some of the solders start searching for fellow crew, Conrad, Weaver and the rest of the survivors are found by a tribe of Iwi natives, but are assured by a WWII pilot whose been stuck there for thirty years Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) that they are friendly. It's discovered that Kong is worshiped as a god to protect them from the larger lizard creatures on the island. Along with those, giant spiders, and King Kong himself, its race against time to see who can make it.For a spin off about King Kong, my expectations were low. The good news is that Kong: Skull Island happens to be good monster movie. Good, but not great. Half of that has to do with the casting. While John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson have a lot of good scenes (including a subtle Jurassic Park reference), neither Tom Hiddleston nor Brie Larson are that interesting. Both actors are trying, but the script simply makes their characters empty shells of leading men and women. But lets face it, the real star of the movie happens to be Kong. Unlike Godzilla, which took a lot of time away from the monster, here we get more of the giant ape and him fighting the various creatures of Skull Island. I love his design and of how more animalistic his personality is, even more so then the 2005 remake.Though the characters aren't strong, what makes up for it is the atmosphere and tome. It's clear that a lot of influence was taken from Apocalypse Now, Jurassic Park and of course King Kong. It all meshes into a beautiful looking picture that fits right alongside the multiple Vietnam war movies. I'm not sure who was responsible for the cinematography, but they deserve a lot of accolades.I'll give this seven Kongs out of ten. While I can't see thing alongside the original King Kong in a state of icon-like phrase, it's a fun popcorn monster movie. It gives you what you want fast and manages to keep the tone going. I have to give this a lot of credit for running under two hours. With a lot of blockbusters going well over that, it's nice to see a movie that knows how long it needs to be. As long as you can accept this a blockbuster, then I'm sure you'll have some fun. Get to the theaters and see if this roars some excitement into you.",7,1,5,15 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Hobbit: Battle of the Fives Armies closes a clunky, but satisfying return to Middle Earth.
","I always hope that parents do their best to encourage their child to be an artist. All it takes is one good idea to expand into something big; something that's so masterful that the art itself becomes another world. This I refer to is Middle Earth of the Lord of the Rings books. J. R. R. Tolkien barley escaped death in WWI to start on The Hobbit, the beginning idea of something that was going to have life of it's own. The books have picked up cult status in the 1960's, but when the movies came out, the series had suddenly exploded into mainstream popularity. The fan base has grown so large, then when The Hobbit trilogy was announced, the crowd was so hyped up that they assumed that they were going to receive more then a fantasy film; they were expecting something that was going to push what we call magic on the silver screen and even offer philosophical ideas we've never considered before. When the film consensus was good to just okay, I was surprised by much people have translated the idea of okay to really bad. That's certainly not that case; it's just that no matter what any Hobbit movie would pulled off, it was not going to match The Lord of the Rings. So let's take one last descent into Middle Earth with The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies. Beginning where the last movie left off, the dragon Smaug is now flying out of the Lonely Mountain to wreck havoc on Laketown. Two dwarfs are still down there while the rest and Bilbo are back within the mountain. Local townsman Bard manages to kill the dragon by striking it in it's one weak point, making for a great opening sequence. Anyway, Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman) has found the Arkenstone, the same thing that the dwarfs have been searching for among the dragon's treasure. The leader of the dwarfs, Thorin, has succumbed to the dragon sickness of greed and flat out refuses to share the treasure or even leave the mountain. This doesn't please the Elves, including Legolas (played by Orlando Bloom), and townsfolk of Laketown looking for shelter. At the same time, Gandalf the wizard (played by Ian McKellen) manages to escape his prison to warn the others of the incoming Orc army that also wants the treasure. It'll be hard to determine who will claim the mountain, but Bilbo may have a helping hand thanks to his new ring. The Hobbit has finally ended and I think that this is that last time we'll venture into Middle Earth for a while (with Warner Brothers, of course it's never over). The road has been a bit bumpy but people seems to be satisfied enough with these movies, even if their not at good as The Lord of the Rings. Return of the King and Battle of the Five Armies are similar finales with a lot of action and plenty of goodbyes. Now which one is better?It should be a no brainer that Return of the King did it masterful, so toping it was out of the question. But Battle of the Five armies really tries. For pure popcorn entertainment, I definitely got what I wanted. The action and look of the film all pay off is some CGI environments that Maleficent should have done. The cast here also continues to prevail, weather it's Bilbo as a conflicted coward, greedy dwarf Thorin, or a no nonsense wizard Gandalf. What's interesting is that Battle of the Five Armies shares the only flaw with Return of the King; and ending that takes too long to end. At least it's not as long, so it's not too much of a complaint.I'll give this eight Arkinstones out of ten. Desolation of Smaug was my favorite of the Hobbit movies, but this closes the book nicely as well. Those that don't like fantasy will not be swayed here, but I thin few people are going to hate this story. The Hobbit will probably not be as regarded as a masterpiece adaptation, but at most an interesting series of fantasy blockbusters.",8,2,5,23 December 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Well acted and visually sound, Murder on the Orient Express is a nice mystery that should make Agatha Christie fans satisfied
","I think it's been a while since we've seen a classic murder mystery film. What's interesting is that there's thousands of books, but not too many of them get adaptations let alone into film. Why? Their not easy to write and they manage to keep a lot of detail to plot and character in order to twist and turn the final answer of 'who did it'. I can only conclude that mystery seems to have a better life on television as in that medium, those elements can not only stretch further then a films runtime, but can probably better play around the viewers ideas on what's going on. Given all of that, today's movie is a remake of Murder on the Orient Express, based off of the acclaimed novel by Agatha Christie. While I know she has written a large amount of books, her mysteries has been adapted countless times. What made Murder on the Orient Express (and what a lot of mysteries had incorporated) good was how tight and claustrophobic the situation was. It also had the luck of having Hercule Poirit, a detective with crazy attention to detail, to solve the mystery. While he hasn't had the same attention as Sherlock Holmes, he's made his stance has his journeys have filled over thirty novels. Let's see if Murder on the Orient Express can improve from the previous adaptions. In 1934, Hercule Poirot (played by Kenneth Branagh) is about to embark on a much needed break after solving a recent mystery in Jerusalem. He is still under his oath that within most cases, there is only right or wrong. In needing to return to London, he's given a spot on the Orient Express, which seems to be fully booked. He's approached by an American businessman Samuel Ratchett (played by Johnny Depp) to work for him, but Poirot declines. The next morning, Ratchett is found to have been stabbed to death. An avalanche has also derailed the steam engine, stranding the rest of the passengers. Poirot decides to take the case to curb his boredom. It's on this train he interviews all the suspects; wet nurse Pilar (played by Penélope Cruz), scientist Gerhard (played by William Defoe), the princess Dragomiroff (played by Judi Dench) accountant Hector (played by Josh Gad), Doctor Arbuthnot (played by Leslie Odom Jr.), traveler Caroline (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), and Mary (played by Daisy Ridley).I better stop there as most mysteries are best when you know as little as possible. Kenneth Branagh is also in the director's chair for Murder on the Orient Express, and for what I expected, I was surprised. I haven't seen the original, nor have I read the book, but I can say I was intrigued, even if the story is a tad overstuffed. It's common for a lot of mysteries to have a lot of characters, but given what exactly is being solved, it may have benefited to cut two or three of the background characters in order to tighten everything. Though even with the over abundance of characters, all the main actors shine, especially Kenneth Branagh, whose very likable and a fun guy to follow. His accent and tone has the right balance of over-the-top and subtle makes him seem like someone who could be that eccentric and smart. If I had to pick my other favorites, I'd say that they were Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who do a lot with the material their characters are given. That's not to put a damper on everyone else. This is compelling enough that it goes a long with the long dialogue.Now for those expecting a lot of action will want to look elsewhere. Murder on the Orient Express is very dialogue heavy, as a lot of mysteries are. Where it can make up to curb boredom is the cinematography and editing. The movie is beautiful looking and contain the element of a grand scope feeling that most Kenneth Branagh movies have. Many of the flashbacks are shown which has a neat 'old Hollywood' look to them that gives this movie a bigger sense on nostalgia. I'll give this seven Orient Express trains out of ten. I can't fully embrace this as great piece of art, but I'm glad I saw Murder on the Orient Express. The imagery looks nice enough that I'd recommend that you view it on the big screen. If your not looking for something that is a definite slow burn, this isn't for you. Take the train and see if this kills for you.",7,6,17,13 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Though it's visual gags and side characters are good, it's main characters and Toy Story-plot make The Secret Life of Pets a bad dog
","I was having dinner with my parents the other night where a plate of hamburgers suddenly disappeared. Seven beef patties vanished as we were getting other side dishes ready to go. What makes it harder to grasp is that it was in the middle of a round table, so we first tied to see where they went. Once our large Rottweiler Zoey came into the living room, we noticed that standing on her hind legs, she could have been tall enough to reach the burgers. While I have no video evidence and no one saw her, we all suspected she must have gotten to the table when we kept our eyes away while she had herself a feat.There's a funny dynamic on how much people will associate animals with thoughts that are just as human as their owners. I'd be lying if I said that I never had my dog with me if I was watching a comedy, hoping that my animal could understand the jokes I was laughing at. With today's movie, voices are given to common pets, even though we've seen plenty of talking animal movies before. The Secret Life of Pets explores the thoughts of our pets and what they do when were away.In the heart of New York in a high rise lives a young woman named Kate who cares plenty for her Jack Russell terrier, Max (played by Louis C.K.). He spends a lot of his time simply waiting for his owner to come home, but does communicate with other pets including a fat cat Chloe, a pug Mel, and a dachshund Buddy. When Katie returns, she also brings in a large Newfoundland that's named Duke (played by Eric Stonestreet). Though they are told to be brothers, Max immediately takes charge as the alpha dog to show whose boss.The next day, Both Man and Duke get separated from their building's dog walker and start wandering the streets. Not only do they loose their collars to a deranged Sphinx cat Ozone (played by Steve Coogan), but they end up being taken by dog catchers. Before the truck can get to the pound, Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit Snowball (played by Kevin Hart). Their taken underground where Snowball reveals his team of other abandoned animals who are hoping to take revenge against humans. Meanwhile, a Pomeranian dog Gidget (played by Jenny Slate) is organizing a search team to find Max and Duke before their owners get home.As a pet owner myself, I thought that this would be very good. Illumination Animation (The Lorax, Despicable Me, Minions) has a talent of imposing classic slapstick into their stories. There were plenty of moments that I laughed when I was reminded of stunt that seemed like something out of a Looney Tunes short. The visual gags were one thing, but Illumination is not that skilled at writing. The big problem is that The Secret Life of Pets feels like a beat-for-beat dog version of Toy Story. You can identify the same structure of the buddy story of the two that don't like each other, but are working to get home; It's Toy Story.How are the characters? What's odd was that while I got into the side stories of Gidget and Snowball, it's actually the main characters that really bland and uninteresting. I cannot remember a single line from a shockingly stale Louis C.K. whose working with a script that gives him little to do except make dog jokes. Truth to be told, the biggest character is the animation, which looks nice and gives a fantasy-like of New York City while making it feel big.I'll give this five Maxs out of five. The Secret Life of Pets is a movie that was made for kids (I'd say eleven and under). I didn't laugh much, but my full theater had kids and families that seemed happy. While it wouldn't be my first choice to show children, this will probably seem fine if you just want something for them to watch for an hour and a half. Pet people just might want to take their leashes and frisbees somewhere else.",5,1,11,12 July 2016
Finding Dory," Finding Dory makes for a fun splash, even if the wonder and emotional punch isn't as strong
","Thirteen years ago, Pixar gave the world one of the biggest animation hits of all time, Finding Nemo. People went nuts for the beautiful animation, the father-son story that parents related to so much, and probably the biggest selling point, the use of Ellen DeGeneres as the fish with short- term memory loss. As much of a surprise as it was to some people, I originally didn't care for Finding Nemo. I was a freshman in high school at that point and was the wrong age to get into a story about a little child trying to be found by his worrywart father. It wasn't until several years later that I gave it another watch and really started to appreciate what it gave us.When Disney announced that a sequel would be developed, I wasn't sure how to react. The tract record for Pixar sequels has been a mixed bag. The Toy Story sequels are amazing movies that built upon the world of toys, but Cars 2 took a step back by giving the uninteresting side character his own story while Monsters University did all right showing us an origin story. Lets take a dive back into the water to see where Finding Dory ranks. It's been about a year since the events of Finding Nemo and Blue Tang Dory (played by Ellen DeGeneres) has been living peacefully with Clownfish Marlin (played by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (played by Hayden Rolence). While she's still suffering from short-term memory lost, she's been experiencing occasional flashes of old thoughts. While helping out on field trip for Nemo's class, a view of the sting ray migration triggers a sudden urge to find her parents. With the only clue being that they might be off the coast of Morro Bay, California, Marlin and Nemo accompany her to help.They arrive, but are separated when Dory is 'rescued' by marine biologists. It turns out that the coast is right outside of a Marine Institute/Aquarium attraction. It's here where Dory also comes across a grumpy Octopus Hank (played by Ed O'Neil), a near-sighted shark whale Destiny (played by Katlin Olson), and a beluga whale whose sonar is broken Bailey (played by Ty Burrell). They all try to help Dory see where her parents went while Marlin and Nemo try to find Dory. Finding Dory seems like a sequel that doesn't have much reason to exist, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Thanks to the same team from the original movie returning, they give Dory a pretty solid background on where she came from. Parents of children with disabilities will probably relate to this story given how much Dory's parents go through to make sure their daughter is happy. While part of me misses some of the characters from before, it makes up by including some likable new animals. Ed O'Neal seems to know how to use his 'grumpy' personality to his advantage. Of course this movie belongs to Ellen DeGeneres who is not only funny, but a pretty good dramatic actress (she much love doing her talk show, as I've always wondered why she hasn't done more movies).Finding Dory is a very good movie, though not a great one. To be fair, the original movie is tough to top. I think the issue falls on two things. First, the story of Dory finding her parents can feel a bit repetitive to the first movie. And also, while Finding Nemo gave us a vast ocean off the coast of Australia, here were stuck at this Marine park for most of the story. It's nice looking, but it does limit how much these fish can do.I'll give this eight Dorys out of ten. This movie will definitely please families looking for a fun animated movie and movie fans that have been waiting for a sequel. I myself was laughing at several jokes and even hoped that Dory would find what she was looking for. It may have not had the emotional punch the original had, but Finding Dory is a solid effort, come on in with the fishes and keep on swimming.",8,2,12,20 June 2016
Arrival," Arrival identifies it's own complex language to deliver a great film message
","Put yourself back in French class in high school. The textbook your given has a preface that the new language your about to acquire isn't just important in a modern world, but remains a poetic way of communicating. But then your teacher comes in and you can't get past her introductory, 'Bonjour!'. It all seems to come out as alien and you suddenly think that you'll never be able to communicate with the French. First of all, many French people know English. The other thing that people tend to forget that as babies, their own language was just as strange.Though we speak and write every day, it usually never comes across that were using a complex system of characters and set structures to even do something basic. It's only when were learning a new language when the difficulty comes up of seeing something in Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, and even sign language. Today's movie actually addresses something that very few science fiction ever figure out; if aliens did come to earth or vice-versa, just how do we talk to them? Much of the previous movies either conveniently give them the English language or simply make the uncommunicative hostile. Arrival goes into better detail on how one might be able to crack an alien language. Linguist professor Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams) is a brilliant woman, but seems to suffer from bad memories of her daughter who died young of a rare disease. When she goes in to teach a class, she witnesses the news which talks about twelve mysterious UFOs that have touched over various parts of the world. The ships remain in place, but this sets off a panic from the public. Louise is selected for a military team to go to the UFO that's hovering over Montana.A part of the team is also physicist Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner) and US Army Colonel Weber (played by Forest Whitaker). They all eventually enter the ship and make first contact with the aliens, which are dubbed 'Abbott and Costello' to tell the two a part. Louise uses her skills to teach them a few basic words like 'Human' and 'Earth'. The written response from the aliens is incredibly complicated circle-like symbols. By working with the aliens more, she starts to understand just how the circles work and what each structure means. She is working to eventually ask, 'Why did you come to Earth?'.Arrival happens to be a fresh change of pace in the science fiction genre, especially after an abysmal summer of lame blockbusters. Not only is the story very creative with how people could potentially talk to life in the universe, but it is gorgeously shot. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) has crafted the best cinematography of the year with the way he can capture depression, mystery, and from the shot of the first flight into Montana, awe. He also manages to cleverly keep the story within the military camp and only show the outside world through news channels, making the situation more confined.Amy Adams proves again that she's a very strong actor, considering my phrase for her in 2014 for Big Eyes (which I still feel she was robbed of an Oscar nomination). Jeremy Renner and Forrest Whitaker, while they do fine, are merely passable and are surprisingly given little development. Though to the credit of the story, it at least keeps it's focus on what it needs to do.Speaking of story, I'll admit that the final twist is creative to both the plot and they way the film is structured, so I will not dare spoil that here. I'll give this nine shell UFOs out of ten. Those that are looking for a heavier action movie are not going to get this here. What they will get is a slower (intentionally) story about how hard it would be to even say hello should aliens come to our planet.",9,3,10,14 November 2016
Parasite," Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to 'Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?'
","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of 'helping the poor'. Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of 'would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family'.Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is.",10,14,21,14 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman reminds me that I should always trust Michael Keaton under any hood.
","The hardest thing about being an actor is that it is a very unforgiving profession. While a steel mill worker is given a big send off retirement party when he leaves, an actor faces something very different. They are in the trend business and just like fashion, have to fathom new ways to continue staying relevant, therefore continuing to get work no matter how demeaning it is. It's the dream to be able to walk down the red carpet to the applause of millions waiting, but once a star gets a taste of it, they'll continue to be thirsty for that love. If you talk to anyone who used to be a big actor in Hollywood or Broadway, they'll say that their biggest regret was not taking some deal that could have made their career last longer. Perhaps it was an award winner or even a big blockbuster, but every actor will admit to wanting to be back at the top. What's tough about that is that most folks over the age of fifty do quite understand what the young people are into. There's no easy way to figure it out, but these actors need to find something that will get them attention again. Perhaps Birdman can give them inspiration?Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton) is a Hollywood celebrity who has career has been in decline since his days playing a superhero named Birdman (yes, it's supposed to be like Batman). He is in the process of making a comeback by writing, directing, and staring in a play in New York. He's getting help from his producer/lawyer Jake (played by Zack Galifianakis) and the play is starting his girlfriend Laura (played by Andrea Risborough), Lesley (played by Naomi Watts), and another actor that doesn't last long.A fallen lighting rig injures one of the side characters (we learn that Riggen had planned this), so they are lucky enough to get Mike Shiner (played by Edward Norton) to fill the place. Mike is anything but easy and even stops a preview performance when Riggen switches his real gin with water. It doesn't help that Riggen's adult daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone), whose a recovering drug addict, has littler confidence in her father. Riggen also keeps having a vision of his Birdman counterpart mocking him and his show. All Riggen wants to so is prove that he still matters in the world of entertainment.Birdman benefits not only from a very good story about acting, but with how it's shot. It has a behind the scenes feel as the cameras It has the look of a continuous take, which probably resulted in the actors having to memorize longer pages of dialogue, just like theater actors. It's very Kubrick in pacing and tone, almost what Interstellar was trying to go for, but Birdman pulls it off much better. Even the soundtrack is close to a Kubrick feel as most of it is classical. Going back to the acting, I've always been a big fan of Michael Keaton who has been underused in recent years. Blame the Hollywood system, but Birdman proves that Keaton has got a lot of ability to play different characters. He is a big Oscar possibility. Rounding out the rest of the troupe, Edward Norton plays kind of a parody of himself as his character is difficult to work with (as is rumored with the real life actor) and does it well. He's the theater guy who is fighting back against the film actors trying to step in on Broadway territory. It's clear that the message here is that while acting is tough, trying something else for glory is a big risk, but whether you want to continue living in a shadow of a past is your decision.I'll give this five Birdmans out of five. Birdman is the most avant-garde of the big award movies coming out, so it's clear that if you want something more linear and straightforward, it's not here. But Birdman is still one of the best of the year thanks to it's classical musical- like tone that's both haunting and entertaining.",10,3,11,8 December 2014
Halloween," Despite having some great moments (cast, music, and a scary monster), Halloween as a movie is overrated.
","We're going back to 1978 to one of the original slashers, Halloween. This is a movie that has not only continued to be a constant watch around the autumn season, but has inspired several imitators hoping to capture that same success. I can't blame them as Halloween was made on a very low budget (it might have been lower then John Carpenter's first film Assault on Precinct 13), yet generated a major profit. You have to give it credit that while it was not the first slasher movie ever, it was the first to be centered around Halloween. What's interesting is despite the spooky surrounding of the holiday, Halloween was the first to set a horror story on that day. I think that similar to why we don't see Christmas settings in horror stories, Halloween too has a sense on innocence that even represents a right of passage with most children with trick or treating, watching scary movies, and of course, carving pumpkins. Having a dark character like Michael Myers suddenly come into the fold takes away the intentional fun scare to make way for the true scares. So is Halloween the classic that everyone says it is? Welllet's look at the story.After a very suspenseful opening that shows a young Michael Myers murdering his older sister, he is sent to a mental hospital where his doctor Samuel Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) looks to keep him there as he says 'I saw nothing but evil in his eyes'. One evening before Halloween, Loomis sees that several inmates have escaped, including Michael Myers, who has stolen a car to make his way home to Haddonfield, Illinois. In that same town on the same block, teenager Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is getting ready for a typical night of babysitting her neighbors child Tommy while her friends are going to do the same. But unlike her friends like Lynda, Annie and Bob who want to make it a night of romance, Laurie is single, and thus more focused on being Tommy's friends and making it a nice Halloween. But once the sun sets and the jack o lanterns light up, Myers has made up a costume from a boiler suit and a mask and is heading back to his old neighborhood where Laurie is.People are constantly phrasing Halloween as the essential John Carpenter film and one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I find Halloween overrated. Is it bad? No, not at all. In fact there are some great elements. Speaking of which, let's get into the atmosphere. The beginning, which is all shown through Michael's perspective, is a masterpiece in horror staging and setting the mood to let you know that this kid isn't turning back. He will come out deranged. The rest of the time, you only see him with that mask, giving him the same idea that was occurring with Street Thunder in Assault on Precinct 13; that he's a force rather then a person. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect as Laurie, with a combined sense of tension along with a bookish look that makes her the best choice for this kind of teenager. Donald Pleasance is often regarded with playing the authority figure, but few point out that he has that same sense of unpredictability and crazy that would have rubbed off given his job of watching Michael Myers. It's too bad that aside from the three leads, I found non of the other characters, even the child actors, that convincing. Laurie's friends especially only seem to exist to give the movie a longer running time.It probably has to do with the script, which aside from some good lines and setup, is not that good. If you listen to the way the teens talk, they seem too dumb for the sake of the plot. Even the adult characters just seem like stock cops and stock teachers that may have given this movie more depth. Without it, your stuck knowing whose very likely to get axed off while we wait patiently for Michael to eventually get to Laurie. Even the way this movie is shot is mixed. Many of the night shots seem clumsy and rushed which I can understand some of the reasoning (there are great moments with the way Michael Myers enters through the dark), but creates an lazy look when compared to how dark was shot in later John Carpenter films. I'd say that out of the things he did for the movie, John Carpenter's score may be the best as it is chilling and of course, has a memorable synth sound that would be his trademark. I'll give this six Michael Myers masks out of ten. The setup and situation seems ready to go, but I really wanted better characters out of the teens and a bit more unpredictability with the plot. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if one of the kids had gotten killed? At least there are a lot of elements that can make it entertaining in some areas. This is one horror movie I don't come back to that often, but I understand why a lot do. Take a look and see if this is one Halloween worth celebrating.",6,2,3,16 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Like the real Wonder Woman that was sculpted in clay, the movie is god-like is how fantastic it is in every field.
","When it comes to women superheroes, it seems that they have more of a prominence within comics rather then their film adaptations. A lot of that has to do with that there are simply more men then women that even wear the capes, as it seemed that the image of the comic book seemed more like a boys thing. Of course that's far from the truth as not only plenty women read comic books, but comics themselves have proved that they can be an art. So for each Spider-Man, Batman, and Iron Man, where are the women heroes like Captain Marvel, Batgirl, and of course, Wonder Woman? Like how comics had to prove that there's room for heroes of all genders, film had to do something similar. It's too bad we couldn't have started with both men and women, but that's just how society is. Previous attempts to portray women as superheroes have fallen short with awful movies like Supergirl, Catwoman, and Elektra. It's hard to pinpoint where those went wrong, bit I think it was a matter of trying to be too different from the regular superheroes. Everyone can rest easy as Wonder Woman not only gives us a good DC movie, but a great woman-led superhero film.On the hidden island of Themyscira, which is home to the Amazon women, young Diana is the daughter to Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielsen) and Zeus when she was sculpted out of clay. Diana would like to train to be a fierce warrior, though her mother refuses it. This leads Diana to be secretly trained by her aunt and General of the Amazons, Antlope (played by Robin Wright). Things seem fine as Diana (played by Gal Gadot) proves to be quick on her feet and strong, until a planes crashes near their waters.Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) who turns out to be a captain from the United States Army Air Service in the crisis of 'The War to End All Wars'. Steve convinces Diana that the Amazon women would be in great danger while Diana starts to think that that it's all the cause of the god of war, Ares. Knowing she can handle the 'God-Killer' sword, she accompanies Steve to England to find out where Ares would be during the Great War. Meanwhile, the Germans are working on more methods to fight forward with the help of General Ludendorff and the mad scientist Dr. Poison.Wonder Woman has figured out why the previous female led superhero movies have failed and why the others work; because they care. It's clear that director Patty Jenkins understands that you don't need to try something too different, but rather fresh. Wonder Woman uses a familiar setup of a 'team up plot to defeat the villain', but it has a radical feel to it all because you can tell that the people behind this care about their character. Much of the dark tone from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is gone in favor of something more lively (though it does have grim moments).One of the stronger points of Batman V Superman was Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This movie shows she's a good enough actress to carry herself throughout. What makes it smart that aside from being a fish out of water scenario for our hero, the Chris Pine character has one too on the island of the Amazons. This allows a reintroduction to Wonder Woman as she starts to understand the humans and how some of their actions may not come from the gods. It's a true character arc that not even Marvel seems to be doing a lot of.What I also like is that it's never trying to push the 'women rule!' feel (similar to the Ghostbusters from last year) that hard in favor of a 'men and women working together' tone that seems like something that everyone will like. Her willingness to want to save everyone while accepting that many of victims of circumstance not only having me feel good about our heroine, but even had me think about some of the flaws of the original Captain America movie that had a 'good vs. evil' style war.I'll give this ten lassos of truth out of ten. Wonder Woman is not only the best DC cinematic universe movie, but feels like a fresh breath of air within the superhero bubble that only seems to be getting bigger. It works as an action movie, a comedy, a movie about World War I, a drama, and above all, a great superhero story about ones evolution. It only seems like that this was sculpted by the same gods who made Diana.",10,59,128,6 June 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton contains the right beats and lyrics to rise outta the ghetto, even if it trudges in schmaltzy tropes
","We are what our environment makes us. I grew up in a small town that has grown, but I like to imagine how different I would have become if my parents would have stayed in the Los Angeles area. Perhaps I might have been more troubled or perhaps not. I grew up in Long Beach for a few years before we moved, but I wasn't old enough to have had any influence. The area wasn't dangerous, or at least nowhere near as dangerous as the city of Compton was. Compton, California tends to have a reputation as one of the most ghetto cities in the world. I don't think it would be put on any list, but if you were to get off the 91 freeway twenty years ago for a car trip, it would be a bit easier to make a case. The entire city of Los Angeles was in a gang problem with the Crips and Bloods in an everlasting melee, yet Compton seemed to be the center of it. The area was a probably black community and it didn't help that the law enforcement was anything but sympathetic and came around to simple harass. Coming Straight Outta Compton was a group that would use it's message from the streets to create a different side of rap.In Compton in 1986, five friends Dr. Dre (played by Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), Eazy-E (played by Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (played by Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (played by Neil Brown, Jr.) form a new hip hop group N.W.A with the goal of putting their hard views of city living and gang warfare within their raps. Their first single, 'Boyz-n-the-Hood' catches the ear of a music business man, Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti) whose been looking to get back into management.Eazy-E works out the deal with Haller, making him the manager for N.W.A. while Eazy-E starts his own label, Ruthless Records. Haller gives them the resources to make their next album, but the guys are still harassed by law enforcement. The album, Straight Outa Compton, is a smash hit, making the group popular by mainstream crowds and giving them their first tour. When not paid for his written work, Ice Cube leaves the group to embark on a solo career while Dr. Dre signs on to Death Row Records. Each guy takes different route in the music business as L.A. continues it's crime problems leading to the 1992 L.A. Riots. Bio pics are a dime a dozen and need a hook to stand out. Straight Outta Compton has the right beat and does well as a storyfor a while.The strongest elements here are the production value and acting. Straight Outa Compton has some of the best recreated concert footage since The Doors. When the concert in Detroit was commencing, I almost forgot I was watching a movie and that I was watching a documentary. All five boys resemble their counterparts in a way that adds to the documentary argument. Even watching O'Shea Jackion (who also happens to be Ice Cube's son) sing 'F**k the Police' was freaky with how much he resembles Ice Cube.The movie is standard as a bio pic I would have ruled it as an entertaining piece of music history had it not been for the unnecessary last forty five minutes. Without giving away who it is, one character coughs and the movie embarks on the trope of padding it until they die twenty minutes later. It's predictable and easily could have been cut and implied instead. As sad as a death in the family is, the movie needed to make it's cuts and choices a bit better for the sake of a flowing story.I'll give it seven Straight Outa Compton albums out of ten. For what it is, I'm glad I saw this. It's a needed look to understand why a song like 'F**k the Police' would be made and how people would misunderstand it's intention.",7,6,34,17 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," The actors try their hardest, but Fifty Shades of Grey deserves fifty spanks
","If you ask any guy, then chances are that if you bring up the idea of watching a chick flick, then they'll probably give you that look that questions not only their masculinity, but of all masculinity representation all together. It's not that I think that all chick flicks are bad, but when it comes to making and promoting film for a women audience, then the executives of the production company are probably not going to put a lot of effort into. They'll simply look at When Harry met Sally, Love Story, and Pretty Woman and slap together what they think works. So more then often, movie studios will turn to romance novels as a quick way to make more movies for women. The setups are very similar; a woman who wants more out of life meets a mysterious man who changes their perspective and then something comes in between that will tear the two apart only for one of then to realize that they were wrong and get back together and live happily ever after. The Twilight franchise is probably the most obvious example, yet is one of the most successful of the chick flicks. Now we go from vampires tosubmission erotica in Fifty Shades of Grey. Fittingly enough, we open in the grey Seattle where Ana Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) is filling in for her journalism major friend to conduct an interview a young corporate executive, Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). The interview starts out awkward, but the young stud seams to have interest in the young innocent. She encounters him again ad the hardware store she works at and asks her to a coffee shop outing. Though she initially leaves, he goes as far to send her a first edition of a Thomas Hardy novel to show his interest in her. She still seams resilient to his advances until he takes her home after getting a phone call from a drunken Ana. When he doesn't take advantage of her, the two start dating and the two seem pretty good. This all comes to a halt when Christian reveals that he has a hobby on the sidelinesbondage. Yep, he's into the handcuffs, whips, and other naughty things that shock Ana at first, but agrees to go with. She signs a non disclosure contract and agrees with Christian that they are playing and not 'sleeping together'. Fifty Shades of Grey sounds more like a soft-core porn story then a genuine movie. Though the hard R rating is well earned, I don't know if I say that it went as far as it could have gone. I have seen erotica dramas that are far better (like Last Tango in Paris and Chloe) and most people have already gone as far to call this a waste of time even before it was released. It came and gone and honestly, it could have been worse. Oh it's badly written (I mean laughably bad dialogue bad), but I can tell that director Sam Taylor-Johnson tried her hardest to make this more thrilling then anything.Dakota Johnson has a lot of talent. So does Jamie Dornan. The two have genuine chemistry and try their hardest to make some bad writing work. It doesn't even come close though I still applaud their effort. The novel of the same name, from what I'm told, is just as empty and bland, but the production seems to want to make this work. I'm clearly not the target audience, but I think that the same audience who loves the book will still like thisThere's not much else to say other then it had an odd ending that seems to only set up for a sequel. It'll probably receive one, but it's not on my pleasure list.I'll give this four sexy handcuffs out of ten. Some people are really outraged by this project coming to the big screen, but its something I can live with.",4,4,9,17 February 2015
Black Panther," I don't know if this is 'grand and revolutionary', but Black Panther is a very entertaining movie
","In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest. In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther. In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium. When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes. Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar.",7,5,13,20 February 2018
Mother!," With how underwhelming mother! is, we at least know what Darren Aronosky's Project X remake is like
","When people saw the trailers for the latest Darren Aronofsky film mother!, many people expected that the filmmaker was going to make a return to the horror genre, similar to The Black Swan. It certainly sold me on it's claustrophobic and unnerving imagery that made me curious. I, along with a lot of people, walked out of the theater wondering what exactly we just witnessed. I'll say upfront that the movie taps into the surreal, experimental kind of style, that I haven't seen since Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life or Charlie Kaufmans Synecdoche, New York. All these films are artist's dreams, but can be polarizing the mainstream audiences. Darren Aronofsky has been known to explore into experimental areas before with Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and even Black Swan. This ranges from out of order storytelling, camera focus on odd objects, and especially cinematography He uses a lot of these tactics to separate the films world from our own, accomplishing his goal of making his work feel more unnerving then the typical blockbuster. Audience members may argue that they wanted something more logical, but often don't consider enough just what logic was even established, if any. Let's see if mother! pushes once too much for it's audience to think. In a paradise-like country home that's separated from society, a young women, only known as Mother (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is focused on renovating the house, making it clean and well built desiring to making it heaven for her and her husband. Only known as Him (played by Javier Bardem), he's a famous poet with writer's block whose hoping that the home their building will inspire him once more. As she's painting or spackling, she starts to see visions of a heartbeat that seems to slow down as the film progresses. One day, a Man (played by Ed Harris) visits, looking for a place to stay. Though Mother is suspicious of the stranger, Him insists that he stay for the night. The next morning, Man's wife, Woman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) comes to find her husband and stays too. The two enjoy conversing with Him, but Mother is wondering when their going to leave. Things become more complicated when Man's two sons arrive, cause some trouble, and results in even more people arriving at the house.I have to stop there, as the third act of mother! gets insane from there. This is the point that is going to polarize the audience. I will understand if people like or hate the movie, though I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I had to ponder on where I stood, as I was impressed with the ambition that Aronofsky wanted to portray. It was written well and allowed the story (or lack of) to keep my attention all they way to the end. But at the same time. I could get exactly what this movie was going for: humanized representations of the early days of the bible. What do I mean with this?Javier Bardem is supposed to be God, Jennifer Lawrence is mother earth, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are Adam and Eve, and I could go on with what was supposed to be represented. The problem is that I think it comes around as too obvious and could have benefited from being more vague, something more in tune to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ironically, much of the noise in the background tries to say so much about everything and that came off as overly pretentious. Maybe I'm supposed to be reading it as something else, but Aronofsky tried to bite more then he could chew.I'll give this five crystal rocks out of ten. I give the movie points for ambition, but it may be the most unfocused Aronofsky story of all. I can't say it was bad from beginning to end, but the second half could have used both less, but more vagueness. It's to put down on paper, but I'd still suggest Pi and Rosemary's Baby as an example of what mother! needs to be. I'd still encourage film buffs to check it out to make their own conclusions, but their probably going to expect more.",5,1,4,18 September 2017
Creed II," Creed II has the same Burning Heart from Rocky IV without going over the top. It's a worthy sequel
","If you were to ask any child of the 80's (or anyone who loves movies from the 80's) what an essential movie from that era was, chances are, they'll say Rocky IV. While a fourth movie from a boxing series may not seem like much, have you seen that movie? It's basically Rocky Balboa fighting and winning the Cold War. Okay, it wasn't that, but given it's time period and the fact that the competing fighter from the heavily controlled Soviet Union, it represented a lot of feat that a lot of Americans had about the Motherland and what could be lurking behind the Iron Curtain.It may have been the silliest of Rocky movies (any Rocky movie with a robot is jumping the shark), but it embraced its tone enough that I still recommend it as an entertaining film. Like a lot of fans, I had also speculated about Dolph Lundgren's character of Ivan Drago. What would have happened to him after his loss and the fall of the Soviet Union? Would he still be involved with the world of boxing? Thankfully, these and more questions have been answered in Creed II.After the events of Creed, Adonis Creed (played by Michael B. Jordan) has become the heavyweight champion and seems to be enjoying his new celebrity status. In celebration, he proposes to his longtime girlfriend Bianca (played by Tessa Thompson) in which she accepts. They also agree to relocate to Los Angeles to be closer to the Hollywood scene and be closer to his mother Mary Ann Creed (played by Phylicia Rashad). While this concerns Adonis who doesn't want to leave Rocky Balboa (played by Sylvester Stallone) alone, Rocky seems okay now that he's recovered from his cancer treatment from before.Meanwhile in the Ukraine, former boxer Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lundgren) has been living a quiet life after being exiled by his home. But he's not alone. He's been training his son Viktor (played by Florian Munteanu) to become a boxer as well. Once ready, Ivan and Viktor travel to the states to challenge Adonis for a match. Nobody, especially Rocky, wants Adonis to take the fight, as Ivan was the one who killed his father in the ring. Adonis accepts it for the sake of his family history. At the same time, he finds out that Bianca is pregnant and he's afraid that the baby will inherit his wife's deafness.Like a lot of sequels, Creed II does follow a lot of the typical second movie tropes like friends falling out, ego getting in the way, and a later 'eye of the tiger' style learning to earn that hunger to win. The good news is that it still works thanks to the characters from before. Everyone, especially Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, are interesting and I want to see what's going to happen with them. Whether they fall or rise, their story is never boring and feels good in the place of the Rocky universe.What makes this work better then I thought is the return of Ivan Drago. He isn't just a man of few words and punches like in Rocky IV. He's a man with a lot of anger, who blames his fight with Rocky as the start of his downfall, who only want's to reclaim the former glory of his days in Russia. It's clear that a lot of inspiration can from the new YouTube series Cobra Kai. Like in the show, they took a character who was a black and white villain, and added more depth to his personality.Adding to that is his son, who is no joke. I have no idea to what preparation was made, but the movie did a great job at making this beast of a man who makes Adonis look small in comparison. This makes the upcoming fight very anticipated.Without giving much away, if there's anything to admit, its that if you seen the other Rocky movies, then chances are, you'll know some of the outcomes. It's a sports movie, but I think a lot of focus is trying to make it a part of the Rocky storyline...perhaps a little too closely.I'll give this eight Rocky IV posters out of ten. Creed II continues both the stories of Rocky IV and Creed in fantastic ways that I'll be ready for a Creed III. It'll depend on how long Stallone will remain a part of this, but even if he leaves, this series is in good hands with Michael B. Jordan. Go see it, take a punch, and see it again.",8,0,1,27 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Does Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice live up to the hype? I don't hate it as much as some, but it still has problems.
","Superheroes are bigger now then ever. Today's niche happens to be anything geek related and comic books have positioned themselves as great works of literature. The movies have also taken a big step forward, thanks to how Marvel and Disney have combined forces to give us a cinematic universe that has never been attempted before. I could have never imagined something like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man being as appealing (or even doable) twenty years ago when the most well known superhero movies were Superman and Batman. Both of these heroes are from Marvel's biggest competitor, D.C. Comics.D.C. has their own line up of superheroes including Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and the Green Lantern. Like the Avengers, they occasionally team up as the Justice League along with Superman and Batman. It's clear that Warner Brothers, the owners of the film rights to D.C., really wants a similar cinematic universe like what Disney has done with Marvel. The one that started it was Man of Steel (which I still stand by as a good movie, though I would have given it a four rather then a five) that had fans polarized. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice takes a giant step so that Justice League can be next. It has been two years since Metropolis was nearly destroyed in the fight Superman had with General Zod. It's revealed that Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) was present at the event and witnesses a building of his collapse, resulting in the death of several employees of his. The rising death count makes Wayne out to believe that Superman does more damage then good. Meanwhile, Superman (played by Henry Cavill) has fallen into place as Clark Kent, working as a junior reporter for the Daily Planet, whose stories on the 'Batman vigilante: in Gotham is harmful for the nearby city.The two meet at a fundraiser hosted by Lex Luthor (played by Jessie Eisenberg) who also hates Superman and had been working with Senator Judy Finch (played by Holy Hunter) to help find remaining kryptonite from the crashed Krypton ships from the last movie. Batman and Alfred (played by Jeremy Irons) manage to retrieve some kryptonite to create weapons that could weaken Superman while Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams) starts to uncover information that Lex is using his funds to start a war between the two. Perhaps Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot) can help out.Where do I begin? Batman V Superman feels like five stories for other movies that are combined into an overlong, grim, and unfocused mess. Is it all bad? Not exactly, as I found Ben Affleck to be a very capable Batman who takes the cape back to the origins of the comic rather then the realistic tone that Nolan had done before. Jeremy Irons brings more assertiveness to Alfred that I would have liked out of Michael Caine. He just may be my favorite Alfred. I wouldn't be surprised id director Zack Snyder wanted to make a standalone Batman movie, but was forced to pair him up with Superman.Henry Cavill is a passable Superman, but we still have yet to get to know this guy along with Amy Adams whose charming, but some of her choices are questionable. Jessie Eisenberg was just awful as Lex Luthor. His psychological tics and odd way of talking make him so much of a psychopath that it's hard to believe he could be a billionaire, business genius. While the overall tone of this D.C. universe feels different from Marvel, it still feels too serious to be entertaining. I'm not even sure is Warner Brothers is taking in the factor that they need kids and families to make it a big sell and I think most children will find it too boring with the exception of the final battle. One the fights between batman and superman happen, it's fun as is another fight that brings in Wonder Woman, but the rest of the story is so scattered an uninterested in itself, I find little to care about.I'll give this five rocks of kryptonite out of ten. I would hate to think that this is what D.C. Comics thinks this needs to be done to separate itself from Marvel. I hope that the tone and get lighter and more focus can be placed on the relationship between the heroes. If not, then perhaps I'll keep waiting for Captain America: Civil War rather then continue talking about Batman v Superman.",5,1,5,30 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," The Greatest Showman works better as a musical then telling the story of P.T. Barnum
","Ladies and gentleman! Boys and girls of all ages! Welcome to the circus! This was a statement that I heard at least once a year whenever the circus came to town. I'm not talking about the more artistic acrobatics of Cirque du Soleil, but the three ring shows that come with a tent, clowns, animals, and the rest of the entertainers who have chosen to use that to showcase their talents. As a child, seeing all these elements together was magical. As an adult, I do question their place in today's bigger world of mixed media. How can a circus that comes once a year compete with specific shows, film, Internet, and zoos?People have to understand that before all of that was created, the circus was often the only place to see the clowns, elephants, and such. True, there was a darker element to the factor on just how far the people behind the scenes would push themselves and others. But if they were good at something, they knew how to entertain. They've built businesses out of it, including those of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Baily (both now closed). The story of one of the originators, P.T. Barnum, is now showcased in The Greatest Showman.We learn that as a child, P.T. Barnum grew up with a tailor father, but liked to make others smile...including a young Charity Hallett. Years later, P.T. (played by Hugh Jackman) meets with Charity (played by Michelle Williams), they marry, have two daughters, and try to make something of their lives. Though everyone is content with their lives, P.T. is let go from an accounting job while he dreams of something better for his family. While entertaining his children, he gets an idea to bring the world of the mysterious and unknown to everyone.He gets a loan and opens Barnum's American Museum, to showcase wax figures, odd exhibits, and anything he can make to invoke a greater wonder within the world. The public is resistant. Lower ticket sales gets P.T. to start hiring live performers including midget 'Tom Thumb', a bearded lady, and acrobat Anne (played by Zendaya). This brings in more people, but local critics are unimpressed. The museum (later named a circus) becomes popular enough that P.T. hires a famous playwright Phillip (played by Zac Efron) to try to help run the show and make it appealing for everyone...including the upper class. The Greatest Showman is trying to do a lot of things. It tries to make P.T. Barnum likable and conflicted, it tries to show the merits of the circus, it tries to make you sympathize with his freak show, and it tries to be historically accurate. Oh, and it's also a musical. Does it all come together? Not all the time, but I can't deny that I enjoyed myself. Seeing this is a lot like a real circus; it's full of talent and has a lot of effort put into it, but what is it leaving behind?My problem with The Greatest Showman is that we only get glimpses at the real P.T. Barnum. Hugh Jackman does great with the material given to him, but given how the real life figure was a debunker, a salesman, and even a representative of Connecticut, I got more of an edited version. The same goes for Zac Efron, Zendaya, and the others that work in the circus. There's a lot you could have done to show the conflict of exploiting their 'specialty' while finding a home. I'm glad we do get the conflict of a man who wants to climb socially, yet isn't sure if his show can come with him.How is it as a musical? It's probably the best element. I'm sure that the overall intention of this movie was to make it as such. What's interesting is that all the songs and music have more of a modern sound (trying in replicate what Hamilton did on Broadway). It does work in it's favor, though not all the songs are memorable. The one I liked the most was 'This is me', which I'm sure will get a lot of song nominations. I'll give this six circus elephants out of ten. The story of the real P.T. Barnum is fascinating, but The Greatest Showman only scratches the surface. I can't say it was for nothing, as the musical sequences are fun and I did care about parts of the story. If you like musicals, you'll get into this. Families are more or less the target, so I might as well say to check it out if you like the circus.",6,0,3,3 January 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. Fans of the series will like it fine, but it's just passable in my book
","Looks like we've got another Pitch Perfect movie out. I might as well talk about them. I'll admit they've never been a favorite series of mine. I find them a tad annoying and perhaps full of themselves. That's not to say I don't understand why people get into them. They've made a lot of money, and I base that on the one element that's done well; the singing. Those that have been in a capella groups know how difficult it is to recreate instrumental sounds. It's the same thing as beatboxing. Don't tell me your impressed when someone can make guitar and electronic sounds all with their vocals. Do the Pitch Perfect movies do well for a capella groups in college? Probably. Can they translate out to movies? Sometimes. The previous movies have had their strengths, as I said in the singing department and even some laughs, but their not something I'd return to on my own. I've mentioned before that third movies in franchises tend to be the point in which the steam has run out. Has the steam run out for the Bellas? Well...lets look at Pitch Perfect 3 to see what we have. After graduating since Pitch Perfect 3, the majority of the Bellas are living in New York City as they try to make something of themselves. Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) is trying to make it as a music producer, but quits on principle. Her roommate 'Fat Amy' played by Rebel Wilson is simply trying to make it as a celebrity. Both seem to be empty since graduating. Though she, Fat Amy, and the other Bellas get invited to a 'reunion', all it was, was to simply watch the only Bella still in school, Emily (played by Haliee Steinfeld) and her group. She apologizes for misleading the group and treats them to a night out.While they talk about the good memories of school, former leader of the Bellas Chloe (played by Brittney Snow) tells them that they might be able to perform in the military USO show. Everyone loves the idea and they sign up. Upon arriving, the Bellas find out that not only is it a full competition, but they'll be competing against full bands that use instruments. While the Bellas keep trying to find a better tune and find out what's going to happen after this, Fat Amy's father Fergus (played by John Lithgow) is back after being absent and wants to become close with his daughter.The best way to describe Pitch Perfect 3 is that it is what it is; a Pitch Perfect sequel. Fans of the series get exactly what they'll be looking for; more singing, more the bellas, and of course, more of Fat Amy saying some offbeat jokes. There's not a lot that separates this from the previous movies other then that the girls are out in the real world. It's just that the majority of those parts are rushed in favor of getting to the main plot.The one element that feels out of place is a kidnapping subplot that feels out of place. Though I won't say what happens, let's just say that most audience members are going to be looking at their watches wondering how long this movie is. It tries to add on some character history, but who cares? People that love these movies aren't there for a spy thriller. Their there to watch the Bellas sing.As far as musical sequences are, their done well. It's also a scenario in which the songs and performances are good as before. I know their trying to make it bigger, but the problem is that not only are the Bellas at too much a disadvantage, but the final song feels like something that goes against what a capella groups would do. Maybe it's because the last song in Pitch Perfect 2 felt like a better send off then this does. This has been marketed as the final Pitch Perfect movie, though we'll see what the audience says.I'll give this five microphones out of ten. What can I say? It's Pitch Perfect 3. If you really liked the first two, then you'll get into this fine. Newcomers (I don't know why you'd start here) should watch the first ones before knowing if this is for them. I'll pass on watching these again, but don't let that stop the fans who love these.",5,0,1,29 December 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," A spoonful of sugar indeed! Saving Mr. Banks is a great movie about two creative geniuses.
","I can understand why authors are very protective of their works and characters. To write a good story, one must fully understand who their characters are. Why does Jay Gatsby hold his parties? Why does little Matilda love going to school? Why is Charlotte committed to saving Wilber the pig? All of these characters have long backstories that explain their motivation and how their relationship works with others. A lot of authors will have built up their characters so well that they've become close friends. So if someone calls to say that they want to put their own interpretation on the subject, it can become quite frightening to imagine someone else working on it.This probably makes it a convenience that most of the writers of the fairy tales that Walt Disney Pictures has produced have long passed on. The company doesn't have to worry about people from estates trying to but in into areas where they have no experience. For the most part, they wouldn't have needed the authors anyway; the movies comes out fantastic. Not all of them are a home run, but Disney has built up it's reputation enough to make anyone trusting enough to let the studio produce their work. Wellalmost everyone; Walt Disney does everything he can to please P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.Did you know that Mary Poppins had a really troubling production? Let's take it back before this. Pamela Travers (played by Emma Thompson) was the author of the successful Mary Poppins books. Though they have made her a wealthy woman, her funds are starting to run low, due to her stubborn decision to not write more. She had declined many opportunities to make to the movies with Walt Disney who had wanted the rights since the thirties. In 1961, she finally takes up on the offer to go to Los Angeles to discuss the possibility.Though she's greeted with a nice driver Ralph (played by Paul Giamatti), sent numerous Disney related gifts, and a promise from Walt (played by Tom Hanks) that the story will be handled well, she's still reluctant to proceed. She finally gives in on the condition that she has final say. Her meetings with the other script writer and musicians Sherman brothers (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) don't go too well as she seems to say no to everything. As Walt tries everything he can to make her happy, Miss. Travers constantly remembers her days growing up in Australia, and how her relationship with her father (played by Colin Farrell) became the inspiration for the stories.This is not a movie about Walt Disney. This is a story on P.L. Travers. And just because the Disney Company produced the movie doesn't mean that they will be sugar coating it. This is an honest story on how her unruly attitude had not only made the production on Mary Poppins tough, but had also cost her a chance at having a close family. Emma Thompson nails the part in every direction, making it harder on everyone else to live up to her.Luckily, the rest of the cast does just as well. Tom Hanks again pulls another great performance as Walt Disney, making him gentle, but a hard worker. Both Schwartzman and Novak are great as musicians who are probably the best in the industry. Even Colin Farrell shows a lot of emotion as P.L. Travers father. The story is edited in a brilliant fashion as Saving Mr. Banks uses the songs from Mary Poppins to cut to the authors past life. This is a true experience that will make you laugh, tear, and ultimately smile.I'll give this ten spoonful's of sugar out of ten. Saving Mr. Banks is a perfect movie about a relationship between two artistic geniuses. If you have any interest in the Disney Company, Mary Poppins, or simply how literature becomes adapted into film, this is something that you need to see.",10,1,3,9 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force is stronger then ever in the return to the famous saga, Star Wars: The Force Awakens
","Star Wars! These two words are all I need to say when describing what is probably the most iconic cinema story of all time. I've never said it was the greatest (some may argue that though), it's responsible for reinvigorating the science fiction genre, raising the stakes on blockbusters, and turning a man with a creative vision into one of the biggest leaders in Hollywood. Star Wars has transcended upon generation after generation, letting children and their grandparents relive the tale of a warrior's journey through the combination of several likable characters and amazing special effects. This original series became of one cinema's greatest treasuresuntil the prequels.Three movies were never enough, so a whole galaxy of merchandising and novels had to fill the gap for fans that wanted more. It wasn't until 1999 when creator George Lucas returned to the galaxy far, far away to give us three more movies that gave us information on how the events in Star Wars came to be. I don't think the prequel saga is as bad as most people say it is, but I can agree that it was no where as entertaining as the original trilogy. Now under the mind of J.J. Abrams, the battle continues in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It's revealed that sometime after the events of Return of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker has left and has been missing for years and that though the Galactic Empire was weakened after the death of Darth Vader and the Emperor, it didn't end the war by a long shot.The First Order is searching for Luke as is the Resistance. The key seems to be within a ball-like droid, BB-8 whose owner is the best resistance pilot, Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac). BB-8 manages to escape before Poe is taken away by commander of the First Order, Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver).BB-8 is found by junk scavenger Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) who also bumps into Finn (played by John Boyega), a Stormtropper who goes rouge after seeing the horrors of the First Order. The two and BB-8 manage to get away from a First Order attack after acquiring the Millennium Falcon from the previous movies. Along the way, they come across Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Chewbacca, Leia (played by Carrie Fischer) and more as the resistance takes another stance to try to find Luke (played by Mark Hamil) and battle the First Order. Much of the hype driving this movie is that not only is it a long awaited sequel to such an iconic franchise, but also that J.J. Abrams is taking over George Lucas. The Force Awakens not only reminded me why I love Star Wars, but made me excited by the possibility of seeing another one soon. The result is a fantastic, exciting movie that boasts a ton of great things.The casting is perfect as the older crew fits into their old shoes just as well, especially Harrison Ford who seems more at ease here then he was in the last Indiana Jones. The newcomers like Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega have no problem setting themselves up as new likable characters that should set into the Star Wars saga without a problem. The gold star here goes to Daisy Ridley who this movie really belongs to. While I won't say why, she is perhaps one of the best new strong female characters (since Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road).Adding to the show is the special effects which learned it's lesson from the previous movies that it's not digital all the way, but a blend of practical and computer effects that bring it's life back to the good old days of the original trilogy.The story is also really good, taking us on another hero's journey that the Star Wars movies is famous for telling. Though it is familiar, it feels fresh with the way it is written and portrayed. The only problem I had without giving anything away, is that it does feel like it makes too many winks at the original Star Wars movie, following certain beets we've seen before. While not bad, it did manage to remain predictable in some areas. I'll give this nine BB-8's out of ten. I doubt anyone coming in will say that it was bad from beginning to end. The Force Awakens is properly titled, as the folks at Disney and J.J. Abrams have brought back the science fiction magic in such a new and fantastical way that everyone will be glad they saw this. So may the force be with you and longer as the movie should delight you.",9,4,21,18 December 2015
Unbroken," Unbroken may be familiar for war movie fans, but will break the hearts of everyone else
","The sound of an air raid and guns going off are the last things WWII survivors want to remember, yet they like to talk about them. I've recanted about post traumatic stress in the military, yet I've recently heard about curing the nightmares by talking about it. Not just in a therapeutic way but also to walk the footsteps they've already taken, therefore retracing their thoughts to see what they learned out of it. It may be simply don't go to war, but it could also be to never give up hope. Becoming a military storyteller just may be what the doctor ordered.I can vouch for my own grandfather who is ninety-four, yet seems to be in good spirits and health. He served as a medic during WWII, a doctor during the Korean War and Vietnam, and was a hospital administrator until sometime in the eighties when he retired. He always likes to talk about his days in the Navy and they are some fantastic tales of courage. Cinema has seen many stories of ones heroic experience during wartime. Last year, we had Lone Survivor during the war on terror. Now we have a WWII story in Unbroken. Louie Zamperini begins as an Italian immigrant who is still a young boy when his family settled in Torrance, California. He's a troublemaker and constantly bullied for being an immigrant, but his brother Peter notices how fast he is. With a new pair of shoes, Louie become a respected runner, even gaining the name 'the Torrance Tornado', going as far as the 1936 Olympics in Berlin where he places 8th. WWII comes next where Louie immediately joins, looking to serve his country and maybe make it to the next Summer Games.He becomes a bombardier in the Air Force in the South Pacific where he's found a crowd of people he can call his friends. Their called on a search mission in an unstable plane, which the military insists is air-worthy. Both engines fail, crashing into the sea. Three make it out; Zamperini, Mac and Phil. They survive on a raft where they ration the little food they have and attempt to ward the sharks that are swimming around them. They manage to go on living for another forty-seven days (though they lose Mac) when they're finally foundby the Japanese military. Their captured and sent to a P.O.W. camp where Zamperini endures the meanest military officer around, Mutsuhiro 'Bird' Watanabe, who feels nothing but jealousy for the Olympic athlete.This 'military grunt who goes through the storm to triumph' seems like something that has been done beforeand I'm not gonna lie when I feel like that it's familiar to me too. But that didn't ruin my experience watching this as Zamperini is a very likable guy here, always showing the will to survive even when the Japanese tell him that he's nothing. Jack O'Connell plays our lead and does really well with this guy, giving him the needed rebellious edge to give him his strength for his darkest moments. Angelina Jolie is behind the camera here as the film looks really well. Much of the news behind Unbroken is her directing this movie. While it's not as groundbreaking as Stanley Kubrick or Oliver Stone, she can paint an impressive side of the war. The movie itself is something that I'm glad I watched, but I don't know if I'd watch it again. It's not the story, but it's just kind of sandwiched between a lot of other war movies. I would understand why people would love this and even understand why it could become a box office hit,I'll give this seven B-24 Liberator planes out of ten. Unbroken manages to pass as something that's interesting to hear about, though once you hear about the hundreds of military triumph stories, it'll be easy to lose track.",7,3,10,29 December 2014
Godzilla," The king of the monsters is back, but we could have used more Godzilla in Godzilla.
","The days of miniatures and guys in rubber creature suits are long since past. Back in the previous century, this was a long-standing way of making an entertaining monster movie. It didn't really need much of a character development story to make for a great film. The people who saw this, were here for the monsters and city destruction. That was enough to make the Japanese monster Godzilla such a cultural icon for over fifty years. If you do your homework, you'd be surprised to find out that there are more then thirty Godzilla films, ranging from having him as a terrifying force to saving the world from other monsters to even making him a children's idol to look up to.The Godzilla series was something else I loved as a kid, though it wasn't easy for an American like myself. The movies are very hard to find (these were the days before we had the convenient Netflix) and rarely show in theaters (I saw Godzilla 2000 in theaters), making hard to persuade my friends that wanted modern special effects and better story telling. Today's movies can't work on special effects alone, often needing that griping story that for something like giant monsters, is hard to pull off. The American Godzilla gives the famous monster a second round at combining action and a western setting.The story begins in 1999 inwhere else but Japan where scientists Ishiro Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins) discover a giant skeleton and a hatched egg where one of the creatures as escaped into the sea. At the same time, a power plant supervisor Joe Brody (played by Bryan Cranston) nearly escapes a meltdown when seismic activity destroys the place. The disaster, written off as an earthquake, results in an evacuation and quarantine of the Japanese area. Cut to fifteen years later where Joe's son Ford (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an officer in the Navy living in San Francisco with his wife Elle (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam. He finds out that Joe has been arrested for trespassing in the quarantined area, forcing Ford to go back to Japan. Joe and Ford return to the quarantine zone to collect disks that reveal a cover up. They are arrested and taken to a facility where an egg hatches, unearthing a winged creature called a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) destroys that place and flies off to the United States. The scientists and the Navy reveal another creature, Godzilla, as the only thing that can fight off the MUTOS as Ford tries everything in his power to get back to his family.To combine a tragic story around a monster like Godzilla in today's time is hard to pull off. Does it work? It does in many areas. Last years Pacific Rim perfected the combination of having good human characters in a giant monster movie. Godzilla took a lesson by applying the same idea of good actors playing good characters. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's story of getting home was good, reminding me of War of the Worlds. Brian Cranston steels every scene as a broken man attempting to expose a conspiracy, even if we've seen this before. Even the story of the military trying to kill the monsters is good. What's missing is Godzilla himself. He doesn't show up until an hour in, but when he does, it brought me back to my childhood. The creature is given a modern, CGI look that is defiantly worthy of the title 'GODzilla'. I just wish there could have been more of him. He's in about twenty-five minutes of the entire movie, giving th story to the people. This is like getting a taste of a gourmet chefs food without getting the full dish. I guess it's better to have a little of something that great rather then to have too much of it.I'll give this seven rubber suit Godzilla's out of ten. Had their been just a little more monster action, this would have been one of the best of 2014, but I had fun. I was satisfied with the new American Godzilla. Lets just hope that if they make sequels, we get to see Mothra, Mechagodzilla or King Ghidorah fight the king of the monsters. Oh, and more Godzilla would be nice.",7,4,9,21 May 2014
Deadpool," This guy sucks at reviewing, so I, Deadpool, will talk about how great it is (not perfect, but awesome!)
","Written by Robert Nickerson...NOPE! The awesome Deadpool!Hey you! Yeah, you! What are you doing reading this and not at the movies right now watching Deadpool? I've had to wait through two decades worth of comics and that god-awful X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie in order to get my own spin off (who through that quieting me, the merc with a mouth, was a great idea?). I'm even using one of my super powers that allows me to talk to you, the readers (which the other X-Men see as schizophrenia in the world of the comics). Go spend money. Go eat some popcorn. Give more money to 20th Century Fox so that I can get a sequel!I bet your wondering what's my deal. Besides that fact that I can heal faster then that tool Wolverine, I hold nothing back as I cut and kill all people I hate (which might be everyone, so I may be looking at you!). Guns, swords, my hands; as long as I get the job done. But I love cracking jokes that this other critic, Robert Nickerson, is no where near talented enough to make. So now that we've had our little pow wow, let's get into what my movie Deadpool shows about me!Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds, that guy from Van Wilder) is a mercenary who's no hero, but he's willing to stop stalkers. He's a crack up and makes some good jokes, but the sick ones haven't arrived yet. While meeting with his friend, bar owner Weasel (played by T.J. Miller, nerd), he meets the hooker with a heart of gold, Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin, super hot!). The two become attracted to each other with their similar backgrounds and sexual interests and seems to be a good couple. Things go wrong for Wade when he finds to have cancer everywhere.To cure his cancer, he undergoes an experiment as run by Francis Freemen (played by Francis Freeman, tool). Wade is submitted to days of torture and medical injections of a serum. His mutation of healing is triggered in an oxygen chamber, but it makes his complexion disfiguring. He manages to escape, but can't manage to face Vanessa with his new look. Hoping to find Francis, he become a masked vigilante to now be called Deadpool. He attacks various syndicates, hoping to find a cure for his ugliness, with the help of two X-Men trying to recruit him, Colossus (the real Iron Giant) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (coolest name ever!)Deadpool is finally the right movie for a guy like myself. Like my comics, the movie allows me to go full force with as much blood and splattered limbs as possible. I have no clue what Ryan Reynolds was meant for, but letting him play me is a match made in heaven. I usually don't care for him as an actor (did you see him in Green Lantern?), but his snarkiness really works o his advantage. He plays me as an unpredictable force, and that's fine by me!Story wise, Deadpool is a revenge story, but it also works as a good introduction for me. Those that don't know will be surprised to find a love story. But aside from that kissy-boo-boo business, action fans will get their kick. Colossus and Negasonic Tennage Warhead are both welcome into the world of the uncanny X-Men. If I had to say anything negative about my movie is that that villain is weak. He may be an evil British guy, but I've seen this guy in too many movies before. And as much as I joke about superhero formulas, mine does succumb to some of them. The good news from that is if I get a sequel (I'll probably get it), the formula has now gotten out of the way in order to really go at it next time around (shall we call it Deadpool Rides Again?).I'll give my movie eight me's out of ten. Deadpool is an awesome, violent, and very meta antihero story that most people will see as a welcome change to the over saturated Marvel line up. Take your friends but leave the kids at home (or take them anyway, I don't care!).",8,3,13,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsmen: The Secret Service is a fantastic send up to old fashioned spy thrillers that truly kicks butt!
","The last time that my dad tuned the channel to BBC, he shut off the TV, claiming that the Brit mentality had tired him out in less then five minutes. My poor father, as I'm a big fan of British television, especially of comedies like Mr. Bean and Blackadder. It might be for the funny accent as I found their sound very fancy, but it may also be for the mindset on how they process ideas. With Doctor Who and The Avengers (not the Marvel heroes, but a spy series). I've always seen their thinking as more out of the box and oddball. Who else but the British would have come up with something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One of their most well known properties are the 007 spy movies. They too had that British set up as we had a super human that had a lot of strange gadgets, cool vehicles, and an actor that can both kick butt and be very suave. The course of the films have gone from being realistic to almost science fiction-like. This had put fans at a crossroads of where something like Skyfall would fall. For those that want a return to the more outrageous should come to Kingsmen: The Secret Service. While on a mission in the Middle East, secret agent Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) witness a fellow agent killed by enemies. He visits that family back in London where he gives a young boy a medal that has a phone number to call should he need help. We cut to years later as the boy has grown into Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), an unemployed youth whose intelligent was once training in the royal marines. He's arrested for steeling a car and finally takes up the phone number to see what happens. Eggsy get's released from jail, as paid for by Harry. With a vacant slot open, Eggsy is recruited to apply to join. He sees what Harry is capable of when he fends off a set of drunken ruffians with his fighting skills and an umbrella with gadgets. Eggsy meets up with the other possible candidates while Harry investigates billionaire Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the too good to be true free cell phones and Wi-Fi he's giving away. Eggsy meets up with the head of the agency, 'Merlin' (played by Michael Caine) but fails his next test, sending him home. But when something goes wrong and Valentine may be looking to take over the world, Eggsy may be needed to be a kingsmen after all. Kingsmen: The Secret Service made me realize that it's been a while since I've seen a spy film like this; one that totally embraces the tuxedos and fine taste along with the high tech weapons and machines. The Bourne series was a more realistic spy movie and the 007 movies still have the strangeness, but relies on being more of a blend of the old and new ideas. Kingsmen: The Secret Service is more of a comedy-action movie then anything. Oh there are some action scenes (some really good ones!), but I was surprised with how much fun I had with the spy sequences and the witty banter. Colin Firth is one actor I would have never pictured as an action hero, but I now see that no one else could have played this guy as well as he did. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, really loving his role as the villain. Newcomer Taron Egerton is a force as he had movies like Bond and a sassy mouth that could also lead him to be a comic star. He could go wither direction.I'll give this ten umbrella guns out of ten. The Kingsmen: The Secret Service is another British creation that I hope both strikes a cord with American audiences and sparks a series.",10,4,13,25 February 2015
Green Book," The Green Book is more then a guy version of Driving Miss Daisy. It's an engaging car ride of class difference and friendship
","Remember the Farrelly brothers? Yeah, that's a name I haven't heard in a little while. They were previously remembered to making a lot of farce comedies like Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and The Three Stooges. That makes it even more fascinating that one of them, Peter Farrelly is now directing a 'dramedy' about race relations and friendship. The jarring shift in tone relates to the fact that the pair had been having trouble finding that same comedic fire from before. Movies like Hall Pass, The Three Stooges and Dumb and Dumber To were not hit movies with critics or at the box office. It makes sense that at least one of them would want to try something different.The good news is that even with a different kind of movie, it's still possible for a filmmaker to follow similar themes. In the case of Peter Farrelly, the main character is still a blue-collar man who goes on a journey. I think that's why he and his brother's movies before used to appeal to a mainstream audience; it was easier to relate to someone who was on a similar class level. So let's see what happens in Green Book, again a Farrelly production.In the early sixties, rough bouncer Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (played by Viggo Mortensen) is out of work when the nightclub he works at is closed for renovations. His experience leads him to be interviewed by a 'Doctor Don Shirley'. What Tony discovers is that Don Shirley (played by Mahershala Ali) is a musician who needs a driver to escort him for a concert tour in the Deep South. Though there is clear difference in class and race, Tony is hired based on his recommendation and that he would be a needed help within the segregated area.During the car ride, it's made clear that the two come from different worlds. Tony is unrefined, a slob and is proud of his rough Italian heritage while Don is classy, well educated and is proud of his classical training. Over time, Tony is impressed with Don's piano playing comparing him to Liberace and Don see's the humanity within Tony. The further they go south, the more Tony understands the unfair nature of segregation and Don is forced to see just how different his world is compared to African-Americans in the poorer areas. Though the two become friends, Tony is not only concerned he won't be home for his family on Christmas Eve, but that perhaps he'd been unfair in the past.I guess it shouldn't matter where Green Book came from; it may be one of my favorite movies of 2018. A lot of people might see it as that because it's addressing this issue. Truth to be told, that's not what this movies does well in. In fact, I see this movie as a class separation story that works thanks to its script and actors. The best movie I can connect this to is Driving Miss Daisy. That movie also addressed race relations in the Deep South, but was a story about friendship first. Green Book is also like that.The biggest difference is that along with two men, the plot has to two stuck in the car as they go to each town. Thankfully, the script allows for fun moments without seemingly too comedic. It's likely how the dialogue would have gone down with me if I was thrown into this situation. It's more natural then a lot of stories that probably would have skipped to the race relations' stuff.The winning combination is the two leads Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. They both had challenging roles as they could have fallen into the stereotype trap. But thanks to a good script, both actors embrace their personas and make each of their characters more human by making them both susceptible to each others suggestions. This isn't a story where everything is changed, but that's also the idea. Its about tolerance rather then acceptance. Both are clear about each others differences, but still find ways to become friends. It's never boring and even leads into jokes that I found funnier then a lot of regular comedies. It's just a nice film overall.I'll give this ten pianos out of ten. I still have more award movies to watch, but I can see this playing over well during the holiday season. This is a kind of movie that isn't made too often, but need more of. Just movies that feel like pleasant conversations you'd have with any friend. This is a definite recommendation.",10,10,21,3 December 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick: Chapter 2 continues it's faced paced, neo-noir story of our assassin
","In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered. I've always liked Keanu Reeves as an actor whether he's a metelhead from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, a SWAT officer in Speed, or 'a chosen one' from The Matrix franchise. He has a more reserved, yet intriguing way of adapting that to his characters. Under a good direction, this can create a strong character. This has worked for John Wick, which reminds me of an older James Bond-type if the movie was more of a noir. I was happy to sit and watch John Wick: Chapter 2.After a great opening where he finishes his mission from the first movie to collect his stolen car, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) returns home with his new dog to try and find peace with his retirement and death of his wife from before. Like a lot of typical spy movies, John gets visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio)who asks him to come out of retirement. Santino asks to have his sister assassinated so that her brother can have her seat at a table of mafia heads. When John refuses despite making a blood oath years ago, Santino has the assassins home destroyed.John accepts the job knowing that saying no would only put his life in danger. In Rome, he finds the sister Gianna at a party, but she commits suicide rather then allowing an assassin to get her. On his way out, John finds himself double-crossed by Santino who has sent some of his weaponed goons lead by the mute Ares (played by Ruby Rose). Though John escapes and makes it back to New York, Santino has put out a seven million dollar contract on our hero to cover all the tracks. John Wick: Chapter 2 manages to pull off a really good sequel. Not only does it expand the John Wick universe more, but the stakes feel bigger and the villains seem more threatening. Now that I have seen the first movie, I can see how tough it would be to follow up on a pretty good action movie. Unlike the Taken sequels which simply repeated the formula over and over again, John Wick: Chapter 2 still feels fresh thanks to it's plot which honestly kept me guessing on how things were going to move forward. Do I think it's a higher rated movie then before? No, simply because if it does have any faults, it's that it feels a bit long. Not the segment in Rome, but when John returns to New York. It's quick pace suddenly halts when he visits a friend. Though the scene is okay, I feel like they could have cut it in favor have keeping up with John's mysterious background. Keanu Reeves is still the perfect choice as John Wick. You can tell this man wants to be happy, but understand that with his connection to the crime world, is unlikely to happen. This is enough to keep me hyped for another John Wick movie.I'll give this eight grey pitbulls out of ten. If you liked the first movie, you'll definitely like the sequel. John Wick has plenty of action waiting to burst, so I can only say love your dog and go see this sequel.",8,11,21,14 February 2017
Minions," Minions proves these characters can carry a movie, but they need a more goofy surreal setup then the too safe British Caper here
","In the current age of computer animations, the mainstream audience has never been more accepting. I'm serious when I say that people love animated movies more then anything. It's not's just with Frozen becoming the highest grossing animated movie of all time and becoming a global phenomenon, but it's also with Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony, and Universal setting out their own content that's opened up the hearts of many to the art form that many adults have seen before as just kids stuff. We had a similar revolution in the late eighties when The Little Mermaid, The Land Before Time, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit all came out show showed what kind of storytelling animation was capable of. Speaking of Universal Studios, no one ever expected a project like Despicable Me to have been as much of a success as it was. Those that went opening night would discover that unlike the works of something like DreamWorks's satire tone or Pixar's masterful storytelling found a new kind computer animation that we haven't seen a lot of; good old fashioned physical humor, Both of the Despicable Me movies are noted for their heavy, but funny use of slapstick, especially with the film's most iconic characters, the yellow pill-shaped minions. Given their universal appeal (no pun intended), it makes since to give them their own movie. The question most people had with Minions was, 'Can these creatures carry their own movie?'. Through a great intro, we discover that the minions started a micro-cells whose only purpose was to serve the most evil on earth. They bounce around from dinosaurs to cavemen to supernatural creatures and real life historical figures, only to lose them one reason or another. After the death of Napoleon, the minions retreat into the Artic where they remain hidden for many years.Tired of waiting, a tall minion named Kevin sets off to find a new master. He's joined by Stuart and Bob where they set off into the wilderness and later end up New York. They play around for a bit before ending up in Orlando, going to Villain Con hoping that their new master will be there. They get their answer in a beautifully terrifying Scarlet Overkill (played by Sandra Bullock). She takes them to her hideout in London where she describes to them their job of steeling the crown so that she can take over England. They receive gadgets from her inventor husband Herb (played by John Hamm) and set off, yet due to their silliness, take matters into their own hands.The good news is that the minions can carry their own project, but they still might need Gru to do so. The problem here aren't the minions, as they are expressive creatures that get a lot of fantastic slapstick gags, but it's with the people. The big selling point to Minions is their master Scarlet Overkill who may have Sandra Bullock, but is not that interesting of a character. They needed to make her a lot funnier if she wanted to match up to Steve Carrel's level.As I've said, the first half hour is filled to the core with some of the best physical gags in a comedy I've seen and sets the movie up for a big adventure. But instead, we get more of a British Caper. This wouldn't be an issue if the situation was more unique and funnier, but it's the typical spy scenario that we've seen before. Had Minions been a bit more consistent in tone, or perhaps spent the entire story just looking for a master, it might have been hilarious, but I see this more chuckle worthy then pee in your pants worthy.I'll give this six minions out of ten. Chances are, a lot of kids are going to want to see this, andyea, this defiantly feels more geared towards kids then a family audience. It's strange to say that Minions plays their game a little too safe, even though they would be very likely to play something else entirely. Let's see what they learn before making Minions 2 (I know this will definitely happen).",6,2,4,15 July 2015
Incredibles 2," What can I say but Incredibles 2 is Incredible. It contains great action, comedy, and relatable family dynamics
","Yep, I get to talk about The Incredibles this week. It's already well known as a great animated movie from Pixar & Disney, a fun superhero action story, and is even presents a more typical family. Not too sweet like the Waltons and not too cynical like the Simpsons. The Incredibles or the Parr family don't hide that they have problems, mostly learning to deal with the outside world, but manage to work together to get through life, whether it's a new super villain or helping their son succeed at school. The Incredibles may have been the closest thing to a 'realistic' family from Disney, despite their super powers.Many fans have been wanting a sequel, but faced a lot of challenges. Not only did director Brad Bird insist on coming up with a story up to his standard, but the fact that superhero movies have become more common and even overblown. When the original came out, superheroes were only out sporadically. So how do you go about making an Incredibles sequel while standing out in a market currently dominated by Marvel and D.C.? Well based on how good Incredibles 2 is, I'm pleased to say that were able to build not only on it's own superhero ideology, but it's commentary on family and suburban life. Taking place immediately after the end of the first one, the Parr family, Bob 'Mr. Incredible' (played by Craig T. Nelson), Helen 'Elastigirl' (played by Holly Hunter), son Dash (played by Huck Milner), daughter Violet (played by Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack-Jack are once again forced to hide when they manage to cause damage attempting to capture a super villain. Bob fear having to take another menial job, but his friend Lucius 'Frozone' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) tells him of a new opportunity.Bob, Helen, and Lucius are taken to the office of Winston Deavor (played by Bob Odenkirk) who happens to be a fan of superheroes and wants to get their illegal status reversed. He proposes that Elastigirl fight crime with a hidden camera showing the work she puts in to save lives. They agree, which causes Bob to have to stay home to look after the kids while mom continues her superhero actions. Bob suddenly finds himself in a tough position from trying to help Dash with his homework, helping Violet with her crush, and dealing with Jack-Jacks multiple new powers.I loved The Incredibles back in 2004 and I can say that I loved Incredibles 2. What Brad Bird understands about his family movies is that the most important aspect is the family. Not just with the likable and relatable family characters, but the problems they face and the challenges parents face. While I did think about that Michael Keaton movie Mr. Mom, Incredibles 2 showcases a lot just how parenting itself is a superhero act. Yeah, there's plenty of Craig T. Nelson looking tired and multiple bags under his eyes, but I'll bet a lot of dads are going to look at this and say, 'That was just me a few weeks ago!'.Even in a market where superheroes are dominating the box office, Incredibles 2 still works as a superhero movie thanks to a lot of elements. For me, it's the action. Brad Bird not only knows how to play with a lot of the powers characters have, but thanks to the magic of Pixar and computer animation, makes the larger set pieces look great without having to make them realistic. This makes me realize that animation still has that advantage over live action movies in which it doesn't have to build it's effects in a realistic manner, making it's scenery looking seamless.If I do have to fault this movie, it's with the villain. While I won't say who it is, Disney attempts to throw another character who initially isn't a suspect but later reveals themselves. Not only is this becoming a trope that I'm getting sick of, but isn't as interesting as Syndrome from before. At least Syndrome had more of a personal connection to Mr. Incredible. The Screenslaver has their moments, but again, when it's revealed, the motivation doesn't make a lot of since. What does help is the action in the final act, which is a boat chase that puts Speed 2: Cruise Control to shame.I'll give this nine Incredibles logos out of ten. Incredibles 2 is such a relatable story and really funny that I have hard time finding people that won't like this movie. Brad Bird really is incredible making this movie. So put on your make and fly with this movie.",9,1,5,18 June 2018
Spectre," Spectre manages to remain an entertaining 007 film, even if the old tropes they bring back don't feel that fresh
","MGM and Sony have a big responsibility when it comes to representing one of cinemas greatest characters, James Bond. The 007 series is one of the longest running film franchises of all time that manages to draw major crowds and connect with every generation. For a character that has been around the sixties, he manages to be the envy of every guy because he is living the lifestyle that everyone else wants to live; cool, suave, smart, and a strong fighter. What also draws people into the seemingly never-ending spy series are it's well-staged action scenes, exotic locations, and a formula that most people agree is fun to watch even if it does get a little old.Since Dr. No, the formula for the typical James Bond movie followed as in an opening attack, bond investigating, finding a girl with information, going somewhere, fight, investigate some more, go to another location, find a villain, hear his plan, get tortured, escape, battle villain, kiss the girl, and then the credits roll. Since Casino Royale, the bond movies have taken a different direction and up to Skyfall, have become bigger and have given us more of an unpredictable 007. Spectre tries to go back to it's original formula.Following the events of Skyfall, Bond (played by Daniel Craig) makes his way to Mexico City where he finds, and through a helicopter flight, kills Marco Sciarra, an assassin with a unique ring that has an octopus symbol on it. His intention was to fulfill the last wish of the previous Q (played by Judi Dench) who had asked him to kill the man and to travel to Rome to get further answers from the attack of the previous movies. Due to the Mexico City incident being unofficial, the current M (played by Ralph Fiennes) suspends him from field work until further notice.As M is busy trying to deal with MI6's merge with the Joint Intelligence service that wants to end the 00 program, Bond defies his suspension to go to Rome. Here he finds Sciarra's widow where she tells him about the criminal organization Spectre. He goes to a secret meting only to called out by name by the leader, Franz Oberhauser (played by Christoph Waltz). He escapes and gains information that leads him to Mr. White (from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace). He's told more about Spectre and to protect his daughter, Dr. Madeleine Swann (played by Léa Seydoux).Even with high profile director Sam Mendes returning to the director's chair, Spectre had to follow Skyfall, which is debatably the best Bond movie. It seems that Mendes wanted to return to the roots of what made the 007 movies popular by brings back the memorable tropes like the gadgets, the fight with one strong guy, and even the world domination plot. I admire it for trying to do so, as some of the new additions work while some aren't as new they want to be. The movie is still entertaining with these tropes, but I would have liked further spins on these classic ideas.Daniel Craig still makes for a good Bond, staying a suave as 007 should be while allowing himself to remain rough. Christoph Waltz is a lot of fun as our new villain, and everyone else clearly knows their in a bond movie. Like before, Spectre has plenty of good action scenes (though it may have pulled it's best one too soon with the opening scene in Mexico City), though perhaps they could have cut out a few more scenes as this definitely felt too long. It doesn't need a Lord of the Rings length to be epic, it just needs to be a fun spy movie to be epic.I'll give this seven Jaguar C-X75's out of ten. Spectre could have used newer ideas to the James Bond legacy, but they tried their hardest to give us something entertaining. It's far from turning me away, but maybe we need to bring in a new director to give us something different for the next one. If you see Spectre knowing it's just a spy movie, you'll defiantly be pleased.",7,5,10,18 November 2015
Joy," I know there's an interesting story within Joy. Careless direction and writing turns this into a dirty mop
","Children are always told by their peers that their meant for more in life and that they will give the world something amazing. The message is very 'kumbaya' and vague, if not well meaning. The problem is that the adults that tell children this often don't see other things getting in the way; money, health, or simply the people around them that hold back on their supposed 'big ideas'. Another thing that people fail to notice is that it doesn't just take ambition to make it big, but it requires an inclination for the gambles involved; something that not everyone is blessed with. Now for those that are willing to take the risk, the next step is finding the right people to receive help from. In this day in age, there are a lot of resources one can go to in order make their dreams come true. Investors are an easy start from the crowd funding sites of Kickstarter and Indigogo to a popular reality show like Shark Tank. The only issue now is that since the idea of self-doing most things from self-publishing and self-marketing has become popular, it's too easy to get lost in a sea of other good ideas. One young woman tries to get her great idea noticed in Joy.The idea behind this movie is that it's sort of a bio story on Joy Mangano, the inventor whose products have been featured on QVC and Home Shopping Network, but the movie makes it clear that this is a fictional Joy. Anyway, Joy (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is a divorced mother of two who's already working hard as a booking agent for an airline while living in a house that's also occupied by her soap opera obsessed mother Terri (played by Virginia Madsen), supporting grandmother MiMi (played by Diane Ladd), and her ex-husband Tony (played by Édgar Ramírez). If that's not enough, her divorced parents Terri and Rudy (played by Robert De Niro) are always fighting and her half sister Peggy (played by Elisabeth Röhm) is always putting down like a bully.It's shown early that Joy loves making things since she was a girl. It's during childhood where her MiMi kept telling her that she will be strong and be successful. One day, Joy starts developing an idea for a mop that self-wrings and is washer friendly. Calling it the Miracle Mop, she takes it to QVC where executive Neil Walker (played by Bradley Cooper) gives her the chance to go on TV and try to sell this thing.Joy seems to have an interesting story in there and even a good set of actors to pull this off, so where could they go wrong? The direction.David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle) is our director with who've I've always seen asoverrated and Joy seems to be the most misguided so far. While I know that biographies have to take creative liberties in some spots, by only using the basis of the Miracle Mop woman and combining the ideas of several strong women, we get a main character whose only personality is 'strong independent women'.What's strange is that the film makes creative and narrative errors. The formula is practically the same as a sports movie that remains predictable, especially when they keep hammering in that Joy WILL be a strong person. If I do have anything nice to say, the film still looks good and the actors are well casted in these parts. But another trait of David O. Russell is dysfunctional families that are so horrible as humans, that they seem nearly cartoon-like.I'll give this three Miracle Mops out of ten. Joy never comes of as a genuine story about a strong woman, but rather an empty shell with the director telling the audience, 'you can do this'. Rather then inspiring, it's pandering. I'd say to mop this movie away for something cleaner and more refined.",3,6,16,4 January 2016
Her," Her takes the idea of having a computer relationship to an amazing level. This needs to be seen.
","I am just fascinated with the rate of development of how we use machines. It's not that were using more of them, it's that computers are getting better to our responses. Siri on my IPhone is always a fun thing to play around with. I've given it plenty of instructions like on which Michael Jackson song to play or which way to the nearest Japanese restaurant. But it's curious to ask it things like 'Tell me a story' (It will do that!) or 'Does god exist?' (It also answers that?). I may not be the biggest user of the voice recognition technology, but I have learned that my phone has started to adapt better to my questions.Now as computers become more intelligent, how close are we to giving machines a full conscience? And if machines can think for themselves, are they allowed to have rights? Luckily, I don't think we are at that point just yet. We are the testing grounds for a future generation's artificial intelligence. All we can communicate with now are other people, but it'll be interesting how we partake conversations with computers. Her examines just how far a relationship with a computer can go.In the near future, Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely writer who had just gotten through a long relationship with his childhood sweetheart, Catherine (played by Rooney Mara). Though he seems to be doing all right with his job as a letter writer, he can't seem to accept that the life he loved before is over. He hasn't even signed his divorce papers. Through a whim, he purchases a new operating system with artificial intelligence. He sets up the system to understand that he's not social and wants a female voice. What he gets is Samantha (played by Scarlett Johansson).Unlike most operating systems, Samantha is based upon hundreds of personalities to create a computer with a morality. Theodore is fascinated about Samantha learning everything and bond over themes of life and love. After a one-night fling with her (yes, with Samantha), Theodore decides to put himself in a romantic relationship with his operating system. In the mean time, his friend Amy (played by Amy Adams) has just divorced her husband and she too develops a relationship with the OS that he left behind. They both contemplate whether relationships with machines are acceptable and whether they can be done.Any film that has director Spike Jonze behind the story makes me excited. He's the kind of storyteller that isn't afraid to take chances and really push with how much humans are capable of. Her is the kind of science-fiction movie that I've been waiting for; something progressive, but dystopian at the same time. There is clearly a theme of how much we are attracted to our technology like smartphones and such. It's trying to show us of what the next step in evolution is in that favor. I like how this movie establishes a brilliant device; just that it was put into the wrong hands.I will also say that the science-fiction aspect is a small part. This is really a romance. And a inventive, brilliant one it is. Her is smart, funny, and sweeter them most typical Valentine's Day junk I've seen. Spike Jonze has a knack for picking great actors. Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Rooney Mara all are perfectly fitting in their rolls as different people going through relationships, and have different opinions about computer relationships. The big steel here is Scarlett Johansson who manages to bring a lot of personality all through voice. Yes, there's no hologram, animated character or even text on a computer trying to be her. It's all just her voice from the machine that would make any man fall for this computer.I'll give this ten artificial intelligent operating systems out of ten. Her is a new kind of romance that may seem silly on paper, but has managed to bring a lot of philosophical ideals on love. This is a movie that people will talk about for decades.",Null,0,1,9 June 2014
The Nice Guys," Shane Black's nostalgic and great writing make The Nice Guys of the best of 2016
","The Nice Guys takes place ten years before I was born. Though I was technically alive in the 1980's, I've always seen myself as something of a nineties child. I think it's because of the media I was watching. I was heavily into the Nickelodeon channel and the 1990's fast evolution into the computer age. The reason I bring this up is that one's preference of culture can definitely define the era they were raised in. My older brother may have been born in 1985, but he has a love affair of the 1970's. He likes a lot of the television shows from that time like Dukes of Hazzard and Starsky & Hutch. While I'm not that much of a nostalgic individual, I can see some of the appeal of the seventies. There is something of a bright but gritty combination that's unique. A lot of that had to do with the darker content that was coming out now that the previous restrictions that were present from old studio system were lifted. The Nice Guys returns to this era, giving us a buddy-buddy mystery that's in vein of something that's closer to the seventies cop shows like The Rockford Filesonly with an emphasis on comedy.In the late seventies, adult film star Misty Mountains is killed in a car crash. The aunt of this star hires private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) to find a missing girl named Amelia Kuther (played by Margaret Qualley). Amelia, however, does not want to be found and hires an enforcer Jackson Healy (played by Russell Crowe) to try and intimidate Holland to stop trying to find her. Jackson is something of a wannabe detective who may be better at it then Holland, who is an alcoholic klutz. When Jackson encounters and escapes two thugs looking for Amelia, he decides to team up with Holland to find Amelia before the bad guys can.The two end up being assisted by Holland's teenage daughter Holly (played by Angourie Rice) who seems to be the only one to truly read things between the lines. Holland and Jackson end up going from a porn producer's party in Bel Air to an air pollution protest. It's there they discover that Amelia was making an experimental movie to work with the air pollution protesters, leading into suspicions into the adult film industry, Detroit auto industry, and the Los Angeles city government.While it sounds like a lot to take in, The Nice Guys not only has an interesting mystery, it is also a great buddy-buddy comedy. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a surprising good team, given how well they establish Crowe as the rough guy and Gosling as the idiot (a role I never expected him to play). Now if you want to know who had the best performance, that honor goes to young Angourie who played Holly. She may have been smart and curious about the mystery that her father was a part of, but she still acted like a child. Why is it that few movies that involve kids really let them act like kids?Shane Black wrote and directed this very enjoyable film. You can see a lot of Lethal Weapon's same buddy cop mentality, though I'd argue there's something of a 'meaner' feeling. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that our heroes are not cops, but private investigators. It also has to do with it's 1970's setting which is so rich in it's own world, that I'd be surprised if the film isn't awarded for it's production design. I'll give this nine cookie jars out of ten. The Nice Guys is already guaranteed a spot as one of my favorites of the year. Shane Black is clearly one of the best writer's in Hollywood and I'm glad to see studio's like Warner Brothers taking a chance on him to let him make whatever he wants. I can't summarize enough with how much fun this original story is. Please see The Nice Guys to support more new content from Hollywood!",9,3,9,23 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," It's a Lovely Day Indeed! Mad Max Fury Road is without a doubt the best action movie of 2015
","If an earthquake starts to shake your home what's the first thing to come to your mind? Survival. Should your car break down in the middle of the desert and you have no phone to call for help, what comes as the first instinct? Survival. I may be placing a lot of emphasis on the word survival, but we take for granted how much it takes just to survive. We hear stories of starving children that are teetering on the brink of death, yet they manage to survive for at least another day. What makes us want to survive? Protection.So what is it we're protecting? Whoever it is we want more then anything to see the new day. No matter what people of think themselves, no matter how much of an egotistical jerk they are, there will always be someone that their going to put more importance on then their selves. Maybe their a child that might have a better chance then you had or maybe an older persons who holds an important bit of information that's needed for everyone else's survival. When a major disaster strikes, we drive ourselves to save everyone. When the world has fallen apart like it has in Mad Max: Fury Road, then everyone else matters more then you.Max (played by Tom Hardy) is still drifting around the Austrian Outback dessert in the same post apocalyptic wasteland we've seen in the previous Mad Max movies. He's captured by an army of the infamous leader of a thriving city, Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne) where he's being held as a prisoner and a universal blood donor of one of Joe's sick henchmen, Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, a famous driver named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) has been assigned to take a large vehicle to collect gas (which is very hard to find in this world).In the middle of the escorted transportation, Furiosa makes a sharp left into the desert where it's made clear that she's going rouge, taking the rig along with the four wives of Joe with her, escaping their slave-like roles. She manages to loose the rest of Joe's army in a sand storm, all except for Nux who still has Max with him, taking plenty of clean blood from them. Max escapes once they catch up with the Rig and joins Furiosa and the other women to get to safety in a rumored land of green where there is hope for the future of humanity. It has been thirty years since the last Mad Max movie and I wasn't sure what to expect, as I wasn't sure if people were still hungry for the road warrior. Not only does director George Miller prove he still loves this character, but has pulled off one of the greatest action movies off all time. Watching Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching one continuous car chase that runs through out the majority of the movie. You would think that would become boring after a while, but Miller kept it's focus not on the action (though it's great!), but on it's characters.Tom Hardy does well as Max, still making him likable even though he doesn't have much dialogue in the film, but he does not need it. The real stars here are Charlize Theron and the rest of the women. It's not just their characters personalities, but how much they play a part in the story, always helping out and working together to flee away from the mad men. You could say that Mad Max: Fury Road may be one of the most feminist movies ever made (yet the guys still work on an equal level).I'll give this five Mad Max vehicles out of five. Get ready to ride into Hell as we watch interesting characters drive through an interesting world. The characters are great, the story is great, the design is great, the car stunts are great. It is truly a lovely day indeed!",10,4,12,20 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," The story of Desmond Doss, a Christian medic who served in WWII, earns a grateful film with Hacksaw Ridge
","Within the hands of a solider, a gun is a killing machine that those in training learn to use and accept their fate as they will eventually have to take a life. Without the finger to fire, it is simply an item filled with the power to create change. I'm not making this an anti gun review as I myself have gone shooting (but I've never pointed it at anything living), but what I'm trying to get across is that every machine requires energy to perform its function, and those weapons cannot go off without the intervention of people operating it. As an American, I believe in the right to own a gun as long as the owners are mentally sound to operate with it. But given their violent history, I can understand why one would object to their use. Guns are the primary example of a coin flip invention, which can have its use, but also hides a dark side. The subject of today's movie refused to touch a gun on religious grounds. He has every right to defy the social norms in order to show how ironically, he is American. Hacksaw Ridge is an example on how a solider can do important things without a rifle.Were introduced to Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), who is a stance Seventh-day Adventist who abides by his philosophy to treating others well, especially after a flashback reveals he nearly killed his brother. After learning medicine from his nurse girlfriend Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) and seeing his brother enlist in the army, he too decides he needs to go to WWII for his country. He arrives at basic training under the command of Sergeant Howell (played by Vince Vaughn). Though Desmond does well under physical training, he becomes an outcast when he refuses to even touch a rifle during training.Attempts to get Desmond to leave from physiological tests to even getting beaten up by fellow privates fail to break his spirit. At one point, Desmond get charged with insubordination when he doesn't follow an order from a superior to hold an unloaded weapon. Without saying how he gets out of it, he does make it through training where he's sent to the South Pacific where he becomes involved with the infamous Battle of Okinawa. Again, I won't say what he does, but it's so inspiring that it almost seems like Hollywood fiction (I looked into it, and it really did happen).With a hero whose also religious, this could have been incredibly easy to hand this over to a Christian film company and let them handle it in a too safe manner. Instead, director Mel Gibson knew the importance of showing the brutality of WWII (I don't think I've seen this much blood since Saving Private Ryan) which always manages to balance with Desmond's beliefs. Andrew Garfield's voice might seem a bit hokey, but I think it manages to carry his character fine. I appreciate how the movie does reveal a lot of character and how his devotion to Jesus makes his struggle harder.Hacksaw Ridge reminded a lot of Full Metal Jacket, as both movies seem to feel different after the first half. Both have a basic training half and the other all about the days on the battlefield. What Hacksaw Ridge has over the latter is a more unique hero. It's an overall nice change of pace from the typical shot-the-bad-guy and everything will be fine. You don't see too many war stories about the ones who never fired a weapon. Even pacifists deserve to have their story told.I'll give this nine Battle of Okinawa pictures out of ten. Mel Gibson is definitely back in full force behind the camera. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best of 2016 and I highly recommend this to those that want a WWII story that's different. While it's not for those that can't take too much violence, I think, like how Desmond defends his beliefs, the action is justified and deserves a chance.",9,2,7,17 November 2016
Warcraft," Warcraft gains zero experience points for a compelling fantasy movie, but something for amazing effects and battle scenes
","One memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. Why that? Because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. This adventure they were a part of was the World of Warcraft. While I've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on South Park, I have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. Like anything popular, Hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point.The issue once again is that Hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. Hit-man: Agent 47 and Ratchet and Clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. Is it the people making the game? Is the people in front of the camera? It's hard to say, so Blizzard, the company behind World of Warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. They've even hired Duncan Jones, the creative genius behind Moon and Source Code. With the game company and a good director in tow, does Warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem?We begin in the fictional world of the orcs, Dreanor, where the planet is dying. Several orc clans follow the direction Gul'dan (played by Daniel Wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into Durotan, the world of the humans. One of the orcs that made it, Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell) joins Gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. The humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper).Top knight commander Sir Anduin Lothar (played by Travis Fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. He starts to work with a mage (magical person) Khadgar (played by Ben Schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard Medivh (played by Ben Foster). They gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. While scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman Ganrona (played by Paula Patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. Meanwhile, Khadgar is questioning the intentions of Gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time.Did you get all of that? I hope so, because Warcraft spews A LOT of fantasy elements that I assume are from the source material. I'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. The problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. This seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil.Now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in Warcraft. The motion-capture and CGI is some of the best I've seen. They way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. The story of orc Durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. I could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. They only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot. I'll give this three copies of World of Warcraft out of ten. If the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. Warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. Even if I did know the material, I doubt the movie would still be good.",3,16,31,14 June 2016
13 Hours," 13 Hours is not a serious geopolitical story, but rather a serviceable action war story
","Most Americans have the notion that they have the greatest military and strategic force. Combining their strength, training, and overwhelmingly patriotic attitude, and a solider is supposedly no match for a Taliban or a member of ISIS. The heart seems to be in the right place, but often we forgot to consider the hearts of those that are not American. I'm also a supporter of the strong military defenses and the people that fill those dirty boots. Though now that I've studied abroad, I've gotten a better idea that most countries have their own patriotic slogans with none that read, 'We're number two!'.It's not just the military bases that are all over the world, but the various CIA, FBI and simple representatives of the U.S.A. that are so frequent, that it's no wonder that they've gotten the nickname, 'police of the world'. In a way, it's true as they are seemingly ready for any kind of attack or initiative to help regardless if help from America is wanted. One such response came from Islamic militia's when they assaulted on two American compounds in Benghazi in 2012, including one where the U.S. Ambassador lived. Their story is told by Michael Bay in 13 Hours.In early 2012, Navy SEAL Jack Da Silva (played by John Krasinski) is returning to Benghazi to take up a security post for the nearby CIA Annex along with six other SEALS whose job is to be 'last responders' to any trouble that their building or the nearby ambassador may be facing. The country of Libya has just gone through a revolution that has taken down a long-standing dictator. One vice has been traded for another as various gangs have seized control of the former dictators weapons, turning Benghazi into a warzone as several sides fight to claim the city in their honors.Even with an incident arriving into the country, Jack and the other security team don't face much trouble until September 11th. The day is being remembered for the tragedies that happened in 2001, but local Islamic groups have decided to use this day to make their mark. The ambassador's house is attacked and the security team there is overwhelmed by groups that we would later identify as the early ISIS. Jack is scrambling with the other guys as they hear from their leader Tyrone Woods (played by James Badge Dale) that he wants the guys to defy their rules in order to try and save the ambassador. A story like 13 Hours seems like the kind of serious geopolitical story that would have caught the interest of Kathryn Bigelow or Clint Eastwood. But it surprised me that Michael Bay, whose mostly known for his Transformers movies, wanted to take a stab at this historical story. His first attempt at a historical story, Pearl Harbor, suffered from inaccuracies, childish dialogue, and a romance that had nothing to do with the actual event. None of that (almost none...there is still some silly writing) is evident here as Michael Bay has decidedly gone with a more 'fact-for-fact' basis. The 'fact-for-fact' definition is what probably happened during the attacks. So for those that were hoping for more on the political issue, you'll be disappointed. At least Bay does put his focus on the attacks, which actually do have some well staged war action. Action fans will probably be satisfied, though one thing was missing for me that this movie really needed; relatable characters. Most of the six solders are all the same 'macho military' stereotypes that do little to distinguish themselves (it doesn't help that all of them have beards, making it hard to tell them apart).I'll give this five Libyan flags out of ten. I was surprised with how mature Michael Bay is trying to be with this real life story. It's a shame he still can't shake off his bad writers from giving him a suitable screenplay that might give him a bigger chance to shine. 13 Hours is a serviceable action film rather then a genuine look into a major political issue on the right of the U.S. to be in a place where their not wanted. I might have been closer to enjoying this had it been twenty minutes shorter. I can't give it too much trouble for trying it's hardest and giving us something rather then nothing.",5,6,19,20 January 2016
Sully," The story of the 'Miracle on the Hudson' is interestingly recreated with grace in Sully
","People often forget that when their riding an airplane (specifically, a commercial airliner), their sitting on top of a major carrier of fuel that it were to crash, would likely explode. This shouldn't discourage people from flying as such a profession requires finding everything that could go wrong and making sure nothing can happen. Aside from terrorists that have tragically used them as weapons, most plane crashes tend to be mechanical. Engineers before the takeoff can find most of these glitches. In the case of something going wrong in the air, most planes can simply head back to their original airport and try to land at a nearby one. If all of the above is available, then the people on the plane better hope that the pilot can find a place to land. Though these things rarely happen, most of these forced landings or crashes tend to end badly. Though there is the occasional miracle.In 2009, a US Airways plane was forced to make a water landing when their engine was struck by birds. Not only did the plane land alright, but Captain Chesley Sullenberger managed to save everyone on board. The story of that crash and the aftermath are the subject of Sully.As history is recreated, we see Captain Chesley Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks) and his first Officer Jeffrey Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) getting ready to depart from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina. For Sully, this is just another routine flight in his thirty years of flying experience. He's discussed retirement soon so that he can spend more time with his wife Lorraine (played by Laura Linney) and his two daughters. Just as his flight is ascending, both engines are struck by a flock of birds, rendering them broken with the plane unable to restart them.He makes the decision to water land after deciding that trying to get back to LaGuardia or another airport was not doable. Though the crew and passengers are frightened, Sully manages to get them all out safely. Sully is seen as a hero by the press and get's several bookings to talk about it from Katie Couric to David Lettermen. Though suffering post traumatic stress and experiencing nightmares, he seems to be pulling through. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating whether Sully had made the right call and even holds a large meeting to determine whether his decision was correct or he should give up his wings (doing so would prevent retirement pension).Sully sounds straightforward and it pretty much is the kind of reenactment one would expect. Given the Hollywood budget, they manage give us a pretty good sequence of the plane landing in the water and the rescue of the people. Though a good part of the movie is about that crash, the real focus of the story is surrounding Sully's aftermath and the investigation he was under. With the 'Miracle on the Hudson' story surrounding the press, I had no idea that Sully was questioned about his actions. Director Clint Eastwood brings the same dark style that he brought to Gran Torino and Jersey Boys and I think he finally understands that too much of it makes the experience unpleasant. The story is short at only an hour and a half, but it's the right length. Though it's story is good, the editing is very odd. There are several moments where it chooses to sporadically cut to Sully's youth or of the crash. Some are short, but some are very long, which makes you question just what the intention of the flow was. I think this would have been better had it been shown straightforward without the time jumps.I'll give this seven airline captains hats out of ten. In the end, I was glad that I saw this miracle on the Hudson story to life. While not necessarily a strong commentary about the airline industry nor a dive into captain psyche, Sully is an engaging story about one man's decision. Plus with Tom Hanks, you know you're gonna get a good performance. I'd say check it out if you heard about the story and wanted to know more. Board on and hope for the best.",7,0,1,28 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant serves to be a fun blockbuster about the xenomorphs rather then a groundbreaking game changer that Alien was
","A couple of years ago, Ridley Scott returned to the Alien franchise  with Prometheus. The movie was meant to be a story set within the same  universe to dive into some of the more mysterious elements of Alien  like the fossilized space-jockeys and what they were doing with a bunch  of facehugger eggs. The response from fans was mixed. Some thought it a  nice return to what made the Alien series work. Some thought it was a  boring and pretentious story that only asked more question. I still  stand by the beauty of Prometheus and the material that it expands  upon.  The newest movie is something of a response from Scott to some of the  complaints from before like the lack of xenomorphs and more of a  connection to the earlier films. I think Scott realized that in order  to keep his fanbase, he had to be sure that the new stories wouldn't  steer too far from the original. The problem that I see is that despite  the addition of new characters and more background on the company that  wants the alien, the film is going to succumb to it's horror-like  slasher clichés. Does Alien: Covenant add anything new to this world?  In 2104, a ship called the Covenant is bound for a remote planet for a  colony mission. Though the overall trip is being maintained by android  Walter (played by Michael Fassbender), the crew, the two thousand  colonists and a thousand embryos have remained in hyper sleep for some  time. A sudden neutrino storm hits the ship, forcing the computer to  awaken the crew and stabilize the craft, but not before the captain  dies when his hyper sleep pod malfunctions. This makes Christopher Oram  (played by Billy Crudup) the new captain with his first orders to make  the necessary repairs to continue.  The ships picks up a signal from an unknown planet that not only seems  to be habitual for human use, but is close enough that the crew would  not have to go back to sleep. Despite objections from the former  captain's wife Dany (played by Katherine Waterston), the crew vote to  head down to explore the new region. Except for the pilot Tennessee  (played by Danny McBride) whose still in space, the crew finds a world  that seems to be breathable along with plentiful sources of water. They  then come across a similar ship that had been found in Alien and  Prometheus. Looks like we've got trouble.   I can already say that Alien: Covenant is an entertaining movie that's  ultimately good. Good but not great. In fact, this has the same  distinction of the original Alien where the first half, before the  aliens appear, being better then the action orientated second half. A  lot of that has to do with the fact that Scott not only knows how to  build a high sense of mysteriousness with such a beautifully shot world  to dive into, but he always casts well to build a set of likable  characters.   Much of what we see deals with the relationships the characters have  with each other and their significant others. Danny McBride and Michael  Fassbender bring a lot of needed humanity and occasional humor. The  only one who I wanted more time with was Dany. You get a background of  her, but I don't know what I could tell you of her personality.   Without giving anything away, the plot dwells into territory that makes  it an interesting sequel to Prometheus. We definitely get some more  answers about the past of the space-jockeys and even some background on  the xenomorphs. This unfortunately does clash with some of the  established continuity.   The xenomorphs looks amazing and are fun to watch as they make their  kills. Scott still understands the rule that you never give away too  much too soon. I wish that not only more new elements were brought to  the monster, but the final fight does seem too familiar of the previous  films. It gets trapped within its own slasher tropes when you can kind  of tell which characters are going to die. I would think that Scott  would be able to bring a new spin to how the Alien movies can conclude.  I'll give this six facehuggers out of ten. Rather then offering a major  game changer to the science fiction genre, Ridley Scott has given us an  entertaining Alien movie. There's nothing wrong with a movie that seems  to exist to make the fans happy and I hope this entertains a lot of  people. Take a look for yourself (but watch out for the facehuggers).",6,1,7,19 May 2017
The Martian," The Martian is the scientifically sound space thriller that Interstellar should have been
","Castaway is my favorite 'stuck on a desert island' story. It was an almost one-man story about a guy surviving with the skills he has. He's not a genius, but he uses what he has (coconuts and anything washed up from the crashed Fed-Ex Plane). There's no villain or McGuffin device that could save him. Castaway knew that it had to play things simply. That, along with most desert island stories, take their inspiration from the Robinson Cruise novel that turned the simple premise into an engaging genre that has been repeated over and over. It's usually easy to make up the story by simply choosing the location.You set the story on an island, then anybody has a chance to survive. Put the story in space, then your character, no matter how intelligent they are, will be facing a bigger challenge. Food and drink would be a problem as space has nothing that a human being would be able to live by. Shelter would be another issue as you only have enough oxygen for so long. Speaking of oxygen, even air would be troubling. For a Mars-set The Martian, it's going to have to take a very resourceful Matt Damon to solve this.Sometime in the near future, the NASA-bound Ares III crew on Mars has done well with collecting samples that they hope to study on Earth. A sudden storm hits the red planet where the crew, including commander Melissa (played by Jessica Chastain), Rick (played by Michael Peña), Beth (Played by Kate Mara) struggle to get to their escape ship. Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) gets struck by debris and is presumed dead. The crew launch off the planet, mourning their loss before starting their return mission to Earth. Mark wakes up in a sand pile and manages to make it back to the artificial habitat, unable to make contact with NASA with the communication equipment all destroyed. He calculates that it will take four years for another mission to reach him. Before attempting find a different way to get any message home, he uses his skills as a botanist to try and make enough food and water to last the next long period with only disco music as his source of entertainment.Back on Earth, head of NASA Teddy (played by Jeff Daniels) already announces Marks death before other engineers Vincent (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mindy (played by Mackenzie Davis) see that they have an astronaut to rescue.Last year's so-called scientifically accurate Interstellar seemed to capture a lot of people's imagination except mine. The Martian accomplishes that scientific accuracy while boasting a better story and more interesting characters. Matt Damon seems like a more human character then Matthew McConaughey's monologue spewing borefest. Even though he's a genius, Damon still seems at home enough that we along with him would work as he does, get hungry as he does, and become angry as he does. Damon comes really close to rivaling Tom Hank's Castaway performance.Unlike Castaway's one-man show, The Martian boasts a huge cast that surprisingly never becomes over crowded. Everyone fits their shoes and plays their part in this one guy's journey to make it home. I may not be an astronaut, but The Martian also reminded me why I made those annual trips to Space Camp. The movie shows how cool these intelligent people can be with what they can make. I won't say what he does to survive, but it seems so believable, that I wonder how much of a part the real NASA played in creating it's plausible situation.I'll give this nine Mars artificial habitats out of ten. The Martian only has one goal in it's story and that all it needed. This movie is my Interstellar and should hopefully even turn those individuals to see why that Christopher Nolan story was drab while this Ridley Scott movie is awesome. This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of 2015.",9,2,9,7 October 2015
Furious 7," With with right set of hands on the ignition and an acceleration for car stunts, Furious 7 takes the franchise to unbound heights.
","Last year, the world lost actor Paul Walker. His persona carried plenty of charisma that belonged in action movies. I place him within this genre as I haven't seen enough of his other work to make a fair assessment. Work like Brick Masons and Eight Below are not the best examples I can give, but they did prove that the man could carry a story throughout. He'll be remembered for his contribution to The Fast and Furious series; a series that I doubt anyone in Hollywood would have bet that this would go beyond it's street racing roots into something far larger.As said, the first film has it's moments, but it's nothing like future sequels that would take the problems I had, fix them and yet keep what it's most famous for; car stunts. Car action movies have been around forever (Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run and Death Race 2000 come to mind), but Fast & Furious, Fast 5 and Furious 6 have now established the franchise as one of the most successful blockbusters and perhaps even one of the best action movies ever. Somehow, the makers of the latest movie figured out how to work around the death of Paul Walker and deliver us Furious 7, my new favorite of this continuing series. After the events in London (Furious 6), Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (played by Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew have returned to Los Angeles to settle down and live like the family they've always wanted. Unfortunately, Luke Hobbs (played by Jason Statham) is the older brother of the previous film's villain and he's out for revenge. This leads to fellow crewmember Han's death in Tokyo (another previous film) along with a planted bomb that nearly kills the crew. Toretto goes after Shaw and engages in a fight, but is beaten by the latter's martial art skills and manages to slip away as a covert ops teams comes in. Led by Frank Petty (played by Kurt Russell), he makes a deal with Toretto that should he and his crew manage to track an evil warlord, he will help find Shaw again. Toretto agrees and his team head for the Caucasus Mountains where they fail to get the wanted warlord, but manage to rescue a hacker named 'Ramsey'. They then go to Abu Dabi to retrieve the 'God's Eye' software that could track the people their looking for. With each new location comes a test in physics and awesomeness with the continuous car stunts and kung fu fighting.You would think that it would be easy to compare this to the continuous nonstop dumb action from the Transformers, but I would actually put this along the sleek coolness nonstop action of James Bond. Furious 7 somehow keeps it's car stunts from becoming boring and even manages to make me jealous. As I sat munching my pop corn, watching Vin Diesel crash his car through two skyscrapers, I got lost within the excitement, wishing that I could do all of this even though it's probably impossible by the laws of physics. The story is also pretty goodor at least as good as this kind of movie will get. It may be a revenge story and something that's nothing groundbreaking, it really is like a James bond movie with it's exotic locations and further use of high tech weaponry. Perhaps The Fast and the Furious will leave a mark on Hollywood Blockbuster history after all. Finally, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end is beautiful, fitting, and something that I will not give away.I'll give this ten supercars out of ten. Furious 7 is the super charged car ride you want, the revenge thriller you want, the far out travel story you want, and most importantly, the emotional Paul Walker tribute you'll want. Grab your keys and get to that theater!",10,1,4,8 April 2015
