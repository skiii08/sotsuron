Casablanca," Tough crowd
","If Casablanca is only 8.8 out of 10, this is a really tough crowd.I have seen the movie over 50 times and I find something new every time. It always amazes me what moods and shades the directors and cameramen could create with black-and-white. (The only good thing about seeing the colorized version is that I had never before realized that the thing hanging on the wall in Capt. Renault's office is a map of Africa.) If I ever own a bar, it will be called 'La Belle Aurore'.Much as I love Bogie and Bergman, my favorite actor in the movie is Clusde Rains. He gets very few gags, but he's the perfect straight man for the zingers written for Bogie.",10,1,3,26 July 2006
