The Avengers," Sigh i knew this was over-hyped. Absurd rating. A disgrace to filmmaking
","I finally watched this film after much anticipation and this movie is nothing but over-hyped, overpraised garbage. IMDb you should be a shamed by letting all these obviously underaged virgins that wouldn't know true filmmaking if it bitchslapped them in the face. All you people are concerned with is special effects and unnecessary action. If those two elements are in a film for you the character development, creative ideas, acting, script, and cinematography doesn't matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking. This amateur film is currently rated 101 on IMDb. So you suggesting that this film is better than Batman Begins, Heat, Pans Labyrinth, Blade Runner, Rosemary's baby, The Deer Hunter, Jaws, Warrior, Let the right one in and the list goes on. If you think that 'The Avengers', is better than the small list of films I mentioned then I feel sorry for you because you are mixed up in that group I mentioned earlier. All the other truly brilliant films that are being unappreciated you still have one true film aficionado that will always separate the great from the garbage.",1,11,41,28 September 2012
