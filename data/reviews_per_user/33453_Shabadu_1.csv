The Blair Witch Project," Great flick setting a new standard for the horror genre
","Neither the trailers for this movie, nor the multitude of print and television advertisements managed to paint much of a picture for the Blair Witch Project.  And that was only part of its brilliance.  The atmosphere and tone set throughout the movie forced me to share the terror with the cast.  The most frightening thing about this movie is the fact that it is completely plausible.  It actually could have happened!",Null,0,2,5 August 1999
