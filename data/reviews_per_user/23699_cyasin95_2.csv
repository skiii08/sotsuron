The Avengers," Most overrated movie of all time
","The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 8.5 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy.",1,16,28,28 August 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Flawless!
","Silence of the lambs was nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece. It is perhaps one of the most captivating and enthralling movies in history.The cast was perfect, Jodie fosters Sterling was epic, but Anthony Hopkins performance will linger and echo in our heads for ages to come.He depicts the perfect ice cold cannibalistic psychopath. He manages to be nefariously sadistic yet gentle and complacent at the same time. The on screen chemistry between Hopkins and Foster is remarkable. Hopkins manages to make Lector such an intricate and mesmerizing character. Foster gives Sterling just the right amount of timidness and courage.Easily one of the best movies of all time. This film is perhaps one of the most successful Book to film projects ever.",10,2,3,29 August 2012
