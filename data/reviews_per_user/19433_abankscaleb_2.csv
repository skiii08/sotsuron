Skyfall," one of the best in the series
","so, i went and saw skyfall yesterday, and i came to one conclusion. this is one of the best in the series. this one really does good to the style of bond, which in my opinion is what made the bond movies so good. i have grown up with the james bond movies, and have seen all of them many times. casino royal was OK, but i was so very disappointing with quantum of solice. quantum didn't feel like a bond movie, and it also wasn't written very good. skyfall brings back his old school corny one liners, and just everything about it felt like a bond movie. in my opinion goldfinger is still my all time favorite, but skyfall is right up there with it. so, if you are a fan of the old james bond, and you haven't seen skyfall yet, you are missing out everyday you aren't going to see it. i hope my review is good enough, and hope it helps.",10,8,20,19 November 2012
Prometheus," Good, but not amazing
","So i made the mistake by walking into the theater thinking that this movie would lead right up into Alien. When i first saw it i was so let down. I remember waking out of the theater disappointed. Well when it came out on DVD, i decided to give it another chance, now that i knew what to expect. Well now, i think it was a good movie, i would have made some adjustments to it if i would have made it. It has a good story, and it is pretty exciting in some areas. I have watched it a couple of times, and i learned something new every time. Basically, if you haven't seen it, and you think it will lead up to alien, just don't think that before you watch it. Just enjoy it as its own movie, and you wont be disappointed. I just personally would have made it alittle different, which still kinda bug me, but whatever its still a pretty good movie",10,2,6,6 November 2012
