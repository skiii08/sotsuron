Whip It," So pleasantly surprised
","I really did enjoy this film. The entire premise and plot is hokey as hell but there is some chemistry or je ne sais quoi that makes it work.From the silly ass team names to the sophomoric player names, the busted-ass restaurant and that pathetic restaurant manager there should be non-stop reasons to hate this film. I don't. Sometimes art just lives of it's own accord.Kudos to Barrymore, obviously the most talented and intelligent of the entire Barrymore clan.I don't like Page but I have to admit that she did grow on me through the escapade. Would I be a hack if I thought the best line not delivered in the film was when Harden asked Page if she was really doing the pageant for herself and Page could have said, 'I wish it was for me.' Too much? I dunno.Give it a watch.",8,0,3,31 January 2010
John Wick," Lots of action, no suspense, no acting, no original plot
","Did you see Payback? Then stop now because there's nothing new to see and even less talented actors.If you just want body count, then you're set with this one.If you want a script, actors and decent direction, you've already wasted too much time reading this review.Are you a Keanu fan? Well, you might not be the only one but it's a small crowd. This is even more Keanu than even Keanu is worthy of. You'll see.Why did I give it a 6? Because it wasn't quite bad enough to turn off. I might have even given a 7 but the ending screwed that off. He didn't pick up a stray - HE STOLE SOMEONE'S PET FROM THE VET. If the friggin' dog was so important then why didn't he at least take one like what he lost. I call bullship on that scene. Why? Just, why?",6,2,7,4 April 2015
Trouble with the Curve," Can I have my two hours back? Please?
","Although I won't rate it as unwatchable, I would never recommend this film. Clint has become a one-dimensional character in his later years. How much range is there to crotchety old man? Between the gasping whispers and hoarse-voiced vitriol, there is not much else there. Amy Adams brings nothing to this. She can't even be bothered to bring her cute to the front and give us something to watch. Flat, vague, misdirected, and bored, she left me waiting for something, anything to latch onto to make me care about this character and the story. I don't think Justin has much of a future in films unless his next project is just amazingly directed. He was so shallow as to be nothing more than eye candy for the girls who are forced to watch this with their boyfriends.John Goodman is always solid but even he couldn't rescue this snooze- fest. I kept waiting for something that I knew viscerally wasn't going to happen. Just the optimist in me, I guess.From the very beginning I felt that I had seen this film so many times before. Father estranged from daughter, daughter has grown up emotionally unavailable (which they felt they had to blatantly point out), father and daughter are forced into a situation requisite with a bonding moment, rejection, reconciliation, reconstituted love, yada, yada, yada. Oh, and hook it all up with a catchy folk song: You Are My Sunshine. Whether it ended up on the cutting room floor (most likely with running time at 1:54) or Lorenz thought he was slick, there was no explanation or reason why JT showed up at the end to rescue Amy's love. A true saccharin moment for what?C'mon. Really, c'mon.",5,1,3,18 March 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Absolutely brilliance technicals with so-so script.
","I agree with most of the other reviewers that this was an amazing technical achievement. The CGI was flawless, feeling less like CGI and more like 'real life animation'. The textures were intense and the motion spot on.I would say this movie is Firefly (Serenity) meets Star Wars. Pratt was gorgeous, cheeky and strong. Zoe looks much better as my sweet brown baby than as greeny. Rocket, a raccoon, really? A fun character but single-handedly responsible for the loss of one star in the ratings. All I could hear in my head when he was on screen is the Beatles 'Rocky Racoon'. Sheesh. Oh, and Karen Gillan is very cute but in this character she is shrill, emaciated and weak. Wish Selfie was renewed... Sorry, I digress. I really didn't appreciate Groot until about 1:30 or so. Then I loved him. BTW, waste of a paycheck to cast Vin there.The story is well worn and predictable and most of the script from 1:00 to 1:40 or so is detrimental to the entire experience it cost another star. Those two points are the reason for the other two missing ratings stars.So, Chris Pratt +2, CGI +4, technical fun +3, cohesive cast +1, story -1, script -1, raccoon, -1. Overall I did enjoy my two hours in the chair and 3D was a lot of fun.Cheers!",7,0,3,14 December 2014
Mother!," Utter. Horse. Dookie.
",I have to retain two stars because I loved the work that Jen and Jav did. It was intriguing enough - just barely - to keep me in my seat. My bud got up and left during Jen's beat-down scene and I was about to follow him when the beating stopped. Then it went even more down the rabbit hole.Robin Williams once said that a Writer/Director/Producer is the only creature on earth that can blow smoke up it's own asspirin. I am truly a believer of that now more than ever. (Had to use Asspirin 'cuz the believers won't let me write the real thing.) Shame on you Aronofsky. Shame! *ding* Shame! *ding* Shame! *ding*,2,20,33,18 September 2017
Fast Five," Expectations low, check. Disappointment, well, no.
","I've seen all the others so I was expecting nothing more and possibly less. I was not disappointed. Action, action and more action, YES! Acting, direction, story, ehh. Who cares: they destroyed more cars in 60 seconds than I ever thought possible. The Rock was in top physical condition compared to a flabby and fast aging Vin Diesel. The brawl was so darkly shot that I suppose they could have been naked mud wrestling and nobody would have been the wiser.Overall, fast and fun. Do not expect ANYONE to win ANY awards for ANYTHING that happened here; just let it flow over you. BTW, are foley artists retarded? Beer in a bottle being tipped back for a drink does not sound like a half-filled bottle of water being inverted. And, not every motion has to have some artificial sound effect attached to it. Much more satisfying is the slight sucking sound as the bottle leaves the lips and a mild belch following. Pullleeez.Ciao, babies.",6,0,1,1 December 2011
