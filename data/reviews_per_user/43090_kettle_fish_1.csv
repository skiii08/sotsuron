Skyfall," Awful
","Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Mendes tried so hard, and I respect him for it, especially with him being one of my favourite directors. You could see with every scene in Skyfall him trying to inject his usual brilliance, the emotion and absolute conviction of what truth is to be said that makes his other films so varied, dynamic and meaningful. Most of the directing was fantastic. But the script and the story were too majorly flawed for it to be in any way a decent film. Acting from the usually brilliant Javier Bardem was questionable throughout, almost parody-villain, and whilst the rest of the tip top cast tried their hardest, by the end their character motivations were so strained and to the point of absurdity that what starts as a dull and uninspiring romp just ends up becoming confused. The dialogue was wooden and in hurriedly tripping over its own feet to be sexy, sassy and 007 it became a caricature of a caricature of dialogue from previous films. The interesting exploration of who Bond really is that made Casino Royale so delectable has definitely been shrugged off, to be replaced by a Bond so depressed by his own existence you wonder what's the point in even watching him. There were some fun jokes and moments of nostalgia that made you smile (though even the nostalgia was overdone) but other than that it was a complete and utter mess. It was better than Quantum of Solace, but that's not really saying much.",1,36,77,29 October 2012
