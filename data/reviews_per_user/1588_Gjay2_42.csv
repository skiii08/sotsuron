The Devil's Advocate," boring as hell
","i saw this film about three years ago and remember being completely untouched by it all. The main memory i have is of al pacino being creepy, some naked women towards the end. Oh and the most hysterically guilty laughter i've ever had. It is during such a sad scene, and keanu is crying, and hahahahahahahahahaa, oh man, i felt so bad. The guy looked like he'd been constipated for two years, then all of a sudden it all came out. It was hilarious. Anyway, it cracked me up, but that's the only bit worth watching of this tedius film.",1,7,34,26 March 2003
The Blair Witch Project," the woods will never be the same again
","A lot of people tell me that they did not find the blair witch project scary in anyway shape or form. I later found out that most of these people had seen it in the cinema so what do they expect. You can not be truly scared when you are surrounded by loads of other people, eating and coughing and walking in and out all the time. So i waited for it to come to video. And when it arrived, i rented it, went home, waited till midnight, closed one set of curtains, left another set open, turned off all the lights and plugged in my big headphones. Now that is the best way to view this film, because after it had finished, i found myself running up the stairs, straight into the bathroom just so i could lock the door behind me. The Blair Witch Project chilled me to the bone. When i was younger, i played a lot in my local woods, and sometimes i would be afraid of what lurked in them, so this film attacked that fear with a vengeance. The performances (improvisations) were very real, aswell as the atmosphere. The attitudes the three characters had were believable, very human unlike most other horror films. And with my headphones on, each footstep, shout and the quiet cracking of twigs could be heard, which made it more chilling, as it's the almost unhearable sounds which create the scares. So if you're gonna watch this movie, do it right, be brave and watch it on your own with the lights off. I think everyone who didn't like it would have a different perspective if they watched it like that.",10,2,3,17 May 2002
Requiem for a Dream," a turning point
","from the first two minutes, you know what we have here is a different kind of picture. the split screen, the drama, the optimism. something, somewhere is gonna go wrong, and we are all gonna be dragged down with it. then the score kicks in over the arty still shots of the beach area. it's a magnificent start. aronofsky knows how to tell a story. going back and forth being each little tale with a simplicity so reassuring, you can just fall back and watch, without having to scratch your head with where you are at. his visual techniques may not be totally unique and original but in the context he uses them in, and the rapid fire approach in which they happen, it becomes truly hypnotising. and the score just adds to the hallucinations you are seeing on screen. ultimately yes, it's depressing. characters downward spiralling towards a doom they cant stop becomes difficult to watch, but difficult to take your eyes from. and the drama becomes more and more intense as the movie draws to it's eye blinding, fit inducing climax. a solid script with flexible and assured direction is all brought to head with the performances. jared leto has never been or looked better. jennifer connely is beautifully tortured as the fix needing girlfriend. marlon wayans, in a dramatic turn for him, does superbly well, and a big cheer for ellen burstyn who portrays sara goldfarb with enormous conviction.a difficult film but one worth anyones time.",8,0,1,26 July 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," there aren't enough words to describe this film
","Being 21 years old, i remember this film being on every christmas when i was a youngster, so aswell as being one of my favourite films of all time, it's also one of the most nostalgic. I'm sure this is the case for many fans of this superb film. You all know the story, but to me the story is just the backbone to the movie. The real brilliance comes from Spielberg who's heart truly shines throughout. The photography and mood he creates are mesmerizing, the performances and direction of the actors could not be topped. And the ending could not be better. But i can't just praise Spielberg, because with him comes the most brilliant composer. Take a bow John Williams. The music that accompanies this movie is unforgettable, throwing in the atmosphere by the bucketload, and plus,this is the man to blame for the tears that we always find filling up our eyes at the finale, it's his music that creates the sadness and the longing for E.T and Elliot. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and i can't wait to see it on the big screen again in march. Forget the fact that this was supposed to be a kids film, and just let yourself be amazed at Spielberg's best movie ever.",10,2,4,10 February 2002
Minority Report," can spielberg make a bad film?
","being a huge spielberg fan, i knew this would be a great movie. And with tom cruise aboard, how could it fail?. In short it doesn't, it almost does, but there is no doubt that this is a modern classic. You all probably know the plot, but for those who haven't seen the film, don't go in thinking this is a huge action film like the trailer boasts. Don't get me wrong, there is action, but it doesn't over populate the film. It focuses on character and story. And all the better for it. As always, the brilliant John Williams is on music duty, and instead of driving the movie with his score, he makes it more suttle and quiet, providing a backdrop to a scene, that is quite frankly, gorgous. And Spielberg again, shows why he is the best director in the business. Some of the camera work and design of the shots are fantastic, and the acing which he gets out of the actors is superb. Tom Cruise is great as the flawed drug abusing John Anderton, but he has competition in the best actor stakes. As an opposing federal agent, Colin Farrell steals almost every scene with his cool, determind gum chewing character Danny Witwer. He plays the role with such confidence, it's hard not to dislike him. After the first two hours of mayhem and confusion, it slows down a gear, which for some people may drag the film down. I certainly felt a bit funny when it changed from ace futuristic thriller into an almost cliched who-dunnit crime drama, and maybe Spielberg played his all too familiar sentiment card too much, but it certainly weakens one of the best films in recent years. But despite the change of pace, on second viewing, the ending does work, but it still felt just a tad too long. But by the end, you are willing to forgive it for the minor setback, because the previous 2 hours are just brilliant, in every possible way. Can Spielberg make a bad film?",7,1,2,6 July 2002
Se7en," how more films should be
","i don't think cinema has ever been the same since the film seven took the world by storm. Almost every serial killer thriller since has tried to imitate sevens unique blend of darkness, mood, and ability to disturb. But none has and will ever come close to this. The build up of tension throughout the movie is like nothing else, and when it all finally snaps in the last few minutes, you're left with nothing but a sour taste in your dry mouth. Director fincher, knows how to pull an emotional punch, and he uses his actors like puppets. Masterfully crafting their performances to hyper realistic proportions. Every twist and turn in the story is done brilliantly, with the script being that rare thing of intelligence, wit, and both a good, and evil heart. Kevin Spacey comes across as almost sympathetic. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make a highly convincing pair of detectives, and the supporting cast are equally as brilliant. But the best part of the entire film is the ending, with it's great un-hollywood approach. I won't say anymore but it's an ending to cherish.",10,0,0,24 March 2003
Unbreakable," brilliantly alright
","as a follow up to his massive sixth sense movie. Shyamalan gave us this tale of a man who begins to think he's unbreakable. It's a captivating plot, and a highly intriguing angle in which he tells the story, but it lacks something. And that is general enjoyment. It's slowly spun, testing the patience, and i was fine with it. It drove me in to it's little mystery. It's directed brilliantly, he truly is a film maker of the highest calibre, but beneath the technical brilliance of it, lies a story which doesn't really pay off. Like the sixth sense, there are millions of huge plot holes that destroy any realism it tries to create. And despite the occasional magic moment, it just seems a trek to get through.Performance wise, it's spot on, everything is. If only it was paced and structured a little better. I think the score becomes the most memorable part of the movie. Shyamalan and composer james newton howard, are the new spielberg and john williams. Well lets hope so.",7,1,1,26 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," a one man show
","a few months ago i stumbled across the poster for this little ditty. and without a second thought, lumped it down to being rubbish. so months later when it comes out to rave reviews, i was suprised to say the least. a good pirate movie? never. but i went to see it. and what can i say, i enjoyed it immensily. a good old fashioned pirate yarn for the modern audience could be difficult to get off the ground, but this film has everything a story needs. drama, intrigue, scares, action, and most unexpectedly, comedy. this movie is as funny as it is adventurous. the script on paper may not be so funny, but the actors add their own humourous invention to it. with johnny depp stealing every frame he's ever in. with his drunken swagger and delivery of lines, he becomes the king of comedy. the most refreshing character seen in years, and by far the most memorable ting about this picture. with decent support and a thrilling storyline pirates comes out storming. a tad head scratching at times due to lots and lots going on on screen. but the overall enjoyment of it seems to blot all that out.oscar nom for johnny depp? lets hope so",6,0,1,16 August 2003
Finding Nemo," ocean epic
","pixar have so far produced a quite astounding streak of great movies. since toy story through to finding nemo, they have not made a fluff piece of cinema yet. and finding nemo only builds on their previous efforts. the animation here is awe inspiring. it's layered and brilliantly colourful. the visuals alone can keep you entertained for the duration. but thankfully there is even more depth do it. the story and narrative are equally as astounding. a simple yarn thrown into the deep of the sea, it tells the story of a father fish trying to find his child fish. thats it. yet it's more exciting and intelligent than 90% of movies released monthly. with finely tuned comedic performances from the voices, and a general knowing in what pushes are emotional buttons, nemo never dulls from start to finish. it's hilarious, moving, intense, wonderous and clever and i dare say that adults would probably enjoy it more than the toddlers they brought to the film. a wise choice for this picture was changing the composer of the score. moving to thomas newman, of american beauty and road to perdition fame, the score touches all the right notes, and never goes cheesy like ole randy newman used to do. i really hope thomas will score future pixar movies.a delight, difficult to top. but pixar have never dissapointed us yet.",10,0,1,25 October 2003
Dead Poets Society," carpe diem indeed
","it's a pure, absolute picker-upper of a movie. It should be handed out by therapists to their depressed and undriven patients. The script is rich, and as poetic as the existing poetry in the film. While Peter Weir's direction is restrained, it all makes the settings more natural and believable. And he draws out some remarkable performances.It's a pristine story of a new english teacher who gradually opens his students eyes on how to live. By their own rules, instincts and impulses. And when the brilliant lectures come out of robin williams, it's like he's talking straight to the viewer. Asking us to ask ourselves if we are doing enough to make our lives truly extraordinary. And it all works so damn well. Coming off best are williams, ethan hawke, and robert sean leanard, who's fate is enough to move the most stone of heart. The best film of that year. Almost became second best in the picker upper stakes, when american beauty was released in 1999, the only other film, to me anyways, that i think can inspire and move in equal measure.",10,0,2,2 April 2003
Insomnia," above average thriller
","The film is really really good. Gripping and complex, it does everything a good thriller should. It's hard to live upto a film like 'memento' but it's still a great movie. Al Pacino plays his usual cop with a past role with ease. And Robin Williams breezes through an unusual role for him. For once, he is the 'bad' guy, and he really does do well being creepy. All in all, a fab movie. But be patient, it may take awhile for some, to start enjoying it.",6,5,8,6 April 2003
The Terminator," when arnie was great
","i saw this when i was about 9 years old. It was the film which you tell your friends you've seen, so they would think you were cool.Complex plotting and some stellar action sequences make this a classic of the sci-fi genre. And no matter how cheap the effect look today, it still carries the same effect it did all those years ago. Although these days, seeing a character gun down cops by the dozen, isn't as shocking as i'm sure it would've been when this movie came out to the public. It shocks in more ways too, probably seen as a very daring film in it's day.Arnie does his best when he doesn't have to speak so much. Very cool in his black leather jacket, riding his motorcycle, he is as menacing as they come. Linda hamilton plays the helpless victim well and michael biehn fits the role of the hero comfortably. Dialogue may not be great, but the story is intact and tight enough to get the tension buzzing. Which it does superbly. Great film, strangely becomes cooler with age.",8,0,0,26 March 2003
Alien," the first and best
","to me, this is a film which, other than the haircuts, just doesn't age. The first film of the alien saga is easily the best. Or at least, the scariest. Pitting one alien against a crew of seven is a great set-up for some horrible and gruesome battles. But instead, it takes it further and draws the war out, singling out certain members as they leave the crowd, to face the creature on their own. It takes a good while before the action begins but all the build up it what makes the end result so utterly chilling. As soon as one of the main characters 'releases' the alien, you know it's only going to get better from there. The sound effects in this movie are the best use of noise ever put on screen. The wind effects, the spaceships, the alien, the computers all have memorable sounds, and the creature design for the alien has become legendary. Undoubtebly one of the scariest films ever made.",8,0,1,27 March 2003
Taxi Driver," destructive
","i bet most people who have seen this film, first saw it when they were a teenager, younger than the 18 certificate. I saw it at the age of 15, and did odd things to my teenage life. It made me bitter, angry, judgemental, and also gave me the ability to appreciate such art in a film. We all wanted to be travis bickle. And why? the guy is a loser with a desperation to put across his hatred of life unto others. In a strange way though he is a hero, and it rubs off on the audience. Scorsese hits a home run with this film, it's film-making of the highest calibre. It just looks dirty, and seedy, you can practically smell the pollution in the air. And paul schrader's soul searching script has never been equalled. And with de niro, here in his prime, pulling off an amazing turn as mr bickle, it's hard not to see why the film has become such a classic.",10,0,0,4 April 2003
Léon: The Professional," a symphony in film
","luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made.",7,299,390,25 April 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," what goes up, must come down
","you know the story. well, we all 'kind of' know the story. or maybe there isnt a story. or maybe there was a story. who knows. but it's a fact that the matrix trilogy could have been a cinematic extravaganza. it could have been the greatest trilogy that has ever been. but it's also a fact, and a remotely sad fact that it has become neither. quite tragically aswell.this third film was the one to rekindle the plot, and the hopes and joys of the millions of fans who were displeased with the matrix reloaded. this was to be the messiah among the trilogy. it's not the case. it is so not the case that it becomes absolutely stupid to even think that it is the case. the wachowski brothers have shovelled dirt in all our faces. whether or not they knew they were doing so, they shovelled. it's blindingly obvious that they didnt even try on this one. they put their efforts into the first film. both visually, mentally, and physically. in the second film, they lost all logic but managed to retain, and even up the action sequences. but with revolutions. they have disregarded all. the story has become drivel. the visuals dull and depressing. and the action sequences are now a mere blip on the action radar. gone is the astounding choreography of the kung fu, and in comes a ripped off sequence from aliens. and despite all of their millions of dollars into this so called sequence, aliens still comes off better.that is what is wrong with this picture. there is no kicking and punching. and that is what gave reloaded it's most thrilling moments.it all becomes clear during the final 'fight' between agent smith and neo. now we know they can pull off a neo vs hundreds of agents smith. so why the hell did we have to witness several hundred agents smiths all watching the fight?. why did they not join in? why oh god why was the final showdown so turgid. they had the potential to make something spectacular, and they blew it. and the use of slo-mo and big special effects in that final showdown become insanely dull. suffice to say the wachowski brothers will make another movie. but the question now is, will anyone actually care?",Null,0,0,12 November 2003
American Psycho," fab fab fab
","I've read the book, which was fantastic, so i, like most fans of the book, i expected the film to be an endless gore fest, focussing on the incredibly dark nature of Patrick Bateman. But, Mary Harron goes in a completely different way. Instead, she goes comedy, continually mocking the yuppies that plagued Wall Street. These people who have to fit in, where the people you're seen with and places you eat in are very very important. And the truth is, it works unbelievably well. Pat Bateman is the butt of the jokes, a man so scared of not fitting in, that his sanity is slipping fast. Killing for fun is his hobby. Throughout the comedy, there are plenty of dark moments to keep the hardcore fans happy, yet even they are done with a giggle. The film though would not be so good if it wasn't for Mary Harron. The Direction is first class, never rushing to tell the story, the camera work is marvellous, knowing when to move and when to keep still, it works perfectly, building an unparralelled atmosphere. But i have been saving the best till last. Two words, Christian Bale. He injects so much into this character, making him so very chilling and ridiculously funny with just the slightest of facial movements. His eyes say everything and that is a talent to behold. It's his dead pan deliveries 'i know my behavior can be a little...erratic sometimes' that make you fear him like death, and somehow make you burst out giggling too. The scenes between the detective and Patrick create sparks too, the way he goes from a cold, emotionless being to a dribbling sweating and nervous moron is superb. Very Good marks all round, it leaves a few questions in the end but it's worth all the confusion in the world. An underrated masterpiece.",8,1,2,14 February 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," different but worthwhile
","the first two terminator films are classics. so this third installment had a real good chance of ruining the whole effect. but i was actually suprised. although complex, the film actually fits with the story. and it leaves with something to think about as the end credits begin to roll. it's almost profound.it's no terminator 1, how could it be. and it's not even T-2 but i was 12 then, so nothing ever could be. but it is a damn good film. the action scenes are orchestrated just as good as cameron ever could have done. the actors are fair but nothing great. nick stahl proving the best as john conner. i suppose if you step back and look at it, it is different. john conner looks different and in a way, ruins the continuation. arnie now bears no resemblance to himself from T1, which makes it difficult to relate to the past story. but what i really missed. what i really thought should have been in the movie. was that great terminator score. not just the popular one but the theme they use during the chases of T2. if they coulda put that in over the action scenes here, it would've felt more like a terminator movie.but with these flaws, it doesnt stop you from enjoying what's on the screen. a slam bam action film that provides a thoughtful ending to the classic trilogy.",6,0,0,6 August 2003
American Beauty," almost poetic
","what an amazing movie. Truly the millenniums first classic slice of great cinema. This is as life defining, and as life altering as the fantastic dead poet's society. The film is wonderfully shot, and directed. Full of colour and jaw dropping gorgeousness. The movies score ranks as one of the most beautiful in film history. With it's quiet, sparkly piano's and echoey spooky synths. All the actors give great performances, most notably wes bentley, chris cooper, and of course kevin spacey. And the script, by alan ball, is precise and incredibly knowing of life's small but memorable moments. Put it all in a pot and you have a piece of art that can never be reapeated by anyone,anywhere ever.",9,0,0,23 March 2003
The Exorcist," nowonmai
","back in 1973, the exorcist had a profound effect on it's audience. people fleeing from screens to be sick. people claiming sleep depravation through reacurring nightmares from the film. people leaving the cinema because they were just too darn scared. so as a teenager living in britain. i became rather angry with the fact that it was a banned film over here. i read the book, but really wanted to see the film. it became a desire to do so. i finally got my chance when it became available back in 1999. and i was disappointed. on first viewing. my hype just blew the film up in my face. but on repeated viewings, it's got better and better. first things first. it's not the scariest film ever made. maybe back in the day. but now, it's too dated to be shocking and daring. we've seen things far worse in other movies. it is chilling though. the sounds effect of regan in the room, cursing and screaming are bone shaking at best. at worst, they are disturbing.but thats all really. a great piece of film. with brilliant performances. even from linda blair as the child. before she becomes the demon, she gives a highly realistic childlike show. the mystery heightens as it builds to it's climax, and it's gripping. only letting go during the slightly lame final scenes with the priests.but what film doesnt have minor flaws. they are minor. and do not detract from the in your face cinema experience that this film provides",9,0,1,3 August 2003
28 Days Later...," a big hmmmmmm
","this film gets a big hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Some parts, most parts were brilliantly done, and executed tremendously. But the smaller parts that were not that great cast a huge shadow over the film. The acting from a few characters was unbelievably amateurish. The dialogue sometimes slipped into pure cack. And as soon as the army get involved, the film just makes you feel queasy for all the wrong reasons. It just didn't make sense, i wont give anything away. But yes, i found myself losing interest rather quickly. Still though, it's entertaining, and the great bits are what make it watchable. You could do worse, a lot worse.",5,0,0,6 April 2003
City of God," speechless
","bang, the first minute of city of god. Fast cutting, overlapped sound effects, wonderful camera shots, great music. What a way to start. And the brilliance of the first 5 minutes, is just a prelude of whats to come. Usually telling a story of this scope and size is very difficult to pull off, but the director easily succeeds in keeping an audience's eyes wide open throughout the whole picture. It's most definatly shocking. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, with some of it's documentary style approach. It is also very funny, and very poignant. Being a foreign film, i knew none of the actors, but it just made it all so much better. The friendships really seem genuine, and when some of the friendships fall, you literally feel the emotion pour out of the screen. Lil ze, the more deadly character in the film is played brilliantly, and whenever he's on screen, looking towards the camera, you almost feel obliged to walk away. Like you are being bullied or something.It's also a movie which pays off, and doesn't disappoint you with a cop out ending. But even it did, you could forgive it for everything that came before, and if you are like me, then you'll leave this film speechless.",9,0,2,26 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," moves things along nicely
","i read the first book before i saw the film last year, and was dissapointed with 'the fellowship of the ring' on first viewing. Then on second viewing, i found it very good, and on third viewing i became a lover of the film. I started to read the second book but like a lot of people who have tried to read them, only managed to get half way through. The book became too hard to read, with tolkien becoming more and more descriptive, and beatifully poetic, but taking an awful long time to get the story going. So i stopped reading it.Now, the film is out. And i hoped i wouldn't lose interest at the similair point in the film. Luckily i didn't. Peter Jackson intertwines each of the three different storylines well, one of which becomes a little too less focused on. And the film does take a while to gather some steam. But when it does it is damn well worth it. Yes, some of the effects are a little 'crap' for lack of a better word. Well too be fair, only one little negative to the effects, and you'll all see it when you watch the film. And it's not gollum either. And also a scene that is unintentionally funny, which maybe us brits will only gringe at. Anyway, Gollum enters the scene, and i did groan and think oh no, it looks too fake. But after a short while, when it closes in on his character, he does look fantastic. And at times, very very funny and very very evil. And everyone is saying blah blah helms deep battle, best thing you'll ever see blah blah. It isn't the best thing you will ever see, by no means, but it is absolutely fanbloodytastic. More in the mood and the build, with the rain and the distant footsteps of the approaching army. And that is only one of three brilliantly depicted battles. All the performances are good, nothing oscar worthy, and if orlando bloom gets another nomination, i'll be so damn angry. He didn't do anything in the first film, yet 'best newcomer', why?. Anyway, he was good, but so was everybody else. Overall, just another great part to a film that can only truly be judged when all three are on dvd.",6,0,0,6 April 2003
Dumb and Dumber," funniest movie ever

Directors bobby and peter farrelly have been trying to recreate it ever since, but with kingpin, and there's something about mary, they dont even come close.Jim Carrey in an insane role does an amazing job, both physically, and emotionally. While jeff daniels also does great as his best friend. The script is pure gold, for a comedy anyway, with a laugh out loud gag on every other line.

2001: A Space Odyssey," difficult, but stimulating
","the slowest film ever made. Yes indeed it is. And to watch the whole film without having to break in between is very very difficult. As regards to a plot, the film is shot so nonsensically that it's often hard to follow. But it is an experience. Some of the most fantastic visuals, and visual effects can be seen in this movie. Space has never looked so clean, and effect free. The lighting effects have never been so mystical, and stunning.The film kicks off, i think, when you are introduced to the computer HAL, that becomes the core of the film, and the most 'film'-like plot throughout it's duration. It becomes exciting, without losing it's credibility as a piece of brilliant cinema. I only wish i could have seen this on the big screen. The little screen could never do it justice.",5,0,4,23 March 2003
There's Something About Mary," bah, it's okay
","the farrelly brothers are still yet to make a funnier film than dumb and dumber. This outing sees ben stiller and cameron diaz together, in the hope of getting a lot of laughs. Instead it gets just a few laughs. The film relies too much on the 5 main set piece gags, and the time between them is wasted on dull jokes and not very amusing physical comedy. It looks bright enough, with the usual colourful framing, but it leaves you wanting more.The actors try very hard to dish out the humour but it leads them nowhere. And lee evans is just so cringeworthy, doing an american accent so bad, you just wanna turn it off right there and then. But yes, the set pieces are funny, rib ticklingly funny. It's just a shame there is so much dead air in this one.",6,3,6,26 March 2003
The Fly," Beauty and the Beast for adults!
","The Fly is a great movie. Its a compact 91 minutes that veers from intriguing romance, to disturbing unravelling of man. Jeff Goldman is the victim in question here. A man literally consumed by his work, as he turns from scientist nerd to a twitching, vomiting nightmarish monster. Goldblums work has often been seen as irritating and mock-able, but it works beautifully here. His bug eyes, his gangly frame, and his quick delivery, perfectly fit Seth Brundles enthusiasm and following decline. Geena Davis comes off weaker, but still effective as the suffering Veronica who knows the fleeting time they had together, will be with her all her life. It may well prove to be David Cronenbergs masterpiece!!!",9,0,1,30 September 2008
Groundhog Day," it's groundhog day....again
","without a doubt, one of the funniest films ever made. Usually, you associate funny with dumb, but with groundhog day, you get one of the most intelligent comedies of all time. Mainly set around one day, which weatherman phil conners must relive over and over again, to his utter confusion, the film just throws out brilliant idea after brilliant idea. Bill Murray will probably never be better, his comic timing is superbly spot on. He could say even the most dull line, and make it funny. And without being intimidated, the supporting actors are all as equally good in their own parts. It gets rather sentimental as it moves on, but still doesn't quit with those great one liners.

","the first film created a head-messing reality/unreality questioning plot, which everyone thought was so deep and profound. which, in a way it was. it is. but this film, as being the second of a trilogy, loses some of the brilliance in story. as it tries so hard to explain what is going on with everything, that it eventually, and inevitably loses it's own head through it's long, drawn out, philosophical dialogue. it's becomes such a mess. i actually really dont care what the matrix is now. and as for revolutions, i'm not bothered whatever deep posturing is may give us. i'm now just here for the action. reloaded ups the game for action movies everywhere. the choreography is outstanding, the music pulse racing. and it works so well. occasionally the action scenes are ruined with obvious computer generated characters, but there is enough real on real brutishness to fill several kung fu movies. some of the moves, are jaw dropping, the flips breathtaking. the only drawback being the overly done slow motion. which is used almost every other frame during these scenes. but, it's amazing however you look at it.fighting has never looked cooler.",Null,0,0,26 May 2003
Vanilla Sky," more art than film
","Wow, easily one of the best films of 2002. With a high profile director, and a very high profile star, it could've all gone wrong for this film, but it seems to do everything right. The plot takes so many turns it's sometimes hard to keep up, but isn't it better that a movie makes you think rather than not? Cameron Crowe has made his best film here, and it's most likely to be the best film of his career in many years to come. Using colour and some fantastic camera shots, it becomes more of an art piece than just a film. His direction and editing are so tight in some scenes, it's hard not to notice his talent. Check out the scene with tom cruise and noah taylor in the bar. It's perfectly executed. And the finale is positively poetic. Beautiful infact. Everyone here makes an impression. Penelope Cruz i thought did extremely well in a soft role, and tom cruise once again shows us that he can infact act his socks off if he wants to. It's brain numbing, head scratching, wonderfully surreal, disturbing, horrific, romantic, poetic, arty, everything really. Oh and not to forget that is has possibly the best soundtrack ever put on film. Sigur ros, icelands premier band make the ending with it's glorious track 4.",8,0,0,27 March 2003
Bruce Almighty," bruce alrighty
","i admit it. i like jim carrey. i think he's a comedic genious. i think his brand of humour is the funniest kind. so i knew, without a doubt, that bruce almighty would contain a handful of great gags. and it does just that. more so infact. with some laugh out loud set pieces, you cant help but fall for the charm of the movie. yes, it preaches a little, and aims far too high with the religios aspect, but as a no brainer, this is perfect. well, almost. if it weren't for the abysmally slushy score that practically draws itself out for the whole film, and the occasional 'find god' corny messages, it would be. and it's nice to see carrey diverting back to what made him a star in the first place.",6,0,1,20 July 2003
Signs," yeah, it's not bad y'know
","signs is m. nights third commercial movie. and a well made movie it is too. the direction has it's own character, be it odd camera angles, visual trickery, or the placings of the actors. m. night is a director first and foremost. which is rare. and as a storyteller, he is original, give him that, but he can be a little over ambitious. the sixth sense was perfect as it was. unbreakable was intriguing but difficult. and signs, is just far fetched.but, it could have been different. the last 20 minutes are good, but it didn't need to be. i think m. night struggled to better the endings to his other movies. and in the attempt, botched it up. it does hold some nice meaning to it, but the way it was done was over dramatized. and the alien was a bit cack. but the duration of the film is masterful, brilliantly set up, and spooky, creepy, tense and moving. it moves at its own pace, giving us more dialogue than action. but at least it's good dialogue. mel gibson and joaquin pheonix are very very good as brothers, and the kids, mainly abigail breslin, are just adorable. so what could have been a masterpiece, ends up being just above average due to the copout finale. lets hope m.night stops trying to please the audience with a twist ending next time, and just lets the story breathe.",6,0,1,16 May 2003
Identity," darkly good
","from the get go, this film pretty much has you hooked. and does not let you go until the finale. the set up of how each character ends up in the motel is done remarkebly well. and from then, the countdown begins. it's dark too, with the director taking notes from finchers seven. and the rain is a constant source of atmosphere and dread. it's this atmosphere that make the picture work, and it isnt until the last 20 minutes that the atmosphere disappears. with the much talked about ending comes either love or hate. it's the ending which will define your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. each actor does adequetly enough in their roles. some are more annoying than others but they give enough for the audience to care about there well being. interesting then, and hugely enjoyable. one for the top ten movies of the year.",6,0,0,20 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," quite xellent
","i was ever so slighty disappointed with the first x-men movie. i thought it tailed off in the last 20 minutes, which ruined the whole movie. so with this one, i had no expectations. which maybe is why i enjoyed it so damn much. it has all the right ingredients for a summer blockbuster, and more, as singer has a nice touch that makes it mature enough to be seen as a proper movie, rather than just a brainless summer movie. the characters evolve nicely, and some nifty special effects add a little fun into the plot, which isnt that good. but it has enough sub-plots to keep people interested. lets hope the pyro plot is followed up.and unlike the first film, the finale is exciting and well executed.roll on X3",7,0,0,12 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," beautifully chilling
","shyamalan has crafted a beautiful film here, that's more chilling than scary. You all know the story by know, and yes, there are then thousand plot holes, but it really doesn't matter when you have film-making of this standard. The direction and score go hand in hand perfectly. While the actors all give their best, most notably toni collette and haley joel osment. Osment is the films heart, with a performance easily up there as one of cinema's best. The scariest thing in the film is how the kid manages to convey his emotions so realistically. When he is scared in the movie, he genuinely looks scared, and that is no easy feat to do with a big camera pointing in your face. Bruce Willis does a good job, proving that he can actually act very well when he wants to. But he is outshone by osment, which is probably best for the movie anyway. The plot is strong, and unwinds at it's own crawling pace, but it pay's off in the end with a touching finale that makes you want to watch the whole film again. And not many films do that.",9,0,0,25 March 2003
The Matrix," a great start to the trilogy
","i first saw the matrix back in '99 when it was first released. And i was so excited by the hype that i got caught up in it a little too much. I went in expecting an all out action fest. So i left the cinema in a state of 'was that it?' But on second viewing, it all changed. I began to appreciate the actual story, something i missed first time around. The plot is as deep and surreal as you can get, and the action is really just the icing on the cake. Few and far between, the fight scenes, gun play scenes, are all fantastic. Edited sharply, and being inventive with the visuals,using slo-mo, then speeding up the frame. and it works wonders. The actors look cool enough, and there is plenty of room left to boost their characters, which it will hopefully do in the following two movies. But it's definatly a film that makes you think, the matrix isn't that easy to understand. Not until you've seen it a good 6 times, which i think i'm now upto. So roll on reloaded and revolutions, an audience awaits.",7,0,1,23 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," how can i be a minority?
","here it is. a guy who thinks star wars is the most over-rated film...ever. Don't get me wrong, i don't not like it, but really, when you break it down folks, it's pretty dire. The dialogue is horribly horrible. The direction is even worse. Almost no invention, or intelligence with the camera. Which i why i still and always will believe that George Lucas is THE worst director in cinema history. The story is interesting, but that's it, the sets are cheap, costumes are almost laughable. But yes, it can be enjoyed ever so slightly, the drama is quite convincing, as it's the acting which is to be applauded. It's not great but they must be quite good at the art if they can come across as realistic while having to speak such awful lines. Look closer guys and girls, it's not the best film ever made.",5,3,10,23 March 2003
Apollo 13," not a disaster
","it's just a typical feel good gung ho men together flick. a true story though in this case. some of the technical jargon gets a little frustrating. how are we supposed to know what a thingymabobianelectrodesnappitycricket is? well i dont. but it's acted well, it's heart is in the right place and it's all goes to make a nice heart warming film about overcoming the odds and succeeding. it's nice. just...nice.",6,2,5,30 July 2003
Pineapple Express," Smoke 'em if you got 'em
","I was excited. Having loved knocked up, and poured adoration over superbad. Just knowing Seth Rogan and Judd Apatow were involved in this movie had me anticipating comedy gold. And then the trailer. Put together well, showing little but enough laughs to have me believing this could be 'the' film of the year.I've seen it now. And i'm keeping it together but i'm so god-dam disappointed.Not a lot worked here. The story was vapour, the direction standard, but the script? These guys can write funny, we've seen it before, but this script has a handful of good laughs and in a feature length film, that just isn't enough. Sure there are chuckles along the way but so much of it falls flat that it stands out head and shoulders above the good stuff. No-one really has anything to do, even the two main characters don't really appeal, and there was never a point where i felt like i wanted these guys to succeed. And i was promised action, and instead got made-for-TV action highlighted with bad language, which is the other films is funny, but the profanities are used way way too much here, and it just feels awkward.I may watch this film again, but not until i'm older and reliving past experiences. The experience of severe disappointment.",5,2,5,14 September 2008
Donnie Darko," best film of 2002
","by far, the best movie of that year, and possibly one of the least expensive. no point in even attempting to describe the story as any idea could ruin the experience. as a debut film from director richard kelly, he should be very proud of this. this is the movie of which all his future movies will be judged against. the film is so very intimate, and intricate, using small town locations, and complex plotting to bewilder the viewer but to also wrap them up in the atmosphere of the movie. donnie, played by jake gyllenhaal is a mystery, his character is so down to earth, yet so unworldly that he becomes an instant contender for best character in a movie. and the score by michael andrews is hallucinatingly beautiful, touching the right notes on the right scenes. it all adds to an incredibly light, haunting film, with a pitch black heart. and one hell of a head trip afterwards.",10,0,1,16 May 2003
The Wedding Singer," the funniest rom-com ever
","it's short, it's sweet, it's perfect. it hits the mark all the way with what it's trying to be. which is a funny love story. and it surpasses that, it's a very funny love story. some wonderful lines, whether comedic or bittersweet, nostalgic or insulting, they are all delivered with brilliant timing and effort. sandler and barrymore have a great chemistry between them, and they bring the neccesary emotion to the movie, which cant help but win you over. great soundtrack too, especially sandlers own contributions.
the best rom-com ever, and it's going to be hard to beat.",8,0,1,2 June 2003
Goodfellas," shoulda been called 'greatfellas'
","after only being made in 1990, it's amazing how much of a 'classic' it is known as already. But it deserves every bit of applause that it gets, as it truly is a legendary film. Right from the start, you are pulled head first into this world of petty crooks, and murderous gangsters, and the pace just never slows down. You have pesci, and liotta all putting in their best work. De niro is great but not new. And with scorsese behind the camera, the audience are treated to some brilliantly executed scenes. Be it the 'classic' 'you think i'm funny?' scene, or the handgun to the nose beating scene, which is done so realistically, you can feel the cracks as his nose spurts blood. And the use of music in the film fits like a glove, really setting a tone, and enhancing the mood. I don't think it could have been put together more perfectly. It's a long film, but it's one you never actually want to end.",9,0,0,24 March 2003
