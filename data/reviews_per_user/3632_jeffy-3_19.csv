Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing
","Even the people who are disappointed by this movie are already getting their hopes up that the next segment will be better since Episode 1 is 'setting up the rest of the story'. I'm not so convinced that there's much of a story to tell since we already know how it ends. The challenge that faced Lucas in bringing the prequels to the screen is to surprise us with stories and characters for which we were not prepared and at the same time bring us up to the point of Star Wars A New Hope (#4). Lucas's story here is quite simply lazy. There is no real conflict here to care about and the characters don't have enough personality to keep us interested. What makes people think the next segment will be any different? If they already know what's going to happen, then Lucas again faces the challenge of coming up with something new and surprising to offset the predictability. People defend the new film's lack of well-developed characters by saying the original trilogy's strong suit wasn't in its well-defined characters either, but I disagree. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2, C3P0 and the rest are firmly embedded in fan's memories while I doubt in 17 years anyone will be talking about Qui Jon (?) and Jar Jar Binks. It was such a wasted opportunity to have the likes of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neesan and not give them some kind of discernable personality.",6,0,1,1 June 1999
Erin Brockovich," Julia Shimmers and Shines
","ERIN BROCKOVICH   * * *    Julia Roberts proves once again that she's worth every penny of her out of sight salary.   Her charisma and rapport with costar Albert Finney lift a familiar and mostly routine storyline into great entertainment.   Those outfits dont hurt, either.",7,0,1,24 August 2000
X-Men," Very Exciting
","I know more about nuclear fission than I do about this comic book series so I can't comment on how well it captures its source material but I can say it is one of the most exciting movies I've seen in a long time, and despite several jump out of the seat action sequences, it also slows down frequently enough to get to know and like the heroes.  A lot of plot strands are left unresolved for the inevitable sequel, and for a change, I look forward to it.",7,0,0,21 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Great eye candy, good scares
","Great effects and each beheading scene is explicitly shown  but not too disgusting.   Great film to look at too, cool sets and photography. Plenty of laughs too.   Storyline is slightly lame but it's not a cheat.",7,0,0,20 November 1999
Cast Away," The Island Part is Great, But....
","Cast Away  * * *     The mostly silent hour-plus segment on the deserted island is tremendous, but it is bookended by very disappointing scenes back home.   Still worth seeing",7,0,0,27 December 2000
Pitch Black," Better Than Expected
","Totally derivate sci-fi/horror/thriller mixes together elements of Aliens, The Road Warrior, The Birds and The Lost Patrol and turns out actually not half-bad, with better than average characterizations and a few good shocks. Worth seeing at matinee price or on video.",5,1,1,20 February 2000
The Patriot," It's Formulaic, But it's a formula that works
","Corny at times and formulaic, but it's a formula that works. You can tell it's by the makers of Stargate and Independence Day because little in it is original.  Cast and production are top notch. Some of the battle scenes are good, but of course don't approach PRIVATE RYAN for intensity.",7,1,2,5 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Extremely Creative but Over-reaching
","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH  * * 1/2     A tough one to rate.  The screenplay is extremely creative but to me it tries to hard to cover too much ground, too many themes.  As entertainment, the first half hour is the funniest stuff I've seen in a movie in a long time,  but then the unpleasantness of the characters started getting to me and by the end I had to consider it an admirable misfire.  John Cusack is excellent.",6,0,1,25 May 2000
Man on the Moon," Good Script and Direction
","MAN ON THE MOON  * * * 1/2    I never understood Andy Kaufman nor did I ever think him to be funny on 'Taxi', so it's a credit to the filmmakers and the cast that I cared about him by the time the movie ended. Jim Carrey's performance runs more along the lines of an impersonation, and Courtney Love is likeable even though we really don't know anything about her character. Worth seeing for the scenes involving 'Taxi' with most of the original cast appearing  as themselves.  Marilu Henner looks the most like her old self, Jeff Conaway looks unintentionally hilarious with what looks like a bad hair weave.",8,0,0,12 June 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Winona's Show All the Way
","Angelina Jolie took home best supporting actress for a showy role as a troublemaking sociopath in a late 1960s mental hospital, but it is Wynona Rider who turns in a great performance in the lead role.   It's a very well-done movie,  and the main group of girls are all memorably played, especially Brittany Murphy as a patient with an eating disorder.",7,0,1,19 June 2000
The Hurricane," Great Performance, Iffy Movie
","Denzel Washington's performance is the best thing in this misguided drama.  Unfortunately, the rest of the characters, including a fictional evil cop played by Dan Hedaya and a trio of do-gooders who help free the imprisoned boxers are laughably silly and downright corny.",5,0,2,31 July 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Works Pretty Well if Taken as a Dream
","EYES WIDE SHUT  (1999)  * * 1/2   Kubrick, Kidman and Cruise spent the better part of a year making a movie with a moral as simple as 'appreciate what you have at home (in this case a wife and kid) and don't venture out into unknown territory because there's a lot of evil and misery out there'.   Even with director Kubrick's notorious propensity for retake after retake, he obviously gave up on getting a convincing performance out of Cruise as a  physician.  He's as believable as Woody Allen playing a gladiator.  Still, Kidman is good and Stanley Pollack is excellent in a supporting role, and if you take the movie as sort of like a dream it works pretty well.",5,1,2,25 May 2000
Detroit Rock City," It's no Dazed and Confused
","DETROIT ROCK CITY   (1999)   * *   Four kids in 1978 (?) and their efforts to get to a KISS concert in Detroit.  Not much more plot than that, and it pales in comparison to Dazed and Confused in its depiction of that time period and to American Pie in its teen sex hijinks.  A few good chuckles and a good rock soundtrack.",4,1,3,25 May 2000
The Green Mile," Good Performances, but Gets Increasingly Ridiculous
","THE GREEN MILE  (1999)   * * 1/2   This movie has the best money can buy:  great character actors in most roles, wonderful sets, excellent photography, and is never boring despite it's 3 hour length.  That said, it's a shame that in its third hour the movie just keeps getting increasingly ridiculous to the point that I really can't recommend it. Oscar nomination for best picture was a joke, as was the one Michael Clark Duncan as the giant, childlike black death row inmate. His performance consists of contorting his face into a grimace and letting his eyes well up with tears.",6,1,2,26 June 2000
Final Destination," A 5 out of 10
","FINAL DESTINATION   * * 1/2   Enjoyably stupid horror mixof Scream and The Omen. Worth it for a couple of reallycreative death scenes, especially one really juicy decapitation.  Cast is pretty good, although the characters are sketchy at best, downright half-dimensional at worst.  Worth  a video rental or matinee price",5,0,0,25 March 2000
Tarzan," Great Animation, Formulaic Plot
","TARZAN  (1999)   * * *     What's good about it: incredible animation, great voice characterization by Minnie Driver.  What's bad about it: generic music by Phil Collins, very distracting voice work by a tiresomely obnoxious Rosie O'Donnell.  What's so-so about it: standard, formulaic Disney story which pretty much writes itself by now.",7,0,0,31 May 2000
The Thin Red Line," Cinematography At Its Best
","THE THIN RED LINE  * * *    The first movie I've ever seen that I'd recommend solely for the cinematography.   It's definitely not something you watch while while you're ironing or doing a crossword puzzle, since it doesn't give you a straight-forward story.  The performances by Sean Penn and Jim Caveizel ('Frequency') are very good, but the star cameos (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, etc) are distracting.",7,0,0,1 June 2000
Gladiator," Absolutely Riveting
","This movie was absolutely riveting from minute one to the end. The performances were perfect, the dialogue literate, the cinematography beautiful, the direction controlled and sublime.  The plot itself is vaguely reminiscent of several other historical epics, with its tale of family treachery, vengeance and the evil son vying for his father's attention. There are action scenes in this movie that had me practically leaping out of my seat with exhilaration.   I highly recommend this to everyone!",8,0,0,8 May 2000
High Fidelity," Uninteresting Despite Good Performances
",Mostly uninteresting.  John Cusack owns a record store and talks to the camera about his past troubles with different girlfriends.  Lacking in humor and characters to care about. Catherine Zeta Jones plays one of his ex's.,4,1,2,20 October 2000
