The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Heartfelt coming of age movie
","Unlike other teen movies, feelings portrayed are mature and multi- layered which is the reason it makes you connect with the movie at a different emotional level. Casting was superb and lead characters do full justice to the multi-faceted nature of their characters. Brilliant movie without any dull moment. The conversation 'Why good people ends up with the wrong one?' will stay with you.",10,1,2,17 September 2017
