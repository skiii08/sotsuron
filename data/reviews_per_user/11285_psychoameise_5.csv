Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Zzzzzzz... what? Oh, they're still talking... zzzzzzz
","To begin with: I don't hate this movie. It did not offend my nerd sensibilities. No, it committed a crime even worse than that. I bored me senseless. And it managed to make its stellar cast look like they couldn't act. Oh... and of course there's Jar Jar. 'Nuff said.I will start with the pros, because this won't take long. Lucas tried (emphasis on tried) to really give us fleshed out backstory about how the Empire and the Rebellion came into being, about how it all began, where everyone is coming from. Another star is for the excellent choice of actors, the third one for Darth Maul (holy smokes, that is one of the most bad-ass villains ever).The cons however far outweigh the pros. The film is unmercifully dull. Lucas is sadly completely unable to write realistic dialogue, and apparently insisted on doing it all himself, which results in great actors looking like card-board cut outs and middling actors looking like terrible ones. The film is over CGI-ed to an unpardonable degree (which was often done back in the day, so I can't put that sin as squarely on Lucas' shoulders as I can with the dialogue). Nothing looks real or convincing, you can basically see the actors helplessly trying to appear as if they are interacting with anything. It's lame. The endless trade and taxation discussions are so uninteresting that I ended up actually NOT understanding any more of the backstory or motivations.Bottom line: I have seen it twice now, once in the theatres, after which I was in denial about how bad it was. And now, years later, expecting it to be bad. I thought this might make the viewing experience less disappointing, but actually, I found it was worse. I will not be watching it again.",3,1,8,17 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worse than Phantom Menace, save yourselves the pain!
","Seriously, the only reason I give it two stars is because it's Star Wars, and it has Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee in it. There are practically no other high points for me. I don't think I need to describe the plot in much detail, but many consider this better than Phantom Menace, so let me briefly expand on why - for me - it was worse.Phantom Menace was boring as hell, granted. But even with Jar Jar in there, it never once made me cringe in horror. By god, this one did. The movie doesn't contribute much to the story line, other than that Padme and Anakin fall in love (rather unconvincingly at that). Again, Lucas' complete inability to write dialogue comes into play, but with romantic scenes, this is so much more apparent than during trade negotiations. It's so bad, I cannot begin to tell you how bad it is. The 'romantic scenes' between the two leads are so unconvincing, so stilted, borderline creepy at times and at best will make you snigger. At worst, it makes you cringe with embarrassment-by-proxy. This is the only one of the Star Wars movies that I could never bring myself to watch a second time. Granted, the romance does not take up all of the screen time. Far from it. And I understand why many people would find the rest of the story, the origin of the stormtroopers etc. more engaging than Phantom Menace. For me, however, the story is just as uninteresting as Phantom Menace, with the added horror of the corny dialogue. The battle scene at the end, rather than looking cool, left me cold. The screen is overcrammed, the stakes are virtually nonexistent since you know the important characters will live and you don't care about the characters anyway. For me, this is the lowest point in the Saga. I understand that proper Star Wars geeks will have to watch it, but everyone else might as well save themselves the pain.",2,2,17,17 December 2015
Pride & Prejudice," No, no, no!
","I didn't really expect that much when I popped this into my DVD player, but I was still disappointed. There is so much wrong with this movie it's difficult to decide where to begin.Firstly, the script is abysmal. I know they had to cut stuff, but why did they have to mutilate Austens' beautiful language and perfect story? Here, Longbourn House is not the house of a gentleman but more or less a barn and the pig wandering through the kitchen gonads a-dangling is apparently the scriptwriters' idea of compensating the viewer for leaving out all of Austens' humour. Also, the characters are butchered almost beyond recognition. Elizabeth is portrayed as rather silly and quite aggressive at times rather than prejudiced but sensible. If you were looking forward to seeing any of the wonderfully crafted tongue-in-cheek banter Lizzy directs at Darcy in the book, you will look in vain. Darcy himself is portrayed as a man who conveys the impression of arrogance for a very short while but then becomes rather soppy. The Bennet girls are portrayed as fools who run around the house screeching like banshees. I also cannot forgive how the scriptwriter ruined the first proposal scene. For starters, Darcy and Elizabeth are standing in the pouring rain. How very modern and unnecessary! Then Darcy makes a surprisingly obsequious declaration (while the actor wears the facial expression of a frightened dog), Elizabeth turns him down and ensuing quarrel almost leads to yelling which is very unlikely for gentlefolk of that time in general and NOT what's in the book. Then, Darcy leans towards Elizabeth as if to kiss her. And she – who claimed to hate him 10 seconds earlier – doesn't recoil from him but rather gives him a look that seems to say 'are you as turned on as I am right now?'. What were they thinking?!!! I didn't like the interpretation of Bingley either, he is portrayed as completely spineless and the actor doesn't look much older than 18. At least Bingleys' proposal scene was alright. But Darcy and Elizabeth have no such luck, even the second proposal was written to smithereens. Darcy and Lizzy both wander through a field in the morning because they can't sleep. Luckily, they are both up at exactly the same hour and meet (yeah right) and are both half undressed because – naturally - in the regency era people often went out in their pyjamas. They declare their love while the sun is rising and Darcys' perfectly cringeworthy 'I love, I love, I love you's which are set off by the tacky moodlighting are enough to make anyone puke.Also, though I'm no expert, some of the historical inaccuracies are just too blatant to pass unnoticed. There are almost no bonnets and gloves for three quarters of the movie, then they seemed to remember 'Oh hang on, I think women wore bonnets back then'. So they put in a couple of scenes where nearly everyone wears a bonnet but then they seemed to think 'Oh what the hell' and the bonnets disappear again. The dance where the Bennets and Bingleys first meet is not the classy amusement the gentility of the period would have indulged in. Instead they staged a sort of peasant folk-dance in another of the many barns used in this movie. And at some point Miss Bingley wears a gown with straps instead of sleeves. Come on! I have already mentioned how Darcy and Elizabeth wander through the fields in their pyjamas - unlikely. When Jane is sick at Netherfield, there is a scene where Bingley just walks into her bedroom. And Darcys' letter of defence after the first proposal is delivered by him personally in the middle of the night to Lizzies' bedroom. As if! It would have been so simple to avoid these mistakes. So why didn't they? It almost seems like they weren't bothered.To add insult to injury, some of the casting is off. In fairness, some of the actors' abilities were probably hampered by the abominable script, but judging by this movie alone it's quite hard to find anything to like. Matthew Mcfadyen is insipid as Darcy. Apart from the fact he isn't handsome enough and that he wears his hair mullet style, he seems to have only two expressions at his disposal. Arrogance and soppiness. Keira Knightly does slightly better, she's got three. Boredom, anger, and a very toothy girn. Donald Sutherland, brilliant actor that he is, is simply wrong as Mr Bennet. When Lizzy tells him she loves Darcy, he actually cries. It's so wrong it hurts. The girl who plays Lydia needs acting school. She uses very chichi hand gestures and her screeching gives the viewer tinnitus. I was pleased to find, however, that Caroline Bingley is portrayed as good-looking. She is so in the book and earlier film versions tended to use absolute scarecrows to portray her. Kelly Riley does a decent job. I was also pleased with Tom Hollander as Mr Collins and the formidable Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. The brief appearance of Rupert Friend as Wickham is quite funny, but for the wrong reasons. Someone described him as looking like Legolas and that is precisely what I thought when I saw him in this. It's the only time I laughed while watching this film.To end on a more cheerful note, the camera-work is good and the scenery gorgeous. Especially when Lizzy is on tour with the Gardiners there are a couple of achingly beautiful landscape shots. But that is all that can be said in favour of this movie and it isn't enough.To cut a long story short, I absolutely hated it. Although I'm not an Austen purist this left me completely cold. I've seen all the filmed versions of P&P and this is the worst. By far.",1,9,17,25 February 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I envy everyone who liked this movie so much!
","Just to be clear I did not go into this movie with high expectations and that's the reason I'm disappointed. I went to a prescreening, fully prepared to be disappointed after seeing the trailers, but still in a good mood and hoping for the best. And to be clear, this movie isn't completely awful. But I went home disappointed and canceled my tickets for a second screening. I'm glad for everyone who liked this and wish they would stop dishing hate on people who didn't. The following is my opinion, you don't have to agree with me, but I'm not bought off or just hating on principle. This is how I feel about BvS: If we want to save Justice League, Snyder has to go.This movie is a jumbled mess. It tries to do too much. There's a Man of Steel sequel in there, they're introducing a new batman, setting up the Justice League and then they've got to cram some villain motivations in there too. Guess what? It doesn't work. If you try to cram three and a half movies into one, you can't properly flesh out what's going on. It's possible to follow the plot, but every time you start to get emotionally invested in a scene, it skips to somewhere else and doesn't pay off. Also, because we don't get to spend enough time with the characters, the motivations are inadequate. There is no real reason why the Batman vs Superman fight needs to happen except miscommunication which two hyperintelligent men like Batman and Superman would not have, and the reason it stops is paper thin as well. The major players only have a handful of scenes together. It's not enough. It is very easy to tell that the movie was cut down and it is glaringly obvious sometimes that pieces are missing. Characters refer to something as if they had talked about it before, even though they haven't, which tells you that scenes were cut. But even so, with all that stuff going on, the movie manages to drag. There's so much that we don't need to see, and it's disappointing that they chose to give us that instead of more time with our heroes. Another thing that angered me: if you're gonna put one stray joke in your movie, why spoil it by explaining the punchline? How stupid do you think your audience is? I found that offensive.It's not all bad of course. The cast is solid throughout. Batfleck is fine, so are Cavill, Gadot, Adams and Irons. But the dialogue they are given is so inauthentic it really bothered me. It's just exposition or pompous pep talks and not the way real people behave. I didn't like Eisenberg, but if the rest of the movie had been better, I would have been able to live with him. Visuals are great, as you would expect. Some of the action is good too, but not all of it. Those good points are where my three stars come from.All in all: This movie is setting up so much stuff that it fails at one crucial thing... being a standalone film. It's disjointed and choppy and we don't get to spend enough time with the characters to actually care about them or understand their motivations properly. To everyone out there who liked it: I'm happy for you. I envy you. You have no idea how lucky you are. But I just couldn't.",3,12,25,25 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nice movie, J.J. played it safe... a little too safe, perhaps?
","Just so you understand where I'm coming from with this review, I am a proper Star Wars geek and have seen all of them, most multiple times. I am, however, not an all-out fangirl.To begin with: This - by itself - is a really good movie. This, when viewed in context, is perfectly serviceable. It is a story you've seen before (no seriously, you've seen this exact same story before) and yet it is engaging and fun. It's obvious J.J. Abrahms approached this with a lot of respect and love, but maybe a tad too much fear?The pros: The characters are reasonably well introduced, very likable and engaging, their relationships seem believable. The acting is - for the most part - good or even great (with a few exceptions). There are many nostalgic nods to the OT, which I personally enjoyed, even if it was a little overdone.The cons: The story is completely predictable from beginning to end. Villain motivation as far as we know it from this movie seems thoroughly inadequate.What really lifted the movie for me was Harrison Ford. When he appears, the movie goes from OK to good. He gave a great performance, which carried a lot of the story. Daisy Ridley is good as Rey, even though it is slightly unclear where all her language, mechanic and flying skills come from. This, however, might still be explained. The movie commits the occasional sin for plot convenience, but hey, that's nothing we haven't seen before and I was able to overlook it most of the time. Carrie Fisher is clearly phoning it in, but since she doesn't have a huge part in the movie, I could overlook that, too. Boyega is good as Finn, there is the occasional comic relief which worked well most of the time. All in all, I enjoyed myself during the entire run time.There were, however, a few things I wasn't so sure about. There's been a lot of hate for the villain, Kylo Ren, and I get where people are coming from with that. He starts out as a complete bad-ass and is later revealed to be insecure and emotionally unstable. Also, his face is pretty and babyish. One the one hand, he feels like a watered down Vader. On the other hand, the choice to make the villain young and handsome and conflicted from the start (rather than the end, like Vader) seems like the only bold choice J.J. made. The motivation for the villain seems inadequate now, but I hope we will come to understand it better in future movies. I do hope there's more than we got, otherwise it would be very weak sauce. The in-your-face nazi imagery and the new Emperor reminded me of Voldemort in Harry Potter. And apparently, it has now been put into law that Andy Serkis may only play heavily CGI-ed characters and all heavily CGI-ed characters must be played by Andy Serkis. It's becoming a trope and tropes tend to annoy me.To summarize: J.J. probably feared the rage of the nerd-herd so much he played it too safe and the movie therefore lacks originality. However, the new characters are engaging, the story works in and of itself and there's promise for more originality in the future. I liked it. It was so over-hyped that it was nigh-on impossible for J.J. to exceed expectations, and I don't feel we should hold that against him. He is a real fan and this is a labour of love, and this is what counts in the end.",8,2,16,17 December 2015
