The Blair Witch Project," Creepy and original
","The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting movie.  It is advertised as an actual event - 'In 1994, three student filmmakers disappeard in the woods of Burketsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary.  Three years later, their footage was found.'  A lot of people hated Blair Witch because they claimed that 'I could of made that movie myself!' or that 'It wasn't even scary!'  Most people today are used to chop 'em up slasher movies.  For fans of those movies, the usual definition of a scary movie is a movie with lots of gore and lots of things jumping out of the shadows and making you jump. Movies like these fail to have a creepiness about them.  A scary movie should be subtle in most parts, mysterious, and it should get under your skin.  Blair Witch does this.  Our stars, Mike, Heather, and Josh, are pursued by something that is unidentifiable and mysterious.  Evidence of it is heard at night, when it..or them...lets itself be heard.  At one point in the film the characters are in a tent at night and hear a warped, unearthly noise.  This sound alone without knowing exactly what made it is creepier than some burly man with an axe.  Even the legend of the Blair Witch is unsettling.  While in bed at night, I read an Blair Witch ad that had a list of occurrences involving the Blair Witch.  One in where 7 men are found in the woods stretched on a big rock, disembowled and bound together by their hands and legs.  Reading that gave me the creeps.  In my opinion, The Blair Witch Project wasn't as 'Scary as Hell' as Rolling Stone claimed it was, but it was indeed very creepy.  If you plan on watching Blair Witch, watch it with the mindset that you are watching someone's home video that has gone horribly, horribly wrong.  5 out of 5 stars",Null,0,1,24 June 2000
Meet the Parents," Meet this movie
","I had a good time at this movie.  Ben Stiller is Greg Focker, 'It's pronounced like it's spelled...Focker'  who is getting ready to engage to his girlfriend (Teri Polo).  But first he must meet her parents.  His girlfriend's father, (Robert De Niro) is a 'flower expert' who is well known for not liking some of his daughter's choices in boyfriends.  First off, Focker is warned not to smoke in the house, because the father finds smoking as a sign of weakness, and his girlfriend throws his pack of cigarettes on the roof (which come in later).  To help his craving, Focker purchases some Nicarette gum, in which he chews several pieces at a time.  The big laughs start with an urn containing a dead grandma's ashes and the family cat, who has an unusual talent of using the toilet.  Ben Stiller's character is similar to his character in There's Something About Mary, he's a clumsy, shy guy just trying to impress his girl and her parents, but everything seems to go wrong for him.  For anyone who has tried to impress a date's parents, or has had bad experiences at airports will be able to simpify with Stiller's character.  There are many big laughs in this movie, and most of the jokes all join together perfectly (ex, Focker is trying to catch the family cat on the roof, but ends up just causing more trouble in a hilarious sequence I won't ruin for you.) 
Meet the parents is one of the better quality comedies recently, and I recommend that you give it a chance.",Null,0,0,15 October 2000
Fight Club," Intelligent and entertaining
","Fight Club is the story of a man (Edward Norton) who is suffering from insomnia.  He sleeps little, hates his white collar job, and is looking for help.  He finds it in attending  a countless number of therapy groups that range from Alcoholics Anonymous to a group for men with erectile disfunction.  He finds comfort in being in a room full of troubled people being helped, and pretends to have the same problems so he too can be helped.  Another faker makes her presense and attends all of our protagonist's sessions, which annoys him.  They make a deal to attend sessions at different days.  While traveling on the job, He meets a soap salesman (Brad Pitt) and after getting to know each other, they start Fight Club, a new kind of therapy.  Our hero builds relationships with both Pitt's character and the other faker from the therapy sessions.  The Fight Club also builds, and spreads across the country.  I enjoyed this movie.  Right from the beginning and through the movie, the main character is narrating the entire movie (a la Forrest Gump).  There are many funny moments as he endures things that life throws at him.  The movie builds from seeing the hero in his everyday life, to forming a club, and witnessing the mis-adventures he gets into from it.  I like the laughs that the movie provides and it has a certain style and attitude to it.  Towards the end, things get more serious and there is a major plot twist which is confusing at first, but after you complete the movie, it all makes sense and you might want to see the movie over again.  Some people will see this movie expecting a 'fight' movie with lots of brutal face-smashing and fist swinging.  That's not what this movie is about.  This movie is about a man's downward spiral and shows that an individual can also make a huge influence.  This is a very intelligent movie and I find it very entertaining.  It is very long though, 139 minutes to be exact.  While Fight Club is not one of my all time favorite movies, I still like it a lot.  If you like smart, witty movies, give Fight Club a chance.",Null,0,1,6 July 2000
The Green Mile," Great and touching
","The Green Mile has to be one of my favorite movies of '99.  The story: Tom Hanks plays a security guard who encounters John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan), a man wrongly accused of murder and who later reveals that he has the power to heal people.  Michael Clarke Duncan is awesome as John Coffey, a giant of a man who is gentle and child-like.  He has to be my favorite character out of this movie.  Tom Hanks and all the other guards and prisoners of the Green Mile, the name given to the death row because of the lime-green floor, are also very good characters.  Pursey, a weaseley guard with a bad attitude, is one of those characters that you just love to hate. There are many other likeable characters in this movie, including a mouse which a prisoner names 'Mr. Jingles'.  This movie has some lighthearted funny moments in it.  For instance, in the night the guards try to find a mouse that has been poking around the prison. (Mr. Jingles)  'Three grown men, outsmarted by a mouse!' It is also very touching in parts, specifically towards the end. If you get the chance, see this movie.  In my opinion it's one of the best movies of 1999.  Michael Clarke Duncan should of won an Accademy Award.  Oh, well.",Null,0,0,14 July 2000
The Matrix," Stylish, fun, and smart....Whoa
","I first got interested in The Matrix when I saw a trailer for it on TV. It looked cool and different.  I also had very little knowledge of what the story was about.  I decided that this film would be interesting and gave it a try - and I'm glad I did.  At first glance, The Matrix seems like your everyday dumb mindless action flick with trench coat wearing madmen.  But really it is a movie that expresses a very interesting and thought-provoking story that gets in your head and asks, 'Is my world really as it seems?' There is a little bit of modern mythology in The Matrix (like Star Wars) and the film also ponders about the subject of fate.  The action scenes are also well-done and spread out.  There are a few Kung-Fu fights, one taking place in a dojo with sunlight pouring in from high windows.  There is also a gunfight that is very John Woo-esque.  The action doesn't distract from the story, though, and between action sequences (there are few of them, so this doesn't qualify as an all-out action movie) we get well-acted scenes that flesh out the story.  All-in-all, The Matrix is good fun, but also offers subjects that can start an interesting conversation, and give the movie a see-it-over-and-over quality.  5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,24 June 2000
