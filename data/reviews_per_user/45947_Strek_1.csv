Alien 3," Avoid at all costs!
","After seeing the fist two films in the series, needless to say, I was totally pumped to see the third installment.  Then I saw the trailer: no weapons, a prison colony, a rookie director?!  Has Hell frozen over?This film has to go down as one of the biggest let downs in movie history. When a film goes through twelve scripts, you know a project is in trouble. Have you ever noticed that when a fan of 'Alien 3' praises the film, (I'm generalizing) most of the time he/she will comment on the great cinematography?  Then if the conversation shifts to 'Aliens', (again, I'm generalizing) mostly everyone talks about the great story?  This is because the story and characters of 'Alien 3' were awful.  The characters were not memorable, in fact, it was difficult to distinguish them apart from each other because they were all bald.The master stroke was killing off Hicks and Newt before the opening credits were finished!  I almost walked out of the theater and asked for a refund. This means whenever you watch 'Aliens', youre thinking, 'Oh well, none of this matters, they're dead anyway.'  The third Alien movie couldn't have been set up better with Hicks and Newt surviving in 'Aliens'.After seeing this movie, I thought, 'Ok, in 'Alien 4', Ripley realizes it was all a dream.  Now that I've seen 'Alien 4', Ripley has two dreams in 'Alien 5'!This is a shame.  The Alien franchise could have been one of the best film series of all time.",Null,504,551,24 June 1999
