Ford v Ferrari," Best Movie I have seen in years!
","I am not a race car fan. In fact, I know nothing about it or even cars. They do not interest me. However, this movie was fantastic. The acting was superb, storyline interesting, and great characters. I even enjoyed the car racing scenes. Never grew bored. Can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this movie!",10,0,0,16 February 2020
