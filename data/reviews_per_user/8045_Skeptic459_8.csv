Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I would like to pretend that this never happened...
","When I was about 7 or 8 my Mum took my brother and I to see Return of the Jedi. This was my introduction to the world of Star Wars and it blew my little mind. I'll never forget some of the most memorable characters ever put to celluloid.When Phantom came I wanted to see it so bad...My friends and I made it a 'get wasted on noxious chemicals and buzz out' kind of a night. What we did not know is that the film would be so well...boring, lame and uninteresting. The film audience at a midnight showing can be very telling of a films greatness. In this case, remember when Jar-Jar was stumbling around in the final battle. NO ONE LAUGHED!!! Remember when Anakin was on auto pilot and ended up accidently flying into the battle in outer space. NO ONE LAUGHED!!!Why does this film suck? Well the acting is universally awful. Liam Neeson comes off best. Mcgregor is extremely camp, which makes me wonder if he was taking the mickey out of the whole thing. Jake Lloyd is awful! Just awful! Wasn't 'Jingle all the way' a film that taught everyone that Jake Lloyd should not be allowed to do movies? He is like an even less talented Macaulay Culkin. The best example of bad acting from Lloyd is when he has to say goodbye to his Mother. Now if that actually took place the kid would be torn apart inside and would be a mess of claws and tears. Lloyd plays it like he has to go to summer camp for the first time and its a bit of a bummer. Not that he is being separated from HIS ONLY FAMILY for what will be a very long period of time. The acting is JUST SO BAD and I suspect it is because Lucas can't direct actors. Faster, more intense are probably not the best directions that you can give to your performers.For anyone who is interested I suggest you read Peter Biskino's 'Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.'In this book Biskino writes that Lucas always had an ambivalent attitude towards Star wars. It made him but also defined him. As a director he would be as typecast as Mark Hamil was as Luke Skywalker. It also says that Lucas would never make anymore Star War's films for this reason. This is where I think the film goes wrong. The films are about money and showing off what digital special effects can do. This series fails because the script is terrible but the special effects are incredible. Special effects do not make a movie. There is something sadly ironic about the fact that this has happened to this series. There were so many bad Star Wars clone movies, like Battlestar Galatica. Star Wars always had the leading edge on special effects, story and characters. This all falls to pieces here. To all you movie directors out there. Well written characters and decent acting make a movie, not effects.There are some other people who have commented that the film is good because it has some great looking worlds. For example, the underwater city that features at the beginning of the film. Or the chariot-speedster race that is obviously a wink to Ben-Hur. These things just make the movie look like a god-damn video game and do not add anything at all to the movie. To me these things are like Guy 'one trick' Ritchie. It is just visual showing off for no particular reason. It certainly does not do anything for the weak and ill conceived story.One of the worst parts of the films to me is when Anakins mother says that he was immacutely conceived. This of course has religious connotations. Anakin as the 'one.' GROAN!!! C'mon this is just lazy writing and an easy way of getting rid of any Father figure.Because of the business factor Lucas seems worried about his audience. he certainly does not want to get too dark. But if you think back to the original trilogy there are dark moments in all three films. Therefore a minimum of Darth Maul is seen on screen, which is a shame because he is the most interesting character. But if he started speaking, maybe we would have hated him to. Well at least N'sync are nowhere to be seen.There is also the racial nightmare inherent in the film. What was Lucas thinking? The trade federation guys accent seem to be suspiciously Asian of some kind. Of course thet would mean they are greedy and insidiously evil. Watto, his penchant for profit and his big nose, is this anti-semitism? Jar Jar, more racial stereotyping? I mean was there someone there saying, 'hey George! That's a bit dodgy!'Its all just another nail in the coffin for the series. Lucas has now proved what I have always thought. He is no Kubrick or Renoir, he is a special effects guy. When Star Wars originally came out critics stated that the film was infantilizing the audience. What the hell is this doing? This is the little rascals in space with all the dodgy 1950's political incorrectness.Lord of the Rings, the Matrix films and the Star Wars prequels. These films seem to have dominated the box office these last few years. But it is Lord of the Rings, which is the only one where I care to see how it ends. The other two series I could not care less about the characters. To me that is very telling of the quality of the film. Even though this is a Star Wars film, I give it a 1 limping stormtrooper running away from 10 angry Tuscan Raiders. Avoid, unless you are a huge fan.",1,1,4,23 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The all male 'Mardi Gra' of the Ring!
","Ya know when I was 11, I was beaten senseless on a regular basis. Bullied beyond belief! Granted there were mitigating circumstances that lead to my brutalization at the hands of young sadists. I had 'uncool' clothes with patches so big and colorful that I looked like a circus performer. I also only showered if I was forced to and spent most of my days covered in mud. My tastes also haunted me. I loved jet fighters, fantasy novels and dungeons and dragons. People like me know that only one thing can come from LOTR, social exclusion. So its funny, have you noticed how geek-dum is coming to Hollywood?  Quite possibly you have. In fact they have taken William Randolph Hearst's place as the chief inhalers of cocaine and the grand administrators of all Hollywood orgies. Remember 'Eyes Wide Shut?' Those were all comic book and fantasy freaks! Did you notice the masks and the role playing? Kubrick was actually exposing these people! Whats even freakier is that the marketing exec's are right there with them, chanting. This is because these films have so many marketable goods.I could have easily hated this film. Anything with Elves and trees that walk and talk is deserving of contempt. Tolkiens novel is also known for its asexuality and repressed homosexuality. How very English! Yet somehow this film works, like Fellowship did. Yes the characters are very cheesy. The viewer does wonder what Sam and Frodo are doing in the bushes when the camera is not on them, perhaps a secret wedding? There was one in Attack of the Clones! Also Aragorn is such a cardboard cut out of a 'hero' that he belongs in the same Parthenon of hero's as Mr T and Shatners infamous Captain Kirk. Aragorn and Legolas, Sam and Frodo. So many cute couples. Lords of each others rings. Thats why I think they threw in some love interests because otherwise...this isn't a fellowship of the ring but a Mardi Gra of the ring. Many people I talk to complain about the issues of lack of depth in the characters. However as I have said, I don't think it is Jacksons fault. I think these flaws go back to the original text. But hey, 'cocktails anybody?'The feminine angle of the film further bugs me when none of the women engage in physical combat! They are forced to look after the kids! Isn't this the 21st century!?! Where the hell was Xena!?! She would have kicked ass! I mean I can't remember the book very well, but didn't women fight? Listen, if you are heavily outnumbered against a bunch of very hungry looking Urak Hai, you would have your wife, daughters and grandmother fighting with pitchforks! The character Eowyn should have had more to kick. She was straight jacketed by the limited role and wasn't let out to kick ass and chew bubble gum! Everyone wants to see sexy chicks kicking ass or mud wrestling.Basically what Jackson has done is take the best elements of the book and made them cool. Observe Legolas using a shield as a skateboard at the battle of Helms Deep. Jackson has 'Matrixed' LOTR. I am sure if Tolkien saw this, he would roll in his grave, either that or spark up a big fat one. The battle scenes are impressive and they made me think that they must have been extraordinarily difficult to film. Tension is actually built up all through the film and by the time Helms Deep rolls around the viewer is at the edge of their seat. Well at least I was! So many aspects of this film could have been so very cheesy. The Ents could have destroyed the whole film. The Golem could have been the worst thing to hit cinemas since Jar Jar Binks or that guy who played Anakin in Clones...The villains are also well done. They look like the evil dead and speak like Sid Vicious. Orcs and Goblins as punks is a cool idea and harks back to Jacksons classic 'Meet the Feebles.' Also an added bonus is that many stars of a local kiwi soap die in this film. To see 'Lionel' and that other guy die is worth the price of admission alone!The set designs, costumes and special effects are all excellent. The filmakers deserve an oscar for those aspects. Golem becomes the first computer generated psycho, who is actually well acted and could give Anthony Perkins a run for his money. WETA obviously went nuts on this movie. The effects literally transport you to another world. I was amazed as Jackson has taken the images of the book and what I imagined and transposed them onto the screen. This is how Tolkiens invented world looks and is! For achieving this feat alone the Jackson team deserve much credit. This film is also a great tourist brochure for New Zealand and hopefully many d&d freaks will come here and pretend to be little goblins in the Mines of Moria.Overall this is a simple film. But it is still a very enjoyable one. The last two points I would like to mention are,1. Why do Christians watch LOTR and boycott Harry Potter? Two Towers has brutal violence and homicidal maniacs that make Josef Stalin look like Timothy Leary! Potter gets picketed and banned in school libraries! Just because Tolkien is Christian and Potter is not devout, that does not mean Potter is an evil little boy who deflowers virgins. That's not Potter, that's Bill Gates. 2. Why did anyone think any of these films would get Oscars? Other than for special effects. It has Hobbits in it! Did anyone notice that? How can anyone take this film seriously? Although Chicago won oscars and it possessed a singing Richard Gere. Jesus, there is hope for ROTK then.I give this film 7 extremely horny and angry Urak Hais out of 10. Thats a B.",7,0,1,3 June 2003
The Incredibles," What a cool movie!
","I thought the Incredibles was brilliant! There are few films that bring out your inner child. In fact, most irritate you! However, this film is like picking up your first superhero comic. What is truly awesome is when all the factors of a big budgeted film come together to make a truly great picture. Pixar cannot seem to make a wrong move. I have not seen any of their other pictures but they are meant to be very good. When effects, acting and story come together it is actually very impressive. George Lucas take note! The voice acting in this film is very good. Craig T Nelson makes a very funny, kind of deadpan Mr Incredible. Also, Jason Lee was an interesting choice to be the baddie, Syndrome. Holly Hunter is also good as Elastigirl. They give the characters a lot of life, which is a good thing considering how flat comic book characters can be. But Brad Bird steals the show as Edna Mode. The superhero fashion designer.What is refreshing about The Incredibles is that it takes a kind of Simpsonesque humour to Superhero movies. With so many 'serious' superhero movies coming out, it is a much needed change of pace. At the heart of this movie is a very well written and clever story. The Incredibles has a solid storyline, instead of being the usual one joke wonder that afflict superhero parodies.The film cuts into the heart of suburbia and takes a look at things like boredom, mediocrity and a stifling sameness. The protests against everyone being the same. The Incredibles are superhero's! Why should they just be like everybody else? All attempts to suburbanize the Incredibles end in failure because they represent the forces of difference and uniqueness. Are not superheroes the ultimate or the most individual of individuals? The film amusingly gives us a look into the everyday lives of superhero's. Mr and Mrs Incredible get married, have kids and get a bit overweight. A very funny example of everyday superhero life is when Mr Incredible works for an insurance company. Another funny bit is when he states that he feels like the maid! Can't the world stay saved for at least 10 minutes? In these moments, that is where the inherent charm lies in the film.There are many great moments in this film. When Frozone is trying to get his suit and his wife is yelling at him. The jokes about villains monologuing. The cape story of Isadora Duncan that not even I was aware of. The domestic over finding the way to the villain. The family squabbling. There are just heaps of funny bits and it does remind you of an episode of the Simpsons.The animation is also really cool and everything has this awesome 60's retro look about it. In fact, I thought this was going to be another overrated, geeky animated superhero film. I have been very pleasantly surprised! The Incredibles is a film that appeals to all ages. With themes like non-conformity, individuality and the strength of a family when it pulls together. How can you possibly go wrong? 10 out of 10. You would have to be a real spoil sport not to like this film. ALL HAIL BRAD BIRD!!! See! Superhero movies don't have to suck!",10,1,4,16 February 2005
Driven," A hilarious homoerotic love story.
","This movie is so bad! It is absolutely terrible. I wish Sylvestor Stallone would do us all a favor and get out of movies altogether. His movies suck, he sucks and his films will always suck. I got the DVD version of driven. I listened to the audio commentary to hear how Stallone could justify the existence of this appalling film. At one point in the commentary Stallone states how a scene where Stallone's character and Burt Reynolds character argue was very hard to write. Then he states that he finds that ALL SCENES ARE HARD TO WRITE IN MOVIES!!! This is the level of incompetence that we are dealing with here.All of the acting, if you can call it that, is inept. Kip Pardue has a constant blank expression and looks like he has been sniffing the petrol that his car runs on. Although, there does seem to be sexual tension between Pardue and Til Schweiger. Obviously they can't express their love for one another so they need to use Estella Warren to do this. She jumps from one man to another, like they are playing pass the parcel. Warren acts like someone dropped her on the head as a child. She has a blank look that rivals Purdue and she even seem to consider blinking to be acting. Keanu Reeves would be proud of these actors and their complete lack of skill. You even have Stallone as the mentor who shows Purdue, ahem, the ropes. Did he use lubricant? All this to capture Schweiger's heart. I hope he appreciates it. Reynolds even develops a tear in his eye....awwww.Not that the actors have much to work with. Stallone writes the characters in such a two dimensional manner that cardboard cut ups of Mr T and William Shatner seem more multi-layered and emotionally complex. Stallone even has a very fruity looking Burt Reynolds as the voyeur. He loves to watch young men with their shirts off racing each other. He wants to race and envies the young racers as they make love passionately.   We know this because STALLONE SPELLS IT OUT AT LEAST THREE TIMES FOR EACH NEW PLOT STRAND!!! There is no ambiguity here. The viewer is handed everything on a platter.
The track becomes the symbol where Pardue tries to prove his love for Schweiger. What should be happening in the bedroom is actually happening on the track. With the fast cars slipping, sliding and banging each other. Yep, this film is as gay as Top Gun! The last scene is hilarious. The characters hold phallic symbols of bottles of champagne and everyone showers frothy champagne over each others bodies. In one last big homosexual orgy! Awww, how sweet, we knew these guys would get together.Then there is the issue of female representation. Gina Gershon is the ball busting ex wife and Warren is that girl from special school who is still wearing nappies. Retards and bit**es. Hmmmnnn.. surely gay men think of women more than this.The film is not even saved by its special effects. The special effects of the race is tacked on. It seems to jump from a playstation racer game then back to the movie.Its all just to horrible and only worth watching for its camp value. I give 2 out of 10 and just cannot believe that Kip Pardue is an actor.",2,0,2,31 December 2003
8 Mile," Just cause you say Dawg alot does not mean you are 'real.' Spoilers!
","I must admit that even though I do not like Eminem's music, the surmise of the film did intrigue me. Indeed watching the film I felt that I had much to identify with. However you realise that anybody with any dream could identify with this picture!This may seem like a good thing, however it is a flaw. That is because once you start thinking about the accesibility of the film. You begin to realise that this is an extremely manipulative picture, which basically exists as public relations for Eminem. It is also a nice little money maker for Hollywood. People in PR get paid loads of money, money that I can only dream about. I therefore resent being made to watch PR by an an acclaimed director on my time! This film will obviously cause even more teenagers to think that Eminem is the second coming of Christ. You can almost hear the cash registers at Hollywood opening with glee at this film. What is apparent, more than anything else here is Hollywood in its greed hurriedly cashing in on the Eminem fad.The cinematography is something that stuck out to me. What is shown is a very hard looking, poverty stricken Detroit. A Detroit that is full of ex-cons and welfare mums. It is obviously the perfect and humble base on which to start a superstar's life. The city looks real but everything walking around in it is false. The question of why the city is doing so poorly is again sidestepped and the viewer isn't told what is keeping these people in crap jobs. This factor makes the film kind of exploitative, its taking hip hop and rap, playing it to the masses as if saying, 'here is something cool and interesting.' But at the same time ignoring the whole hip hop history by not looking at why rap first came to Detroit.The characters come across as fakes and phonies. Firstly you have Eminem himself playing Rabbit. he is portrayed as brooding and introspective, yet sensitive to the needs of others. He does this by being kind to Cheddar Bob who shoots himself in the leg. He makes fun of Exhibit but only to stick up for the homosexual man at his work. His tirades against women in the film are justified because all except 'the virgin,' his little sister, betray him in some way. In fact the sister seems to be nothing more than another emotional button to press on the audience. Eminem seems to have the biggest virgin/whore complex that I have ever witnessed in an entertainer. What is happening is that media spin  tactics are being forced, like bits of broken glass, jaggedly down the viewers throat. O'l Curtis is maximising Eminems conventional side and his working class ethic to work hard and succeed. On the other hand we have dodgy Curtis downplaying the negative side of Eminem, such as his noted homophobia and his misogynistic hatred of women. Well they gave him a sister so he must love women right?His friends also are about as real as Hulk Hogan and the other characters from the WWF. There is, Future, who is obviously based partially on Dre. He is Eminems mentor and almost personifies support. His other friends are just paragons of loyalty and support. How could a woman ever compare to his posse? Yet he is homophobic, maybe not. Maybe he likes hanging loose with the boyz!All of Eminems friends are bad in a ghetto sought of way, but not really bad. Actually and predictably they all have hearts of gold. None of them, of course, use guns and this issue is sidestepped. It's more played up for comic effect with the scene with Cheddar Bob. Naughty Curtis has lil Kim Basinger screech her way into the epitome of bad mothers so she can become yet another symbol of adversity for Eminem. When she won the lottery after her bastard boyfriend left her. I just groaned. Can it get any more corny? I wondered this with beer. Yes it could and the ending with Eminem in rap battles shows just how corny one film can be.Rabbit had to lose his first competition, why? Well to truly find himself in a macho sought of way he must go through a series of masochistic episodes. He is kicked out of his apartment by his ex. He is forced to move back into the trailer with his hated Mommy and then finally has to take a beating. Only through pain can he develop his identity enough to use it as a kind of weapon in the last part of the film. Calling himself trash and a bum he goes onto win the freestyle comp through what I call poverty rap. Eminem is not a gangster like Ice Cube or Tupac. However he gets kudos for being poor. This is enough to win him the competition because Papa Doc his competition is found out to be a poseur from a private school and has the real name of Clarence. Clarence loses his 'blackness' and Eminem gains street cred for being 'real.'The end is the most interesting part of the film. Eminem just goes bact to work. He decides not to team up with his mentor, Future as an announcer at the club. Neither does he hang out with his buddies. What is the point? They no longer serve any purpose within the narrative of the story. He walks off into the distance like big 'ol John Wayne in any Western. It is odd because this is a film that draws two cultures together and now it pulls them back apart. Huh? Start the debate on this scene someone.I give this film a 5.5 rabid, foaming dawg D.J. battles out of 10 or a C. Next time Eminem have some balls and make sure Inholywood represents life in the ghetto properly. Everybody sees through this!",5,0,3,4 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I steal from every movie ever made.
","I think that this quote from film maker Tarantino perfectly captures Kill Bill and its endless references to other films. The excess references artful or annoying? I still have not decided.Some of the things that follow Tarantino films make my skin crawl. For example the rabid fans, the geeks with their black t-shirts and their obsessive record and DVD collections. The ones that refer to the director as 'QT.' Another example would be all the fashion crap that seems to travel. Vain celebrities who hope to get noticed by being at QT's premieres. I hate Hollywood! Will there now be a million duplicates of Kill Bill? I hope not.I have extremely mixed feelings about Tarantino and his films. His movies are ultra-violent with little redeeming value. 'Kill Bill' shows Tarantino to be a kind of Godard of Violence. The problem with a film like Kill Bill is that it seems that you really have to be a teenager to enjoy the movie. I am sure many adolescent males will love this film along with its cult movie flavors. Kill Bill reminded me of when I first discovered Manga. I thought it was the cool new thing at the time. Anything with super-violence appeals to you when you are a teenager! I am  older now and have left Manga and comics behind. But this film and its popularity  proves that some people still reside at this developmental point. What is with all the comic book films?My main complaint of Kill Bill is like a comic book, there is no psychological depth to any of the characters. The figures in this film could all be action figures from your local Wal-Mart. The plot is that a woman goes to get married in Texas. Her old assassin pals show up and kill everyone at the wedding chapel. The bride is left for dead but survives. She proceeds to enact revenge by killing literally hundreds of people.
That is the movie in all its simplicity. That is why Kill Bill bugs me. The film is like a glossy magazine for people with ADD. It is pretty, glossy with beautiful people plastered all over it. But it has absolutely no depth. What is interesting is that Tarantino films used to be synonymous with clever dialogue. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were cool because they had some interesting dialogue. Remember Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink? Remember Samuel. L. Jackson and the path of the righteous man?  Yeah, that was some cool dialogue! Moreover, the films of Tarantino all speak like he does, in that motor-mouth random fashion. In Kill Bill the dialogue is very minimal, which actually surprised me.The major factor in this film is that it is a 70's or 80's action film that has all the terrible idiocy taken out. It is a 'Delta Force' with no Chuck Norris. it has high production values, good acting, superb direction and nice choreography. In other words it is everything an action film is not. But it is also as standard as any action film gets. This is exhibited by the usual revenge plot that we the viewer have observed so many time in other action films.Tarantino must be congratulated for making an action film that is not stale. This standard action flick still manages to be fresh even though the material is not. It is well filmed and I liked the animation sequences. But animation interjected into a live action film is a double edged sword because it reinforces the idea that you are watching nothing more than a comicbook. For me it makes the film seem like it lacks depth. What is interesting here is that there is another film that suffered  from the same problem as Kill Bill. That film was Natural Born Killers. Actually written by Tarantino but directed by Oliver Stone.  The film threw in a lot of things, including an animation sequence. This  detracted from N.B.K and made it seem even more shallow than it was. the constant insertion of different styles detracted from the film. Most notably the dysfunctional family sequence set to a sitcom format.However Kill Bill is the better film and there are some good things about it. The fact that you have some damn fine looking woman fighting, this is always a good thing! Samarai swords and swordfights are cool. There is no way of getting around that fact! I thought it was quite amusing to have a kung fu fight set in a domestic setting! There was another cool bit where the Bride tells a young gangster off by smacking his bottom with a sword. 'This is what get for messing with the Yakuza!'  YOU GO GIRL!!!' There is another great bit where the Japanese sword-maker states that if God were in a swordfight with the Bride and his sword, God itself would be cut. This is a nice touch and reminds the viewer that Tarantino still has his dark sense of humor.But the main problem with this film is exhibited by the final part of Kill Bill. Ultimately the movie is one long video game. It reminded me of  when I played Enter the Matrix on the playstation two. But then I have never really been a kung fu movie fan. Kill Bill is a film that will not linger in my mind. It is not my kind of film but at the same time I can recognize Tarantino's talent. This is volume one and I don't really care what happens in volume two. I was pretty indifferent to the characters because they had the character development of WWF wrestlers. I kept expecting the Rock to appear at some stage. But in a film such as this, who wants character development? Watching a film like Kill Bill makes me want to see something character driven like Six Feet Under to compensate. I give this a 7 out of 10 and feel a definite ambivalence.",7,0,3,3 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wow!!!
","What a film! There was a time when I read fantasy novels avidly. This was about when I was 11 or 12. Peter Jackson has reminded why I found them so enjoyable. Roger Ebert comments that this film is not great. I disagree, I think this movie taps the spirit of the books excellently. Like the books, which were a great literary achievement, the films will last forever as a great cinematic achievement.Compare this to the other popular movie trilogies. The Star Wars prequels are awful. The Matrix lost its way. ROTK doesn't drop the ball. Instead like the cinematic equivalent of a Jonah Lomu it stomps down the opposition and scores a try. Now that we know the characters, Jackson builds on them and gives them a little more depth. Thats what I thought hurt the last film. The characters were too much like cardboard cut outs. The problems are still there but they are replaced with some fantastic performances. The acting was universally good. My favourite was Sam, Sean Astin is excellent as this character. Its funny because when I read the books, I did not really like the character and thought he was a bit lame. Astin is awesome as Sam and shows the character to be one of the most important characters of the story. The scene where Sam picks up Frodo is my favorite in the film. I don't know the actor from anything else but I really hope his career goes places. Likewise, Andy Serkis as the Gollum is also excellent and really nails the Gollum who seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder. Both actors should be up for an oscar.The film is exhausting but in a good way. I mean you have dragons, giant elephants, an army of the dead, eagles, a giant spider. All are excellently done. My favorite monster was Shelob. She was disgusting and really made me want to buy some fly spray. There is just so much going on that it is mind boggling. It is just a huge, huge film! What a ride! It made me feel like a little kid again. To me, I think this is the next Star Wars series. The next films that just grabs everyones attention.  Jackson has set the bar for film making on a colossal scale. How many fantasy films work? Remember 'Dungeons and Dragons?' It would be cool if somewhere along the line, Jackson made 'The Hobbit.' I think Jackson immerses you in this world so well that people will be able to understand why their kids get so into this genre.The other aspect that stuck out to me was the camera work. Very well done, the camera swoops around giving the viewer dizzying glances of battles in middle earth. In fact their are shots that show such a detailed world that it rivals the Star Wars films set design. The shot of the dragons attacking the city is amazing.What is so great about this film is that 'the Two Towers' pretty much sidelined the Hobbits. Jackson puts the focus on the Hobbits and the Gollum. This really brings out what the novels are all about. That the smallest of things can fight and win against ultimate evil.Some complained the ending went on for far too long and I would have to agree a little bit. However it lets you know what happens to these characters that we have been seeing every Christmas. I noticed many differences from the original books but it does not bother me. I mean, if you want 100 percent faithful adaption of the books, read them. I just thank god that Jackson got rid of Tom Bombadil. I thought that character was so lame!The problem is that I really cannot see this film getting any oscars because it is a fantasy film. These kinds of films only get oscars for special effects. Plus with Clint Eastwood's Mystic River and Peter Weir's Master and Commander, I think these films will pick up the oscars. Especially Mystic River because it is a 'serious' dramatic work.
A great adaption of a rollicking good story! See this film! It will bring out your inner child. ALL HAIL PETER JACKSON!!!",10,0,2,28 December 2003
The Matrix," There is no spoon...
","This of one of the many psuedo-philosophical statements that is uttered by one of the minor character's of the film. The Matrix is a geeky film. Everyone, especially Morpheus speak in semi-priest like ravings. His character is based on John the baptist, isn't it? Everyone has stupid computer geek like names, like Neo or Tank. It should be annoying and cringe inducing. Bringing up images of geeky computer nerd, teenage goths. You know, those ones that spend all their time listening to Skinny Puppy and quoting Nietzsche out of context. The ones that dress like Mortis the Depeche Mode goblin.However despite all its faults this is an exceptional film. A film that when it came out was thrilling and innovative. This film made the 'Phantom Menace' look like what it is, a piece of crap. The Wachowski brothers have shown their influences to range from Jean Baudrillard, gnostic thought to Japanese anime such as 'Ghost in the Shell.' There is lots of stuff going on within the narrative and its refreshing to see an action film that has something of a brain. See Hollywood you can still make films with explosions and not always go for the lowest common denominator.The problem was that it was so good that a sequel was inevitably doomed unless more innovative stuff was put into the film. Empire magazine wrote an article on the state of the art special effects that were used in 'Reloaded.' However it was the actual concepts that got people excited and the next film only offered some flimsy philosophical ideas on free will.
This film has been embraced by so many crusty academics and religious zealots who use this film to push their own ideologies. Everyone took this film way to seriously. I mean it's like 'Fight Club,' it is a thrilling ride but thats about it. Christians say that you free your mind by believing in a spiritual reality. Media professors state the matrix is a metaphor for the media, which controls attitudes and perceptions. Psychologists tell me that the matrix is a metaphor for the mind. All reality is perception, therefore when you change cognitions, you change your reality. Free your mind. There are other interpretations but you do you get my drift?  The fact that it has got the attention of so many different kinds of intelligent people is a good example of why this is such a good film. It really grabs the imagination of the audience.The  film is competent. I'm not use to seeing competence in sci-fi films. I am still getting over 'The Shape of things to come.' However everyone does well here. One of my favourite characters is actually Morpheus who is very well played by Laurence Fishburne. He pulls off some pretty difficult dialogue convincingly. Keanu 'Whoa! I still can't act' Reeves even manages to be bearable. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity is also quite good. I liked Cypher as Judas. But the man who steals the show is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. He is a bad guy that is unnervingly alike to my work and income case manager. I kept expecting him to look out from the screen and say 'Mr Skeptic, have you found work yet?' His camp demeanor is funny and effective and this is played on more in the sequel.The imagery is also good and when Neo was being pursued by the bad guys I was reminded of Franz Kafka's 'The Trial.' The Matrix is a world that seems to look alot like downtown Sydney. The s&m tendencies of the directors seems to spill onto this film and everyone dresses like they are off to the 'torture garden.' The infamous s&m club.  It certainly is not a way to keep a low profile. I think I would notice a whole bunch of people dressed in PVC with machine guns.Despite these nigglings this movie is one hell of a ride. Even though it is a hive of geekdom. Recommended. I give it 8 depressed goths out of 10 existential computer nerds.",8,0,2,25 December 2003
