Blade Runner 2049," The original is on a whole other level
","In Blade Runner (1982) you are transported into that world, it feels real. In Blade Runner 2049 not so much, it is ultimately superficial in comparison and holds you at arm's length throughout. It's uninviting whereas Ridley Scott's film unearthed true beauty in it's bleakness.I guess this is what separates Ridley from the likes of Villeneuve and his Hollywood counterparts. Ridley was a true visionary and his film understands the importance of spirit of place and the fragility of the human condition. Blade Runner 2049 might have a more conventional and rounded story arch but is predictable and less interesting for it. It is ultimately cold and contentious at heart. An interesting film and insightfully theoretical if not a little spiteful in rhetoric. The original works on a whole other level. It is metaphysical, spiritual and ambiguous by nature and design. 2049 is a good film and well made by today's standards but it is not the 'masterpiece' critics are prematurely touting it to be.",7,2,9,6 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A True Star Wars Film
","I was so grateful for the release of Rogue One after the disappointment of Ep7 The Force Awakens. The latter currently scoring just slightly higher than Rogue One on IMDb (at 8.1). Sure Ep7 serves a purpose and clearly satisfies it's contemporary demographic. But it's one that I do not associate with, myself being a massive fan of the original trilogy from back in the day. Rogue One really understands the Star Wars ethos and plays out all the beats of the originals, staying true to the lore with integrity and originality. You know watching Rogue One that the director is a fan and is 100 percent invested, making it all the more easy for the viewer to invest also. And that I did.The real highlight of this movie is the return of Darth Vader, who's ominous presence is felt throughout and as the tension reaches it's climactic crescendo he gives us a moment of such awe and dread it's right up there amongst his most iconic scenes. With all the superficial remakes and expanded universe franchises being churned out today. Rogue One took us back to that familiar world of A New Hope, where the sense of peril and wonderment is back to it's visceral best. Kudos to Gareth Edwards for this standalone movie. It is so well crafted, brilliantly acted and tidily scripted. But more importantly it truly is the love letter all Star Wars fans have been longing for. 10/10",10,3,13,9 August 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Mindless nonsense
",More mindless nonsense terrible cgi animation and no story of any interest. Kids dig this crap. We are encouraging a generation of idiots. Get back to making real movies Disney. You used to be so good at it!,1,2,8,14 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Good but lacks what the original(s) had in abundance...
","Which was originality along with a sense of realism, wonderment and awe.Although a good effort from JJ, the criteria bestowed upon him by Disney is very present here. Watching it in the theater, my 8 year old nephew turned to me and whispered 'this is more like a comedy!'. I was already well sunken into my seat by that point. It was simply too cartoonish and felt incoherent with the originals that were so much more grounded and realistic with just enough humour to round out the characters.For the record my nephew didn't want to see The Force Awakens a second time. I did, but not immediately and although it was much better the second time around it's unoriginality was clear throughout.The dialogue and action is good but staged and coincidental, much like a US sitcom, it was farcical. It's pacing is very fast, there are no moments where the camera doesn't move, track or zoom. Its frenetic from start to finish and this diminishes the scenes that should have a real impact. The story is unoriginal which surprised me the most seeing as Kasdan was involved.Return Of The Jedi ended with the rebellion victorious and so you'd expect to see the new republic in all it's glory with the uprising of a 'new rebellion', The First Order. Instead we have a fully operational Empire 2.0 already set in place, only bigger and seemingly more menacing. Wait did we miss something??? Of course we did, thats what JJ wants, huge gaps in the narrativeÂ…. And so our heroes 'The Resistance' now have to destroy an even bigger more destructive version of the Death Star in similar fashion to what we saw in A New Hope and Return Of The Jedi. A great story was waiting to be told but instead we get a neatly packaged but over condensed movie that pulls from the original trilogy, leaving everything open to interpretation and speculation, a tact Abrams has built his career on. To me this shows a lack of any original ideas and plays on the manifestation of the audiences own thoughts. This in my opinion is lazy and cynical movie making.Admittedly Abrams has to adhere to the modern day audience and not that of 1977-83 but when my nephew, who has watched the originals since he was 3 tells me 'It's not like Star Wars' then you know whats up.Granted TFA is miles better than the prequels, with interesting characters and some great moments but it still falls well short of the originals. I can't help but feel TFA has been manufactured to suit a youngling audience with no prior recollection of the original films while taking us willing fans along for the ride.I hope we get something to really invest in with Ep 8 and 9. If history does repeat itself then perhaps The Force Awakens will be the lesser of the new trilogy much like ROTJ was to the originals.",6,16,28,14 January 2016
