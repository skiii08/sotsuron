Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Good Movie - Know what your going into
","This is a good movie as long as you know what you are going into. It is not meant to be a historical documentary. Some look at it and see the name 'Abraham Lincoln' and expect the movie to contain more of an historical aspect to the flick; however, in reality, it is a movie regarding Vampires. So, if you like vampire movies, you will probably like this. I read the reviews from others and they complain about how the book is so much different, well it is different. But anyone that reads a book and then expects it to be exactly the same (Other than Harry Potter Enthusiasts) has basically gone off the deep end. The movie does contain somewhat of the same plot, but it is not exactly the same. I like a lot of what some would categorize as 'weird movies,' and enjoy the occasional vampire movie as long as its not overly gory, which this isn't. Its a good movie, just know what you are going to see, not what some wish it could be.",7,4,5,3 January 2017
