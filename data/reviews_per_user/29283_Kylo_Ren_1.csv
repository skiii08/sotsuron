Raiders of the Lost Ark," My favorite film of all time.
","If you have not seen this film, this is it. The top. This is the most exciting and entertaining film that has ever been made. Harrison Ford creates a truly iconic character named Indiana Jones. Conceived by George Lucas and molded by Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly a sight to be seen. Inspired by many of the 1930's serial films like its cousin Star Wars, Raiders keeps you on the edge of your toes. The whip, the leather jacket and of course the hat have become iconic with film lore. Indiana Jones is the all American hero, the American James Bond. The sequels were all great and highly entertaining films thanks to Lucas, Spielberg and Ford, but Raiders is truly a masterpiece to behold.",10,2,4,27 May 2014
