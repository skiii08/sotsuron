Miracle," Great
","This is the best hockey movie of all time! Kurt Russell was amazing. All of the actors who were the players were great. This should of been nominated for an Oscar. Kurt Russell should have been nominated for an Oscar also! I love this movie! Top 5 sports movies(not in order) Hoosiers, Rudy, Miracle, The Babe, Field of Dreams. All of these movies are great but Miracle steps forward and send across more than sports. There are life lessons to be learned and also you can learn a lot about that time period. Watching Miracle is truly a lifting experience. Miracle stands above the rest by making a movies with such great action and with a sport that has only been measured in Hollywood by Slapshot and MVP.",10,1,1,13 March 2005
