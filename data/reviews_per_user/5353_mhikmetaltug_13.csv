Ford v Ferrari," A Tribute to another forgotten heroes
","This is a movie that tributes to some men who lost their names in the history boiler, actually shows the amateur spirit of the racing sports. With limited material support on their individual account compared to todays billion dollar budget business of race sports, Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby takes effort to win a most important racing event in the world. Even you are not a huge fan of motor sports you would enjoy this movie like I did on 'Moneyball', '42' or 'Field of Dreams' even I don't like baseball. Christian Bale and Matt Damon will assure you that you enjoy the movie while you're watching it.
Besides the great actors' performances, you will like the cinematography, effects and the intriguing story that tells the rivalry between two big car and motor companies Ford v Ferrari as they give their name to the movie. A Nice and satisfying action and drama you have to watch.",8,1,2,27 March 2020

BlacKkKlansman," Brillant Spike Lee's latest masterpiece
","I love Spike Lee sarcasm. His realistic point of view truly amazes me every time I watch a work of his.
He always vouches for black community however, including the villains, degenerates and the oppressors in the public take place in his picture without harsh denunciations. On the contrary, all his characters appear in his movies with the idea of 'we are all human after all.' Thus, this naturalism is always giving the audience the message of 'It's useless and the most ridiculous thing to fight each other in a racist perspective, or a in religious diversity especially in the U.S.A where the multiculturalism has been living since in its origins'.
BlacKkKlansman as in its double party plot which the audience sees the inner circle of the kkk and the Black Civil Right group, defends the idea I mentioned above. I think Spike Lee's anti-acute diversion picturization with his usual sarcasm he uses in both communities in his movies, demonstrates the sick parts of discrimination in a nation in a better way (Like in BlacKkklansman) rather than the hatred, violence and brutality are pictured.
In technical angle, the cinematography, mise en scene and the shooting smells like an auteur work as Lee has it with his many years experience in Hollywood and movie is perfect in total.
The story is very intriguing as it has savour of political matters, crime, action, drama and in some points humor.
I recommend it, at least you won't get bored and have a good two. hours",9,4,7,29 March 2020
Black Mass," Lack of Taste, Black Mass critic.
","Young director Scott Cooper's third directing experience Black Mass, tells the real story of 'James 'Whitey' Bulger', a well-known Mobster who was active in South Boston in the period of 1970's until mid-1990's. I found the biography of Whitey Bulger intriguing. Johnny Depp as the Bulger character vitalizer, did well job on the character, And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch's presence in the cast, as William Bulger (brother of Whitey) must have made the attraction on the audience. I found it wise to blend his acting skills, with one of the most characteristic actor, Depp. Generally I admit the casting was good. Everything in the director Scott Cooper's kitchen, such as great actors, cinematography and a unique biography adopted script, has been served to him, to cook. However, I found something missing meanwhile, I was expecting more from the movie. I loved the art direction, shooting angles, acting and etc. But still I felt the attachment problem with the arid taste of editing and directing. The main problems of the latest Hollywood Mobster movies are these actually. The same scenes with individual violent punishments of betray, the boss's and the gangs sudden rise story, depicted in one scene in a few seconds, boss's problems shown as his loneliness as he loses his family members or getting frustrated with his wife and old friends. And in the aspect of the gang members, senior to junior, feeling the boss fear with a thinking of the boss is going mad day by day. The all come as in the right and simultaneous way, just as millions of other similar late Hollywood Mobster movies.Scarface 'Tony Montana' had been brought in life by 'Al Pacino'. It was unique and it still is mentioned as a classic Mob-story because It was the first. The depiction of Tony Montana from his penniless times to become the drug lord of the whole Miami depicted almost same as In this biographic history of Whitey Bulger. Besides, Scarface was more violent and graphic, It wasn't the style that made it apart from it's equivalents (for instance) as 'Black Mass'. The real difference was its way of giving the sense of ambition and violent side of Tony Montana to the audience, with much more accurate catharsis than the others. I am sure, the acting skills of Al Pacino as playing the character, such as using his mimics, anger expositions, both physical and mental descents and ascents, must have thrilled and caused more emotional changes than the after 2000's mob story movies on the audience while watching Scarface, even second time as well. I felt that way at least. So the missing part was generally the lack of the absorption of the characters by me. It is possible for the director, wanting to stay loyal to the real life story of the Whitey Bulger so that, maybe his calm and creepy silent characteristic depiction was thought to be depicted sovereign. The violence was castrated by the director and the editors maybe, instead of a more novelish way of narration. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it, to get the feeling from a genre that I like to watch. But, for instance, 'Kill The Irishman', 'Departed' (although I believe that it was inspired by the Hongkong version 'Infernal Affairs') and some more other examples of TV and cinema productions, telling the inside stories of Irish mobs made me more attached than 'Black Mass'. Unfortunately, I must admit that it would be much more effective with its cast, and unique biographical story.",7,3,5,1 October 2015
Southpaw," There Should Always Be Hope.
","Whenever I decide to watch a mainstream movie, I always hope to get enough satisfaction, excitement and joy. Because I believe that the first goal of a movie is to entertain and give the feeling to you in a right way. I am or the general audience is not an academy jury member and 'Southpaw' is not an artistically estimated movie neither.I can tell that the movie has that stereotype motive blended all over in its structure.But like I said, I always try not be a smartypants like the audience who has nothing to do with film business and watches few films, criticizing them as same copies of each other. The work, effort of the crew and actors, writers and everyone else is always deserve respect in this business, unless they obey the rule of honesty and only if they avoid commercial concerns, crew, actor based self-entertainment motive, which means fooling the audience with trashy and slipshod work.So, after I put all these elements on the consideration of my review, I found the movie satisfying. The film bases on a success story of a boxer (Billy Hope) who has a rugged up life comes from bottom, reaches the top, falls to the bottom and gets his throne again in the end. It seemed so familiar to you too. Yes, I know. However, sometimes you watch a movie even if you know what will happen from the beginning till the end. And yes 'Southpaw' is a kind of these movies.The attraction mostly takes place in the mid part in this kind of movies. And every time it is the deciding part. The mid part (except the beginning and the ending) showed me some different dialogues, characters and motive of a boxer that I can call them unique in comparison with all time sport movie clich√©s, that every one of them's must have scenes lets call it.Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his elder statesman coach Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) maintains harmony and the depiction of their relationship got the best points from me. The two Star's performances is the biggest reason for the great harmonic relationship depiction for sure.The other appreciative point from me goes to the physical pain and psychological pain blend's success. The both Billy's and Tick's sufferings from their miserable life and sharing that in a frame of a naive and honest friendship, Billy's remembrance of his orphanage years and his hard tries to prevent his daughter to end up like him until her adulthood, gives the feeling. And despite the Billy's story is more original and less stereotype than Tick's returning to professional Trainor life for just one match (Like many of the other sport movies) I felt sorry for him anyway, because I usually observed that in this kind of movies the returning trainer's arrogance still does exist and distance with his students stays stable. But as I said I felt sorry and pitied him maybe because of Forest Whitaker's fatherly performance and giving the soft-hearted courageous man image inside his huge and tough looking body.For last words, I recommend 'Southpaw' as a watchable movie without big expectations of a masterpiece. And it will a good choice to spend two hours if you have some spare time and you have nothing to do anything else.",Null,0,0,21 September 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Every good and bad aspect of being famous
","In the last few decades on Hollywood cinema, biography of a star has been pictured with all the good and the bad vibes in their life.
This is another kind of the blunt stories of a sensational star. The reality of the rising and downfall of a star really amazes you. Sometimes you envy the star's life and you badly like to be like him and sometimes you thank god you're just a simple person.
Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly that kind of biographical work that you envy to be Freddie Mercury and you pity his loneliness because it is simply a person's life who lived a moderately short life with fame and glory that you would never want or you would, accepting to die at his age to live that splendid life.
Beautiful acting by Rami Malek, good shortened precise biography with the most important moments and joyful of queen music both acoustic, live and studio versions.
And if you are even a little bit into queen, you should never miss it.",9,1,2,27 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Yes he did it again !
","Tarantino is always Tarantino. Even he mentions the naked truth in his movies, he dresses it up.
The movie proceeds in his orbit. Absurd, unexpected and unbalanced violence scenes stage in the cinematography as usual. Roles of the vfp (very famous person) in the movie, it's also a usual characteristic of a Tarantino movie.
As you approach to the end while watching it, you will understand what I mean at the beginning of the article as he surprises the audience again with a real story touches interpreted by his own.",8,3,4,27 March 2020
Ex Machina," Modern Time Frankensteins; Ex Robot Film Review.
","We are in 2015 and we are still not sure about that, one day the robots we create can rule us.For over 40 years, that possibility has been a part of Robot themed Sci-fi movies.The curiosity of the audience mostly ended in a terrifying way.The Robot films generally terrify the audience about them, taking control of the all human resources with their intelligence created by humans.And taking revenge from the people because of people seeing them as consumable machines. In the most of the TV series and movies this idea of using the robots as changing batteries, interrupted by a scientist who wants to make them one step ahead of the others and create a humanlike model of robot.The mood of the scientist is mostly joyful and fearful when he is creating the most emotional Robot.He doesn't hesitate, even he knows that the robotic power and their artificial intelligence can take over the control on him and the world by increasing the number of the emotional A.I. robots.The fear and feeling the adrenaline of creating a thing by pretending to be god, of course, make a scientist amazed by himself and be proud of himself, but usually the fear of the possibility turns the audience furious towards the scientist who creates the emotional robots in these movies and usually the audience begin to blame him being a psychopath or an irritating person. The Ex Machina is one of the latest kinds of the Robotic catastrophe.The film's plot is based on an obsessed genius emotional robot creator, its emotional tester man, and the robotic woman itself.The main plot makes its difference from other movies step by step.The process of the Robotic films is commonly same.As I watched many A.I films, I mostly observed the dramatic end of the robot after they had been created emotionally and taking revenge from the creators and then the world, using their physical power and intelligence.But after I watched Ex Machina, for a while later it seemed more and more interesting to me. The slow beginning continued with stirring scenes like the flash in the pan and some of the scenes made me wonder to reach the final in the easiest way but, finally I realized that the scenes that I found unnecessary was really necessary to complete the story.'Warning Spoilers in this paragraph'Caleb's (Domhnall Gleeson) British naivety could be seen just after a while later the film starts and it continues until the end.First he thinks that he is the chosen one in the genius robot creator's computer enterprise to test the humanlike robot yet to release, and emotionally shows the traces of how he weakly will handle a robotic relationship with an A.I. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) Is the genius creator scientist of the A.I woman robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander) basically I think Isaac played his role just well like Gleeson.Both physical appearances of the actors took part in it also. Anyway Nathan is also the owner of the company that Caleb works for and with his intelligence and bright mind he chooses the naive Employee Caleb, with a plan of finding the emotionally weakest one by a sweepstake trick and invites him to the creation facility as the winner of the contest. He has an arrogance of being a genius and taking advantage of the women robots that he creates with his fetishist fantasies sometimes and in the influence of his drinking problem. The film continues as the classic A.I film plot.The young and emotionally weak tester boy used by the bad attitude scientist who treats his products like a slave after he programs them emotionally. The audience could frustrate for a long time, slander the scientist and maybe curse him, the point of view changes towards to the end as I mentioned before.Ava (the female robot) and Nathan begins to impress from each other and the bad scientist's plan works perfectly with a love story.But the genius scientist knows the danger and completes the testing experiment process and makes the biggest mistake by telling the young lover Caleb that he will tear down the experimental robot Ava.Naturally the emotional pretender Ava hears that up and the real sentimental Caleb make a salvation plan for her before he leaves the facility.The ending was outstanding.It was like a new peculiar movie. After that love, revenge, and real emotion fake emotion conflicts, tragic incident mixture occurs on the script.The message of faking the human emotions and the acting capability of a Robot in an arousing way that created by a human, can be devastating for fooling the people with standard intelligence and can cause deaths as if robots only take bad human behaviours like taking revenge, manipulation or being free in a society without caring general public rules.",8,0,2,4 September 2015
Everest," Suffocating,Freezing,Exhausting: EVEREST Film Review
","Disaster movies usually create one of the most empathetic gaze in the presence of the audience. From that point, the movie should a little bit tense and disturbing if the director wants a real interaction. With his mostly 2 well known Hollywood directing such as '2 Guns' and 'A Little Trip to Heaven' 'Baltasar Korm√°kur' can reach at the peak of Hollywood with his third movie Everest. Except some long and emotionally fulfilled saving process scenes, the empathetic side of the suffocating, freezing and exhausting feeling has been experienced by me even I was watching it lying on my bed. The mainstream disaster movies' plots were full of thrilling sudden actions and scary accidents mostly causing the death of the supporting actors. The effect supported dying scenes, brutal events and stereotype leave the dying behind, like nothing happened and continue, because you are Sylvester Stallone and you are the strongest man in the world plots, wasn't as effective as these claustrophobic ones have been shot in past few years. And as the leading example, I could possibly say that 127 hours has blazed a trail and we are Glad, It did.The film bases on gathered people from all around the world, nothing left for them to get excited in their life and paying a big amount of money to climb Everest and eager to take place in the history books. These activists are assisted with the professional climbers in addition to the service they bought. The movie begins with a classic beginning. The depiction of the collective excitement of the first timers, experienced amateur climbers, and the professionals, gathering in Nepal having fun and training. With this Classic dialogues and scenes, we see the climbers' families reaching them with satellite phones, and emotional depiction of the climber's fear implies when they speak to their families on the phone.And the climbing part as the second part of the movie begins with a classical and rapid climbing victory scene and joyful celebrations appears as plenty of them reach the peak.The thrilling begins slightly and you feel the peak point's low oxygen level in an exhausting gaze.Then suddenly film turns into a complete thriller and achieves its goal of keeping alive of the audience's nausea, suffocating and exhausting feelings when the climbers die one by one freezing and facing the same circumstances we live hypothetically.And maybe the process of their survival efforts and in the meantime, the emotional connections with their family and with the rest of the team members who are in a lower altitude, seemed long to me. However, as a challenging film lover myself, I bet the catharsis of the climbers' realistic process of survival struggle would work on the audience who loves hard to watch movies too. And the relief of the sleepy death and joy of surviving blend at the end makes the audience think; It was worth to struggle while watching it. The death is everywhere even you are rich or poor and sometimes you can't even know if you have paid lots of money to prepare your sweet sleepy death.",7,0,1,22 September 2015
Parasite," I remunerate that's an original script. That much Oscars? Doubtful
","Bong Joon Ho had done a great job. One of the most original international script and his directing was brilliant. The plexal events leads the scipt to a wonderful inevitable ending that would both expected and harshly expected by the audience. I can't say much about acting since I don't know Korean but the story slowly swallowed me up. Mostly with the raising the complexity of the plex of the plot as I mentioned.
Personally, I have of course no doubt about its originality and uniqueness, however I still think that maybe the best international film award would go to Almadovar's Pain and Glory as Parasite was declared as the Best Picture of the year.",8,0,1,27 March 2020
Straight Outta Compton," Rhymes of The Ghetto
","'Straight Outta Compton' has the similar taste of the other Music business,Wall Street business and the merchandise business movies which could easily satisfy and inspire the young audience to live their Katharsis of being a successful man or woman in the future, like the depicted successful people in these biographical genre movies. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street ). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell. Especially to young needy teenagers and young people eager to try everything to break the societies pressures and taboos.The expectation on the box office is important of course. 'Straight Outta Compton' will possibly gain the success on box office.But some effectiveness' can make the audience feel uncomfortable about watching it again or remember it as their one of all time favorite classic. At least I will criticize the defectiveness that I have determined after I watched the movie until the end.The Subject of the biographic approach of Rap All-Stars is a perfect and unique idea. The originality can't be questioned. However the catharsis that I have mentioned before could not work for all cinema audience, I found the directing, acting and narration superficial.This was not the first biographical movie that has disappointed me with its narration and process of progression. And I think that won't be the last for sure.That's another argument.The main point is some biographies made by commercial concerns and cosmetic structure, harms them sometimes.This is the Rap Music's fathers' story,the action scenes could be more efficient on the contrary of matching some action b-movies, the classical and vigilant music agent profile played by Paul Giamatti, gave me the feeling of the same type which I ran across in other Music based movies.The actors who play the role of The Rap creators are good. The lack of the Katharsis begins with their shallow depiction, so that I definitely think that Dre or Ice Cube or Eazy E's lives depiction with other characters and crowded casting had created that mess and caused the defectiveness. Because almost 2 and a half hour movie isn't enough to depict the whole family of rap's beginning and the depiction of separate lives of them could make a better order in the narration. Linked to that criticism of the shallow narration, the documentary trace additions which would be a good idea on a biographical Movie, was used ineffectively in my opinion. For Example The Rap's born documentary series on VH1 would be watchable for all kinds of documentary lovers, so I believe that in the movie this magazine coverage documentary style is used by showing the social struggles of the Rapper's since their youth, the police's tough attitudes to the Black Citizens in their Neighbourhoods and putting the actual footage of the fights and plundering in the ghettos. However the idea of Half magazine and half crime narrated documentary style using in a movie, is very hard job and I realized that some parts were good adopted from this kind of E! or VH1 documentaries but some parts seemed weak because of several things that make the distinction between Documentary Movie and Cinema Movie, which would cause dead ends on the narration of Cinema Movie.For instance the lack of voice narration as a result of the director's obligation of staying out of magazine words, the time-lapse difference between a documentary and a movie,the slow timing usage to tell the story in the movie on the contrary of a rushing biographical documentary and doing it with telling the audience the story of at least 5-6 rap stars in such a slow occasion, had killed the spirit of the 'Magazine-Documentary- Biography' triplet style depiction. But I still believe that 'Straight Outta Compton' could easily be the first and unique example of the future styles of direction and maybe could create a new unique genre as well.",8,83,167,20 September 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," An original and unique spy comedy. Kingsman: The Secret Service Movie Review.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service seemed rubbish American actioned comedy for the first time I decided to watch. Besides the beautiful unique ones I admire my general impressions of the Hollywood made action comedy spy movies triggered my prejudice as usual.Then I have decided to watch it.The same beginning of a spy movie occurred on the screen. An action scene, Special forces, and casualties then a peaceful beginning of a new story with more actions.The situation was simple and similar as usual. But after a while the process of the film plot has begun to show me pleasant surprises with its eclectic context.The British spy marks of the context may not seem to be the most unique to the audience at the beginning ever since we have experiences on watching dozens of Bond Movies and their pastiche comedy versions. However, the new things I discovered in the script's pastiche parts made me satisfy step by step and natural cause of watching new things, scenes or dialogues attached me to the movie. Of course we can't say that Kingsman is a unique comedy masterpiece but the pastiche and eclectic script writing seemed distinctive even it has mainstream look a like script. And so that I can say I had a good time watching it without any comedy masterpiece expectations. If I say nothing was peculiar I lie.With a clear conscience, I can say that the subject is a classic one but the eclectic scenes with original ideas make the difference.'Warning These Paragraphs Contain Spoilers' The idea of depicting an orphan boy having sociological problems from a Slang lout loaded neighborhood, to become a legendary British gentleman spy, through his dead spy father's heritage.The instructor Galahad (Colin Fith) and the spy applicant boy Lee's (Jonno Davies) harmony reach the climax with the 3 rd supporting character Merlin (Mark Strong) who is the reasonable one in spite of the ignorant but genius boy Lee and the real Gentleman Galahad.And besides the harmony of the characters, Arthur's manipulated character and abandoning his agents for becoming one of the most important informant of the cyber organization displayed by a well-chosen actor, Micheal Cane.According to this slang, type storytelling blended with Royal aspects of the spy agencies, the unique scenes make a place in your mind.Such as the Galahad's bar fight involvement with the slang louts,Massacre in a church scene in the aspect of a gentleman's unconscious attitude,the Kill Bill alike fighting scene of Lee with a crippled woman in a bar Hall, The cyber terrorist image of Samuel L. Jackson that we have never seen him like a cyber villain and the sexual dialogue between a prisoner queen and Lee are the most significant unique components that I still remember.The result, dosage of the comedy is adjusted well, cheesy fun is less than any kind of its samples and if you look for a good action with a unique humour and if you like British groove I recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service to you to consume for a few times. We have to wait the movie for a while to become a cult but one day it can easily be with its originality.",8,5,10,9 September 2015
The Martian," The Martian Crusoe, The Martian Movie Critic
","When a Sci-fi movie appears on the horizon of the box-office, it becomes most expected, between the other upcoming productions by the audience, according to curiosity and the hope of the new technological and effect based predictions, begin even the new Sci-fi movie rumours pops up in the production process.One of the greatest Sci-Fi director known for his cult classics, such as Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus, the expectation and eager on waiting process of the Sci-fi audience, rises to sky with more curiosity. As a Sci-fi genre lover myself, I have eagerly waited to watch The Martian likewise the other Sci-fi lovers.The process from Andy Weir (the book) to Drew Goddard (screenplay) to Ridley Scott (the director), at the end, created expectations on watching huge blended new, cult sci-fi movie by the audience. In order, it maintained the martian life of Humanity, in such detailed way for the first time of Hollywood filming history, especially in these days of NASA's exploration of Mars by proving the new life sources could exist on the planet, guarantees the movie's attraction and its box office success. I found it watchable, as I mentioned before the popularity of the genre and the recent events happening on the real life Mars explorations in these days, firstly makes the movie 'a must watch' even you don't like Sci-fi genre. In the other hand, a Sci-fi lover would never miss a Ridley Scott movie. Generally it was easy for 'The Martian' to attract all the Sci-fi lovers and popular culture lovers, as it fulfills expectations of both scientific subjects and non-scientific Martian survival curiosity, as the audiences' catharsis on the survival, millions of miles away from earth, individually.I have used the definition of 'watchable' about the movie in the previous paragraph. The reason that I have used this definition at the first place is, I liked it with its distinctive and unique semiotic way rather than cult Sci-fi effects on me. Every one of Sci-fi lovers or an ordinary movie audience can find a place for them in the plot and make predictions about living on Mars according to the recent scientific discoveries made on there by Nasa.Matt Damon as 'Mark Watney' creates the empathy on the audience as we used to watch him in such other kinds of survival movies.So The choice of the protagonist, who is chosen to survive in outer space is applicable, I must say.Besides the watchable and interesting plot, directing and acting, Some clich√©s oppressed me by the way. And just for these exaggerated stereotype scenes and dialogues, I can say it could be much better and become a cult like Scott's other Sci-fi movie 'Alien' or Kubrick's '2001: Space Oddysey' for instance.The main and biggest problem of Hollywood directors is the pressure on the directors to stay in the box of the mainstream with the producers worry of the box-office success. The amazing side of the plot, showing the audience that, by the Martian elements, humanity can create life sources with science and can create crops or sun-based energy to use vehicles, and other stuff, In the other hand a scientific Robinson Crusoe survival side of the plot. They are perfect. But I repeatedly saw some clich√©s, that caused to lose my appetite in some parts. For instance, the world's survival support to Mark Watney, with the cheerful screams, watching him on the big screens, the dominant and egoist Nasa headmaster Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) character who is not eager to rescue Mark because of the image and cursing worries, and the last scene that depicted Mark character as the retired superhero in spite of spending some cheerful time with his companions, were some of the scenes that I found a little bit Stereotype.In addition to 'The Martian' 's cons and pros, I observed the retro disco music idea was unique, as I am tired of listening to symphonic tones in the most of the Sci-fi movies, especially space exploration based ones.",7,1,3,14 October 2015
