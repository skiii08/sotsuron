","'Ford V Ferrari' Review
(7.5/10)Between its thrilling racing sequences and underlying commentary, Ford v Ferrari makes for a somewhat entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography.
On paper, a movie about the Ford company's efforts to defeat its rival Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans probably only sounds interesting to either racing enthusiasts and/or anyone who actually knows what a 24 Hours of Le Mans even is. Thankfully, the final film, Ford v Ferrari transcends its biographical trappings to deliver an enjoyable viewing experience for gearheads and race-car novices alike. And with director James Mangold calling the shots, the biopic is mostly successful in getting at the heart of what makes this story interesting - namely, the struggle between commercialism and creative integrity.
At its core, the Ford v Ferrari script credited to Jason Keller and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth is part American corporate myth and part real-life story about a ragtag group of artists in their profession who're trying to stay true to their vision while working for a company that's far more concerned about public image and selling their products to the masses. Of the two, the latter element is more compelling than the former and gives the film a beating heart, even when it's all too apparent where the story is going next.
Ford v Ferrari knows what matters most are the people who come along for the journey. In this case, Damon and Bale have excellent chemistry as Shelby and Miles, and their dynamic gives the film much of its flavor, whether they're bonding over their shared passion for racing or coming to blows in what's typically a very funny fashion. Their personalities are well-complimented by those of Ford's business suits, with Letts and Bernthal doing excellent work as always and Josh Lucas bringing on the smarm as the Ford executive Leo Beebe (who proves to be the biggest thorn in Shelby and Miles' side).
The race-car sequences and recreation of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans are the primary attractions as much as anything else here, and Ford v Ferrari very much delivers the goods in this regard. Mangold and his DP Phedon Papamichael shoot these scenes with a steady hand, allowing viewers to actually see everything that's happening while still experiencing the sheer exhilaration that comes with being a body that's 'moving through space and time'.
Trouble is, it's all so very predictable. Miles loses his seat, but you don't think for a second that he won't win it back. Miles is losing the race, but you don't for a second think he won't pull it back. What these men achieved, in such a short space of time, was nothing short of miraculous. But that doesn't necessarily translate into an engaging story, and for much of its punishing run-time, Ford v Ferrari fails to get out of third gear. Like a race car without an engine, Ford v Ferrari looks good on the surface, but fails to motor for its 150-minutes. There's fun to be had watching the Ford executives clash, and the driving scenes are shot with real artistry and skill, but they're interspersed with scenes of true inertia. So while Le Mans might be the most exciting race on the planet, a film about that race is a very different proposition, with Ford v Ferrari lacking urgency and thrills, and instead simply chugging along in underwhelming fashion.",7,0,3,30 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Carol Danvers' debut puts a fresh spin on Marvel's Phase One origin story formula.
","'Captain Marvel' Review
(8/10)The MCU's newest hero, Captain Marvel, has entered the fray literally swinging, with a cosmic-flavored origin story. Carol Danvers' debut puts a fresh spin on Marvel's Phase One origin story formula.
I'm just going to say this first, I'm tired of people trying to review bomb a movie and call it terrible, awful, an horrible, when they didn't see the movie. So what if Brie's comments hurt your feelings, grow up and be a man. This movie is not full of 'SJW crap', this is a movie about a beloved comic character brought to life in the big screen. The movie is not full of 'feminist propaganda', the movie is a MCU movie and a good one too.
Now that I'm done ranting let's get into this review. As the first first woman-led superhero epic from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel touches down at the multiplex with a lot of sexist monkeys on its back. You could carp at about how the plot is too convoluted by half, the pacing's too casual, it's retro style too flat in the light of the usual MCU fireworks. But the time that Boden and Fleck use to underscore how lives get lived between the not-always-rousing action sequences may be what keeps Captain Marvel in our memories.
By the end of Captain Marvel it becomes clear why its titular character is talked about as the most powerful superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. (It also becomes very clear that Thanos is about to get his purple ass handed to him in Avengers: Endgame.) Because of the source of her strength (I won't spoil it), the half-human, half-Kree warrior can pretty much take on any villain, any weapon. Captain Marvel is the MCU's first solo superhero movie with a female lead; the studio had to go big. It also had to provide an allegory for why women heroes had been held back for so long. The notion is slyly reinforced again and again.
The movie takes some time to find its footing, but once it does the action is great and the effects were actually, I would say, on par with the effects in the Avengers' movies. The movie has flare that's for sure, the soundtrack, which includes Elastica, TLC, Hole, Garbage, and a particularly tongue-in-cheek usage of No Doubt's 'Just a Girl.' The 1990s were nothing if not a time of riot grrrls and feminist rock and hip hop, all of which got too often discounted and discredited. Maybe codirectors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck just wanted to put some nostalgic jams in their movie, but there's no denying the film has a spirit of revisionist history.
While the message of Captain Marvel is clear, whether it will be heard or embraced is another matter. Some people will like the film, others won't. Some might find it too feminist; some may think it's not feminist enough. Some may like or dislike it for reasons that have nothing to do with its meaning, direct or implied. The beauty of being a fan of anything is that you get to make up your own (damn) mind.",7,1,2,9 March 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.
","'Knives Out' Review
(9/10)KNIVES OUT LEADS VIEWERS ON A THRILLING AND WICKEDLY FUN RIDE AS THE ENTIRE ENSEMBLE OFFERS BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCES IN THIS WHODUNNIT MYSTERY.
Though Rian Johnson is now perhaps best known for having directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi, across all his films, Johnson incorporates story elements that subvert expectations, delivering twists viewers won't see coming. That's all to say, Knives Out fits perfectly within his wheelhouse as a modern murder mystery whodunnit thriller. Written, directed and produced by Johnson, the filmmaker also surrounds himself with an astonishingly talented ensemble cast, who execute his vision with masterful precision.
Johnson's particular talent of keeping audiences on their toes is on full display with Knives Out, which follows a fairly standard formula for murder mystery movies - in that the viewers are shown little bits about the night of the murder as the mystery is slowly unraveled on screen. The filmmaker uses a deft hand in both setting up and pulling off the twists in Knives Out, laying the foundation for them long before viewers even see them coming. Astute audiences, especially those that revel in solving a murder mystery plot before the characters on screen, will pick up on the clues, but Johnson uses their expectations against them to keep even those viewers guessing.
In a film with plenty of colorful characters, Craig's Blanc is an energetic scene-stealer, even as de Armas' Marta is presented more as the film's protagonist. The actress and her more understated performance work well to make Marta the most grounded character in Knives Out, contrasting well against the more campy, over-the-top members of the Thrombey family. Collette's Joni is another scene-stealer, dropping a surprising number of one-liners, as Curtis's Linda is a more imposing woman - though her performance is just as fun.
Every aspect of Knives Out - from Johnson's directing and Craig's southern drawl to the satisfyingly chilling score and intricately detailed set design - comes together to form this lush, captivating murder mystery. Knives Out manages to combine the campy fun of Clue with a new and carefully crafted mystery, plus infuse some commentary about everything from detective stories to modern American politics, all while allowing Johnson's filmmaking voice to shine through. In the end, Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece.",9,11,32,28 November 2019
Deadpool 2," 'Deadpool 2' comes up a little short to it's expectations.
","Review for Deadpool 2
(8/10)Deadpool 2 had huge expectations to live up to after it's origin story was a R rated thrill ride, but 'Deadpool 2' comes up a little short to it's expectations.
The script, by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds, is loaded with winky, fourth-wall-piercing eruptions of meta, the kind of humor that can make even the slow-witted and literal-minded feel devilishly clever. Works for me, I guess. But this sequel to the R-rated, X-Men-adjacent surprise blockbuster of 2016 works maybe a little too hard in the service of a dubious cause.
'Deadpool 2,' cracking wise at the expense of nearly every intellectual property in the DC and Marvel universes - and occasionally drawing metaphorical blood to go along with the abundant onscreen gore - uses its self-aware irreverence to perform the kind of brand extension and franchise building it pretends to lampoon.
Grief and despair drive Wade first to seek revenge and then to try to prevent two other acts of vengeance from taking place. The first 30-40 minuets of the movie weren't that entertaining to me, there were a few jokes that made me laugh, but for me the movie got going once Josh Brolin's Cable showed up and kick some ass. And Zazie Beetz is great as Domino. And there are some fantastic cameos, that definitely draw a laugh and a 'wait I know who that is'.
For me 'Deadpool 2' is a good-enough sequel to the original, but it is definitely not better than the first one. I just wish we could of actually seen X-Force.",8,1,3,9 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee is coming at you with his greatest and most galvanizing movie in years
","'Blackkklamsman' Review
(9/10)Spike Lee is coming at you with his greatest and most galvanizing movie in years. BlacKkKlansman is right up there with Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X in the Spike's Joint pantheon of game-changers.
BlacKkKlansman, adapted by Lee, David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott from Stallworth's book, demands the best from everyone, including cinematographer Chayse Irvin, editor Barry Alexander Brown and composer Terence Blanchard. (Having Get Out provocateur Jordan Peele on the producing team doesn't hurt, either.) Still, the movie breathes Lee as he walks a tightrope over the heroic best and craven worst of humanity.
Some might argue that the movie didn't need a present-day coda of the showdown between white nationalists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia; the notorious Trump speech claiming there was 'blame on both sides'; or the still-active hatemonger Duke praising the President's comments. I am not one of those people.
While this movie may have been about a true story from back in the 70s, this true story still has tons of merit in today's society. For the most part, the moments of levity serve to keep the bleakness at bay. Evil is among us, hidden - or not so hidden - in the hearts of ordinary-looking people. As the film's final moments make clear, we need a new fight back against it.",9,3,7,9 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," When faced with 14,000,605 possible outcomes, it manages to be a surprising and satisfying one.
","'Avengers: Endgame' Review
(11/10)I didn't think Marvel would ever be able to top Infinity War, but I was wrong. Marvel delivers a fitting and surprisingly poetic payoff to the Infinity Saga.
The less you know going into Avengers: Endgame, the more you're likely to enjoy it. Obviously, you wouldn't have clicked on a review of this movie if you didn't want to know something about the culmination of a decade's worth of Marvel's superhero storytelling, but trust me: more than Avengers: Infinity War, Endgame is truly a story that needs to be experienced. Forget all the external noise from the deliberately vague teaser trailers, perfectly-calibrated celebrity soundbites, and footage leaks, and just strap in for the ride.
There's little that can be said about the film without at least alluding to its twists, but what I can say, with certainty, is that Avengers: Endgame is a marvel, both in terms of narrative scale and sheer logistical ambition. The film walks a tightrope between high drama and cathartic comedy, offering some of the darkest and most emotionally honest scenes in the history of the MCU, alongside some of the most ridiculous and sublime. There are fewer laugh-out-loud moments here than in Infinity War, but it's certainly lighter and oftentimes more joyous than you might expect from a story that begins with the fallout from Thanos' snap.
Endgame is a film that feels like it was made by fans, for fans - to the point where some scenes will undoubtedly be labeled as outright fanservice. But it's hard to view those moments as cynical pandering so much as earned and effective homages to the moments, characters, and relationships we've grown so invested in over the past 11 years. While Infinity War did its best to juggle an enormous roster of heroes spanning the entirety of the MCU's history, it's no spoiler to say Endgame rightly narrows its focus to the original six Avengers, giving them each a well-deserved moment, or several in the spotlight. The cost of sidelining so many characters is high, but it pays off brilliantly.
I know it's not the end of the MCU, but it certainly feels like it. Endgame's greatest accomplishment is how it deepens our understanding and appreciation of the movies that preceded it. This is truly a climax to an entire franchise, not just a resolution to the cliffhanger of Infinity War. This may not have been the only way for Marvel to end the first chapter of its sprawling superhero saga, but when faced with 14,000,605 possible outcomes, it manages to be a surprising and satisfying one.",10,1,4,26 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way
","Infinity War Review (10/10)
Avengers Infinity War is a lot, but in a good way. Marking the passing of a decade since the conception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Infinity War acknowledges that Marvel's audience has grown up. There's a seemingly hopeless amount of characters packed into this story, but the Russo brothers make the bold decision to establish big bad Thanos as the primary protagonist, and the film is all the better for it.
The film is very fast paced in the beginning but then it smoothes it's self out and slows. The insane amount of action and characters means that not everybody gets enough screen time, but most make an impact on the story, in some form or another. Some of the new relationships and conflicts work extraordinarily well - Doctor Strange and Tony Stark make for pitch-perfect rivals, and Star Lord's gut-wrenching jealousy toward the sculpted, hyper-masculine Thor is hilarious.
Every single member of the team tries their utmost to prevent the apocalypse, and occasionally, even come infuriatingly close to overpowering Thanos. But it's never quite enough, and one important distinction between Thanos and the Avengers is repeatedly highlighted - our heroes are emotional creatures, unwilling to sacrifice their friends for the greater good, while Thanos is stone cold.
The final act, including the post-credits sting, brings a chill, a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. Infinity War is the first half of the final installment in the series, and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual, unmarvelous world.
Ultimately, Infinity War is a great film and one for the ages. This movie goes right into the top 5 of MCU movies and it just might be in the top 5 of all comic book movies. I recommend seeing this movie on the biggest possible screen, to experience it in it's full glory.",10,0,3,9 March 2019
The Lion King," The film pushes celebrity faces rather than good storytelling.
","'The Lion King (2019)' Review
(5/10)It seems the Circle of Life nowadays is being a grown man watching a Disney reboot of a beloved animated film from childhood. We've had three of those this summer alone, and the latest - a remake of one of their greatest - The Lion King is aggressively mediocre in every department except for the visuals. Jon Favreau's aggressively mediocre retelling lacks heart and nuance.
The story remains the same, but if you're only interested in gawping at the visual boundaries a film could push The Lion King will blow your mind because there is absolutely no way to tell where the 'live action' ends and the CGI animation begins. Everything, from a blade of grass to the eyeballs and fur of the lions is 100 percent photorealistic. Director Jon Favreau employs the same hyper realism technique he did in the terrific The Jungle Book, but the results here are far less effective.
Making this film hyper real looking exposes two vital downsides of the original - that it has a simplistic story, and cliché and cringey. The original was such a classic because it hid those downsides with beautiful, colourful animation, sympathetic, emotionally charged faces on the animals, and an extraordinary soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Elton John to tug at your heartstrings during the emotionally heavy moments. Favreau removes these very elements in the remake, making this a drab looking film bereft of colour, with the animals having no emotional core, and adds atrocious remixes of the classic songs.
Things 'happen' in this film - but they don't carry much weight. Simba's journey is supposed to be transformational and heroic, but the transitions are too quick and lack energy. The message is very much there - that a man shielded by privilege needs to step out and live with the commoners to gain a better perspective on life, and this remake had a golden opportunity to dig deeper into these themes, but the script by Jeff Nathanson makes no such effort. The final fight isn't as exciting and emotional as the original, and the same goes for Mufasa's death.
Disney has retooled some of its classic stories to make them more progressive and nuanced, but we don't see that in this Lion King. The comic relief comes predictably from Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumba (Seth Rogen) but here's the thing about this whole cast - there's no shaking away their personalities which are given a bigger focus that the characters in the story. The film pushes celebrity faces rather than good storytelling. If there's any statement this film makes it is that voice actors need to get back into recording booths - films like these are not going to make less money by giving experts jobs that utilise their expertise.",5,6,10,24 July 2019
A Quiet Place," WOW WOW WOW!
","'A Quiet Place' Review
(9/10)
WOW WOW WOW! This movie is intense and extremely stressful. The horror genre is one filled with cheap jump scares and crappy plots, but 'A Quiet Place' actor, co-writer and director John Krasinski seems to understand this thoroughly, and the result is an unnerving film.
Horror, in particular, only works if you're invested in the characters, and this cast absorbs you into their terrifying world.
As the conversations are primarily restricted to sign language, sound design plays a significant role in creating a heightened sense of dread and tension throughout.
Although slow paced initially, this is a deliberate screenplay decision which then leads up to a suspenseful second half. Granted, some of the events require a brief suspension of reality, but it's a small price to pay for a film that is most enjoyable because of its understanding of the genre and innovative use of the elements it sets up.
A word of advice - choose your viewing partner carefully as 'A Quiet Place' can only be appreciated in silence with the least amount of conversation during its runtime. I am not one for horror films, but 'A Quiet Place' is something different entirely and is already one the best films of the year. You must see this movie, even if you are not one for horror films, you will enjoy this one.",9,0,0,9 March 2019
Joker," Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
","'Joker' Review
(9.5/10)I was close to giving this movie a ten out of ten, but then I thought to myself is it wrong for me to think that Joker is brilliant and unsettling all in one? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
'I just don't want to feel so bad anymore,' whispers Arthur, who's also on seven different types of medication and has been in the system for most of his life. A system that now has no resources or time for him. A desperate whisper that you know won't be heard by anyone. That simply signifies the beginning of both a descent and his path to becoming the Joker. This is ultimately what Joker is: an origin story. One that touches only ever so lightly on what has come before in the DC Universe. This could, particularly in the current climate, be viewed as a lament for outsiders and the ignored. That's too simple and Joker does anything but deliver you easy answers. It's a sad, chaotic, slow-burn study of someone who isn't visible; who doesn't even exist to the world around them. But your empathy, sympathy even, isn't guaranteed, and it begins to dissolve as Arthur somehow moves even further to the edges. This is, we mustn't forget, the story of how a villain was made.
As Arthur/Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is astonishing. Phillips has said he had a picture of the actor above his screen when writing the script and it's a belief that has paid off. Phoenix inhabits Arthur: having lost weight for the role, he looks thin, frail, hungry. Shadows carve out his exposed bones. His physicality is precise, the way he moves, shuffles, runs, sits, smokes, shrinks. His usual intensity is on full display and it's captivating, even overwhelming in moments. While this is Phoenix's film, Frances Conroy is quietly devastating as Arthur's mother Penny, and Zazie Beetz, as neighbour Sophie Dumond, while arguably underused, brings vital humanity to her scenes with Arthur. The most talked-about piece of casting was obviously Robert De Niro as late-night TV host Murray Franklin.
Mention must be made of Joker's cello score by Hildur Guðnadóttir: mournful, dark and fractured, and the cinematography by Lawrence Sher. In his hands, Gotham is alive as a flawed, brutal, broken-hearted character in its own right.
Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",9,8,16,5 October 2019
Parasite," Stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence, it's explosive filmmaking on every level.
","'Parasite' Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into 'Parasite,' the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level.",10,83,151,6 November 2019

","Black Panther My Review
(10/10)
This is by far the best Marvel movie ever. Impressively well-acted film. The difference with 'Black Panther' is that, while observing the outlines of the traditional comic book arc, Coogler and his creative team have enlarged and revitalized it.
Drawing on elements from African history and tribal culture, as well as contemporary and forward-looking flourishes, 'Black Panther' pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty, from the beadwork and textiles of spectacular costumes and warm, dazzlingly eye-catching production design to hairstyles, tattoos and scarifications that feel both ancient and novel.
The MCU not only needed this movie, but all of the United States needed this movie. For a superhero movie, 'Black Panther' exceeds exceptions and is sure to leave its impact of being one of the best in its genre. Socially aware, aesthetically captivating and emotionally pulling, this movie is one that is sure to leave its mark as one of the best superhero movies of recent memory.",10,1,4,9 March 2019
Creed II," A solid sequel that will hold up years to come.
","'Creed 2' Review
(7/10)This is by no means a Rocky Saga classic, but it is a solid sequel that will hold up years to come.
Ryan Coogler did a fantastic job with the first Creed, probably my favorite Rocky/Creed movie ever, but he did not return for the sequel which left me a little worried going into this film. And while the followup isn't a runaway success in the way that Coogler's installment was, it's still an effective boxing drama which brings greater depth to the Rocky sequels that inspired it.
Caple does an equally commendable job behind the camera on Creed II, even though his directorial approach lacks the impressive technical flourishes (like the single-take boxing sequences) that Coogler brought to the table on the first Creed. And sometimes it feels as though he's trying to do his best impersonation of Coogler on some of his shots. The soundtrack isn't as great as the first one, but solid nonetheless.
Much like their protagonist, the Creed movies continue to carve out a legacy for themselves, yet always keep one foot in the past and continue to honor the traditions of the past. Stallone delivers another moving performance as the older, wiser, and more regretful Rocky in Creed II, this storyline has as much to do with Rocky as it does with Creed. The biggest surprise in Creed II is how the sequel takes the Ivan Drago character - who was a pretty cartoonish villain and stand-in for the Soviet Union in Rocky IV - and transforms him into a genuinely tragic figure whose shattered ego and broken spirit have poisoned his relationship with his son, Viktor.
All in all, Creed II does a very good job of building upon the first Creed's story and themes in a satisfying fashion, while advancing the overarching narrative of the Rocky and Creed movies at the same time. It's not as inventive or groundbreaking as Coogler's film before it, but that's more of a testament to the high bar that Creed set than any failure on the sequel's part. Those who were fans of the original Creed should largely enjoy its followup and may even appreciate how it casts one of the sillier Rocky sequels in a more serious and tragic light.",7,0,1,9 March 2019
Jojo Rabbit," I absolutely love Hitler Waititi!
","'Jojo Rabbit' Review
(9/10)Jojo Rabbit aims to tackle the difficult subject matter blind devotion and a coming-of-age film with grace and comedic flair that just works, and I absolutely love Hitler Waititi.
The coming-of-age story paired with the imaginary friend trope is as old as it comes but there are always different ways to approach it. In this case, director Taika Waititi decided the best way to address this is to go all the way to 11 and embrace it whole hog. Jojo's Adolf is the kind of happy and supportive imaginary friend we see all the time, the Hobbs to Jojo's Calvin, but the juxtaposition of it being Hitler is part of the shock value. It also gives us insight into what kind of little boy Jojo is.
The point, ultimately, comes down to the fact that there isn't anything that remarkable about Jojo. He's exactly the right age and temperament to buy completely into the propaganda that Nazism was putting out at this point in the war. He's just a normal little kid except for the fact that he is convinced that all Jews are evil monsters that are trying to kill him. That changes when he meets Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) a young Jewish girl that Jojo's protective mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is trying to keep safe. Being so close to the perceived 'enemy' is a bit of a wake-up call for Jojo and the reality of the world around him comes like a kick in the teeth.
That aforementioned gut punch is one of the reasons that Jojo Rabbit works as well as it does. By the time the third act rolls around the movie isn't being subtle at all because there isn't any need to be. Jojo has had his wake up call and it's like the whole world around him shifts as his perspective of the world changes. The world has been collectively looking for ways to cope with the horrors of World War II since the moment the war ended and there have been a few people calling Waititi out for this approach. He is far from the first filmmaker to make Hitler look silly but what makes Jojo Rabbit so well is the human element. We aren't just seeing Hitler we're seeing Hitler through the eyes of a young boy who has complete faith in the institution he's involved in.
Jojo Rabbit is one of those movies that is going to drive a lot of people away because of the concept alone. However, it's a wonderfully funny movie that keeps a good pace and never feels boring. The shift toward the end of the second act is a gut punch and it makes the end of the movie all the more powerful for it.",9,2,7,9 November 2019
Incredibles 2," After 14 years the Incredible's are back and in a sequel that, in many ways, surpasses the outstanding original.
","Review for 'Incredible's 2'
(9/10)After 14 years the Incredible's are back and in a sequel that, in many ways, surpasses the outstanding original. Pixar's Incredibles 2 excels in its ability to balance the important and emotional familial aspects of the story with the exciting superhero antics moviegoers have come to expect in the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The interesting gender role themes that exist for the Parr family also resonate with the Deavors. Evelyn appears to be content with playing second-fiddle to her brother; however, when Helen starts working for Winston by moonlighting as a superhero, she encourages Evelyn to embrace her brilliance and be more outspoken. If Helen's story seems similar to Bob's adventures in the previous movie, don't worry; this time around, the Parrs are acting as a team from the very beginning.
Without going into spoilers, let's just say that Elastigirl's missions are fun to watch and when Dash, Violet, Bob, and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) get involved in the action, it feels like you're looking at an animated version of Avengers. Jack Jack steals every scene he's in, and he even gets a scene all to himself to let the audience know how many powers he has. Incredibles 2 also does a tremendous job of expanding its universe, but not at the expense of the Parr family story, which is always front and center.
Brad Bird's strong script and direction elevate this animated adventure to new heights. Instead of trying to copy or parody the superhero films of the past 14 years, Incredibles 2 embraces what made its first outing so memorable: The Parr family and their willingness to work together in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.",9,1,1,9 March 2019
