Scarface," Vastly Overrated
","Just because a film has its poster in every college dorm room and is quoted incessantly doesn't make it good.While there's a cult status surrounding this film, it has little do with anything interesting.  Instead...it's due to gratiutious violence, drug use, and a few catchy lines.Scarface is over the top in nearly every aspect.  Ridiculously long, filled with overacting, flashy, huge sets, and unnecessary camera wowing (a DePalma speciality).  As far as this being a classic or even good...I just don't see it.A very run-of-the-mill story lengthened to over 3 hours of bloodsplattering and F-bombs.If you thirst for Gangster films that are 3+ hours long see Once Upon A Time in America, The Godfather Pt. 2, or an entire season of Sopranos. It will be time better spent.",Null,1,3,15 November 2003
Meet Joe Black," Unequivocally awful
","This movie is horrendous.  A 3-hour-plus run time for what should have been a 90minute feature?  Check.  Seemingly 2 hours of silence?  Check.  An inferior and unnecessary remake? Check. One of the worst directors currently working in Hollywood? Check. Major logistical leaps? Check. Emotionless acting(I don't care if it's justified, it's not interesting to watch)? Check. Unmotivated character actions?  Check. This film has got it all!An utter indulgence from beginning to (when will it) end.Proof that people are starving for romance so badly that they will grasp to anything that promises it.",Null,1,2,4 April 2004
