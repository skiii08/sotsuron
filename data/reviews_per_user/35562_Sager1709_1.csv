It," Worst Horror Movie I have seen so far...
","'IT' was the worst Horror movie I have seen so far. It reminded me more of a film with the three question marks, as the main characters are children with bicycles and flashlights that want to chase the monster or the clown out of the city. The story as well as many scenes make no sense at all. In addition, many scenes can be anticipated in advance. So all in the cinema (in Germany) were disappointed by the movie tonight. I think for people who know the old movie, the remake is a nice movie that tells the old movie in a new way. For all the others the movie is unfortunately only a big disappointment. I strongly advise not to watch this film. For me it was waste of money and time.",2,1,6,7 October 2017
