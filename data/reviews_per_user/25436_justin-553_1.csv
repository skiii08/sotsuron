The Blair Witch Project," Complete rubbish!
","I heard this film was made on a small budget, what $1.00? 99c of that was wasted. Don't believe what you read, not scary, not interesting and certainly not a good story line! boring in fact, you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat alright...waiting for something to happen. dreadful film. The tag line in the uk said 'you'll never go camping in the woods again' why not? oh i see because there will be a couple of teens in there running up and down shaking a camera. real scary the sounds of twigs snapping and the odd owl hoot. who ever made this film should be fined the exact amount of money it made, i've never ever felt the need to post a comment on a film but boy does this deserve it.",1,3,6,2 April 2006
