Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," infantile comedy at its worst
","I rented this film to see what all the fuss and controversy was all about. Well I regretted spending a single dime on this flick. People went gaga over this film because it offended the entire khazakstani nation and in this age of political correctness, someone going against the grain is seen as welcome. Once you look past the controversy and the shock value it is apparent that this film relies entirely on infantile toilet humour. This film is an example of the degradation of western culture. Many artists resort to this tasteless crap simply because they lack any real talent or their minds have become stagnant, probably from all the drug abuse.I give this film an F minus.",1,3,8,8 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," an awful B movie
","This is a horrible movie. If the intention of the producer of the movie was to provide entertainment for psychopaths, then he did  a good job of it. I have seen many action flicks that have gratuitous violence but at least the hero has some redeeming qualities that makes them likable. The hero an assassin is just as evil as the other assassins she is hunting down. This movie is no better than watching an ultra violent video game. Entertaining if you are the one fiddling around with the paddles making the character move on the screen but not if you are watching it. watching 5 minutes of the worst Jackie chan flick is more interesting than watching 1 minute of kill bill. I paid good money to watch this flick and regret it. I want my money back.",Null,4,7,9 May 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," just awful
","This film consists of an infinite number of mindless clichés of life in the seventies. The jokes are reminiscent of those told by low IQ jock teenagers in the locker room. I feel ripped off, I paid good money to rent this film. A lot of hype was made to sell this film and I found it neither entertaining or amusing, it is apparent that the quality of films coming from Hollywood has gone down hill and continues to slide. The clichés where too much and I thought Christina Applegate was capable of better, then again she didn't have much to go on, she was the only actor in this film who did a decent performance. I nominate this film B movie of the year.",1,9,20,30 December 2004
