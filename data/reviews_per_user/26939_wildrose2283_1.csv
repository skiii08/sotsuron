Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Borat' was produced in Romania, not Kazakhstan
","everyone talks about Kazakhstan, but the first part of the movie was actually shot in a small village in Romania called 'Glod' (='mud' in English). It is a very pour village, but it looks so real and so much better than the USA studios. And so much cheaper as well...the people only got 2-3 euro/day... And thinking of how much money the producers will make out of this...that's really shameful...everything looks so real and so cool 'cause they don't come from the imagination of a brilliant director, but they actually are the real thing. People's bedrooms, houses, clothes, car....everything. And they almost didn't pay a thing for all of these...I like the movie, but the way they used these people that are really simple and naive it's the real ugly part... That's the story behind the curtains of what it will be a major American box-office hit! success recipe: find a really really small village in the far-far away Romania and get inspired and rich (oh,...and don't tell anyone where you found it, so that you'll be the only genius around:))",Null,8,12,9 November 2006
