Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Breathtaking visuals make this a must see!
","Forget all the negative hype! Many were expecting another Star Wars or ROTJ with a wise-cracking Han Solo character playing off a beautiful princess. Episode 1 is about style and visuals. Lucas sacrificed character development and intelligent character interplay with amazing visuals that will blow you away! I'll take the hyperspeed Pod racing scene over Solo/Lea flirting any day. This movie breaks new ground. Some die-hards complained about the CGI. This movie has the best CGI to date. The final battle scenes, played in three arenas were brilliant! So many things are happening visually in each shot that you HAVE to see the film more than once just to appreciate the effects. Buy this movie now. So what if it is not DVD. So what if you're going to end up buying the DVD in six years again anyway. Episode one is a true masterpiece of visuals and epic action sequences. You'll watch it again and again and again.. give it another shot in the privacy of your own home..",9,11,15,10 April 2000
X-Men," FOR COMIC FANS, X-MEN DELIVERS
","Hugh Jackman nailed the part of Logan/Wolverine. Didn't think anybody could do it, but he nailed it. I also enjoyed the young version of Rogue and of course Ian McKellen as Magneto. I'd like to say that you don't have to be a fan of the comic book to enjoy the movie, but can't. I think certain fans of sci-fi action will enjoy the X-Men; others will find it predictable. Visually, the movie offers a few neat effects, but nothing at the caliber of The Matrix. Still, X-Men is worth a look. It is fun, fast paced and Jackman's performance is one to see.",9,0,0,18 July 2000
Malcolm X," Lee at his best
","Malcolm X is one of Lee's greatest pictures (with Clockers being his best). As an epic, it is magnificent. Denzel is powerful as Malcolm X and Spike Lee's direction is superb. This movie is a must-see and should have been nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.",9,2,7,31 December 1998
He Got Game," Style and strong performances
","Lee's He Got Game displays similar gritty street imagery as his earlier Clockers. While not as captivating as the earlier movie, He Got Game, does elicit a raw sense of power and visual style which should please movie-goers. Those looking for a combination of fast breaking basketball sequences and slam dunk music video highlights will not find what they want in this film. While the movie does include a few basketball scenes, it focuses more on the human story of choice, responsibility, societal pressures, and heroism. He Got Game is a tough, human drama, flawed in some of the dialog, but with an outstanding performance from Denzel. Lee's in your face film-making once again shines through in this urban father-son relationship film.",8,0,2,6 June 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This is not a Black Belt Theater movie
","I find it funny that most of the negative reviews on this board come from people exclaiming that CTHD is worse than the countless other kung-fu movies they have seen. That is where the comparison is flawed. CTHD is not a kung-fu black belt theater film. It has on its surface, kung-fu fight scenes and swordplay and magical powers, but on a deeper level, this epic is a much more complex story. It tells of hidden feelings and search for truth in one's journey of life. It tells of wrong choices made in life and the yearning for freedom and independence. CTHD contains thoughts of societal pressures and the guilt one experiences when trying to please others and not one's self. Of dual indentity, both symbolically as well as literally.
Sure, the fight scenes are spectacular, but the interplay between the characters and the troubled emotions displayed as they relate and hold back their inner conflict is priceless. CTHD was the best film of 2000.",Null,0,0,16 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," One of the best films of 2001
","Moulin Rouge surprised me. I'm sorry I missed it in the theaters. Outstanding visuals, hip soundtrack and great performances by Nicole and Ewan make this movie a must see. As a musical, this movie plays like a live action bugs bunny cartoon complete with outrageous comedy bits and dazzling visuals. If you liked O Brother!, you will most likely enjoy Moulin Rouge. Don't go in expecting Evita. Expect lots of fast camerawork, incredible sets, great special effects, and a contemporary songlist and you'll be set to take in this wild adventure.",9,0,1,19 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Brilliant film! Captivating!!
","Many people have expressed their dislike for this movie. That is understandable. EWS is not for everyone. However, I believe the film to be a worthy companion piece to Barry Lyndon. Slow, yes, but still overall captivating. The mood, set perfectly by the score, lighting, and set designs, brings the viewer on a dark, wonderous journey. Clear your mind and expect to be taken on an epic adventure, meeting strage people, walking downtown late at night, with your mind not quite in the right place. EWS is worth a look..",Null,0,0,20 April 2000
Casino," Scorsese at his best
","Casino is one of the most interestingly constructed pictures I've seen. In the tradition of Goodfellas and Stone's JFK and Nixon, Casino comes off like a documentary, yet flows like a epic. This film is worth watching for the film-making alone. the style is brilliant. De Niro and Pesci are once again great as gansters and Sharon Stone is very good as De Niro's object of desire. A warning, however, this film has some very violent scenes.",10,1,2,31 December 1998
