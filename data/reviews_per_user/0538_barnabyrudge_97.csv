The Rock," Standard action picture for the popcorn generation, with a more exciting plot and classier cast than most.
","For his second film (following on from the noisy no-brainer 'Bad Boys') director Michael Bay gives us 'The Rock'. This pounding, pulsating action flick is full of plot holes and implausible action set pieces, but has terrific energy and a handful of engaging performances which make its flaws forgivable. It is a film that will never win any awards for subtlety, but it is effective in doing what it sets out to do - that being to fill two hours of screen time with spectacle and entertainment. Bay is a director whose work I generally tend to dislike but with 'The Rock' he has, for once, done a good job (aided in no small part by the excitingly silly premise and the game performances of Connery, Cage and Harris).Disgruntled American war hero General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) and a team of heavily armed mercenaries seize the San Francisco island-prison of Alcatraz. They imprison a group of tourists and set up a series of missiles at various points around the island. Each missile contains a lethal chemical which, when released or exploded, has the capacity to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the vicinity. A team of soldiers is assembled to get onto the Rock, led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn). Also sent along for the purpose of disarming the missiles is inexperienced chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a guy who would rather be cuddling up to his pregnant wife than tackling a bunch of impeccably-drilled renegade marines. The only problems is that none of them have any idea how to get onto Alcatraz undetected, so the Government agents have to reluctantly call upon the one man who can help them. Ex-SAS soldier John Mason (Sean Connery), who has been locked away 30 years for stealing a government microfilm and is the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz, is temporarily 'freed' and instructed to guide the raiding party into the underground tunnels of The Rock. The raid goes awry and nearly all the would-be rescuers are captured and killed, leaving just Mason and Goodspeed to evade the bad guys, find and disarm the missiles, and save the city!!'The Rock' is very much a packaged, polished film. Nothing raw, edgy or unpredictable here. It's a film that plays safe and delivers the requisite thrills and spills in much the same way that a roller-coaster does. As usual the bad guys can't shoot straight, and the good guys can always think of a witty remark at the very moment they dispose of a villain. The action filmed in a dizzying, lightning-fast style with whizzing pans of the camera and furious cross-cutting of camera angles. This makes the action come across as fast-paced and exciting. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably frenetic and adds to the drama. As you would expect there are predictable scenes, moments that require total suspension of belief, chunks of corny macho dialogue, and every clichÃ© in the book (including a wholly irrelevant car chase - but hey! What's a film set in San Francisco if it DOESN'T feature a car chase?!?) In spite of all this 'The Rock' is a lot of fun and if you watch it for what it is, you'll find it an entertaining slice of escapism.",7,1,1,21 December 2005
The King's Speech," Well-made and engrossing fast-based film.
","The King's Speech tells the true story of King George VI of England, a man who became monarch in the most outlandish of circumstances. He was a notoriously bad public speaker owing to his stammer, and his remarkable story is chronicled here in a brilliantly acted and surprisingly entertaining low-budget film. I was somewhat dubious upon entering the cinema about exactly how the film was going to hold my attention for two hours. 120 minutes charting the struggles of someone with a stammer sounded like a tedious prospect to say the least. However, The King's Speech manages to be moving, funny and engrossing throughout.As King George V (Michael Gambon) approaches the end of his life and reign, the world stands on the brink of a second devastating war against Germany under the iron-like rule of Adolf Hitler. George V has begun making addresses to the nation via the new medium of radio, a direct voice to the masses, something new and hitherto unheard-of for a monarch. His son George (Colin Firth) is impeded by a dreadful stammer which makes his public speaking duties particularly awkward and embarrassing. George consoles himself that he will never have to do an excessive amount of public speaking as he is unlikely to ever be king. His brother Edward (Guy Pearce) bears that responsibility, and is a relatively young successor likely to have children of his own to carry on the line. George V dies and Edward is promptly crowned king, but he soon decides to do what no monarch before has ever done – he abdicates from the throne to pursue his much-criticised affair with commoner and divorcée Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Suddenly George is thrust upon the throne, the first man ever to be crowned without succeeding a dead or dying monarch. He faces a personal torment, knowing that his speech impediment will make him a figure of ridicule and uselessness at a time when the nation needs him to be a pillar of strength and integrity. At the behest of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), he visits an unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), in an attempt to overcome his speech problems. Their remarkable relationship reaches its most crucial stage when George VI has to issue a flawless rallying cry to the nation upon the outbreak of World War II.The King's Speech is especially memorable for its acting. Firth is superb as George VI, Bonham Carter wholly believable as his wife, and Rush an absolute joy as Lionel Logue. The film has excellent period detail and is shot in striking colour. There are some beautifully judged early scenes showing how painful and embarrassing George's stammer could be, especially the opening sequence set at the 1925 Commonwealth Exhibition. It's a thoroughly awkward scene to watch, just as intended! By the end the audience feels almost overwhelmed at the courage of the man as he gives the most important rallying speech of his generation. For me especially - a viewer who doesn't feel any particular affinity or allegiance toward the Royal Family - the film manages to be a winning and inspiring experience. It has the occasional stuffy moment and in parts seems to have been exaggerated to add to the drama, but overall The King's Speech is a highly admirable film.",8,0,0,1 March 2011
Vertigo," Fine puzzler from Hitchcock.
","The initial critical verdict of Vertigo was that it was not one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Time has turned it into his most analyzed and revisited movie and, in the eyes of many, his masterpiece. I still don't subscribe to the opinion that this is Hitchcock's greatest film (give me The Thirty Nine Steps, Foreign Correspondent or North By Northwest) but it is certainly a wonderfully absorbing mystery, and the original indifference that greeted the film from critics and audiences was totally unjust. It takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate what Hitchcock is up to in this movie - it is a sophisticated and multi-layered film that grows in stature the more times you view it.San Francisco cop John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) has a hair-raising escapade on a rooftop while chasing a robber. Thereafter, he develops vertigo (a fear of heights) and retires from the force. Some while later Scottie is contacted by his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) who wants to hire him for a little unofficial private detective work. Elster is worried by his wife's increasingly outlandish behaviour - she seems to go into a dreamy state of mind and wanders off for hours on end without any explanation as to where she has been. Scottie's job is to tail her and learn where she goes. The mystery thickens when Scotties starts following Madeline Elster (Kim Novak).... the more he learns about her and her wanderings, the more it seems that she is possessed by the spirit of her long-deceased ancestor Carlotta Valdes. Eventually Scottie saves Madeline when she tries to drown herself in San Francisco Bay, and soon after they fall in love. But just as Scottie begins to make headway into her psychological problems, she kills herself by leaping from a bell tower. Scottie is left in a state of mental shock but later, following his release from hospital, he bumps into a woman named Judy (Novak again) who is the exact double of Madeline....Hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with Vertigo, coaxing brilliant performances from Stewart and Novak and using the location of San Francisco as almost a third leading 'character' in his story. Stewart's obsession with Novak, and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her, is brilliantly portrayed. As ever - in fact, more so than ever - Hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work, ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of colour. Bernard Herrmann contributes a haunting score (his fourth for Hitchcock) that heightens the passion and suspense even further. The solution when it comes is extremely clever, and proves (as if proof is needed) that Hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists. The film's chief drawbacks, for me, are the excessively studied pacing in the first half, and the somewhat abrupt ending. On the whole, though, this is a superb film which is always a pleasure to come back to.",9,7,9,7 August 2007
Black Swan," A surprising, full-blooded audience teaser set in the world of ballet.
","Black Swan is a film which defies your expectations. It is well worth coming into the film cold, knowing as little as possible about the plot. I was half-expecting some sort of character study about a young girl struggling to cope with the demands of the ballet. I thought perhaps we would follow her on a journey through her trials and tribulations in the industry, leading to either an uplifting or downbeat conclusion. I certainly didn't expect the film that Black Swan actually is – a dark, frightening, edgy tale of madness and all-consuming pressure, with strong elements of horror and erotica.Dedicated ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is given the prestigious lead role in the ballet Swan Lake. Nina has been with the same New York company for several years under the direction of the talented but perpetually moody Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). She lives at home with her over-bearing and obsessive mother Erica (Barbara Hershey). The role is a dream come true for Nina, who believed her years of dedication and hard work would go unnoticed as in previous seasons. To her joy, Leroy is willing to give her a shot at the greatest role in ballet. He knows Nina will be amazing as the White Swan, but is worried that she lacks the dark energy and sinfulness needed to pull off the dual role of the Black Swan. Soon the pressure of the role begins to take its toll on Nina, and she finds herself experiencing terrifying hallucinations and growing paranoia. When a new arrival named Lily (Mila Kunis) joins the ballet troupe, Nina's state worsens further as she convinces herself that Lily is some sort of doppelganger or rival out to steal her role. And her mother's non-stop interference just serves to suffocate Nina even more, pushing her beyond the edge of sanity Black Swan is certainly not for all tastes. Some of the gory, grisly imagery is as unexpected as it is stomach-churning. Similarly, some of the sex scenes are surprisingly graphic. If you come to the film expecting something subtle and civilised set in the world of ballet, chances are you'll be taken aback by what you see. However, if you're in the mood for a deliberately excessive and disorientating thriller, this really delivers. The film has an over-the-top approach which starts somewhere near the point of hysteria and just works its way up from there. Portman is wonderful in the main role, with strong support from the alluring Kunis, sleazy Cassel and stifling Hershey. Their performances are supremely polished and help disguise some of the film's more ludicrous moments. This is a bold and enthralling movie which delights in whisking its audience away on a head-trip that is alternately bewildering, nerve-jangling and exciting.",8,2,6,18 February 2011
Changeling," Frequently harrowing story of police misconduct and corruption.
","Not a remake of the 1980 horror film of the same name, nor yet a filmed version of Middleton and Rowley's Elizabethan play, this 'Changeling' is a harrowing tale about one woman's struggle against police corruption in 1920s Los Angeles. Her quest for the truth is made doubly difficult by the fact that her young son has gone missing, and the police investigating what has happened to him are not conducting the search properly. This is a film about sensitive issues, dealt with tastefully throughout particularly during some of the more harrowing moments (which could so easily have been sensationalised).Single mum Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) lives in the suburbs and works at a telephone exchange in the city. One day she has to work an extra shift and is obliged to leave her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. It is the last time she ever sees him. Upon returning, Walter has gone missing provoking Christine to turn to the police to find him and bring him home. Several months later, Christine is notified that a young boy matching Walter's description has been found. But when she is reunited with the boy she remains adamant that he is not her son. Already under intense criticism from the public, the police cannot afford another embarrassment, so they continually reject Christine's claims. In particular, Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) takes great pains to convince her she is mistaken. When he cannot silence her, Jones has her shipped off to a cruel mental asylum where she can bother the police no longer. Then, out of the blue, honest policeman Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) discovers the remains of a bunch of murdered children, victims of a demented serial killer (James Butler Harner). The police learn that, through their own neglect, ineptitude and misconduct, they may have wasted precious time lying to Christine Collins while her son became the latest victim of this psychopathic madman..Jolie is outstanding in this film, playing down her sexy image to give a very moving and heartfelt performance that is a million miles from the Lara Croft persona. Indeed the whole cast are excellent in 'Changeling', particularly Harner's creepy child murderer and Donovan as the dirty cop who wants to wash his hands of Christine's problems. The film is deliberately paced and builds to a powerful climax, in which emotions of despair are tinged with a grain of hope. Perhaps one could argue that the film has too many climaxes, for it takes several scenes spread over the best part of 25 minutes for all the loose ends to be tied up. However, one does come away from the film feeling that the subject matter has been treated with the thoroughness and sensitivity it deserves by director Eastwood and writer J. Michael Straczynski. 'Changeling' is a disturbing, powerful and worthy piece of cinema.",8,4,6,6 January 2009
Scarface," The definition of excess.
","Scarface (1983) is a loose remake of a classic '30s gangster film. It is written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma. Hmmm, not exactly two men noted for their restraint. Indeed, this version of Scarface may be 20 years old but it will always be one of the most excessively violent, excessively foul-mouthed and excessively...erm...excessive films ever made.
 Al Pacino gives a majestic performance as a Cuban refugee who works his way into a life of crime on the streets of Miami. Starting out as a messenger boy for a small-time local hood (Robert Loggia) he gradually makes his way up the gangland food chain, ultimately becoming an obscenely wealthy crime lord with fingers in every pie, from political assassination to major drug businesses. However, he's just too dumb to stay at the top, and soon he finds he has a price on his head. The film is severely hindered by its insanely overlong running time. There's a detailed and in-depth story to tell here, but at nearly three hours the film is simply too lengthy. It also wallows in unplesantness for the sake of it, with endless scenes of people snorting dope, killing one another, and rolling in their murderously earned wealth. There are powerful moments, true enough, including filmdom's most violent chainsaw execution sequence and a staggering climax in which Pacino single-handedly attempts to ward off a guerilla army that has infiltrated his mansion. However, on the whole Scarface is a disappointment because its emphasis is on sleaze and violence, with not nearly enough time dedicated to the other threads of the story. When all is said and done, three hours spent wallowing in excess is not sufficient to make the film a good one.",Null,0,1,26 October 2003
Gremlins," Cynical, cleverly-made horror parody, marred by occasional mean spiritedness.
","The master of parody Joe Dante and the master of popular entertainment Steven Spielberg combine their talents (Dante as director, Spielberg as one of the executive producers) for this cleverly assembled comedy-horror. Gremlins is a fun movie that delights in anarchic scenes of destruction and mayhem. But while some films think that destruction and mayhem on their own are automatically funny (e.g It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and 1941), this one remembers that things like characterisation and a build-up are also important. Gremlins still has its share of flaws, including unevenness in the narrative and occasional sequences that boil over into nastiness, but on the whole it is an enjoyable movie. The film's box office success certainly indicates that it caught the public mood at the time of its release.Wacky inventor Rand Pelzer (Hoyt Axton) searches for a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) in a dingy curiosity shop in Chinatown. He eventually chooses a cuddly creature called a mogwai, with a severe warning from the shop-keeper's grandson that there are three golden rules any mogwai owner must obey. Never expose them to bright lights, never get them wet and, most importantly of all, never feed them after midnight. To begin with Billy is very careful with his new pet - named Gizmo - but one day one of the neighbourhood kids accidentally spills water on Gizmo. The water makes the mogwai multiply, giving birth to a whole bunch of babies.... but the babies are more malicious and devious than their parent and fool around with Billy's clock so that he unwittingly feeds them AFTER midnight. Their late night snack causes them to turn into vicious, nasty monsters bent on the destruction of the town. Wholesale devastation follows as the dangerous gremlins go on their rampage. Billy and his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) are the only ones with the courage and the know-how to fight back, but when one gremlin manages to make it to the local swimming pool - where it throws itself into the pool and gives birth to literally hundreds of little monsters - the town seems doomed.Gremlins is primarily a monster movie parody, but in a subtler way it also parodies feel-good Christmas movies. The old James Stewart classic It's A Wonderful Life is seen playing in the background on several occasions, but here there's no goodwill and seasonal cheer on display as the titular gremlins start demolishing the town. Even Cates' character has a tragic Christmas story to tell, involving the death of her father whilst trying to 'play' Santa Claus. It is always reassuring when parodies know where they're coming from, and Gremlins contains many in-jokes for film buffs to enjoy. In particular there are a number of telling cameo roles, among them exploitation director Roger Corman, while Dick Miller (star of several early Corman horror quickies) gets a chance to send himself up delightfully as the grouchy Mr Futterman. The monsters are designed by Chris Walas who successfully creates creatures that simultaneously come across as funny, nasty and fairly real-looking. Rounding things off neatly is Jerry Goldsmith's macabre funhouse-style score. Gremlins doesn't have a great deal of plot, which allows things things to crack along at a brisk pace but afterwards leaves one reflecting how slight the whole film is. Also, the black comedy inherent in the story is soured by touches that are just a little too nasty and mean-spirited. But, generally-speaking, this is a gripping piece of entertainment, worth a look if you're a monster movie buff or a connoisseur of the cynical.",6,6,9,22 August 2007
The Sound of Music," Saccharine? Yes... but also wonderfully entertaining and supremely well put-together.
","Already a successful Broadway musical, it was inevitable that The Sound Of Music would eventually be turned into a film. Not so inevitable was the extraordinary level of critical and commercial success that greeted the film – it scooped numerous nominations and awards at the Oscars and Golden Globes (winning Best Picture at both), and usurped Gone With The Wind as the highest grossing movie of all-time up to that point. A colossal hit with critics and the public alike.The deceptively simple story charts the experiences of Sister Maria (Julie Andrews), a postulant nun at a convent in the foothills of the Austrian Alps. Maria is a constant nuisance to the other nuns with her happy-go-lucky attitude and terrible record for punctuality. The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) questions whether Maria truly has what it takes to be a nun, and suggests that she goes out into the world to experience more of life and see what she truly wants from it. To aid her to this end, the Mother Abbess arranges for Maria to take up a post as the new governess at a nearby mansion, where the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs assistance bringing up his seven children. Maria is initially shocked to discover that the Captain treats his children like a military unit, whistling them to order and expecting exemplary behaviour and time-keeping of them. A long line of governesses have come and gone, either fired by the Captain for failing to meet his impossibly strict standards or driven out by the mischievous antics of the children. Soon, however, Maria brings a sense of fun and freedom into their world and the youngsters quickly come to love her. The Captain himself is mellowed by Maria – she brings music and joy back into his life long after it had faded away. Two things threaten the happiness of Maria and the Von Trapps – firstly, the Captain is engaged to a wealthy baroness (Eleanor Parker) from Vienna, even though it's plain as day that they're not meant to be together; secondly, the Nazis are slowly increasing their stranglehold over Austria and expect the Captain to join their navy as it gears up for war, despite him expressing devoutly anti-Nazi beliefs. Ultimately, the Von Trapps' only choice is to flee from Austria and seek safety in neutral Switzerland if they are to live out their days in peace.From the opening aerial shots of Alpine Austria through to the closing view of the Von Trapps marching over the mountain-tops into Switzerland, the film is a visual treat. Ted D. McCord's cinematography is fabulous (indeed in most years it would have been showered with accolades but 1965 was dominated by Freddie Young for his sterling work on Doctor Zhivago). Scene for scene, however, The Sound Of Music is majestically shot, a real feast for the eyes. The performances are uniformly excellent – Andrews is incredible as Maria, Plummer excellent as Captain Von Trapp, and Parker very convincing as the jealous baroness. Even the child actors – so often the weak link in otherwise well-acted films – are superb in this one. The Sound Of Music has often been criticised for being saccharine in the extreme, a claim that even the film's most ardent admirers would struggle to deny, but there are enough pleasures to be had from viewing it to forgive such shortcomings. Certainly few musicals can claim to contain as many classic songs under one roof (How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, Do-Re-Mi, 16 Going On 17, Edelweiss, My Favourite Things, Climb Every Mountain to name only some) while many of the more celebrated scenes are so iconic they're instantly recognisable even to people who've never seen the film. The Sound Of Music is a feel-good classic and a thoroughly watchable (and rewatchable) film.",9,2,9,20 January 2013
Skyfall," The best Bond film since the original 50 years ago... possibly the best ever.
","Contrary to what a lot of critics and viewers say, my choice for no.1 Bond movie has always been Doctor No. 'The original and still the best' has been my assessment of 007's big screen debut since I first saw it as a youngster. A few subsequent 007 films have come close (From Russia With Love, Goldfinger for instance) but Doctor No remains the only film in the series that I have considered worthy of full marks, a perfect score, a 10-out-of-10. Until now. Skyfall sees ace director Sam Mendes taking up the helm after the disappointing Quantum Of Solace, bringing a new sense of direction to the franchise and managing the near-impossible trick of doing something fresh and unpredictable with a formula that is now into its fiftieth year.Following a botched mission in Turkey, James Bond (Daniel Craig) goes into a self-imposed exile, drinking and whoring his way into oblivion. Meanwhile, back in England M (Judi Dench) and the rest of the Secret Service find themselves under attack from a deadly enemy, a mysterious faceless adversary who delights in blowing the cover of various agents around the world and creating havoc and destruction in the supposedly impregnable halls of power. 007 eventually comes out of his exile, returning to the fold to find himself facing a new kind of opponent – no mad mastermind out for world domination here, just a seriously unhinged ex-agent named Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a personal vendetta against M and the service and will go to extreme lengths to have his revenge. When it becomes apparent that the enemy is one step ahead of them at every turn, Bond takes M to his boyhood home – the remote mansion 'Skyfall' in the Highlands of Scotland – where he prepares to take on an army of bad guys on his own familiar turf.No Bond film prior to this has demonstrated a depth of characterisation like this – the maternal relationship between M and Bond; the origins of Miss Moneypenny and her banterish rapport with Bond; the psychological mechanics of a Bond villain Skyfall really changes the ball game for the better, while still providing enough heart-in-mouth action to keep series' fans happy. Craig is still the most serious and sullen Bond to date (even more so than Timothy Dalton, which is no mean feat), but his troubled moodiness actually suits this film to perfection. Bardem's villain is the best in years – perhaps ever – an adversary all the more dangerous because his objective is merely to wreak vengeance. Adele's theme song is also one of the best in the series in many a long year. I didn't expect great things of Skyfall – it was, I expected, going to be another fun but disposable action flick in a familiar old series. However, this film is simply excellent one which will surely be looked back upon as a classic in another 50 years time.",10,5,13,21 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Fairly accurate costume drama, nicely played throughout.
","The Young Victoria is a well-presented costumer about the period leading up to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. Foremost among the various plot threads is her romance with the dashing Prince Albert but there's more to it than just a lavish historical love story. A reasonable effort has been made to show some of the other events – like relationships, power struggles, political jockeying, and so on – that characterised the era. Certain scenes have been added by writer Julian Fellowes purely for dramatic effect – King William IV's rude rant at the banquet; Prince Albert being injured protecting his bride from an attempted assassination; etc. – but in all fairness, it is the right of any film-maker to embellish bits of their story for the sake of an involving narrative. I don't like it when history is utterly ignored and re-written, but in this case the overall essence of the story remains true to the facts. As historical movies go, this is one of the more reliable and worthwhile examples from recent times.As a child Victoria (Michaela Brooks) is over-protected in the most preposterous manner; she isn't even allowed to walk down a flight of stairs unsupervised. All this is because she is next in line to the British throne when the current monarch, William IV (Jim Broadbent), passes away. Vultures are already manoeuvring around the grown up Victoria (Emily Blunt), working their way into her trust so that they will benefit from an allegiance with her when her day of reckoning eventually comes. Her mother The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) constantly pressurise her into accepting them as joint-Regents when she assumes the throne. Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), a future contender for Prime Minister, works his way into her affections and plants those loyal to his cause in positions of power within the palace. Even her cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg (Rupert Friend), is sent to form an alliance with her for political gain. As time goes by, Victoria realises that everyone is jockeying around her for their personal gain, and decides the best approach will be to make decisions of her own. Against the odds, she and Prince Albert find themselves falling in love and together they somehow chart a route through all the intrigue and plotting and avarice around them, emerging a devoted married couple with the best interests of their kingdom at heart.Blunt initially seems a risky choice as Victoria. She's a new and little known actress, asked to carry the whole film. If she fails, the film fails – she is, after all, prominent in more-or-less every scene. Yet she delivers a warm and convincing portrayal as the young queen. My only real criticism, if it can be called that, is that she is probably too attractive for the role (even in her youth the actual Victoria was not an overly beautiful woman). Rupert Friend also does very nicely as Albert, while the bigger stars are reserved for lively supporting parts or cameo appearances. The film is certainly lavishly shot, with sumptuous sets and costumes. It's 'history-lite' in many ways, breaking down the complexities of the events so that they can be understood more easily and presented in a dramatically engaging way. Other viewers have noted that the second half of the film pretty much concentrates on the love elements, dwelling on the romance, and throwing at us those old love story clichés like kissing in the rain. But in spite of its flaws, The Young Victoria is a worthwhile costume drama and a very respectable slice of history on film.",7,6,10,12 June 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," First Indiana Jones film - also the best. A fabulous film.
","Steven Spielberg launched his Indiana Jones franchise in style with this thrilling, cliffhanger adventure movie that owes much in terms of style and pacing to the old serials of the 1930s. Bristling with imaginative escapades, exhilarating action sequences, clever plot twists and enthusiastic performances, this is perhaps the most complete and enjoyable of Spielberg's early films. Some might argue that Jaws or Close Encounters Of The Third Kind are just as good  perhaps even better  but for me this is the finest of all his films prior to Schindler's List. What also helps Raiders Of The Lost Ark immeasurably is the refreshingly tough and resourceful female character played by Karen Allen. Not only are we introduced to a great screen hero in this film, but he also gets a mighty spirited leading lady with whom to share his remarkable adventures. and that's something that far too many films lack.Lecturer and archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) narrowly misses out on a priceless golden artifact in the rain forests of South America, being beaten to the prize by his arrogant French rival Belloq (Paul Freeman). Jones barely has the time to be bitter, for he is soon approached by an American team who want him to go to Egypt to locate the Ark Of The Covenant which, if you know your biblical stories, was the box in which Moses put the smashed, powdery remains of the stones upon which were written the Ten Commandments. Jones is informed that the Nazis have been searching for the Ark to present as a great trophy for their leader Adolf Hitler, who is allegedly a nut on the subject. Jones first heads for the Himalayas, where he hopes to get help from his old partner Abner Ravenwood. He discovers that Abner is dead, but his daughter Marian (Karen Allen)  formerly Jones's lover, and now very angry with him for walking out on her  is still alive and has vital clues to help him find the fabled prize. Jones and Marian go to Egypt, where Jones learns that his old adversary Belloq is working for the Nazis in their quest for the Ark. In a battle of wits, Jones tracks down the treasure but is once more robbed at the last moment by his slippery rival  leading to a series of incredible adventures in which Indy tries to regain the Ark from the enemy before it is taken to the Fuhrer in Berlin.John Williams provides a belting music score that is widely regarded as one of the best pieces of movie music ever conceived. There can't be many people in the world who wouldn't hum along with the famous Indy theme. Spielberg keeps his narrative moving at a staggering pace, with barely a pause for breath between absorbing exchanges and bouts of extraordinary action. Jones is utterly perfect as Indy (hard to believe that he was the second choice to play the role after Tom Selleck, isn't it?). Allen is great as Indy's courageous sidekick, and Paul Freeman's slimy villain Belloq provides the actor with easily the most enjoyable role of his oddly quiet career. The worldwide locations remind one of a period James Bond film, but the quota of action has somehow been cranked up a level on the Bond films, if that seems possible. It's hard to say what the film's highlight is, for it is stuffed with high points  perhaps the exciting fist fight between Indy and a bare-chested Nazi giant at an airfield, perhaps the thrilling truck chase in which Indy recovers the Ark, or maybe the clever climax in which the bad guys die a spectacularly gory death on a Greek island? It barely matters, since Raiders Of The Lost Ark is, from first frame to last, one of the most thoroughly entertaining films of all-time.",10,0,0,7 June 2006
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Genuinely terrible summer blockbuster, done with neither humour nor finesse.
","It seems to be a current literary fad of the moment to take an old classic and reinvent it with a deliciously twisted element of modern horror. Recent bestsellers include Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters and Android Karenina. Apparently no-one has yet thought of 'Robinson Gruesome' or 'Uncle Tom's Cabin in the Woods', but it's surely just a matter of time. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is from the pen of Seth Grahame-Smith – his other notable mash-up of classic literature, history and horror fiction is the fabulously titled Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Word is that the book is pretty good but sadly the film version of it is a huge disappointment (that's HUGE with block capitals, just in case you're not getting the message). It opts for style over content; unfortunately the style is a horrible mish-mash of absurd CGI mayhem, dumb dialogue and plotting-by-numbers. It's almost as if Smith's technique for adapting the screenplay was to link a set of post-it notes together with bits of string, each one containing an idea for a spectacular set piece. What no-one seems to have told him is that set pieces are only truly exciting and enjoyable if you build them around a story and characters worth caring for. There's nothing of that sort here.Young Abraham Lincoln watches his mother die from an illness which baffles the doctors called upon to save her. He keeps to himself the fact that he witnessed a local plantation owner named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) attacking her in the night, apparently feasting on her blood. Years later, a grown up Abe (Benjamin Walker) decides to take vengeance by killing Barts. He shoots him late one night on the dockside, only to find that he simply gets up uninjured and transforms before his eyes into a demonic monster. Abe is rescued from certain death by the arrival of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a charismatic stranger who seems to know more than he should about the strange goings-on in the neighbourhood. Sturgess tells Abe that the country is awash with vampires and teaches him how to fight against them. Armed with an axe and ready to get stuck into his new line of work, Abe moves to the town of Springfield, Illinois; where he soon slays his first vampire. It isn't long before his vampire hunting antics catch the attention of undead master Adam (Rufus Sewell), a millennia-old monster who runs a plantation in the Deep South and has an army of vampires at his beck and call.Almost nothing about Timur Bekmambetov's film works. What kills it more than anything is the fact that the plot is handled with a misplaced sense of seriousness. Sometimes a movie cries out for a lightness of touch, a tongue-in-cheek approach if you like, and this one needs it more than most. However, instead of embracing the silliness of everything that's going on and using it to its advantage, the film is played in deadly earnest. The performances are terrible, but this is hardly surprising given some of the awful dialogue the actors are required to deliver. Visually the whole thing is rather ugly too, with a saturated tone which is presumably meant to evoke times gone by, but only succeeds in offending the eye.Two stars then for the intriguing title and for presenting a fairly original concept, but in terms of final execution this movie is a train wreck of considerable magnitude. It looks likely that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter will be remembered as the worst blockbuster of 2012's summer season.",2,18,34,2 July 2012
Lifeboat," Single-set thriller of the kind that only Hitchcock could make.
","Lifeboat was Alfred Hitchcock's only film for 20th Century Fox. It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon. In the film Hitchcock demonstrates a fascination with restricting the action to a single set. He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. It is an approach that would bring most directors to their knees, but Hitch rises to the challenge admirably, finding ingenious ways to maintain audience interest and providing a ceaseless undercurrent of excitement.A passenger ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat sinks in the Atlantic Ocean. Well-groomed society lady Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead, in an absolutely outstanding performance) successfully mans one of the sunken ship's lifeboats and steers it around the debris in search of survivors. She picks up various types from the sea, including injured sailor Gus Smith (William Bendix), crewman John Kovac (John Hodiak) and the German U-Boat captain (Walter Slezak) whose own submarine was critically damaged in the attack. The dynamic of the group is severely strained by the German's presence, as the other survivors contemplate and argue over whether to toss him to the sharks, or put their trust in him to steer their lifeboat to safety.Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret. Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery. This keeps tension on a knife-edge throughout the film, and holds the viewer in suspense for the whole story. Similarly, Bankhead's casting is so unorthodox, her character so intentionally ill-fitting to the oceanic setting, that her role in the proceedings casts a strange fascination. The film has a lot of political and propagandist subtext, and many people have viewed it as an allegory of the Nazi rise in Europe (Slezak is the metaphor for Nazi Germany; the others metaphors for surrounding nations duped into believing that the Nazi neighbour in their midst is helpful and trustworthy). Whatever else Lifeboat can and can't be interpreted as, one thing is certain - it's a mighty fine movie!",9,43,56,9 May 2005
Meet the Parents," Solid comedy in which the comic timing of De Niro and Stiller masks the predictable plot and gags.
","Meet The Parents is a predictable but fairly funny story about a guy whose attempts to impress his potential future in-laws go disastrously wrong. There's a lot of talk on the IMDb about it being the funniest comedy ever and the best film of its decade to date, but in all honesty such talk is rather naïve. Instead, Meet The Parents comes across as a solid, enjoyable comedy of errors. Anyone who watches a lot of comedies will see some of the punch-lines a mile off, but the performers demonstrate a nice sense of comic timing that raises a smile from even the more obvious gags.Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to propose marriage to his steady girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). However, she mentions during a conversation that her father is a very traditionally-minded man who believes that potential 'suitors' should ask his permission before proposing to his daughters. Greg decides to accompany Pam on a weekend visit to her parents' place, hoping to make a good impression in their eyes before asking for their approval in his plans. Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) turns out to be a pretty intimidating guy, and things only get more and more awkward for Greg when he learns that his future father-in-law is an ex-CIA interrogator. Trying too hard to make a good impression, Greg almost always invariably does just the opposite. an attempt to shower everyone with champagne results in a vase containing Jack's mum's ashes getting smashed; a game of water volleyball ends with Jack's other daughter getting her face wounded; an innocent cigarette causes some pretty disastrous fire damage to the Byrnes' house; etc, etc. Ultimately, Greg causes so much unintentional havoc that he virtually shatters his chances of being accepted by the Byrnes.The film is actually based on a rarely seen low-budget 1992 film of the same title. Here it gets a more polished makeover, though is not necessarily the better of the two films. Stiller is likable in his accident-prone role while De Niro shows a nice flair for comedy as the terrifying father. Polo doesn't have a great deal to do as the girlfriend, since her role mostly consists of hugging the insecure Greg and assuring him that he's doing great, and Blythe Danner is similarly under-used as De Niro's sweet-natured wife. Of the lead actors, the other one who has the best of things is Owen Wilson, in a small but amusing part as Pam's ex boyfriend. In essence this is a situation comedy of the kind seen on TV virtually every day, but scaled-up with A-list stars and an expensive, cinematic sheen. The script contains some funny one-liners which the actors seize upon with plenty of verve, and Jay Roach directs it with the pace and confidence he invested in his Austin Powers movies. Meet The Parents is plenty of fun, especially when treated on its merits, but you shouldn't be hoodwinked into expecting the comedy-to-end-all-comedies. If that's what you expect and demand of the film, you may come away feeling a little let down.",6,0,1,3 September 2006
Se7en," Unique, horrifying thriller which leaves you desperate for a happy ending.
","A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action. Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word 'Gluttony', and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like 'Greed' and 'Sloth', they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his 'inspiration' from the seven deadly sins. However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout 'no - that can't be it... it can't end there!' Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s.",Null,3,5,5 December 2003
Fight Club," Dark, excessive and impressively original.
","Fight Club is a fierce satire and the blackest of black comedies. It is so dark that many viewers won't even be able to appreciate the funny side of it - they won't make it past the raw violence and the immoral attitudinizing. However, if you don't mind an unorthodox narrative and you're not easily offended, this is a terrific film. Beleagured business man Jack (Edward Norton) is suffering from insomnia due to the pressures and tedium of his job. He joins various macabre therapy groups to keep himself entertained, and here he meets like-minded loner Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). However, one evening whilst taking a flight home, he finds himself sat next to an enigmatic, philosophical soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, in a career-best performance). Durden befriends him and one subsequent evening they meet up in a bar, where they eventually end up fighting with each other - not as the result of an argument, but because they want to spice up their existence with the adrenalin rush provided by fighting. They enjoy the event and pretty soon they've set up 'Fight Club', a secret society at which men get to lose their pent-up anger by beating each other to a pulp. I'm not entirely convinced that fighting is the way to achieve the ultimate high, nor am I convinced that to get into a fight is the best way to learn how much of a man you are. However, that doesn't stop me from recognising what an astounding film this is. The bizarre philosophies of Tyler Durden are sometimes outlandish, sometimes agreeable and sometimes downright disagreeable, but they are always entertaining. The exploration of what's going on in the minds of these disturbed, depressed and desperate men is fascinating, perceptive and often troubling, and it really jolts you out of your comfort zone. Fincher directs in a dazzling, flashy style unlike anything you'll have ever seen before, making this a truly original - though ultraviolent - modern masterpiece. The final fifteen minutes or so shoot off the scale in terms of manic revelations, with an incredible twist ending that really shouldn't work, but somehow does. Fight Club is the kind of film which reminds you why you fell in love with the movies!",Null,1,3,26 November 2003
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Very mildly amusing comedy, mainly vulgar and predictable.
","I felt like a Scrooge-like miser while watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Around me in the cinema, people were slapping their thigh and roaring with laughter and wiping tears of mirth from their eye. I wanted to join them, really I did. but I just wasn't 'feeling' it. The film amused me occasionally; frequently it didn't; and true laugh-out-loud moments could probably be counted on one hand. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very similar experience to watching a Bo Derek movie called '10' – it's a little risqué and rude; it's aimed squarely at a specific target audience; and it's not as funny as everyone involved would like you to think. Ten or fifteen years from now, I think this film will be largely forgotten.TV and movie score composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segal) is dumped by his hot girlfriend, TV actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). He attempts a few relationships with other girls, but each time is more disastrous than the last. Eventually Peter is persuaded by his brother to go on vacation. He chooses Hawaii as there is a resort there which Sarah often spoke highly of. Upon arrival, Peter is shocked to discover that Sarah is taking a vacation there too with her new flame, narcissistic rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The situation looks like it's going to get out of hand until Peter befriends a pretty hotel receptionist named Rachel (Mila Kunis). Gradually he begins to develop feelings for Rachel and realises that there CAN be happiness after Sarah. He even reveals to Rachel his long-secret plan of creating a musical show based on Dracula, performed by a cast of puppets. But the course of true love is never smooth, and Peter suffers various calamities and misadventures before his fate in love is finally decided Perhaps the chief strength of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is that it is romantic comedy for guys AND girls. There is a certain raunchy, vulgar flavour to the proceedings which tries to tap in to the notion of a 'male sense of humour'. Anyone thinking they're about to watch a chick flick will quickly realise this is not so. The performances are broadly what you would expect – Segal is amusing, the girls are pretty but shallow, and Russell Brand basically plays himself. The Hawaiian locations provide a lush backdrop. There are flashes of male and female nudity, none of them particularly gratuitous but none of them all that necessary either. In the script department, the story proceeds in a fairly predictable manner, with clichéd characters and comic situations which could have been lifted from any TV sitcom. At 110 minutes (or 117 minutes if you're watching the extended version), the film is around ten or fifteen minutes longer than it ought to be, but it doesn't tax the patience to excessive levels. An easy, lazy watch overall but not particularly worthy of the adulation that has been heaped upon it.",5,13,22,23 November 2009
The Hunger Games," Good - not great - opening salvo in the Hunger Games trilogy.
","Based on the first novel in Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy, The Hunger Games is a film that gives itself an extraordinary amount of hype to live up to. Overall it is a pretty good film, but there's a nagging sense throughout that this is just an appetite whetter, a starter course if you like, for something bigger and better and that the forthcoming parts 2 and 3 are likely to provide a meatier main course and more fulfilling dessert.In post-apocalyptic North America, now known simply as Panem, the wealthy Capitol is surrounded by twelve deprived districts. Each year, a ritual known as the Reaping takes place where a boy and a girl from each district is selected by the Capitol authorities to compete in a savage televised contest called the Hunger Games. They are placed in an outdoor arena and forced to fight to the death over a number of days and weeks until one victor remains.When weak 12 year old Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is chosen to be the female representative from District 12, her older sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) steps in and offers to take her place. Katniss is a skilled archer and has a far greater chance of survival in such a brutal competition. The other competitor from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a baker's son who once helped Katniss and her family by providing them with bits of bread when they were starving. In the battle arena the 24 combatants quickly split into various cliques, some forming into marauding groups intent on helping each other to wipe out the strays and loners; others going solo and trying to survive independently for as long as possible.Straight away, a quick scan of the plot synopsis invites comparison to other films and stories. The concept of televised fight-your-rivals-to-the-death is reminiscent of The Running Man (1987) and the hunting-humans-for-sport theme dates all the way back to The Most Dangerous Game (1932). Then there's the Japanese cult hit Battle Royale which seems strikingly similar to The Hunger Games some have criticised Suzanne Collins for ripping off that story, although she has always maintained that any similarities are purely coincidental. Lawrence is very good as Katniss in a part which may lack the depth and richness of her breakthrough role in Winter's Bone, but is still interesting enough to earn her plenty of well-deserved plaudits. Apart from Katniss's District 12 compatriot Peeta, the other contestants are not really built sufficiently as a group of characters. Most disappointing of all is the under-development of the main bad guy, a born-to-kill fighting machine named Cato (Alexander Ludwig). Little snippets of Cato's lethal prowess are shown along the way, but nowhere near enough to make his rivalry a truly meaningful suspense device in the film. The plot is certainly intriguing and thought-provoking. Director Gary Ross gives the film a slick, polished look throughout and makes sure all of the $78 million budget is up there on the screen. Whatever else you might think, there's no denying that this is a great-looking film. The film ultimately falls short of the hype it's a good movie, yes, but not a great one. Does this trilogy have the staying power to develop into something genuinely outstanding? Only time will tell, but there's more than a glimmer that a truly great movie is lurking somewhere in the continuing adventures of Katniss Everdeen.",6,0,3,13 September 2012
The 13th Warrior," Blood-stained historical adventure.
","The Thirteenth Warrior went through a difficult production history and in many ways the finished film - though entertaining - is a shadow of what it could have been. Antonio Banderas plays the hero, an 11th century Arab poet who finds himself in very strange surroundings indeed.He becomes the 13th member of a Norse expedition as they travel to the frozen north, intending to rid their homeland of its fierce enemies. Some very nasty tribesmen have been slaying the villagers and ripping away their heads, leaving people in fear and communities in ruin. The 13 Norse warriors are the only hope that people have of regaining their lives.Jerry Goldsmith's music is rousing throughout, especially during the battle scenes. Banderas gives a good performance as the bewildered hero, fighting for a cause about which he doesn't really understand. The action is filmed well, with brutal battles and narrow escapes shot in convincingly bloodthirsty detail. However, the characterisation is sketchy, with few of the warriors developed in a particularly meaningful way. Also, the occasional attempts to get a romantic storyline going are terribly weak, almost as if much of the footage was left on the cutting room floor. This film never fulfils its potential. It is fun to watch, but it could have been a first-rate epic.",6,2,4,17 June 2003
Stripes," Predictable but watchable (and occasionally very funny) comedy about smart asses joining the army.
","Bill Murray made his name with this early '80s comedy from director Ivan Reitman (the pair of them would later enjoy an even bigger box office hit with Ghostbusters). Stripes also 'inspired' later films like Police Academy, Spies Like Us and Combat Academy, with its simplistic plot structure showing inept recruits going through training, irritating the hell out of their superiors, and finally coming good in the end. In itself, Stripes is harmless fun for the most part, with obvious jokes and pratfalls and occasional flashes of foul language and nudity. Of its type it is a passable enough time-filler (there are, without doubt, FAR poorer examples of movies of this kind).Lazy layabout John (Bill Murray) realises his life is going nowhere and time is running out for him to make something of himself. Joined by his pal Russell (Harold Ramis), he decides to sign up for the army. Initially John and Russell expect this to be a ball, believing that they're in for the kind of action-packed, globe-trotting escapades shown on the army-recruitment TV commercials. Soon they realise they're in for a much tougher time than that as they begin the gruelling training under the leadership of the sadistic Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). After various misadventures and crazy pranks, the wannabe-soldiers under Hulka eventually get their act together and earn their qualified stripes.... whereupon they are promptly sent off to Europe to safeguard a top-secret new armoured vehicle. John and Russell take the vehicle for a spin, little realising that the rest of the U.S. Army think they've stolen it to hand it over to the Communists. The rest of their platoon are ordered to find them, kill them, and return the vehicle to its rightful place, but they are captured by the Communist forces and locked up in a Czechoslovakian prison camp. John and Russell do the only decent thing, and use their army training to bust their pals out of jail.The film not only brought Murray's comic talent to the fore. A quick glance down the cast list shows other future comedy superstars like John Larroquette, Judge Reinhold and John Candy also given this early opportunity to show their skills. Oates also scores as the absurdly larger-than-life NCO, giving a performance of comic flair that is a million miles from the sweaty, dirty anti-heroes he used to play in old Sam Peckinpah movies. The storyline is totally predictable and implausible, and little effort is made to adopt any form of subtlety or wit, but for what it is Stripes works well in its broad and simple-minded way.",5,1,3,15 January 2006
12 Angry Men," Should be in everybody's list of top ten movies.
","12 Angry Men is one of the movies which doesn't particularly divide audiences: virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece. What is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location, yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense, interest and topicality. Not a line is wasted, not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement. Twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father. Eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict. The one thorn-in-their-side is Henry Fonda, who isn't totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more. Slowly but surely, he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open-and-shut case. Sidney Lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance. The sweltering hot weather adds to the mens' frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations. Fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion, but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of Lee J. Cobb as the most aggressive and sharp-tongued of his rivals. There are superb performances also from Jack Warden as a juror who isn't especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time; John Fiedler as a softly-spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed; Martin Balsam as the self-appointed spokesman; and Robert Webber as a rather self-conscious ad executive. Indeed every juror is played to perfection, and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest. The script by Reginald Rose is pure genius. The whole story is told via talk - there's no direct action and no fancy flashbacks - yet it is enthralling from first minute to last. See 12 Angry Men. This is what film as a serious medium is all about!!!",10,0,1,13 January 2004
Beauty and the Beast," Outstanding animated version of an archetypal fairy tale.
","Arguably the best of the latter-day Disney cartoons, Beauty And The Beast is a stunning film that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. After a lengthy lull for the studio, stretching right back to The Aristocats, they finally returned to form with The Little Mermaid in 1989. This 1991 film, based on a Madame LePrince De Beaumont novel, is an absolute delight and marks a high point in Disney animation unmatched since the days of Dumbo and Pinocchio. So impressive is this film that it was the first cartoon movie ever to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, an award it conceivably might have won had it not been up against the mighty Silence Of The Lambs in the same year.In a small provincial village in the French countryside lives a beautiful young lady, Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), and her inventor-father Maurice (voice of Rex Everhart). Belle is obsessed with books and loves stories of romantic derring-do, but the rest of the villagers find her odd - her nose is always stuck in a book, and they think she should be more in tune with what is happening in the real world. Most of the girls in the village have a crush on the handsome hunter Gaston (voice of Richard White), but he desires Belle.... even though she thinks he is nothing more than a brainless, muscle-headed fool. One day Maurice sets off for the nearby city to sell one of his inventions but he gets lost in the woods on the way and ends up seeking shelter in a foreboding castle. Belle grows worried by his absence and sets out to search for him. She too finds the castle and, upon entering, discovers her father imprisoned under the custody of a fearsome beast (voice of Robby Benson). The beast agrees to free her father as long as she takes his place. Initially Belle hates being confined in the castle but gradually she discovers that the beast is not as cruel and heartless as he appears. Just as she is about to fall in love with her captor (thereby breaking a long-lasting curse and turning him back into the prince he once was), a mob of angry villagers - led by Gaston - turn up to kill the beast.Beauty And The Beast is distinguished by splendid animation, memorable voice work, brilliant songs and a perfectly-paced narrative. The animation is a fantastic leap forward for its time, utilising computer generated imagery that brings the characters and places marvellously to life. All the vocal talent is spot-on, with O'Hara and Benson doing lovely work as the titular characters, while the likes of Angela Lansbury, Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers provide memorable supporting voices. The entire film has about it the feel of a stage show, most significantly during the song routines - tunes like 'Be Our Guest', 'Gaston!', 'Tale As Old As Time' and 'Kill The Beast' are instantly catchy, and are brought to life in vibrant, well-worked out sequences. The original story is an archetypal fairy tale and the makers follow it to the letter, adding a few clever trimmings of their own. Individually, each sequence is brilliantly put together creating an overall sense of awe and wonder, and the whole story flows smoothly putting barely a foot in the wrong place. A great film for the family, Beauty And The Beast is outstanding entertainment.",10,3,4,26 August 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good attempt to give a much-loved Narnia story the 'epic' treatment.
","The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe had already been filmed twice prior to this 2005 version, once as a rather mediocre cartoon in 1979 and once as a modest-budget BBC mini-series in 1988. It had never been done on a grand cinematic scale though, possibly because of the phenomenal expense and technology needed to bring it to life in a manner true to the essence of C.S Lewis' book. The catalyst for this latest attempt to tell the story was probably Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy. Having seen in Jackson's films what could be done - what monsters could be put on screen, how epic battles could be realised, how fantastical worlds could be visualised, and so forth - the folks at Disney decided that the time was right to have another go at this Narnia favourite, only this time they've thrown a mega amount of money at it, as well as every type of visual trickery under the sun. The result is certainly a stirring and well-made piece of entertainment, and easily the strongest adaptation of the story thusfar.During WWII, four children are evacuated from bombed-out London to an old mansion in the countryside. They are Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgia Hanley). The mansion belongs to an old professor, and the children are warned by his crusty maid that they must behave perfectly whilst in the house. Pretty soon boredom sets in, and the children decide to play hid-and-seek to pass the time. Young Lucy chooses to hide in a wardrobe, but she gets quite a surprise when she finds that the wardrobe is actually a magical entrance to a fantasy kingdom called Narnia. One by one, all the children find their way into Narnia via the wardrobe, and they discover it to be a kingdom locked in a permanent state of winter by the evil magic of a powerful witch (Tilda Swinton). The witch has long ruled over Narnia, turning all who oppose her to stone. However, she has always feared the words of an age-old prophecy that states her reign of terror will come to an end with the arrival of four humans in her kingdom. Afraid that the children are the four humans of the prophecy, the witch deceitfully lures one of them - Edmund - onto her side and tries to turn him against the others. Meanwhile, Peter, Susan and Lucy travel across Narnia, evading the witch's wolves every step of the way, and eventually meet the mythical lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) who prepares them for the final battle against the witch and her monstrous army.At 2.5 hours, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a well-rounded and well-developed film, though perhaps a bit too long for very young audiences. The special effects work is pretty impressive on the whole, with a convincing gallery of beasts and some magical sets that really capture the child-like wonder of Lewis' stories. Some of the CGI effects in the battle scenes are a little obvious and detract slightly from the spectacle. The performances are good on the whole, particularly the four young actors and Swinton as the despicable witch, plus James McAvoy as the faun Mr Tumnus. One thing, however, that I found really unconvincing was the way that novice swordsmen like Peter and Edmund managed to cope so well on the battlefield.... surely the witch's army would have despatched with the pair of them quite comfortably if they'd fought so inexpertly?? It is an enchanting tale which has stood the test of time, and thankfully the scripters have stuck to the story faithfully in most aspects. On the whole, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a good, solid family film and a long overdue effort to do a version that is worthy of the source novel.",8,2,4,12 December 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Enjoyable, near-identical sequel to Ice Age.
","The first Ice Age movie was pretty good - excellent animation, funny moments, slightly bland story - and it's virtually the same with this sequel. Many of the same actors return to provide the vocal work for their characters, with a few new voices this time around (like Queen Latifah as a VERY weird woolly mammoth). Just as in the first film, the voice acting is the thing that really makes the film entertaining, with John Leguizamo doing an especially good job as Sid the sloth. The animation is once again superb, but in all honesty the advances in technology over the past decade mean that ALL new animated movies look good (to praise the animators is almost as unnecessary as saying that cereals taste good with milk!) Once more, the storyline is the weak link in the overall scheme of things - it's just a very plain, straightforward tale of friendship and adventure, which passes the time servicably enough without ever reaching a level one might call outstanding.Sid the sloth (voice of John Leguizamo), Manny the woolly mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger (voice of Dennis Leary) are, at the start of the story, living in a walled valley. The weather has warmed up considerably since their first series of adventures, and the ice covering the world seems to be melting. The creatures living in the valley learn that the huge wall of ice next to their home will shortly melt and give way to a great sea of water that could quite possibly wash away them and their homeland. The only hope is for all the creatures to embark on a long trek to the other end of the valley, where a massive tree trunk shaped like an ark can be used to help them survive the imminent flood. During the journey, the creatures have numerous adventures including being pursued by shark-like predators. Manny also has to face up to the possibility that he may be the last of his species, for it has indeed been a long time since anyone saw another woolly mammoth.Leguizamo makes all the best one-liners his own, in particular a brilliant moment where his character Sid utters: 'Gee tomorrow the flood's gonna come and we're all gonna die'.... then, having made this terrifying prophecy, falls to sleep a fraction of a second later! Sid also has a rib-tickingly funny scene where he is mistaken as a God, and gets his tribe of 'followers' copying his every movement. The character Scrat is also back - you may remember him as the rodent perpetually trying to get hold of that elusive nut - and once more there are amusing slapstick gags involving his attempts to eat. The film, at 91 minutes, is of a very appropriate duration and doesn't outstay its welcome.To summarise, if you liked Ice Age you'll like its sequel; if you didn't, you won't. They really are almost identical films in many aspects.",6,2,3,7 May 2006
Hot Fuzz," Hilarious, bloody and rather clever action spoof.
","I wasn't expecting much from this very British spoof on the action genre (and, to some extent, a lampoon of gory murder mysteries). However, it is done with considerable style and energy and has some genuinely hilarious moments. Coming away from this film, one feels pleasantly surprised. It isn't just a low-brow comedy designed to provide easy laughs – there's much more going on here. Cross references to earlier movies, witty one-liners, a wacky yet very clever plot, terrific performances, genuinely suspenseful death scenes. the list goes on. There are flaws - but not too many!Ace policeman Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is too good for his job. As his London superiors explain to him, he's arresting so many crooks that he's making the rest of the force look bad! So, they ship him out to the quiet country village of Sandford, Gloucestershire, a peaceful haven where nothing bad ever happens and the residents proudly tout themselves as the Village of the Year, a competition they've won for countless years in a row. Initially horrified at the prospect, Angel soon realises that all is not what it seems in this 'perfect' rural village. A series of seemingly tragic accidents raise Angel's suspicion – he believes foul play is afoot, and with the aid of his oafish new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) sets out to uncover a dark conspiracy. Angel is convinced that a cunning murderer is at work, but what is their motive and who could it be? Hot Fuzz is a parody of the highly derivative buddy cop flicks that Hollywood has been churning out for a couple of decades – the likes of Bad Boys, Point Break, and Lethal Weapon are gently ridiculed throughout. Likewise many of the murder sequences are reminiscent of the ridiculously elaborate set-ups in slasher movies. Hot Fuzz contains its share of bloodthirsty mayhem, but it all seems done in a weirdly good-natured way which encourages laughter rather than distaste. One scene in particular – a church steeple being dropped onto an unsuspecting victim – is simultaneously gory and hysterically funny. There are flaws, as I mentioned previously. One of them is the (deliberate?) over-editing in a few sequences, which is irritating rather than clever. Another is the way the film seems to have about four separate climaxes and ends up nearly out-staying its welcome. Pegg establishes himself as a genuinely likable leading man, while Frost is broadly amusing as his overweight, under-intelligent partner. The supporting cast is a delightful gallery of old pros – Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Paul Freeman, Bill Nighy and Stuart Wilson – all of whom seem to be having an absolute ball playing against type. All in all, Hot Fuzz is a hugely enjoyable parody of the action genre and a refreshing treat in this era of endless sequels, remakes and rip-offs.",8,2,4,22 June 2009
The Mummy," Disappointingly shallow Indiana Jones clone, with just about enough energy to save it from the trash pile.
","The Mummy doesn't try to do anything original. It merely begs, steals and borrows all its ideas from a host of successful films. The most obvious source of inspiration is the Indiana Jones series. One of the most depressing facts about this film is that it became a worldwide box office smash. Either I'm out of touch when it comes to choosing an entertaining film, or people the planet over are perfectly happy to be ripped off by films like this that have not a fresh idea in sight. As Indy rip-offs go, this one is at least an improvement on Richard Chamberlain's appalling Allan Quatermain flicks. The plot is the same plot that has always been used in mummy movies: adventurers awaken the mummified corpse of an ancient Egyptian. To add spice to the proceedings, this particular mummy has the power to wipe out mankind, unless the heroes can figure out a way to stop him - which proves a tad tricky as he's invincible! The characters are pretty much lifted from stock, with all of the following present and correct:1). a fearless wise-cracking hero.2). a spunky heroine.3). a British buffoon (along for comic relief).4). a totally invulnerable, superhuman baddie.5). a sneaky ethnic traitor. The Mummy moves at a fast enough lick to keep you interested, but never once is it genuinely exciting. Fraser's hero is a boring cardboard cut-out who can handle even the most lethal danger with a quip... how are we supposed to feel tense when the quest to save mankind is in the hands of such an infallible hero? There's an over-reliance on special effects, too, with lots of intentionally gruesome moments that are clearly meant to cause the audience to 'ooohhh' and 'aahhh'. It's not the worst film of '99, nor is it even a total loss, but The Mummy is resolutely average from first scene to last.",Null,0,1,31 December 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Roland Emmerich rehashes his favourite theme of epic-scale worldwide destruction. Nothing new, but easy enough to sit through.
","Roland Emmerich clearly likes destruction on a grand scale. He had aliens decimating various cities and landmarks in Independence Day; he had a giant lizard flattening New York in Godzilla; and here in The Day After Tomorrow he has the entire Northern Hemisphere becoming uninhabitable due to the onset of a new ice age. In Emmerich's films these catastrophic disasters are always depicted on screen with vivid state of the art special effects. But there's always something a bit lacking in the character department; Emmerich deals with one-dimensional people, the kind of people who stay square-jawed and heroic in a crisis, the kind of people who have a cool one-liner for the most hair-raising of moments. The Day After Tomorrow has the usual spectacular destruction, convincingly staged as ever, but when the human story takes precedence during the second half it becomes clear that the director isn't sure what to make of it.Climatologist Jack Hall (Dennid Quaid) gives a speech at a climate conference warning that global warming could change weather patterns on the planet to such an extent that it could send everything into reverse, causing a new ice age. He is largely ridiculed, his theories dismissed as scare-mongering by the likes of American Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh). Yet within a few weeks, Hall's predictions start to become reality as temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummet and inexplicable weather hits various places. Freak ice storms cause destruction in Japan; temperatures in Scotland drop so low that fuel freezes in the tanks of helicopters bringing them crashing to the ground; LA is ravaged by multiple hurricanes; and a tidal wave brings devastation to New York. Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York for a college quiz contest, and gets trapped when the extraordinary weather freezes over the entire city. Jack embarks on a perilous cross-country journey to reunite with his son and rescue him  and others - from the big freeze.The scientific background of the film is loosely true  a severe enough change in the climate caused by global warming could affect the gulf streams so much that another ice age might happen. But the timescale for such a change would be centuries, as opposed to the handful of days it takes in the film. Emmerich delights in entertaining us with the destruction of more famous places  in one scene he even gives us a twister ripping the famous Hollywood letters from their hillside spot over Tinseltown. The performances are OK within the limitations of the characters  Quaid simply has to look and act brave as the worried father, while Gyllenhaal proves himself agile in a few energetic action sequences. The second half of the film deals with Dad trying to reach Son and is largely uninvolving and unconvincing. But the spectacle in the first half is enough to remind us that no-one does end-of-the-world pictures with quite as much boyish enthusiasm as Roland Emmerich! This is easy viewing  nothing new, nothing special, but watchable enough in its overblown way.",5,1,2,24 January 2008
A Bridge Too Far," Under-rated war epic.
","Quite a few bad things have been written about A Bridge Too Far. Richard Attenborough's elephantine recreation of the battle for several strategically valuable Dutch bridges in the winter of 1944 is a star-studded, lengthy and exhausting film (and many critics at the time seemed to be of the opinion that it collapsed beneath its own weight). Almost thirty years on, the film is now viewed somewhat more favourably. It may feel 30 minutes too long, and the need for so many stars in so many tiny parts is questionable, but A Bridge Too Far successfully shows a fierce episode of the Second World War in all its chaotic glory. Incredibly, there's no use of the computer generated effects during the big battle scenes that it is relied upon in modern films like Gladiator and Troy. The scenes in this film were shot pretty much as you see them - so the 35,000 parachutists storming Holland, the river crossing led by Robert Redford under intense enemy fire, and other such staggering combat sequences were filmed with thousands of extras and a good deal of meticulous planning and preparation.The film is based upon Operation Market Garden, an Allied plot hatched towards the end of 1944 with the intention of ending the war in Europe. The concept behind the plan was to drop 35,000 soldiers into Holland approximately 60 miles beyond the German lines, to seize six vital bridges, and to reinforce the paratroopers by sending in thousands of ground troops. However, various mishaps jeopardised the mission and eventually the Allies were cut off and had to withdraw, suffering severe losses.As stellar casts go, A Bridge Too Far still takes some rivalling. Among the many famous actors involved, these are just a few: Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Ryan O'Neal, Gene Hackman, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins and Elliott Gould. It seems pointless for some of the actors to be cast in these roles - true enough, Connery, Bogarde and Hopkins get decent roles and a fair bit of screen time, but was it really worth paying Redford $2,000,000 for his ten minute heroics? Could a decent actor have not handled the role for a fraction of that amount? Is Gene Hackman really the correct choice for Polish officer Major General Stanislaw Sosabowski? Should a light comic actor like Elliott Gould be doing his cigar-chomping 'fun' turn in a movie as serious as this?Luckily, the film is a big success on other levels. The cinematography is extraordinary; the music is suitably stirring; the potentially confusing story is handled with clarity and true-to-the-facts sensitivity; and amid the chaos a number of very memorable scenes emerge. A Bridge Too Far is a very good war film - maybe the biggest war film ever conceived (The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan included) - and I feel that, although it has a few casting flaws, it is in almost every other department a great, great achievement.",7,173,203,10 November 2004
The Adventures of Tintin," Long-awaited big screen version of Tintin - fast, fun and beautifully animated.
","Steven Spielberg has had periodic breaks in his directing career – almost four years elapsed between Schindler's List and Jurassic Park: The Lost World; a three year hiatus from Saving Private Ryan to AI: Artificial Intelligence; and after Munich it was three years until the emergence of Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Spielberg tends to remain very active as a producer and executive producer whilst away from the director's chair, but movie lovers everywhere are always most eager to see what he will next come up with when wearing his director's hat. After the relative disappointment of the fourth Indy film (critically at least, though commercially it performed well), it's good to report that Spielberg is back to pretty good form with The Adventures Of Tintin: Secret Of The Unicorn.Youthful Belgian reporter Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) purchases a beautiful model ship at a flea market. Shortly after, he is approached by the menacing Ivan Sakharine (voice of Daniel Craig) who is desperate to buy the model, and who gets particularly aggressive when Tintin refuses to part with it. Slowly Tintin discovers that the model is one of three identical ships made many years earlier to show the whereabouts of a lost treasure. Sakharine turns out to be a descendant of notorious buccaneer Red Rackham. He has dedicated his life to tracking down the sunken treasure of Sir Francis Haddocke, captain of the Unicorn, a 17th Century treasure ship which was attacked by Red Rackham whilst laden with riches. Haddocke sank his ship rather than allowing his precious cargo to fall into pirate hands, but devised the three model ships to act as clues to the position of the vast treasure. Now Sakharine hopes to locate this unimaginable missing wealth. Tintin joins forces with hard-drinking Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis) – modern day ancestor of Sir Francis – and together they race to be first to solve the riddle of the lost treasure.In essence, Tintin is very similar to an Indiana Jones movie, with its combination of globe-trotting adventures and spectacular action sequences. It is Spielberg's first animated film and the animation is absolutely stunning throughout, with amazing attention to detail. The vocal acting is generally good, especially Serkis whose booze-sodden Captain Haddock is a wonderfully humorous creation. The story attempts to combine elements of three of the original Hergé books - The Crab With The Golden Claws, The Secret Of The Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure. At times, the narrative stretches coincidences to breaking point; at others, the action threatens to become almost too frenetic and overwhelming for the film's own good. But overall, The Adventures Of Tintin: Secret Of The Unicorn is a rip-roaring adventure caper that throws in everything but the kitchen sink for the sake of a good show. On this evidence, viewers will be looking forward to the inevitable sequel with plenty of anticipation.",7,0,3,25 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Bleakly brilliant satire of the nuclear threat - one of Kubrick's very best.
","Such is the esteem with which Stanley Kubrick's name is held in cinematic circles that it's easy to forget that he only directed thirteen feature films during his 46 year career. Choosing the best of those films is no easy task – Kubrick's finest movies are not just masterpieces by his own standards, but masterpieces of cinema as a whole. Dr Strangelove would certainly feature highly on any list, for it is a truly incredible film. Political satire, nuclear comedy, stark warning, apocalyptic drama – it doesn't matter how you categorise the film; it works perfectly under any heading.Mad American officer, Brigadier-General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), single-handedly instructs a squadron of B-52 bombers to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Ripper is obsessed with the notion that the Commies have been 'polluting the bodily fluids' of Americans by fluoridation for decades, and decides the time is right to provoke total annihilation. In the War Room at the Pentagon, American President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), is horrified to discover that one man's irrational paranoid ideals have set into motion a countdown to Armageddon. He and his cabinet desperately try to find a solution to the crisis. Meanwhile, back at Ripper's HQ, an absurdly stiff-upper-lipped RAF officer, Captain Mandrake (Sellers, again), tries to persuade Ripper to reveal to him the recall codes which will bring the bombers back. Ripper shoots himself rather than reveal the codes, but Mandrake figures them out by ingeniously interpreting a number of doodles scrawled across the Brigadier-General's desk. Little of this matters in the slightest, as one of the B-52s piloted by proud Texan Major T.J. 'King' Kong (Slim Pickens) has suffered radio damage and proceeds towards its primary target, blissfully unaware that all the other bombers have been recalled. Having thought they'd averted disaster by the skin of their teeth, the Americans look on in helpless terror as Kong's plane flies towards its appointment with doomsdayBased on a serious novel by Peter George, Dr Strangelove takes only the basic plot of the book and transforms it into something incredibly bleak and biting. The inability of politicians to grasp the futility of self-destruction is a key theme here, very pertinent considering that the film was made at the height of Cold War brinkmanship. Although time has inevitably diluted the relevance of the 'nuclear scare' (nowadays the threat comes from terrorism rather than those pesky Russkies, the film is still enormously powerful and frightening in its absurdity. Sellers is terrific in his triple role (RAF hero, helpless US President and sinister German scientist), but the two stars who make the greatest impression are Hayden as the entirely insane provocateur and Pickens as the dedicated Major Kong. The scene of Kong straddling the bomb to oblivion – yee-hawing like some wild rodeo star as he rides the all-destructive megaton missile to the ground – is one of the most iconic cinematic images of all-time. The script is absolutely razor sharp throughout with some fantastically clever one-liners ('Gentlemen, you cannot fight in here. This is the War Room!') delivered by brilliant caricatures of the men who hold the fate of the world in their hands. Many films have tried since to recapture the magnificently satirical edge of Dr Stangelove – a few have come close, many have fallen short, but none have equalled or surpassed Kubrick's horrifyingly hilarious masterpiece.",10,2,5,23 January 2013
Over the Top," Sooooooo Eighties!
","Over the Top sees Sylvester Stallone returning to the sporting arena in an attempt to hit the box office heights of the Rocky series. Boxing is not the sport in question here, though. This is an arm-wrestling movie, and believe me when I say there's not much to get excited about when two big, strapping guys hold hands and try to out-muscle each other. Stallone plays trucker Lincoln Hawk. He's estranged from his young son, but when the boy's mother falls terminally ill, Hawk takes him on a cross-country road trip to be with his ailing mom. En route, Hawk tells the kid that he plans to make his fortune as a world champion arm-wrestler. At the end, he goes to Las Vegas to take on the other contenders. Oh yes, and the boy's grand-father (who hates Stallone) spends the film trying to drive a wedge between them. This film is quite painful. It can't decide whether it wants to be sensitive or tough; it can't decide whether to focus on the relationship between Sly and his son, or the impending arm-wrestling tournament. It goes through ludicrous mood swings, with a tender scene one instant during which the mother dies, and a destructive scene the next as Stallone drives his truck through his father-in-law's house. The arm-wrestling contest at the end is filmed like an MTV pop video, with a zooming camera, staccato editting and a thunderously headache-inducing soundtrack poured over the action.  Fans of Stallone will probably find something to enjoy here, but not much. Those who aren't a great disciple of the actor and his work will probably see right through it and recognise it for what it is: mindless, cheesy junk!",Null,1,6,21 October 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Foul-mouthed, gruelling snapshot of Vietnam.... intentionally unpretty and bleak (which is, ironically, both its strength and its weakness).
","Stanley Kubrick made surprisingly few movies considering that he was credited as a genius film-maker. For example, he allowed seven years to elapse between The Shining and this Vietnam War film. Well-made as it is, Full Metal Jacket is not without certain flaws and is by no means top-drawer Kubrick. However, it is punctuated with incredible moments in spite of its shortcomings, including a gruelling opening-act which details marine training at Parris Island and ends with a hair-raising showdown between a grunt and a gunnery sergeant. Also, the film's bloody climax, with its inconclusive clash between the American forces and an enemy sniper, is simultaneously tense, frightening, ironic and meaningless.The story (taken from Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers) opens with a bunch of green marine recruits undergoing military training at Parris Island. The drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is a ruthless, motor-mouthed loony who relentlessly humiliates and desensitises his boys, so that when he has finally stripped them of their humanity he can rebuild them as single-minded killing machines. Among the bunch is happy-go-lucky Private Joker (Matthew Modine), and the vaguely ridiculous (and ridiculed) Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). As the recruits near the end of their gruelling training regime, Pyle finally cracks under the strain and kills the gunnery sergeant, before turning his gun on himself. The action jumps forward to find Joker on a tour of duty in Vietnam. He is by this point a military journalist who has seen some pretty unpleasant sights during his time in 'Nam (and is divided by his experiences - notice his Born To Kill helmet and his Peace buttoned jacket). The platoon he is part of becomes involved in a street battle in the ruins of Hue City near the film's climax, where they find themselves pinned down and picked off by a female Vietcong sniper. Finally, after much panic and bloodshed, darkness falls and the marines retreat into the night singing the Mickey Mouse March.Where Kubrick really hits his target is in his depiction of the emotional change within Modine's character, and in his cold and cynical (and authentic) view of the dehumanisation that results from being subjected to warfare. Women and children become acceptable targets for the gun-toting soldiers; fear of death gives way to callous indifference; violence becomes normal; horrific deaths and injuries become commonplace to the point of disinterest. No-one in the film can remember the cause they're fighting for or, if they can, they never refer to it. It's just one side versus the other, locked in a costly, savage stalemate, as they enter into violent engagements simply because it's expected of them. The lack of real location work is a problem - Kubrick wouldn't film outside England, so the final gun exchange in Hue City was actually shot in a disused London factory yard, complete with imported palm trees. Also, the film is so detached from compassion (intentionally, I know) that it becomes hard to relate to anyone in the film. While we're supposed to be shocked by the utter indifference with which people are killed or injured during warfare, the total refusal to present a glimmer of feeling or sympathy makes the film's second half as icily distant as it is bloodthirsty. Full Metal Jacket is certainly powerful and potent, but its sheer authenticity makes it a pretty hard watch.",7,10,15,14 March 2006
The Godfather: Part II," A remarkable epic crime movie, utterly compelling as a sequel though it requires some knowledge of the previous movie to fully enjoy it.
","The Godfather: Part II has the rare distinction of being a sequel that is equal to, possibly even greater than, its predecessor. Indeed, it is one of the finest films ever made, a gangster picture that manages to be epic in scope as well as length, showcasing a number of brilliant performances and proving that, for all the fancy special effects in the world, nothing beats a truly compelling story. The only thing to bear in mind is that The Godfather: Part II relies heavily on a knowledge of the previous film – it is not one of those follow-ups that can be watched out of sequence with any hope of grasping what is going on. 'Sequel' might be the wrong word actually, as the film is divided into two sections, one continuing the story of the Corleone crime family from where it left off at the end of Part I, the other acting as a turn-of- the-century prequel, showing the rise of Vito Corleone from orphaned Sicilian immigrant to powerful Mob boss. In effect, The Godfather: Part II is therefore a continuation of, and prequel to, the existing narrative dealt with in the original.Following the death of his father and older brother, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the new head of his family's empire, based now in Nevada having moved out of New York several years earlier. Running the 'business' is taking its toll on the once-honest Michael – his relationship with wife Kay (Diane Keaton) is frosty and distant; his brother Fredo (John Cazale) is becoming more of a burden than ever; he must deal with rumblings of discontent from New York; and his pledge to legitimise the Corleone family is further than ever from becoming a reality. Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt, Michael puts consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) in charge of the family for a while, while he goes away to deal with some business matters and investigate who tried to have him killed. His adventures bring him into contact with Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who may be Michael's ally or enemy. The story traces Michael's long descent into isolation and paranoia, alienating himself from everyone in his all- consuming quest to come out on top in this epic gangland-battle-of-wits. Interwoven into the story are a number of flashbacks showing the rise of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando's character from Part I, here portrayed by Robert De Niro). After arriving in New York a poor immigrant, Vito eventually finds honest work in a grocery store but is hounded out of his job by local gangster Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Making ends meet through petty burglaries, he gradually rises up the criminal ranks, killing Fanucci and eventually becoming a feared and respected figure in the neighbourhood.Whereas The Godfather was criticised for glamorising violent crime and the Mafia, The Godfather: Part II shows things in a much uglier light. Families are torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; relationships are destroyed by the lack of communication; innocence is tarnished irrevocably. In short, the world seems somehow more rotten and corrupt in The Godfather: Part II. It's an altogether more ruthless film, harder-edged, shockingly authentic even. The performances are exemplary throughout. How Pacino didn't win the Best Actor Oscar of the year is beyond comprehension, creating as he does this incredible character whose grip on his empire comes at a terrible price. De Niro is excellent as the young Vito Corleone; Keaton fabulous as Michael's neglected wife; Duvall convincing as ever as the family lawyer; and Strasberg mesmerising as the slippery Hyman Roth, one of the truly great characters of gangster cinema. If it seems like in this review I have done nothing but shower superlatives upon this film, that's because I have. The Godfather: Part II is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies of all- time.",10,3,8,9 April 2014
Predator," Sci-fi suspenser, simplistic but quite effective.
","The premise of this gory sci-fi actioner is very simple and quite effective. It's basically the story of a hunt. Initially the principal characters believe THEY are the hunters, as they stealthily creep through the jungle towards a guerilla stronghold. We in the audience know that these principal characters are actually the huntED, thanks to an opening sequence which shows an alien spaceship swooping from outer space into the Amazon jungle. What we have here, in effect, is another variation of The Most Dangerous Game, dressed up with state-of-the-art special effects, tons of hardware and weaponry, insanely pumped-up heroes, and an alien baddie as opposed to a mad-man.American soldier Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is called upon to lead his crack team into the hostile South American jungle. A helicopter has crash-landed carrying some very important people, and Dutch and his boys are supposed to find them and rescue them. The mission seems straightforward enough, until Dutch's men start hiking through the jungle and come across the flayed carcasses of another American military team. Tag along team-member Dillon (Carl Weathers) claims he knew nothing of another American unit operating in the area, but Dutch is already beginning to suspect that there's more to the mission than meets the eye. Eventually, Dutch and his boys find the enemy encampment which they promptly wipe out in a lightning attack. But they learn that they have been misled about the true objective of their mission (it wasn't a rescue mission at all, but an annihilation one). As the team head off into the jungle to their helicopter rendezvous point, they suddenly fall foul of a mysterious adversary which picks them off stealthily from the tree-tops. Gradually, they realise that they up against an alien being which is hunting them for sport.... and which can camouflage itself so that it all but blends in with the surrounding environment!Predator is a solid suspense flick, which has simple intentions but achieves them effectively. It never pretends to have any deeper meaning beyond the immediate excitement, and is all the better for this lack of pretension. The testosterone-fuelled cast play their roles with the macho conviction required; there's nothing challenging or subtle about their performances, but they do what's needed to suit the mood of the film. The special effects are good for the era, and actually hold up quite well when viewing the movie nowadays. The film moves along to an exciting finale, though I must say I found it hard to swallow the fact that when Arnold was setting all his traps and crafting his weapons in the film's closing moments, the predator was unable to sense him (yes, OK, he was caked in mud.... but he was making a lot of noise, moving around plenty, and working by firelight!?!) All things considered, Predator is an enjoyable, slick, simple-minded and effective suspenser.",6,2,9,8 March 2006
The Killing Fields," Outstanding, powerful tale of integrity and survival.
","The Killing Fields is an urgent, powerful and visually upsetting film set in the mid-70s in Cambodia. Director Roland Joffe spares us nothing whatsoever in his devastating depiction of casualties, cruelty and torture during the appalling combat. But the film is not merely concerned with presenting a realistic snapshot of the atrocities in Cambodia at the time of the Khmer Rouge uprising. Joffe's film also works on a human level by telling the true story of the relationship between a N.Y. Times journalist and his Cambodian assistant and interpreter during these events. It is the expert balance of unflinching history and human drama that makes The Killing Fields such a tremendous movie.N.Y. Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) is working in Cambodia in 1973 on a report about the consequences of American bombings against suspected communist bases. Assigned to aid and interpret for Schanberg is the native Dith Pran (Hang S. Ngor). As the months pass, chaos erupts in Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge seize control. Dith Pran places himself in danger to protect Schanberg from the victorious Khmer Rouge forces and even risks life and limb to help him gather controversial material for his dispatches back to America. But when Schanberg and the other remaining correspondents have to leave Cambodia, they fail to fool the authorities into believing that Dith Pran is an American citizen, and the unfortunate interpreter is taken to one of the infamous Year Zero re-education camps. After suffering and witnessing inhuman conditions and nauseating atrocities, Dith Pran escapes by crawling through corpse-littered paddy fields, and eventually is reunited with his American friend Schanberg in New York.Slightly hampered by unclear scripting in parts, as well as Mike Oldfield's terrible music score, The Killing Fields is in every other way a stunning film. The appalling and traumatic experiences that Dith Pran goes through are conveyed with near unwatchable authenticity. Indeed, the film hits emotional heights rarely touched upon in movies by placing a lot of emphasis onto Dith Pran's unimaginable experiences, and by showing the way he strives to survive even after these experiences have stripped him of his dignity. Ngor as the Cambodian interpreter gives a performance of real power in the role. Sam Waterston is also terrific as Schanberg, a dedicated journalist who faced the gravest danger by remaining in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge rebellion, and who bore enormous personal guilt for failing to help his Cambodian colleague to escape from the ravaged country. One of the key films of the '80s, and indisputably one of the most provocative tales of survival in the history of cinema, The Killing Fields is an essential movie.",9,1,3,2 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," World class. A truly outstanding film.
","In my humble opinion, the three books that comprise The Lord of the Rings trilogy are all excellent. The Fellowship of the Ring is the second best segment; The Return of the King is the best; and The Two Towers is the weakest part (though still extremely good). This film version is a truly remarkable adaptation of the first part in the trilogy.It treads similar ground to the 1978 animated version of the tale. The special effects which bring the movie to life are flawless. It's amazing how they've managed to make a normal-sized actor like Elijah Wood or John Rhys-Davies actually look the correct height for a hobbit or a dwarf, while wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) appears unnaturally tall. Even more amazing is the effects work that has gone into creating such monsters as orcs or the Balrog (a fire demon). Even the different worlds have been perfectly captured: Rivendell looks resplesdent; the Mines of Moria are terrifying; and the Shire is beautifully realised too. It was clearly a tricky task to get the casting of the film right, but they've done it quite well. Maybe Sean Bean isn't quite right as Boromir (he seems more at home in kitchen sink dramas ie When Saturday Comes), but they've got the rest of the characters quite well figured out.This is my favourite film of the 21st century so far. It works on many levels: visual, aural, intellectual and literal. It's a true masterpiece. Congratulations to all who had anything to do with its production.",Null,0,0,13 January 2003
Grease," Wafer thin plot, but still a blast thanks to energy, exuberance and toe-tapping musical numbers.
","Grease, like a fine wine, has grown with age. It was a phenomenally successful film in its time but its commercial popularity was not equalled by its critical reception. Not that contemporary critics were especially negative towards it, more that they approved it with blandly above average reviews. To be sure, the plot of Grease is wafer thin and its narrative borders on non-existent between the musical set pieces.. However, it is a film which transcends the basic requirements of strong plot and narrative. It's about joyous set pieces. It's about goofy characters, interacting via goofy dialogue. It's about nostalgia. It's about awkward teen courtship. It's about those last days of high school where the joy of being young is ever-so-slightly tarnished by the encroaching end of one's educational era. The final scene of John Travolta and Olivia Newton John driving off into the sky in a flying car roots the film in a dreamy nostalgic/retrospective landscape, reminding us that we've been watching a fun musical fantasy, nothing more. In terms of achieving its goals – entertaining the audience, rocking us out, and putting a smile on our face – Grease does exactly what it says on the tin.It's the start of a new school year at Rydell High, and T-Bird gang member Danny Zuko (John Travolta) enthusiastically tells his friends about a summer romance that he has enjoyed during the holidays. Unbeknown to him, his summer sweetheart Sandy (Olivia Newton John), has not returned to Australia as expected but, in fact, has enrolled at the same high school, where she relates her amazing summer of love with Danny to her new classmates. When they eventually run into each other, Danny can't bring himself to be his true self in front of his friends. Embarrassed by his gushing sentiments, his genuine feelings for Sandy, he treats her off-handedly, cruelly even, and it seems impossible that they will ever rediscover their magical connection. Throughout the continuing story of Danny and Sandy's difficult on/off romance, we also follow the exploits of the other characters in their circle – the risqué relationship between Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) and Rizzo (Stockard Channing); the rivalry between the T-Birds and another gang, the Scorpions, culminating in a classic car race; an impending dance contest at Rydell; and the final graduation (and goodbyes) of each of the gang.What makes Grease work above everything else is the charm, enthusiasm and energy with which it is presented. There's a sense of everyone pulling in the same direction, entering into the spirit of things in a manner that becomes immediately infectious. The characters are at once lovable and identifiable; their actions and reactions cleverly tuned into real people and real feelings, but dressed up in a joyous musical approach. The musical set pieces are very well done indeed – all the songs pretty much deliver, getting the audience toe-tapping in spite of themselves. Best of all is the sensational closing number, You're The One That I Want, brilliantly choreographed against a fairground backdrop, and featuring Newton John shedding her bookish image and wooing Danny in cinema's most infamous tight leather pants. Performance-wise the film is generally pretty good. Travolta and Newton John have a lovely chemistry, even if their characters are a mite too broadly painted at times. Channing is fabulous as the scene-stealing Rizzo, and Eve Arden has some moments of pure comedic gold as the disapproving school principal Miss McGee. Enduringly popular, always fresh and fun to watch, and a real sing-along favourite, Grease is vastly entertaining if nothing else. Yes, its narrative meanders without much direction at times, but Grease is still a blast.",9,2,2,1 May 2013
The Thing," Commendable science fiction which works well until you place it under close scrutiny - whereupon the faults become all too clear.
","Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? (which was previously filmed as The Thing From Another World), this 1982 version of The Thing is an exciting and fairly gruesome slice of science fiction. It has its fair share of shortcomings, which I will mention later, but on the whole this is a commendable film. A bunch of US researchers at a secluded Antarctic base rescue a stray dog. Little do they realise that the dog's body has been inhabited by a deadly alien organism which can take the shape of its victims so that no-one knows it is there. Seems that some Norweigan scientists at a nearby base unearthed the murderous extra terrestrial from the ice, where it had laid frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Pretty soon, the guys in the American research team are being infected by 'The Thing' one by one.... but how can they tell who is who when it can imitate any one of them with such accuracy? The Antarctic setting complements the suspense perfectly. The isolation of a scientific station in the middle of nowhere is an ideal metaphor for the fearful isolation that each character experiences, miles from help and surrounded by other characters who may or may not be what they seem. Rob Bottin's make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's visual effects are memorably (and intentionally) unpleasant. And some performances, notably Kurt Russell as the suicidal hero, are absolutely spot-on. As I touched upon earlier, the film has a few shortcomings. There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how the alien actually infects its victims, and some moments near the end seem illogical (e.g. what's going on with A. Wilford Brimley's character in his last scene, and why does Keith David go running around alone knowing that the alien is on the prowl?) Also there are clumsy goofs - for instance, it is widely-known that Antarctica experiences six months of uninterrupted daylight and six months of uninterrupted darkness, so how come day and night occur on a daily basis in this film? The film is best enjoyed as an exercise in suspense and a show-stopping display of innovative special effects, but if you start to unpick the plot in closer detail the holes begin to show.",6,10,22,27 June 2004
Armageddon," Has impressive moments, but insists on being shamelessly corny rather too much of the time.
","'Armageddon' in its biblical sense refers to the final battle to decide the fate of the world. And this 1998 action movie wastes no time in placing the world in grave danger as an asteroid the size of Texas heads towards the planet, threatening to wipe out life as we know it. Armageddon is undeniably exciting in parts, but it frequently undermines itself with set pieces that are too over-the-top for the film's own good, and some embarrassingly corny dialogue and situations.NASA scientists learn that an asteroid is on collision course with earth. Their only option is to destroy the rock before it hits, but in order to do that they need experienced drillers who can burrow to a depth of 800ft, plant a nuclear bomb in the hole they've made, and blow up the offending asteroid. The only team who have the expertise to carry out the required drilling work are a bunch of misfit oil-drillers led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). The top brass at NASA aren't exactly thrilled at the prospect of placing the fate of the planet in the hands of these unrefined, blue-collar layabouts. But since no-one else can do the job, Stamper and his cronies are put through rigorous space training before being sent to intercept the asteroid and save mankind.Where Armageddon comes unstuck is in its insistence on overcooking its ingredients at almost every possible point. For instance when the heroes dock at the Russian space station to refuel, what's the point of the big action sequence in which the routine refuelling procedure goes wrong and the station ends up blowing up? It's not a genuinely exciting scene - just an artificially contrived sequence shoved in there purely so that the audience can be subjected to more explosions and last-gasp escapes. There are many similarly exaggerated scenes which lose impact due to overkill - Buscemi's bout of space dementia; the dumb scene in which a trio of men drive across a gravity-less canyon; Willis's absurdly noble and polished final speech just minutes after he's elected to sacrifice himself to detonate the bomb; the TV-commercial-style scenes of kids running around with toy space shuttles celebrating the destruction of the asteroid; etc. These scenes really grate on the viewer, because they are overdone to such a degree that they insult our intelligence. That's not to say Armageddon is all bad. It's done with its tongue in its cheek and so manages some occasional flashes of self-deprecating humour. Also, occasional sequences are quite exciting, with good editing and photography, and in a few scenes the action is suitably exciting because it isn't bled dry of all credibility. The performances vary in quality, but Patton is good as one of the drillers and Stormare has a nice role as an eccentric Russian cosmonaut. Armageddon is an OK popcorn picture for the undemanding, but its identically-plotted 1998 rival Deep Impact is unquestionably better.",5,0,1,22 December 2004
21," Easy-to-watch caper inspired by true events.
","'21' is an easy-to-watch caper movie based on factual events. You don't particularly have to be able to understand the rules of blackjack, nor do you have to be a gambling enthusiast, to enjoy the film. It begins, keeps you engrossed for a couple of hours, then finishes. The whole thing is smooth, slick and enjoyable on an undemanding level. The lack of depth hurts the film when it comes to repeat viewings, but if you intend to watch it once only it's a reasonably entertaining flick.MIT student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is desperate to secure a place at Harvard Medical School, but cannot afford the educational fees so is hedging all his hopes on winning a much-sought scholarship. Fate lends a hand when Ben proves his ingenuity in an advanced maths class taught by charismatic lecturer Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), during which he successfully solves a complex probability question. Later, Ben is invited to join Professor Rosa and five other students who are part of a well-organised gambling racket involving the card game blackjack. Using their mathematical know-how, the team have devised a system for winning tens of thousands of dollars at the blackjack table. They take it in turns as 'spotters' (card-counters who place minimum bets and look out for tables where the game is about to yield big money), and 'big players' (players who move in with the expensive bets once a promising table has been identified). Ben is suddenly caught up in a world of glitz and glamour as the team work the Las Vegas casinos. he's having a blast, winning a fortune, and falling for the girl of his dreams - team-member Jill (Kate Bosworth). But trouble brews on the horizon as old-school security expert Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gradually latches onto the team's scam..Based on the Ben Mezrich book Bringing Down The House, the film is generally quite believably plotted. It only really slips into moments of unpersuasiveness when melodrama and clichés take over (e.g the somewhat fanciful love scene between Ben and Jill; the contrived 'sting' planned by Cole Williams to nail his longtime nemesis Mickey Rosa; etc.) It's nice to see a clutch of personable new stars coming through in a film like this, even if the script doesn't place huge demands on their acting ability. Spacey and Fishburne are the older, more experienced hands on deck, and they do their thing with an air of confidence and professionalism. The book-ends of the films - during which Campbell tries to 'dazzle' a Harvard interviewer with the story of his gambling adventures  are a bit forced and obvious and, if I'm honest, irritated me a little. But, on the whole, '21' is entertaining stuff. you could certainly do a lot worse.",6,1,2,11 December 2008
North by Northwest," One of my absolute favourites!
","North by Northwest will need no introduction to most movie-goers. It's a classic, greatly admired by audiences and critics alike. The story about a befuddled ad-executive fleeing from spies and the police (the spies want him dead because he knows of their plot, the police want him captured because they think he's behind a murder) is done at a breakneck pace and deals with Hitchcock's most frequently used theme: an innocent man on the run.Cary Grant is urbane and smooth as the hero. James Mason oozes silky menace as the principal villain (Martin Landau also plays a villain, giving his character a seriously nasty toughness). Eva Marie Saint is simply fabulous as the woman whose loyalties seems torn between good and bad.The set pieces are rightly considered to be moments of cinematic genius. Grant's escape from a crop-duster; the fight atop Mount Rushmore; the auction house bluff; the drunken car journey; the murder at the UN building.... each scene is brilliantly devised by script writer Ernest Lehmann and just as brilliantly filmed by director Hitchcock. Everyone should see this movie... it's a masterpiece.",Null,3,4,15 January 2003
Apocalypse Now," A hugely important and hypnotic film, like a compelling nightmare from which you cannot awaken.
","Apocalypse Now is a stunning film on many levels, and a film that reverberates long after the viewer has come away from it. Visually remarkable, thematically frightening, filled with haunting and dream-like sequences that show the horror and insanity of war in intense detail, it is a film that can be watched and re-watched endlessly without ever failing to throw up new surprises. It was greeted with huge controversy when released in 1979, and almost thirty years on remains as powerful an experience. One thing that has altered over the years is the critical reaction to Marlon Brando's performance as the renegade Colonel Kurtz. Initially, Brando's performance was heavily criticised for being impenetrable and inscrutable (it didn't help that he arrived on set overweight and unprepared), but over the years the cleverness of his interpretation of Kurtz has become more apparent. Kurtz is a man alternately psychotic and eccentric, and always dangerous, and in retrospect Brando's bizarre approach to the role captures the character's insanity quite ingeniously. Those who complain they cannot understand what Kurtz is talking about in the film's final scenes are missing the point - he is lost in his own phantasmagoria and we are not meant to understand his demented ramblings.The story, an updated and relocated adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, deals with an emotionally-scarred Special Services soldier, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is instructed to travel upriver into Cambodia on a highly dangerous mission. It seems that a once brilliant colonel, named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), has retreated into the deepest jungle and formed a private army of Montagnard warriors. Quite mad, yet totally influential, Kurtz sends his loyal followers on horrific genocide missions and lords over them like some self-appointed God. Willard's job is to find and eliminate the colonel, an unsound and embarrassing thorn in the side of the American war effort. On his perilous journey to Kurtz's lair, Willard undergoes various surreal and horrifying adventures, the most remarkable of which is a helicopter attack on an enemy village led by the deranged Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who likes the play The Ride Of The Valkyries on loudspeakers during his airborne raids because 'his boys love it..... and it scares the hell out of the gooks!'The film was a real ordeal to make. The shoot in the Phillipines spiralled over budget and took an unprecedented length of time to complete. A typhoon destroyed much of the equipment and the sets; Sheen suffered a near-fatal heart attack despite only being in his 30s. But the decision by Coppola to make the film under such authentic conditions, with no studio filming or special effects trickery, ultimately pays off. This is war like never before seen on film. Nihilistic, horrifying, destructive, pointless, perversely exciting and shockingly brutal. The much-criticised ending, with its heavy symbolism and (pretentious?) ambiguity, has frequently been viewed as the film's main flaw. But in all honesty, was there any other way to end a film of this nature? Would a nice, neat ending in which the loose ends are tidily tied together really fit in a film which goes so far out of its way to blur conventions, morals and reality? Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece - a challenging, unflinching, thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness which asks many disturbing questions but refuses to yield any easy answers.",10,3,3,1 August 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well made and compelling (but needless) remake of a Swedish crime thriller.
","The Girl With The Dragoon Tattoo (2011) is a direct translation of a 2009 Swedish movie starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace, based on a smash hit bestseller by the late Steig Larsson. It's quite sad in some ways that so many English-speaking viewers have a near-xenophobic attitude towards subtitled movies, necessitating Hollywood's fascination with remaking anything and everything that has been a hit on the continent. All too often, these Hollywood revamps fail to live up to their foreign source material, leaving one to ponder whether the whole remake game is really worthwhile at all. Although this version sticks very closely to the Swedish original – so closely, in fact, that it is essentially a re-run in terms of plot and narrative – it is done with enough energy and esprit de corps by director David Fincher to emerge a very commendable remake indeed, certainly one of the best in recent memory.Journalist Michael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) runs Stockholm-based magazine Millennium, which has just been crippled after losing a libel case against a corrupt businessman. Facing the loss of his business and all his life-savings, Blomkvist gets an unexpected chance at redemption when he is summoned by aging tycoon Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to the remote northern island of Hedeby to help solve an old family mystery. Forty years earlier, Henrik's niece Harriet vanished under mysterious circumstances and has long been assumed dead. However, every year Henrik receives for his birthday a framed flower like the ones Harriet used to make for him, sent anonymously from an undisclosed location. He has long suspected that Harriet was murdered by a family member on that fateful day forty years ago, and believes the murderer is sending the flowers in an effort to drive him to despair. Blomkvist is hired to delve into the mystery, coming at it with a fresh pair of eyes. To aid him in his quest, he enlists Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a bisexual, computer hacking cyber punk who happens to be a surveillance whiz with a photographic memory. Comrades between the sheets as well as in their quest for the truth, Blomkvist and Salander soon discover their lives are in danger as they close in on a very perverted serial killer indeed.Whichever version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo you watch first is likely to be your favourite, simply because the story relies on surprise revelations and a handful of powerful shock scenes for its effect. Both versions generate a compelling and utterly absorbing mystery, benefiting hugely from authentic Swedish location work and the cunningly twisty narrative. In this one, Craig is extremely good as Blomkvist, giving perhaps his most admirable performance to date. The real scene stealer though is Mara, suggesting quiet torment and rage as the weird but resourceful heroine. It's a difficult role, calling for some very frank scenes to say the least, including one of the most graphic rapes ever seen in a mainstream movie. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is slightly overlong and the journey to the denouement is ultimately more gripping than the solution itself, but overall it is a very well made and compulsively watchable thriller. Remaking a movie two years after the original may seem pretty pointless, but if it must be done then at least Fincher does it with his usual provocative panache.",8,4,9,10 April 2012
Rocky IV," A film so silly and unbelievable that it actually rises above criticism on normal terms.
","The fourth Rocky movie retreats into a realm of fantasy that has to be seen to be disbelieved. It is by far the dumbest movie in the series, with a plot that defies credibility, and a closing boxing match that would surely prove fatal for both fighters if a contest like it were to take place in real life. What the film has in its favour is a sense of courage in its own absurdity. It's like everybody involved knows that they're working on something ludicrous, but they give it their all anyway  the actors, the cinematographer, the composer, the editor and the director all pull in the same direction, united in some kind of cheerful conviction that they can make an enjoyable movie from this silliest of premises.Life is good for boxing champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He has a mansion, he has money, he has incredible public support and he has the all-important heavyweight champion of the world title. But news is spreading fast that there might be a better boxer on the face of the planet in the shape of Russian goliath Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Drago comes to America for an exhibition match against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), once Rocky's greatest adversary and now Rocky's greatest friend. The match is supposed to be a straightforward contest for Creed, giving him a chance to reassert himself as a top fighter, but it goes terribly wrong when Drago literally pulverises his opponent and kills him in the ring. Distraught at the death of his buddy, Rocky agrees to fight Drago. The venue: Moscow. The date: December 25th. In the middle of desolate northern Russia, Rocky trains for the fight of his life against a near-superhuman opponent. Not only is the honour of his dead friend at stake, but so is his life. not to mention the hopes of every man, woman and child from the free world! It seems kind of wrong for a Rocky movie to go all political on the audience, but Rocky IV indirectly does just that. Rocky's closing speech is a cringe-worthy plea for tolerance and change amongst the different societies of our world, and if I hadn't heard it with my own ears I would scarcely have believed anyone could put such infantile politics on film. The movie is much better when it concentrates on the sport aspects, especially the pulsating training sequences. With rapid-fire editing and rousing music, these parts of the film are quite inspirational and make you want to get out of your chair and put yourself through your paces in a gym as soon as possible! The final fight itself is a pretty exciting sequence but, given the fact that the film shows us that Drago has an impossibly strong punching-power, one finds it rather hard to believe that Rocky could still be standing after fifteen seconds let alone fifteen rounds. Rocky IV is totally unrealistic, totally simple-minded. and totally entertaining if you look upon it as a guilty pleasure!",5,28,54,31 January 2007
Face_Off," Outrageous actioner, with a lunatic plot that is actually quite refreshing.
","By 1997, the action genre was looking a little stale. The biggest problem was that each new action movie that came along was trying to out-bang the one before. There's only so far you can go with spectacular stunts and explosions. There has to come a point when you hit a kind of ceiling and the only direction left is back down. By 1997 action movie makers had hit this ceiling and were merely churning out film after film that had virtually the same plot. The actors and the backgrounds may have varied from movie to movie, but the general essence remained identical - and therein lay the staleness. That's why Face/Off is such an enjoyable action movie. It manages to sock across a new plot - something different to the norm, something not seen before - and the result is a sense of freshness that is rare for the genre.Special agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is devastated when his young son Michael is killed by a sniper's bullet meant for him. The sniper was psycho Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage), and Archer subsequently dedicates his life to tracking down and nailing this rotten villain. After many years, Archer finally catches up with his nemesis at an L.A. airfield. The encounter ends with Castor being thrown into a wall by the force of a jet engine, an event which leaves him in a coma. All is not as well as one might expect, as before being rendered comatose Castor planted a time bomb, capable of vaporising everything within a square mile, somewhere in the city. The only person who knows the location of the bomb is Castor's paranoid, imprisoned brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), but with his big brother indefinitely unconscious there seems no hope of Pollux giving away his secret. Archer is persuaded to undergo radical surgery that will allow him to look like Castor - to literally 'wear' his body and face - so that he can go to jail posing as Troy, and get the truth out of unsuspecting Pollux. But the plan backfires when Archer (now, bizarrely, played by Cage) is undercover in prison.... for the real Castor (now played by Travolta) comes out of his coma and turns the table on his adversary. The good guy is trapped in jail and the only people who know his true identity are killed; meanwhile the bad guy is out on the streets being hailed by everyone as a national hero!Face/Off is totally absurd, but a lot of fun. The absurdness is almost deliberate, like an outrageous catalyst used to kick-start the ensuing proceedings. Cage and Travolta have a tremendous time aping each other's character once their 'faces' have been switched; Nivola is twitchy to a fault as Castor's hyper-anxious brother; and Joan Allen has a super role as Archer's understandably bewildered wife. John Woo orchestrates the action very cleverly, with his usual slow motion flourishes, and some hair-raising sequences. There are occasional talky moments that teeter somewhere between tedium and melodrama, but when the pyrotechnics take over Woo delivers the goods. Face/Off is a very enjoyable actioner, just outlandish enough to be an effective clichÃ©-breaker.",7,2,4,4 May 2006
Cross of Iron," Astounding!
","Cross of Iron is probably the second best film made by Sam Peckinpah, rivalled only by The Wild Bunch. It is a war film shich follows a unit of German soldiers as they escape from the front line as the Russians smash through their ranks. This was perhaps the most devastating line to be fighting on during World War Two, and as expected there is a lot of death and gore, not to mention filth, sweat and treachery.James Coburn plays a German soldier with an almost God-like air of invincibility about him. He is not a comic book creation, but a hardened soldier who terrifies everybody, including his commanding officers. Max Schell plays a commanding officer who wants an Iron Cross, despite the fact that he a coward, and will go to the most treacherous lengths to get it.This is an upsetting and unflinching film. It pre-dates Saving Private Ryan by two decades, yet is just as detailed and frightening, just as bloody, and maybe even better.Anyone yet to see Cross of Iron must do so as soon as possible. It is one of the great war films, and an unforgettably chilling experience.",Null,67,83,2 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A more 'grown-up looking' Harry Potter adventure, held back by lacklustre plot and over-active camera work.
","The third Harry Potter film has a better 'look' than the previous two. The colours and photography are much darker, presumably to reflect the darker turn taken by the story. It's clear that new director Alfonso Cuaron is intent on moving the series into a more grown-up, emotionally engaging, self-consciously moody realm of film-making. What lets Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban down is the absence of a truly compelling storyline (it hovers constantly on the verge of something really good, but never quite gets there). There's also an irritating over-emphasis on the camera work, more of which will be said later.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts, but things at the school are not at all well. A notorious prisoner, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban Prison and many fear that he will head for Hogwarts. Black has spent years imprisoned for being an ally of Voldemort (the bad wizard who murdered Harry's parents) and it is feared that he wants to track down Harry and kill him. Dementors, demon-like guardians from Azkaban, are placed around the school perimeters to intercept the escaped villain – yet they seem just as dangerous to the safety of the pupils, Harry most of all. Rather than sit around and wait for trouble to come to him, Harry tries to piece together more of the events that led to his parent's demise all those years ago, in the hope that something from his past will help him in his quest to stay alive.Like the previous two films, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is geared towards fans of the book more than casual viewers. There are occasional incidents and bits of dialogue that seem incoherent or flawed, yet those more familiar with the book seem able to fill in such gaps in narrative logic quite readily. On the positive side, though, there are favourable things to say about the film. Its dark mood is nicely maintained; the child actors finally seem to be getting better; there is a more fulfilling sense of character development; some of the plot developments are quite unpredictable. The film is certainly equal to – possibly a fraction better than – the first one, and considerably improves on the underwhelming number Two. One thing which really mars this film, though, is the restless camera work. In every shot – even a scene as mundane as a conversation or a lesson – the camera pans and zooms and prowls needlessly, to the point where it induces headaches. Photographer Michael Seresin has tried to be a little too showy for his own good, and the effect merely lessens one's enjoyment of the film.",6,3,4,24 August 2009
Aliens," Slam-bang sequel to 'Alien' which is possibly even better than its predecessor.
","'Aliens' is a terrific sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi shocker 'Alien'. This time around the director is James Cameron and unsurprisingly the emphasis has been shifted onto hardware, with a narrative that features a bunch of marines blasting aliens away with some awesome weaponry (whereas, in the earlier film, the emphasis was on jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments). In my opinion, 'Aliens' is actually slightly better than its predecessor because it is more visceral and urgent, and encourages more repeat viewings. Sigourney Weaver's character has evolved very appealingly too. In 'Alien' she acted like a victim and her quest was merely to escape from the whole ordeal in one piece; in 'Aliens' she is physically and mentally stronger and is quite prepared to take on the aliens, comforted with the knowledge that she has beaten them once before.57 years have elapsed since the events narrated in 'Alien' (1979). The one survivor of that ordeal - Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - has spent the intervening years in deep space hibernation aboard an escape pod from her old craft the Nostromo. She is found floating in space by a team of astronauts and awakened from her lengthy slumber. Ripley is distressed to discover that the planet LV 426 - where she and her crew-mates originally found the alien species - has been colonised while she has slept. However, communications have recently been lost with the people at the colony and there are mounting fears that they may have been attacked by another alien or aliens. A team of crack marines are readied to travel out to the colony to find out what has happened. Ripley warns them that they don't know what they're getting into, nor do they appreciate the deadliness of the foe they are going up against. Still plagued by nightmares of her previous encounter with the alien, Ripley decides that the only way to exorcise her demons is to go with the marines on this new expedition and confront the monster once again. The team have barely been on the planet five minutes before the full horror of what has taken place hits home.... only this time, rather than one alien, there are hundreds of them. Many of the marines are killed in the initial skirmish, leaving Ripley and the token survivors - plus a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), who lived on the colony before the aliens struck, and has somehow survived the annihilation - to defend themselves against near insurmountable odds.'Aliens' is an exciting and frequently frightening ride and the film that, after 'The Terminator', cemented Cameron's reputation as a film-maker of exciting ideas and technical chutzpah. The pace is superbly judged, with a long but worthwhile opening stretch that sets up the story and sketches in the characters, followed by about 90 minutes of non-stop suspense and drama. The actors have a ball with their macho heroics and quotable dialogue, especially Jenette Goldstein as a female marine named Vasquez who is arguably the toughest member of her unit. Cameron has always valued strong female characters in his movies, and the trio of Weaver, Henn and Goldstein really steal the show - and the action - from their male counterparts. The special effects hold up well even 20 years after the film's initial release, with convincingly scary and scaly aliens and bloody death scenes. The film builds to a now-legendary final showdown between Weaver and the mother-alien (the scene with the classic line: 'Get away from her, you bitch!') and is a thrilling experience virtually every step of the way.",9,0,1,4 January 2006
The Exorcist," Still the no.1 horror movie !
","The Exorcist still ranks in my top 100 films, and is by far thehighest ranked horror movie of the lot. It is far scarier than TheCurse of Frankenstein (another landmark horror movie) and stillbeats off all its imitations (including all of its sequels and naffrip-offs like The Devil Within Her). I can't make it clear in merewords just how spooked I was after seeing this film for the firsttime. I'm equally hard-pushed to describe how disturbing it is tosee a young girl possessed by the Devil, inflicting sexual pain onherself and spouting out obscentities. Any good horror film needsto make you think, make you believe and disturb you enough topush you out of your 'comfort' zone. This movie dfoes all of thosethings and a whole lot more. It is the yardstick by which I measureany modern horror film, and so far I have yet to see a film whichsurpassed it.",10,2,3,18 November 2002
Die Hard 2," Entertaining sequel.
","The original Die Hard wasn't the most plausible movie ever made, but it tried to rationalise some of its action and stunts. Die Hard 2: Die Harder completely does away with believability and goes for a comic-book level of reality. Of its type, it is an entertaining and well-made film. Fairly frequently you may find yourself groaning with despair at some of the unlikelihoods (for example, how long do those grenades take to detonate when the bad guys corner Willis in Esperanza's plane cockpit?), but the breathless pacing and spectacular set pieces should just about win you over enough to get a thumbs-up rating out of you. Story, as already mentioned, is pure fantasy. One year on from his escapades in Part One, John McClane (Willis) is awaiting the arrival of his wife's plane at Washington Dulles Airport. On the same evening a team of heavily armed, ruthlessly organised mercenaries, led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), seize control of the airport. Their objective is to liberate a Central American revolutionary named Esperanza (Franco Nero) who is being flown into Washington under armed guard. They threaten to start bringing down planes if anyone tries to foul up their elaborate plans. But of course, McClane - as we all know - is a dab-hand at thwarting terrorists, and once again he single-handedly takes them on. The film might have fared better were it not a Die Hard sequel. McClane wouldn't go through an ordeal like this twice in his lifetime, so immediately the film becomes a joke in terms of logic and feasibility. Also, there's a bit too much posturing. A good example is near the start when bad guy Sadler is practising his karate moves naked in front of a mirror, and also as the bad guys prepare to head off on their evil mission they march down a corridor in their headquarters, each man coming out of his room with ludicrously immaculate timing to join the back of the queue! However, Die Hard 2 makes up for its weaknesses on other levels. The set pieces are excellent, including a hair-raising plane crash, a snow-mobile chase and a fight on the wing of a moving aircraft. Similarly, the dialogue is well written, veering expertly between knowing humour and square-jawed declarations of courage. On the performance front, Dennis Farina steals the show, etching a memorable portrayal as an abrasive airport cop. Die Hard 2 asks for a massive suspension of disbelief. If you roll with it, you'll be entertained. If you take it too seriously, you'll end up shaking your head in despair.",6,1,2,17 June 2004
Independence Day," Corny, over-the-top space invasion film which is agreeably entertaining if you disengage the brain.
","The most curious thing about Independence Day is that it is structured very much like a disaster movie of the 1970s. For about an hour or so, disparate characters from varied walks of life are sketched in, then the big cataclysm takes place which draws them all together in a struggle for survival. This is exactly how films like Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake and The Towering Inferno were put together. The interesting slant with Independence Day is that it takes this 1970s disaster movie formula and fuses it with a genre that was at its most popular in the 1950s  the alien invasion story. With a mega budget, a cast of hundreds and state-of-the-art special effects, Independence Day is a box office juggernaut that brings out the best and worst of Hollywood movie-making. Corny, over-the-top and jingoistic one moment; exciting, entertaining and spectacular the next.A number of massive spaceships appear above several major cities around the world. Worldwide hysteria follows, with some people welcoming the extra terrestrial visitors with open arms while others fear that the end of life as we know it is imminent. American President Thomas J Whitmore (Bill Pullman) tries to keep everyone calm, promising to take a sensible and communicative approach towards the newcomers. Meanwhile, scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) breaks a code emanating from the alien spacecrafts and realises that they are co-ordinating an attack against the Earth. In a cataclysmic offensive, the great cities of the world are decimated by the aliens  the Empire State Building, the White House, airports, air bases, and city blocks are reduced to rubble during the systematic destruction. Ace US Air Force pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith) somehow survives a mid-air duel against an alien craft, and soon afterwards seeks refuge in the top-secret desert base Area 51. Here Hiller joins forces with Levinson, President Whitmore, and various others, and together they plan one final desperate roll of the dice in their bid to save the planet from the seemingly unstoppable invaders.It's simple to get carried away with Independence Day, especially when viewing it on the big screen. The epic scenes of destruction are done with such enthusiasm that it becomes very easy to sit back awestruck, enjoying the mindless spectacle of it all. (From a post-9/11 viewpoint, though, it's not quite such harmless fun to watch American landmarks crumbling to the ground). If you watch the film again afterwards, particularly on the small screen, some of its shortcomings are much more apparent. Things like the hopeless dialogue, the endless clichés, the non-stop jingoism surrounding American courage and ingenuity, and the largely wooden performances are a lot easier to spot second/third/fourth time around. But director Roland Emmerich is clearly having a great time with the cornball scenario - and during many sequences you can almost imagine him just to the left of the screen, rubbing his hands with glee and delighting in the sheer technical bravura of his simulated world destruction. It might be advisable to leave your brain in neutral.. but if you do just that, Independence Day hits the spot as exciting, escapist fun.",6,1,2,11 March 2007
1941," The poorest film Steven Spielberg has ever directed  a colossal mish-mash that has only curiosity value going for it.
","Steven Spielberg has spent the past three decades directing one successful movie after another. A look down his list of work would throw up titles like Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, E.T, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Jurassic Park, plus many other box office goliaths. What is more impressive still is the fact that many of his films are very good too. Not just box office successes, but genuinely well-made and well-crafted films. It is hard to think of many Spielberg films that are truly bad  some might mention Always, a somewhat soppy and forgettable love story from 1989, while others would opt for Hook, a rather over-glamorised revisit of the Peter Pan story made in 1991. But neither of these movies is actually BAD in the true sense of the word - just disappointingly average when compared to the director's better works. There is, however, one Spielberg film that fails in a spectacular way, one film so overblown, disorganised and clumsily structured that there might be proper reason to regard it a disaster. That film is 1941.America is thrown into panic when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour shortly before Christmas, 1941. On the Californian coast, people suddenly brace themselves for the possibility of a Japanese attack against their great coastal cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It is around this time that various people get caught up in adventures during one hectic night in LA. First, there's family man Ward Douglas (Ned Beatty), whose house overlooks the Pacific Ocean  he spends the entire evening engaged in a gunfight with a Jap submarine that surfaces in the bay opposite his home. Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) is captured by the same Japanese submariners and swallows a compass so that they cannot easily navigate their way back out to sea. Then there's crazy pilot Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi), who single handedly patrols the sky in his battered fighter plane, searching for enemy planes approaching the American coast. Meanwhile, young fast-food chef Wally Stephens (Bobby Di Cicco) spends the entire evening trying to win the affections of a young beauty, but faces stiff competition from the horny soldier Sitarski (Treat Williams); womanising army man Birkhead (Tim Matheson) lies his way into danger in order to impress a sexy female named Donna (Nancy Allen); and a couple of nitwits (Murray Hamilton, Eddie Deezen) spend the night on a fairground ferris wheel looking out for enemy planes and submarines in a foolhardy attempt to protect their country from an invasion.It's obvious just from the plot synopsis that 1941 is a cluttered, unfocused mess of a movie. There's too much going on  too many unrelated subplots and too many big actors in preposterously brief guest roles  for the film's own good. To further confound matters, Spielberg opts to present the film, in his own words, as a 'stupidly outrageous celebration of paranoia'. In other words, he has turned this plot in the unlikeliest of comedies. However, Spielberg's idea of comedy in this film is to throw as much broad slapstick and expensive destruction at the audience as he can. The non-stop obliteration of streets, buildings, vehicles and even fairground rides loses its ability to provoke laughter through sheer unrelenting repetition. Throughout his career Spielberg has often been criticised for being too sentimental, but in this film he goes completely the other way and creates a film that is, if anything, excessively destructive and anarchic. 1941 is a spectacular failure  worth seeing on a curiosity level, but certainly not interesting in any other way.",3,11,22,6 August 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," Could very well be the greatest film I've ever seen.
","Lawrence of Arabia is an outstanding film on every level. Performances, direction, music, cinematography, characterisation, costume design, editing and story-telling - all outstanding. Every shot is beautifully composed; not a word in the epic-length script is wasted; and Peter O'Toole as the titular character gives the greatest performance that I've ever seen given by any actor, at any time, in any film. The film is also remarkable for the level of planning and preparation required to pull off the more spectacular scenes (no CGI back in 1962, remember, so every one of the thousands of extras on screen - even the ones in the distant background - are there for real). I learnt recently that if this film was made nowadays exactly as it was back then, the cost would be close to $300,000,000.Cairo: 1916. The British Army show interest in various Arab uprisings against the Turks around the Middle East. It seems presumable that if the disparate and disorganised Arab factions could be united, they could be fashioned into a force capable of denting the Turkish Army. Young, bored officer Lawrence (O'Toole) is ordered to contact the Arabs and to establish the feasibility of transforming their bickering tribes into a single fighting unit. Ambitiously - perhaps manipulatively - Lawrence intentionally exceeds his orders. He befriends Prince Faisal (Alec Guiness), Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), and Sheriff Ali Ibn El Kharish (Omar Sharif) - the main Arab figures in the region - and convinces them to pool their men and their resources in order to smash the Turks. Without authority, Lawrence leads his new guerrilla unit into battle - seizing Aqaba from the 'impossible' desert side; rolling on into Deraa so fast that the British Army can barely keep up; and ultimately capturing the prized city of Damascus. Along the way, he is captured and (sexually?) tortured by the enemy, emerging from his ordeal a cold, distant shell of his former self, but still driven to complete his incredible quest.This is an amazing film, and I refuse to take seriously anyone who proclaims themself a genuine film buff if they haven't seen it. Director David Lean weaves the story with assured skill, subtly showing Lawrence's evolution from a nondescript army officer, to an inspirational idealist, and finally to a blindly arrogant 'lost soul' who realises too late that his quest has robbed him of his humanity. Freddie Young's photography seems to focus in on every grain of desert sand and every nuance on the actors' faces. This is the best cinematography ever to grace a movie screen. The actors deserve every accolade that has been heaped upon them, but O'Toole in particular should be singled out. His Lawrence - clad in sweeping white robes, much to the chagrin of his stiff upper lipped superiors - has become an iconic screen character every bit as identifiable as King Kong atop the Empire State Building or Janet Leigh screaming in the shower. If this isn't the greatest film of all-time it's undoubtedly in the top five. How many other films can you name that are nearly four hours long and yet every second commands your attention (even during subsequent viewings)? It should be made a legal obligation to watch Lawrence of Arabia at least once in your lifetime, it really is THAT good.",10,5,10,26 January 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Contrived sequel with good effects and effective passages of excitement.
","This inevitable sequel to Jurassic Park is a pretty enjoyable movie with excellent special effects and frequent moments of tension. If you study the structure of the film closely, you'll notice that it not only presents itself as a sequel to the earlier film but also resembles a loose remake of King Kong. There are a few misjudgements in the movie, just little things that undermine the overall impact, but generally-speaking it hits its targets with the kind of slick, consummate efficiency that characterises most Steven Spielberg films.Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a survivor from the original adventure  see 'Jurassic Park',  is summoned by entrepreneur John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). Hammond confesses that a second genetically-engineered dinosaur island exists out in the Pacific. It seems that some of the breeding experiments for the original Jurassic Park were carried out on this other island, but scientists are baffled by the way the dinosaurs have flourished and somehow adapted to their habitat without any interference from mankind. A team of scientists is out on the island observing the dinosaurs for research purposes and Hammond wishes Malcolm to join them. Initially against the idea, Malcolm soon finds himself forced into it when he learns that his girlfriend Dr Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already out there leading the field study, blissfully unaware of the potential danger she faces. Malcolm heads out to join her and is relieved to find that so far everything on the island seems to be under control. Soon all that changes as a team of hunters turn up led by Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) and ace hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). The hunters are on a mission to capture various breeds of dinosaur and take them back to San Diego where a new Jurassic tourist attraction has been built. Malcolm's group face a perilous journey to escape from the island, but worse is to follow as the hunters foul-up their attempt to transport a living T-Rex into San Diego.Perhaps the main misjudgement with this film is the excessively contrived plot. It was virtually certain from the moment the first film was a smash hit at the box office that a sequel would turn up. But in order to provide this sequel with a basic storyline, too many unconvincing story elements have had to be constructed and too many improbable events and coincidences punctuate the film. The climactic sequence in which a T-Rex rampages through San Diego is also a step too far. The film ought to end when Malcolm's group escape from the island, but instead a 25-minute final sequence is tacked on. It's clear that this final sequence is intended to pay homage to King Kong, the ultimate prehistoric-monster-on-the-loose-in-modern-times story, but it jars with all that has gone before. Still, The Lost World: Jurassic Park has plenty to keep viewers entertained. The performances are very enjoyable, especially Goldblum and Postlethwaite, and the dinosaur effects are outstanding. Certain scenes are genuinely thrilling, especially during the section of the film set on the island. Moore's hair-raising escape from a trailer as it is attacked by a T-Rex on the brink of a cliff is real edge-of-the-seat stuff, while the heroes' final desperate effort to reach a rescue helicopter whilst pursued by velociraptors is similarly pulsating. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a slick, packaged, effortlessly watchable thrill-ride.",6,10,17,7 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Extraordinary!
","The Two Towers is actually a notch down from The Fellowship of the Ring, but make no mistake: it's still an extraordinary film. The first hour or so is just a teeny, tiny bit ponderous, but other than that the film is virtually perfect in every other way.The battle sequences are breathtaking. The battle at Helm's Deep contains copious blood-spilling and incredible special effects, making the audience believe beyond all doubt that 10,000 orcs are beseiging 300 weary warriors. In actual fact, most of what is on screen in computer enhanced, but it looks and sounds so much like a real battle that it's impossible to spot the difference.The performances are uniformly excellent. John Rhys-Davies, as Gimli the dwarf, seems a bit too broad and plays the part slightly too much for laughs. However, the rest of the cast rise to the wonderful script, etching out memorable performances. The Two Towers is easily the film event of its year, and it leaves me and millions more yearning for The Return of the King in 2003!",Null,0,0,13 January 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," Richly detailed account of a bungled bank heist - one of the great movies of American cinema.
","Dog Day Afternoon is a film of surprises. At no point does it play out like you expect it to. I came to the film anticipating it was going to be good, but expecting it to be good as a hostage siege thriller, or a heist caper, or maybe a typically gritty 70s crime drama. It isn't any of those things. In fact, it's hard to categorise Dog Day Afternoon at all, because it so skilfully fuses a vast array of conventions and themes, resulting in a film that is endlessly watchable and hugely rewarding. If it sounds like I'm using a lot of superlatives here that's because I am; Dog Day Afternoon is one of the great films of American cinema. As great as Lumet's masterpiece, Twelve Angry Men, I hear you ask? I'd have to say yes; both films pretty much equal each other in their brilliance.On a hot August afternoon, a trio of men enter the First Savings Bank in Brooklyn and proceed to rob the place at gunpoint. During the early moments of the heist, young Stevie (Gary Springer) loses his nerve and bails out, leaving Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to continue with their audacious raid. However, what should have been a lightning-fast robbery rapidly descends into a catalogue of errors. Firstly, the hapless robbers learn that there is almost no money in the bank as everything in the vault has already been collected. Then, Sonny attempts to burn some of the bank's paperwork only for the smoke to raise suspicions in the neighbouring businesses and it isn't long before the police arrive. Before they know it, Sonny and Sal are surrounded by hundreds of heavily armed police officers and their plight looks utterly hopeless. With a handful of oddball bank staff as hostages, the robbers attempt to negotiate with Det. Sgt Moretti (Charles Durning). As the evening wears on, more and more curious onlookers come along to watch the event as it unfolds, many of them chanting their support for Sonny and Sal, especially when it becomes clear that Sonny only ever wanted the money to pay for his gay lover's sex change operation. What was meant to be a straightforward crime suddenly becomes a media circus, and the two men at the centre of it are swept helplessly towards their fate.Dog Day Afternoon is impressive on so many levels, but probably best of all is the acting. Pacino is mesmerising as Sonny. His semi-improvisational dialogue, his jittery body language and those incredibly expressive eyes combine to create a remarkable screen character. In fact, throughout the entire film the characterisation is richly detailed and wholly believable, and all the actors come off exceptionally well. Lumet gets across the immediacy of the situation brilliantly, with moments of tension, despair, folly, bravado and even some absurdist humour. It has a relatively thin plot when you stop to think about it, but very early on in Dog Day Afternoon the importance of the story is sacrificed in favour of detail and character and beautifully understated social commentary. The whole film is a joy to watch – edgy and exciting film-making at its finest. In a decade that saw some truly amazing films, here's one that can hold its place with the best of them.",10,6,8,18 August 2011
Ghostbusters," Loud and brash supernatural comedy, greatly bolstered by in-form comic performances.
","A considerable box office hit in 1984, Ghostbusters is a simple-minded and very American supernatural comedy that provides quite a lot of entertainment if you don't expect anything too profound of it. This is a film that exists as enjoyment for its own sake  there is no wider intention beyond mixing laughter and spectacle in an appealing way. The film could have been instantly forgettable in less assured hands, but director Ivan Reitman deserves credit for pushing the right buttons. He is helped out immeasurably by the comic talents of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis  all four are in uncommonly good form throughout this film, and it's their funny interaction and clever sense of timing that makes numerous scenes stick long in the memory.Three parapsychologists are thrown off campus after bringing themselves into disrepute. Driven by unemployment to take drastic measures, they set up a ghost hunting business. The mismatched trio comprises of enthusiastic Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd), technical boffin Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), and incompetent faker Pete Venkman (Bill Murray) who has virtually no scientific understanding but coasts by pretending that he has. Under the name 'Ghostbusters', they prove a surprising success as they ride around New York responding to ghost sightings and capturing the spectral critters. One lady, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), phones them from a high-rise apartment block after undergoing a weird supernatural experience in her kitchen. When the Ghostbusters arrive, everything in her apartment is back to normal, but Venkman  ever the womaniser  takes a shine to their latest client. Only later does it become clear that Dana's apartment is built over an ancient gateway and is about to become the scene of an invasion of demonic forces. The Ghostbusters find the world turning to them to save the future of mankind when all the malevolent spirits converge.Murray makes the best of his role, using deadpan delivery to ensure his lovable liar is the film's most endearing character. Moranis comes a close second as Dana's hopelessly dim neighbour, a small insignificant mouse of a man who ends up working for the forces of evil after being possessed. The film relies heavily on special effects and, generally-speaking, they are cleverly done (especially for the time). In fact, the film was nominated for an Oscar for its Visual Effects. The ghosts blend fairly seamlessly into the live action, and characters like the destructive Slimer and the gigantic Marshmallow Man are brought inventively to life. The story (by Akroyd and Ramis) tends towards broad slapstick, but it's an epic sort of slapstick that takes the genre to staggering, destructive and spectacular levels. Murray does manage to sneak in a few sly, underplayed gags that are wittier than the demands of the film overall. In summary:- Ghostbusters is brash, broad, and overblown. but a lot of fun!",6,6,11,13 September 2007
The Hurt Locker," Immersive, exhilarating war movie - truly terrific stuff.
","A stunning war film which reflects on the 'drug of war' – that is, the addiction that some soldiers develop towards living on the edge in a combat situation – The Hurt Locker is intense, dynamic and brilliantly handled. Scripter Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski aim for a 'high-anxiety' approach, making virtually every moment of the film raw and visceral. The potential for one of the characters to be blown to smithereens at any given moment hangs over the story throughout, generating non-stop tension. Shot in Jordan, sometimes on locations less than three miles from the Iraq border, the film creates a very immersive and authentic view of the situation in Iraq. Barry Ackroyd's cinematography has a documentary-like feel, using multiple angles to capture the immediacy of the moment. The boiling tension, the paranoia and fear of imminent death, the irrational suspicion that everyone around might be a potential enemy – it's all here, perfectly captured and tapped into with relentless skill for maximum suspense.The story opens with Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson (Guy Pearce) attempting to defuse an explosive device in a busy Baghdad street. His attempt fails and he is killed when the bomb is triggered by remote control. We then learn that Bravo Company have 38 days left in Iraq before they can go home. Thompson's surviving team members – Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) – are given a new team leader to work alongside for the remainder of their rotation. The new man is experienced battle veteran and bomb disposal expert Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner). The story occasionally 'catches up' with James, Sanborn and Eldridge during selected days of their remaining time in Iraq. It is immediately obvious that there is tension within the team, since James is incredibly reckless as an individual, and frequently risks the life of his comrades in his pursuit of a combat situation 'rush'. Their experiences include defusing several bombs; running into a team of private mercenaries and assisting them in a lengthy gun battle; discovering a warehouse where a child has been mutilated and had a bomb surgically implanted in his chest; and trying to save an Iraqi civilian who has multiple timed explosives padlocked all over his body.By casting several then-unknown actors as the main characters, Bigelow generates huge tension. We see early on the expected 'stars' of the film (like Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes) being killed off relatively soon into their roles, so it becomes very hard to anticipate how, if at all, the more unfamiliar faces will make it to the end of the movie. Renner is especially fine in his role as the maverick life-gambler for whom war is everything – he's far from likable, and can be a real a-hole at times, but seems a remarkably real character one that is genuinely multi-dimensional and true to his own inner workings. What The Hurt Locker achieves above all else is that rarest of combinations in modern- day cinema – intense action and brains. You come away from The Hurt Locker caring, feeling and thinking about what you've seen very much indeed. What must it be like as a soldier serving in such a hostile, alien environment? What must it be like being native to a country and having foreign soldiers armed to the teeth walking down your street? How can you trust anyone when the stakes are so high? Yet how could you live with a mistake if you failed to trust someone you should have? How would you handle being so near to potential death day in, day out? Does the film make you long for the 'drug of war' or desperately afraid of it? Put simply, The Hurt Locker is a masterpiece.",10,2,4,13 January 2014
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Generally a fun film, with a refreshingly original plot.
","The most impressive thing about Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is that its plot is refreshingly original. Hollywood cartoons of late have been predictable, bland and boringly alike. It has been left to others – most significantly the Japanese – to produce animated movies with any kind of vision or innovation about them. So, it comes as a huge relief that Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs manages to tell a new, wacky, totally off-kilter story with a fair degree of verve. The film still has some weaknesses – hence the score of 6 – but at least the storyline is not one of them.Eccentric child Flint (voice of Bill Hader) wants more than anything to be a great inventor, even though most of his projects end in disaster. His father Tim (voice of James Caan) is a more practical, down-to-earth type who thinks his son should stop dreaming of wacky inventions and get a proper job. Tim arranges for Flint to start working in his fishing tackle store, but Flint still harbours dreams of building a revolutionary machine that can create food by converting water molecules into edible products. Flint builds his machine, but a freak accident results in it being launched into the clouds. Pretty soon it is reacting with the moisture in the clouds, causing crazy storms in which food falls from the sky rather than raindrops. To begin with, everyone finds these culinary storms funky and exciting, but soon bigger and bigger objects are falling from the heavens. Steaks that crush houses, burgers that flatten towns – Flint realises that his food-creating machine is out of control, creating pieces of food so big they could soon destroy the world! Aided by pretty journalist Sam Sparks (voice of Anna Faris), Flint races to save the planet from the massive food storms that jeopardise the future of human existence.First of all, what do I like about this movie? Already I've said quite a lot about the inventive plot. Besides that the voice acting is generally entertaining, with particular kudos going to James Caan and Mr. T, both of whom create memorably eccentric and funny characters. The animation is pretty dazzling too, with vibrant colours and effects.. What don't I like about the film? Perhaps the biggest let-down is that in the end the film falls back onto the disappointingly conventional and sentimental theme of father-son bonding. After all the imagination and invention that has gone into the story, it seems a shame that the makers then bring their resolution down to yet another example of cinematic moralising, as the dysfunctional father and son 'find' each other. Also, the film's climax goes on and on and on, rather out-staying its welcome and resulting in a sense of overkill. On the whole though Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a fun film, definitely above average and definitely worth watching if only to admire its originality. It's just a shame it succumbs to preachy moralising at the end.",6,0,1,11 June 2010
Kelly's Heroes," Under-rated wartime caper.
","Clint Eastwood reunites with his Where Eagles Dare director Brian G. Hutton for another improbable but entertaining WWII caper. Kelly's Heroes has its moments of wartime spectacle and lots of slambang action, but it also has plenty of comedy thrown in. Many critics judged the film quite harshly, groaning about how it is inappropriate for a film to mix jokes and war. But in truth, Kelly's Heroes never pretends to be a serious wartime account - and the humorous undercurrent helps the film rather than hampering it.A bunch of American GIs are given a few days away from the battlefront during WWII. However, they are not overly impressed with the quiet, excessively peaceful and 'boozeless' village where they've been told to relax. One member of the group, Kelly (Eastwood), has learned of a fortune in Nazi gold bullion hidden away in a bank in a German-occupied town some thirty or more miles behind enemy lines. He tells the other guys about it, and they decide to risk their lives to get hold of the hoard. Of course, pulling off a bank robbery is no easy task at the best of times, but when the bank is so far into enemy territory......Eastwood is suitably laid-back here, but the real stars of the show are Telly Savalas (dynamic and hilarious as Big Joe) and Donald Sutherland (a hippy tank driver so chilled-out he's happy to eat cheese, drink wine and sunbathe in the middle of a chaotic battle!) The pyrotechnics are well-orchestrated, and Troy Kennedy Martin invests the script with the kind of amusing banter and thrilling set pieces that he gave to The Italian Job a year earlier. Kelly's Heroes is totally unsubtle and totally removed from reality - but what it lacks in tact it makes up for with spectacular destruction and bags of entertainment.",7,35,50,8 September 2004
Donnie Brasco," An absorbing, well made gangster movie.
","Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of 'Donnie Brasco' and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing.",Null,90,101,17 September 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Outrageous, intentionally trashy comedy-horror-thriller.
","In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film 'Psycho'. Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to 'Night Of The Living Dead'! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies, and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones, so they seize a family travelling in a RV - ex-preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Scott (Ernest Liu) and Kate (Juliette Lewis). After a palm-sweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point, a raunchy biker-/trucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hell-bent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive, but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of super-strong blood-sucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An all-out gore-fest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar, tongue-in-cheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his real-life pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here, delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasies of tough kids, adding heaps of bad language, gore, nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good, with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left, right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited star-making performance, while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly, Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simple-minded violent action with panache. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a raucous, self-indulgent action/comedy/road movie/horror flick - crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make, and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.",6,11,16,19 August 2007
Clash of the Titans," Shallow retelling of the Perseus & Andromeda myth, all special effects and no soul.
","This new version of Clash Of The Titans is a special effects movie – the problem is that beyond the special effects it has nothing to offer. No characterisation, no interaction, no sense of wonder and – worst of all – no evident narrative. The whole thing plays out like a series of random action sequences, with the deeper story that should link these sequences together completely left out. The 1981 version may have been childish and rather wooden, but at least it had characters worth caring about and unfolded in a way that was involving for the audience. That's what is lacking here – a sense of involvement. The incredible effects dazzle the eye but fail to engage the brain. Nor does it help that the Greek myth of Perseus and Andromeda has been altered so dramatically – why do contemporary film-makers insist on arrogantly rewriting things that have stood the test of time for centuries?Rescued as a baby from a floating coffin, Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up believing he is a fisherman. Only later does he learn that he is, in fact, the son of Zeus. Following the death of his family Perseus arrives in the sinful city of Argus, just as the citizens are being encouraged by their monarchy to denounce the Gods. Angry Zeus (Liam Neeson) sends down his black-hearted brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to restore order Hades promptly threatens to unleash the Kraken upon the city, unless the citizens sacrifice their princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). A small group of hardy soldiers set off on a quest, reluctantly joined by Perseus, to find a way of saving themselves and their princess.There's really not much to add to what I've already said about this would-be epic. The performances barely matter when the emphasis is so obviously on the visual effects – beyond running, jumping, falling and fighting the lead actors have precious little to do. Worthington's accent wobbles between stiff English and Aussie brogue, but most of the time he just has to indulge in heroic posturing. It's quite galling to see the more distinguished talents of Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Pete Postlethwaite wasted in glorified cameo appearances. The cleverest touch in the whole film is when Perseus picks up a metallic owl and asks 'What is this?'. 'Just leave it' replies a soldier with a rueful shake of the head. Those who remember the 1981 version will recognise the owl as one of Ray Harryhausen's many creatures that assist Perseus in his quest. A rare moment of wit in a largely shallow, forgettable and uninspired special effects farrago.",3,4,5,2 October 2010
Victory," Unusual but only partially successful
","Victory (a.k.a Escape to Victory) is an unusual film, combining a wartime setting with a story about a football match. It sounds like a lot of fun, but is actually pretty boring for a good deal of the running time. However, at the end it livens up considerably with a well staged and exciting sequence in which the football match takes place.It is a miscast film for sure. Sylvester Stallone as the goalkeeper, Michael Caine as an ex-England and West Ham player and Max von Sydow as a sympathetic Nazi are less than convincing choices. The story hinges on a less than believable scenarion that the PoWs persuade the German government to let them play an exhibition match against a professional German team. The PoWs use the match as a cover for an escape attempt, while the Germans use it as a publicity stunt to emphasise German superiority. On the whole, the story is hard to take seriously and it's probably best if you don't. Just sit back and try to enjoy it. As dull as the opening scenes are, they are probably just about worth enduring for the final match.",Null,0,3,15 January 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Fierce, disturbing, thought-provoking satire.
","Stanley Kubrick takes an allegedly unfilmable novel by Anthony Burgess and transforms it into one of the great masterpieces of cinema. What, exactly, is A Clockwork Orange? A sci-fi social study? A fiercely thought-provoking and disturbing black comedy? A prescient warning of where society is headed? A criticism of how the law deals with crime and criminals? The list could go on and on, for the film could indeed be described as many things. But whichever way one chooses to approach the film, one thing is certain: it is without doubt one of the most uncompromisingly challenging examinations of the many faces of violence ever made. Where lies the attraction of violence, what are the consequences of violence, is there a solution to violence? It would be easy to expect a glib and sentimental answer to such questions, perhaps some comfortable conclusion that even the most evil of individuals is good at heart. But A Clockwork Orange avoids sentimentality and glibness and comfortable conclusions. This is a chilling film which points out that a solution to one evil is very often the evolution of another.In a dystopian society of the very near future, youths calling themselves Droogs gets their kicks out of sadistic crime. One gang led by the clever but thoroughly nasty Alex (Malcolm McDowell) entertain themselves by assaulting an old tramp, breaking into a home and beating the man of the house before raping his wife, and driving like hooligans around country lanes, forcing other drivers off the road. One evening Alex forces his way into the house of a single woman and attacks her with a gigantic phallic ornament, eventually killing her by smashing the pot penis over her head. But Alex is actually captured for this particular offence and sentenced to 14 years in a rehabilitation institution. Here, Alex learns to survive by faking sincerity and repentance. However, he learns of a radical new treatment for violent criminals, a controversial method of therapy in which the subject is put through a rigorous series of experiments that ultimately suppress their desire to act criminally. Sensing a chance of early release, Alex facetiously volunteers to undergo the treatment. But when the therapy is over, he finds that he has lost more than his violent tendencies  even his basic human thought processes, his ability to make moral choices, have been taken away too.McDowell gives a career-best performance as the sadistic narrator, terrifying in the film's horrific first half and oddly pitiable in the more philosophical second. His character is the fulcrum upon which the whole film depends  if his character doesn't work, then neither does the movie. Happily the actor passes with flying colours. Kubrick shoots each scene with characteristic meticulousness, generating horror when he wants horror, comedy when he wants comedy, and thought when he wants thought. The film's many images and philosophies resonate long afterwards, mainly due to the way Kubrick works them into our mind. A Clockwork Orange has a reputation for extreme violence (having been withdrawn by Kubrick himself for over twenty five years), but it is a more implied kind of violence rather than the visceral blood-spattering common to recent films. Much of what makes this film so disturbing takes place off screen, often in the viewer's own mind. It is a film to challenge our way of thinking, and as such a wonderfully provocative and worthwhile piece of cinema.",10,4,6,1 June 2007
Where Eagles Dare," A great wartime thriller
","Where Eagles Dare is simply wonderful. Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are in terrific form as leaders of a mission deep behind enemy lines. Their job: to infiltrate a mountain top castle and rescue an imprisoned American colonel. There's actually more to the mission than that, but to give away the twists would be to rob anyone who hasn't seen the movie of some wonderful surprises.The snowy backdrop is perfectly captured. The action sequences (of which there are many) are brilliantly staged, especially the fight atop the cable car, and the bus chase at the end. Each character is well cast, with Burton, Eastwood, Ure and Hordern giving commanding performances. Best of all is the little-known Derren Nesbitt who oozes menace and charm as a nasty Nazi soldier.I've seen this film countless times and it never tires me. It has so many twists and turns and well-execute sequences that it is gripping every time you watch it. There's really no other way to say it - you need to see this film and see it soon!",9,51,71,10 January 2003
Groundhog Day," Ingenious concept, enthusiastically presented.
","Bill Murray can be a very funny guy, especially when given roles where his character has a deliciously cruel edge. He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).Pittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.It seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.",8,151,213,9 September 2004
Reservoir Dogs," A ground-breaking thriller.
","Reservoir Dogs marks the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and is a smart, gutsy, original slant on a familiar story. Tarantino admitted that he wanted to focus on the events that would normally constitute the final ten minutes of a heist movie, and stretch them out so that the whole film revolves around them. He also admitted that he has no idea why he called the film Reservoir Dogs, though it seems to me to be a wink in the direction of Straw Dogs (another extreme film which pushed back a few moral boundaries twenty years earlier). The plot focuses on the aftermath of a bloody jewel heist. The would-be robbers meet at their agreed rendezvous point in a deserted warehouse. One, Mr. Orange (Roth) is bleeding from a bullet wound to the stomach. Another, Mr. Pink (Buscemi) is roaring and raging that he thinks the heist has been blown wide open by an informant. Then there's Mr. White (Keitel), a cool killer who believes in honour among thieves, who just wants to protect the survivors and get them out of there before the cops show up. But deadliest of all is Mr. Blonde (Madsen), a psychotic loose cannon who's abducted a cop from the crime scene and is prepared to do whatever it takes to find out if there really is a mole amongst the team. Tarantino has a fabulous eye for grim detail and a fabulous ear for believable dialogue. These guys swear a lot and chat about seemingly irrelevant things, but they sound every inch like a team of lethal jewel robbers. The ear-severing scene may have gone down in history as one of the the most horrific scenes ever witnessed, but it's power and impact are undeniable. However, Reservoir Dogs isn't good just because of some snappy interplay and a couple of powerful scenes. It's quality far exceeds that. The structure is very unorthodox and absorbing, while the predicament of the characters is conveyed with genuine excitement. We know from the start that Roth is the informant (the other thieves don't) and there's something moving and honourable bout the way he suffers in silence as the finger of blame shifts about among the bewildered crooks. Reservoir Dogs is an outstanding thriller, as challenging, disturbing and gripping as any film you'll ever see.",Null,1,3,13 November 2003
Pulp Fiction," Remarkable second feature from Quentin Tarantino - a masterpiece of dialogue, style and sheer story-telling chutzpah.
","For better or for worse, Pulp Fiction changed forever the cinematic landscape of its time, not to mention times thereafter. It was followed by a deluge of copycats and wannabes, none of which quite matched the staggering bravura of this film – we really are talking here about a movie which epitomises that old dictum 'the original and still the best'. In this nonlinear trilogy of gangland stories – stuffed to the brim with crackling dialogue, pop culture references, stylised gunplay and jet black humour – Quentin Tarantino delivers an audacious and endlessly watchable movie, at once rewriting and redefining the whole style of the crime genre.The first story deals with hit men Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) as they track down a briefcase full of 'something valuable', stolen from their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) by a group of young opportunists. Later that evening, against the advice of Jules, Vincent escorts Marcellus's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), on a dinner date which spirals out of control with almost tragic consequences. The second story follows down-at-heel boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) who has been bribed by Marcellus to throw a fight. Butch doesn't keep his end of the bargain, pummelling his opponent to death in the ring before making a hasty getaway. Later, Butch attempts to flee from the city but first needs to retrieve a family heirloom – a precious watch – from his apartment. His attempts to recover the watch set into motion a crazy chain of events involving rednecks, gimp masks and a samurai sword! The third and final thread jumps back in time and follows Jules and Vincent once more, this time showing how they make a thorough hash of bringing in one of the young dudes who attempted to steal Marcellus Wallace's fortune. With an unexpected corpse on their hands, they need help from 'cleaner' The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to mop up their little problem. And even then, their eventful day is far from over as, next, they inadvertently get caught up in an impromptu coffee shop heist masterminded by Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer).While the narrative structure of Pulp Fiction is devilishly clever, the plot itself doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. The plot merely provides a backdrop against which the characters can interact – the film generates infinite fascination in its rich yet random conversations, where the characters chat casually about things like foot massages, European fast food joints, classic TV shows, piercings and why pigs are filthy animals, plus much, much more. Whatever else you say about Tarantino, he's the best there is when it comes to writing terrific passages of dialogue – there's nothing in cinema quite like a Tarantino conversation. Choosing a favourite performance from the remarkable ensemble work is almost impossible; everyone is in dynamic form, though it is perhaps Jackson, as the bible-bashing, smart-mouthed hit-man Jules, who leaves the most lasting impression. His career post- Pulp Fiction has been, quite simply, a twenty year success story. There's an abundance of terrific individual scenes too – the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which Vincent saves Mia from a drug overdose; the clean-up of Marvin's corpse after being accidentally shot by Vincent; Christopher Walken's unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of Butch's gold watch It would take too long to list all of the film's many wonderful vignettes; let's just say it overflows with great moments. Different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. If Reservoir Dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in Tarantino, Pulp Fiction marks a quantum leap in style, control and story-telling bravado. It remains a brilliant film, only Tarantino's second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best.",10,1,3,26 March 2014
Les Misérables," Powerful and mostly excellent adaptation of a mammoth stage production.
","There was talk of a big-screen adaptation of Cameron Mackintosh's show Les Misérables for decades, but the project hit difficulties in the '90s and it seemed it would never happen. Some estimates suggest that as many as 60 million have seen the show around the world, so it was inevitable the proposed film would rear its head once more sooner or later. In 2012 it made it to the big screen a huge, lavish, spectacularly assembled vision of the story from director Tom Hooper, with a colossal $60,000,000 budget at his fingertips and a cast of heavyweight actors in the lead roles. With so much expectation upon its shoulders and so many challenges to be overcome in execution, does Les Misérables pull it all off? The answer is a resounding yes - this is a splendid film, one of the very best of its year in fact. Convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) endures nineteen years of miserable imprisonment after being caught stealing a loaf of bread. When his time is up, he is released by ruthless prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe) and told to keep to the strict conditions of his parole or else be brought back to jail at once. After unsuccessfully attempting to steal some silverware from a preacher (Colm Wilkinson), Valjean looks destined to a swift return to life in shackles. He is offered an unexpected reprieve when the preacher lies on his behalf, claiming to the police that he gave the silverware to Valjean and that it wasn't stolen at all. Touched by this act of kindness, Valjean vows to change his ways and his life for ever more. He skips parole and heads off to begin anew Javert meanwhile swears to hunt him down, no matter how far he must go or how long it will take. The rest of the film traces Valjean's adventures over the next few decades, with Javert entering the picture from time to time to force him to flee for his life. Valjean ends up helping a dying prostitute, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), by saving her illegitimate daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) from a life of misery and raising her as his own. He also helps a number of young French revolutionaries in their fight against government soldiers. One of the young revolutionaries, Marius (Eddie Redmayne), is madly in love with the grown-up Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and Valjean determines to make it his last duty to protect him from harm so that they may live in happiness.Les Misérables is exhausting in many ways, putting its audience through an emotional wringer before the credits roll. It is, however, a very well-made movie, sticking closely to the show while 'opening out' its stagebound source very effectively. Epic widescreen shots combine with intense close-ups, making the story grander in conception than the stage version whilst allowing the actors to show far more via facial expression than is ever possible on stage. The stage version relies on the songs to convey much of its feeling; in the film the camera is able to linger on faces, capturing the many subtle nuances the actors lend to their characters. Jackman is excellent as Valjean (this is his best performance to date); Crowe struggles slightly with the singing aspects of his Javert role but more than compensates in conveying the dogged determination of the character. Hathaway's fifteen minute turn as Fantine is also excellent. The weakest aspect of the film is a slight sag in the middle. The section detailing preparations for the Parisian revolution is a little over-cooked, while the romance between Marius and Cosette is unpersuasive in its suddenness. The same segment is the weak link in the stage show too, and this film version is unable to correct the flaw. It is, however, a minor flaw. Overall Les Misérables is a cracker – a moving, triumphant, powerful cinematic experience.",9,1,2,29 December 2013
Titanic," First half is slushy and unconvincing love story. Second half is an extraordinary and powerful sinking sequence.
","Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancée, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichéd love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",7,7,15,7 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Perfectly watchable kid's film but hardly the stuff of cinematic gold.
","Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left as a baby at the house of his relatives, the Dursleys. Later we learn that his parents were magicians killed by a dark sorcerer, and he has been hidden away for his own protection until he is older. Eventually the time comes for Harry to discover his destiny. He is tracked down by the friendly giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and sent to Hogwarts, a special school of Witchcraft and Wizardry for youngsters with magical prowess. Everyone at Hogwarts, the fellow pupils and the teachers – seems to know about Harry's past, even though he himself knows barely any of it. Harry befriends two other first year students – Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) – and begins to learn the art of wizardry from various eccentric teachers. Things take a darker turn when the three young magicians begin to suspect that Voldemort, an evil figure from Harry's past, is trying to regain his once-great power and strength by obtaining the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful object hidden somewhere at the school.The film is not particularly well-acted, with the child stars coming across as if they are carrying out a reading rehearsal, and too many star names (Julie Walters, John Hurt, John Cleese, Zoe Wanamaker) hamming it up like mad in cameo roles. At least the main adult roles – taken by the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris – are played with a degree of experience and finesse. There are some splendid visuals in parts, though the effects are not so impressive during the much-hyped Quidditch sequence. The most disappointing thing for me is the long and laborious build-up, which leads to a somewhat flat final confrontation (I am reliably informed by those in the know that this film's climax is intentionally brief and aborted, and links to developments in the later films). Overall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a reasonable watch, but I'm hoping for something more as the series progresses.",6,2,4,29 July 2009
The Untouchables," Very well-made gangster thriller, with the usual 'show-off' De Palma flourishes.
","The Untouchables is a well-made, well-acted gangster story from director Brian (Scarface) De Palma. One thing you can virtually always guarantee from a De Palma movie is flamboyance, and this is no exception. Not content with a compelling story, the director has thrown in a series of his typically bravura set pieces, the best of which is a truly outstanding railway station shootout. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed. Most of the city cops either haven't realized it's happening or have chosen to turn a blind eye. Ness soon learns that the criminal underworld is controlled by ruthless gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro), who men on both sides of the law fear to tackle. Aided by a trusty band of three loyal pals, Irish cop Malone (Sean Connery), suave George Stone (Andy Garcia), and reliable Oscar Wallace (C.M Smith), Ness wages war on Capone and his gangland cronies. While other law enforcers pretend nothing is going on, Ness and his men swoop into action against the smugglers, bootleggers, and gunmen terrorising the city streets. Capone is not pleased - he turns his attention to stamping out these troublesome law enforcers who have put a dent in his lucrative criminal empire.Unsurprisingly, the acting here is high-class. Costner does what's required as Ness, but Connery and De Niro go a few steps further. Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme). Also memorable is Billy Drago as Capone's most psychopathic henchman Frank Nitti (not only does he get some powerful scenes; he also dies the most extraordinary death in the whole film). De Palma provides numerous flashy sequences, including a smuggling raid on the US-Canadian border, the rooftop skirmish between Ness and Nitti, and the afore-mentioned railway sequence. Ennio Morricone's music score is exciting and well-suited to the events on screen. There are occasional misjudgements, like Connery's ludicrously prolonged slaying (any more bullets and he's be a walking hunk of lead) and some slushy 'family' interludes with Ness which are intended to show his loving, caring side but which only interfere with the proceedings. On the whole, though, The Untouchables is a fine movie which probably represents De Palma's best work of the '80s.",8,18,30,1 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Disappointing sequel with too many plot holes and a lot of indifference in the script and direction.
","It must be rather relaxing to be a writer, producer or director preparing a new Harry Potter film. Most films are a gamble – will the audience respond enthusiastically? Will the film recoup its money? Will it pull in the crowds? But in the case of these films, there are none of those issues to worry about. The fan-base is so broad and so eager that people would walk through fire to see the films. In the case of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, the makers have too often been lazy because they're already guaranteed an audience. The film is uninspired and the script is totally by-the-numbers. It's a showy special effects movie that lacks real heart – just a professionally executed exercise in commercial efficiency.For the second year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Dark happenings leave an air of fear over the school – a bewitched cat, messages written in blood, strange whisperings, pupils frozen under petrifying spells. No-one is sure exactly what is happening, but there are murmurs that someone could be trying to open the Chamber of Secrets, a forgotten corner of the school with a mysterious history. When Harry finds an old diary belonging to a past pupil know as Tom Riddle Marvolo, he thinks he's close to solving the mysteryor is it all part of some bigger, more sinister plot? On the positive side of things, it's nice to see the adult cast breathing life into their characters. Newcomers include Branagh and Isaacs, both very good in their respective roles (though the Branagh character comes across as rather pointless), while the likes of Smith, Harris, Rickman and Coltrane are solid in their resumption of roles from the first movie. John Williams scores the film well, and the sets, costumes and special effects look good throughout. Where the film falls down is in its child performances (Grint, for example, wears the look of a kid who needs the toilet when trying to convey nervousness). Even worse are the frequent lapses of logic in the story. There are plot holes galore everywhere you look. A few examples: If Hogwarts could be closed due to danger to its students, then why do they play Quidditch? The game is apparently often sabotaged by someone in the crowd, and players risk decapitation while zooming around below the stands. Crowds turn out in their hundreds to watch THAT! How come none of the older, wiser characters can tell when a piece of Quidditch equipment has been affected by a bad spell? How does Harry manage to speak snake language to unlock the Chamber of Secrets, when earlier he confessed that he doesn't realise that he's speaking a different language at all? Why does the magic car rescue them from the spiders when it has been made evident earlier that it is broken? In fact, how does the car even know where they are, or that they're in danger? Perhaps in the book these things are explained, but in the film there's an air of laziness running through the story. I'd happily overlook these goofs if it weren't for the fact that the film seems to pride itself on attention to plot details. Overall, this is weaker than the first film and proves once more that Chris Columbus is the wrong director to trust when bringing fondly–regarded books to the big screen (Bicentennial Man, anyone?)",4,2,3,9 August 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Plot less, over-stylised action-comedy that relies too heavily on its star duo.
","You'd expect more from a film directed by Doug Liman than the meagre fare offered in 'Mr And Mrs Smith'. Liman was the director behind strongly characterised movies like 'Swingers' and 'Go'. But in 'Mr And Mrs Smith', there is precious little story and everything depends on the sex appeal generated by the film's two stars. A genuine case of style over substance. The problem is that sexual chemistry on its own  with no discernible plot to back it up  cannot sustain a film over a two hour running time. As gorgeous as Brad and Angelina might be to their respective army of fans, they are badly let down in this film by Simon Kinberg's threadbare script.During some kind of military crisis in Colombia, American man John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets an American girl named Jane (Angelina Jolie). Since all lone Americans are being thoroughly checked out by the Colombian authorities, the pair of them hook up to draw attention away from themselves. Five or six years later, we catch up with the couple again and discover that in the interim they have got married. Now an unhappily married couple with a glamorous house, glamorous cars but no connection between them, the Smiths' relationship is hanging by a thread. It turns out, however, that each has been deceiving the other about what they really do for a living. John is an assassin working for a secret undercover organisation; Jane is also an assassin working for a rival company. Neither of them has the faintest inkling of how the other earns a living. John and Jane are assigned by their respective bosses to carry out a hit on the same target in the desert near the Mexican border. Upon arriving at the scene, they get in each other's way and foul-up the assignment. Worse still, they begin a no-holds-barred campaign to kill each other in order to restore their reputation within their departments. But it slowly becomes clear that the trigger-happy couple are actually perfectly suited for each other, especially now that their dark secrets are out. Will they kill each other, or combine their talents to fight back against the organisations that have made them into what they are? The premise is reasonable enough, though wholly unlikely. And the film gets off to a breezy start as the truth about John and Jane is slowly revealed to the audience. Things take a rapid downward turn once the couple learn the truth about each other. At this point, all semblance of credibility is tossed aside and the film goes into comedy-action overdrive. The deadly lovers try various methods of eliminating each other in increasingly stylised set pieces; the narrative collapses and becomes an over-the-top parade of one-upmanship. Pitt and Jolie convey an effective mix of tension and desire between each other, but by this stage the story has abandoned them and the entire film is running solely on their personalities. They try gamely  but it's ultimately a losing battle. Each shootout becomes more contrived and stylised than the last, culminating in a staggeringly dumb department store gunfight. 'Mr and Mrs Smith' makes no pretences of reality, and is intentionally tongue-in-cheek, but somewhere along the line the non-stop banter and killing cease to be amusing and the film becomes something of a bore.",4,3,6,23 January 2008
Psycho," A master-class in screen suspense.
","Arguably the most legendary film of all time, Psycho is a disorientating and thoroughly absorbing thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. The film has, to some extent, been hurt by years of imitation and variation. but taken strictly on its own terms it is one of the finest examples of a director manipulating his audience into the exact state of mind that he wants them.In Phoenix, Arizona, bored real-estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is having an affair with a man called Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but fears the relationship will never work out because he is reluctant to leave his wife. She is entrusted by her boss to take $40,000 to a deposit box in the local bank, but Marion senses an opportunity to carve a better life for herself and takes off with the money. She travels towards San Francisco, but en route finds herself in a ferocious thunderstorm. Marion checks into a motel for the night  the seemingly innocuous Bates Motel. Here she is befriended by the shy and nervous proprietor Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a huge, run-down house overlooking the motel shacks and seems to be very much under the constant scrutiny of his domineering mother. Later that night, while taking a shower, Marion is brutally murdered by a shadowy knife-wielding killer. Norman blames the crime on his mother and in a state of distress hides the body. Later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam, aided by private eye Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), start searching for the missing woman. The trail leads eventually to Bates Motel, and an unexpected discovery concerning the truth about Norman's mother.Psycho is an example of pure cinema  Hitchcock doesn't merely follow a singular narrative, but employs every trick in the book (plus a few new ones invented specifically for the film) to extract maximum suspense. For forty minutes or so, the film seems to be a film about a confused woman running away with some money that isn't hers. But the brutal murder - of what we perceive to be the main character - is a masterstroke of audience disorientation. Once the film's biggest star, and the character we have up to that point followed, has been killed how can we feel safe and secure about anything that is to come? The shower scene itself is incredibly powerful  Hitchcock turns us, the audience, into voyeurs. It's hard to believe that there isn't a single shot of the knife actually making contact with Marion's body  via brilliant editing and sound effects we are actually convinced that we have seen all that happen, but most of the horror exists in the viewer's mind. Bernard Herrman's strings-only score is quite marvellous and adds additional suspense to an already thrilling film. And the acting is simply superb, with Perkins the obvious stand-out as the complex and enigmatic Norman Bates. The film has been written about, celebrated and analyzed so much that some of its novelty has been slightly diminished.. but for anyone who has the slightest interest in the mechanics of a 'real' thriller, this is the ultimate experience.",10,2,3,31 March 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Brilliantly ironic war film.
","Few film directors enjoyed such acclaim as the great David Lean. Somewhere between Hobson's Choice and Lawrence Of Arabia, he made this rousing war film set in the steaming jungles of the Far East and featuring many fine performances from a stellar cast.In a Japanese prison camp in the Far East, American POW Shears (William Holden) witnesses the arrival of a team of captured British soldiers, led by the rigid Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness). Nicholson is a man of enormous national pride who refuses to give his captors the satisfaction of seeing him demoralised, and whose stubborn attitude immediately sets him at odds with the Japanese head officer Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). Saito is determined to build a railway bridge spanning the adjacent River Kwai and knows that the British soldiers imprisoned in his camp have the engineering skills required to complete such a project. However, since the building of such a bridge would aid the Japanese war effort by providing them with a supply line for their munitions trains, Saito also realises that it will be hard to get them to build it willingly. He plays a psychological game with Nicholson, first subjecting him to prolonged isolation and degradation, then later challenging him to construct a bridge fitting of the British name. Half-mad by now, Nicholson accepts the challenge to build the bridge. but decides to prove that the British can do such things better than anyone else by making it the finest, sturdiest construction imaginable in spite of the punishing conditions and the limited resources. In the meantime, Shears escapes from the POW camp and eventually finds his way to an Allied hospital many miles away. When the British officers learn of the construction of the bridge, they send Shears back to its site so that he can guide a team of saboteurs  among them Major Warden (Jack Hawkins)  whose job it is to destroy the bridge at all costs.The film is heavily ironic throughout, showing Nicholson to be a man so determined to prove the superiority of the British that he blindly leads his men into constructing a near-perfect bridge for the enemy. Guinness is incredible in the role, going through a full gamut of complex emotions. Hayakawa is almost equally as good as the Japanese colonel who cynically and masterfully manipulates his prisoners. The film is brilliantly shot on location in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), with Lean once more proving that he is the master of the widescreen epic as he and his camera man Jack Hildyard capture the awesome vistas splendidly. At almost three hours, the film is slightly overlong. Also the final sequence, in which the sabotage party face a near-disastrous hiccup in their efforts to destroy the bridge, come across as rather cluttered. Apart from this, however, The Bridge On The River Kwai is an excellent film. It scooped seven Oscars, was a huge box office hit, and cemented Lean's reputation as one of the leading movie makers of all-time. It's a shame they don't make 'em like this any more.",9,0,1,17 September 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Lush version of the old Dracula story  very well-made, though not as faithful to the book as people like to suggest.
","You might think that with a title like 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', this 1992 version of the oft-filmed tale might stick more closely to the Bram Stoker original than most of its predecessors. And there is a little truth in that, but not nearly to the extent that certain misinformed film critics would have us believe. Maltin called it a 'sumptuous retelling of the Dracula legend as originally conceived by Stoker in his 1897 novel'. Erm actually Mr Maltin, this film alters quite a lot from the Dracula of Stoker's conception. Variety was even wider of the mark, stating that this was 'both the most extravagant screen telling of the oft-filmed story and the one most faithful to its literary source'. Had either of these critics actually READ the book? I would suggest probably not. For a start, the film hinges its story on the concept that Dracula declared war on God when his bride-to-be committed suicide in the 15th Century, and after 400 years feeding off blood eventually found what he believed to be her reincarnation living in London under the name Mina Harker. Anyone who has read the book will know that none of this is taken from it. I get very annoyed when people say that this version follows the novel more faithfully than any other, because any fan of Stoker's book will be able to tell you that it really isn't all that faithful at all. Having said all that, if we take 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' on a film level  as we should, since it IS a film after all  then there's plenty here to enjoy and admire.Romanian prince Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) fights and wins a fearsome battle against the Turks in the 15th Century. The beaten Turks fire an arrow into his castle tied to which is a note that deceitfully informs his bride that he has died in battle. Upon finding the note, his bride Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) kills herself. When Dracula returns and finds her dead, he erupts into a frenzy of violence and declares war on God, vowing to rise from his own death to have his revenge. The story leaps forward to the 19th Century, where young estate agent Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) heads off to Transylvania to help a reclusive count (Oldman, again) complete the purchase of a property in London. Harker realises pretty quickly that the count is both dangerous and inhuman, but by this time he is imprisoned in the castle with no hope of escape. Dracula makes his way to England, where he spots Harker's fiancée Mina (Ryder, again) and believes her to be the reincarnation of his long-mourned Elisabeta. Dracula's big mistake is that he first vampirises one of Mina's closest friends, Lucy (Sadie Frost), thereby alerting others that he is on the loose. Famed doctor and vampire expert Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is brought in to deal with the threat posed by this ultimate Lord of the Undead.The film is stunningly designed with lots of incredible visual trickery, including atmospheric red skies, point-of-view camera shots as Dracula prowls around in the guise of a wolf, clever tricks with shadows, moody lighting and awesome sets. The events on screen are brilliantly emphasised by Wojciech Kilar's tremendous score (arguably the best music score from any film of the '90s). The performances vary somewhat, with Ryder doing exceptional work as Mina Harker and Hopkins enjoying himself in a hammy yet controlled display as the vampire hunter Van Helsing. Oldman's Dracula is interestingly portrayed too, alternately threatening and tormented, intimidating and insecure. Reeves tries hard as Jonathan Harker but doesn't quite convince; Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes are wasted in under-written roles as, respectively, Dr Seward and Lord Arthur Holmwood. On the whole 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is a very impressive achievement and a film of real depth and flamboyance. It differs from the book, so don't be fooled by those who try to say that it is the most faithful adaptation ever made. Instead, approach this one on a film level and enjoy it for its visual splendour, its amazing music and its frequently engrossing performances.",8,1,3,26 July 2006
The Mission," Lovingly filmed, thematically powerful, literately written.... but just a bit too solemn for comfort.
","The British film critic Leslie Halliwell said of this film 'sincere to the point of boredom', and that's a very accurate description indeed of The Mission. It is a beautiful film, both to look at and to listen to. It tells a moving story that leaves an intentionally sour taste in the mouth. It also features strong performances and incredible location work. One would assume that in any movie where the cinematography, music, script, acting and locality all slot together so smoothly and meaningfully, the finished product would be truly extraordinary. Such thinking would certainly be true of, say, Lawrence Of Arabia. But in spite of all its strengths and its evident potential, The Mission does not reach the classic heights to which it aspires. Instead, it comes across as a good - at some stages VERY good - historical account which never quite hits a level one might call excellent. I mused long and hard whether to give this film a 7-out-of-10 or an 8-out-of-10 rank, but 9 and 10 ratings never came into the equation.In the 18th Century, in the rainforest around the modern borders of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, a tribe called the Guarani kill a missionary priest by tying him to a wooden cross and sending him over the edge of a waterfall. The priest's replacement, Jesuit Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), approaches the same tribe and wins them over with his patience, love and respect. Before long, Gabriel has converted the tribe to the ways and customs of Christianity. Father Gabriel is joined by an ex-slaver, Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro), who exiled himself after murdering his own brother in a jealous rage, and who finds a chance of redemption by joining the Jesuit order and helping to preach to the Guarani people. Soon, problems arise that threaten the Jesuit cause and the existence of the Guarani. A change in border delineation results in the Portugese acquiring the Guarani land; the Portugese refuse to acknowledge the tribe as converted Christians, viewing them as little more than animals, good for nothing but slavery. The Catholic Cardinal, Altamirano (Ray McAnally), is told to make the Jesuits leave the area and forsake the tribe. Father Gabriel and Rodrigo refuse to turn their backs on the people they have worked with - even though they themselves disagree on how best to confront the Portugese. Gabriel, a man of peace, feels that he should die with them and show them how to go honourably to their graves; Rodrigo, a man of the sword, feels that the Indians should fight to protect their mission....The film's ending is very sad and demonstrates everything that is wrong with the policies of powerful countries exploiting those less powerful than their own (a theme that is still relevant today - it seems our politicians have learned little from history). Ennio Morricone provides a stunning score which is easily his best work since the spaghetti western days, and which brings great emotion to the proceedings. Irons and De Niro give good performances as the differing Jesuits who cannot let go of their ideals even though they know they're doomed if they don't. Both are actually upstaged by McAnally, whose role as the Cardinal is by far the best in the film, exploring as it does the humanistic and moral dilemma faced by the character. The Mission is quite a heavy-going film and, like Halliwell said, it is very sincere indeed. Therefore, whilst it has its good points, it is also a hard film to watch and is more likely to appeal to those interested in the events, the period and the politics than to more generally-minded audiences.",7,3,7,20 February 2006
Jaws," Awesome thriller in which everything that COULD have been done right HAS been done right.
","Based on a bestseller by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a thrilling story about a community gripped by fear as a great white shark brings death to their waters. It is also the film that truly cemented Steven Spileberg's reputation as a maker of hugely entertaining films  and introduced a trend of studios seeking to release 'summer blockbusters' that has lasted to this day. More than thirty years since its release, Jaws still retains the power both to entertain and terrify. It is a classic, plain and simple.A naked swimmer is enjoying a dip in the waters off Amity Island when she is attacked by something beneath the surface that pulls her to her death. When her mutilated remains turn up with the tide, local police officer Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) discovers that she almost certainly has fallen victim to a man-eating shark, most likely a Great White. He decides that her death is probably a tragic one-off and allows the local population, plus holiday-makers from farther afield, to come to Amity Island for the usual summer recreations. But another victim is eaten by the shark, this time a young boy swimming not too far from the beach. A huge shark hunt takes place with all the local fishermen attempting to capture the one that has brought death to their waters. They believe they have succeeded when they kill a Great White and bring it in for public display, but a scientist named Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) isn't so sure they have caught the right fish. He convince Brody to cut open the belly of the shark to see if it contains human remains in its stomach, and they discover that it does not. With the real killer Great White still at large, Brody and Hooper enlist the aid of a crusty sea-farer  Quint (Robert Shaw)  to track it down. But it is only once they are far out to sea that they discover what a strong and formidable foe they have taken on. A terrifying game of man .vs. nature ensues as the three hunters and the shark play out a battle to the death on the lonely waves.Jaws is awesome. So many elements gel perfectly - the casting, for one, with Scheider outstanding as the police officer trying to protect his town and family from the underwater menace. But it isn't just Scheider who catches the eye; Dreyfuss also seizes his opportunity to etch a wonderful portrayal as the scientist simultaneously thrilled and terrified by the foe he is out to destroy. And Shaw is utterly mesmerising as the experienced shark hunter who comes to realise that he is on the trail of his most dangerous ever quarry. John Williams provides one of cinema's most recognisable scores, a simple but chilling tune that builds to a devastating crescendo as the action intensifies. Spielberg reinvents the meaning of 'thrill' in cinematic terms, taking his audience to the point where they think their nerves can take no more only to turn the screw even tighter. The finale, as Scheider clings to the mast of a sinking ship and watches the shark's fin cut through the water towards him, is so tense that it is impossible not to feel your palms sweating and your pulse thudding in your ears. A fantastic movie.",10,1,3,8 June 2007
The Lion King," A brilliant, magical movie.
","After The Aristocats in 1970, Disney studios went into a long period of indifferent features, particularly their animated films (though the live-action productions - like Popeye - weren't so hot either!) However, their fortunes turned with a series of four major winners in a row. The trend was set by The Little Mermaid in 1989, and rapidly followed-up with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. The Lion King may well be the best Disney film since the early masterpieces like Dumbo and Pinnochio. Story deals with young lion cub Simba, the heir to a great, thriving animal community in Africa. Consumed by jealousy, Simba's sinister Uncle Scar murders the current king Mufasa, cleverly making the death look accidental, and encourages Simba to run away. Years go by, during which Simba befriends a couple of free-spirited animals (Timon and Pumbaa), while Scar's newly inherited kingdom falls apart under his tyrannical and inept leadership. Eventually, Simba figures out his rightful place and returns to challenge his treacherous uncle. The animation is quite breathtaking at times, but The Lion King is much more than 80 minutes of pretty pictures. It has a simple but totally engrossing story, which builds to several powerful and emotional climaxes. It also has terrific voice acting, with James Earl Jones lending true gravity to Mufasa, and Jeremy Irons doing a splendidly slimy job as the despicable Scar. On a comedy level, Timon and Pumbaa are wonderful and actually provide some good adult humour to keep the grown-up viewers tittering (a tactic which was used even more successfully in the 2003 hit Finding Nemo). The Lion King is an exhilarating animated film - fabulous characters, fabulous story, fabulous songs.... fabulous entertainment!",10,0,2,24 June 2004
The Woman in Black," Effectively jumpy ghost story with a few minor flaws.
","It is a common misconception that The Woman In Black is an example of Victorian literature, when in actual fact it is a novel by Susan Hill written in 1983 and set during Edwardian times. The book has been highly regarded since its publication, inspiring a long-running stage show by Stephen Mallatratt, a chilling TV movie in 1989, and several radio adaptations. It finally gets the big screen treatment thanks to screen-writer Jane Goldman and director James Watkins. The key question any audience will want to ask is:- have they done justice to this most celebrated of contemporary ghost stories? The answer is yes; on the whole this is an eerily effective bloodcurdler which cranks up an aura of dread and suspense, without resorting to gore and splatter.Young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is struggling with bills and facing the loss of his job. His wife died in childbirth, leaving him with the responsibility of bringing up their child. As the pressure mounts, Arthur is close to the edge and thoughts of suicide are never far from his mind. Then he gets a chance at redemption. In the remote north-eastern town of Crythin Gifford, an elderly lady has died and a lawyer is required to sort out her affairs, including the sale of her dilapidated mansion at Eel Marsh. Arthur accepts the assignment in order to re-establish himself as a reliable member of the firm. The mansion is on a small island at the end of a causeway, completely cut off from the mainland when the tide is in. Arthur is immediately struck by the aggression and hostility that greets him in the village. Things worsen when he goes to the mansion itself, where he is plagued by a series of malevolent sounds and happenings which cannot be explained in a rational manner. Slowly, Arthur learns that the villagers live in fear of The Woman In Black, a vengeful spectre with a score to settle against the whole community. He pieces together the shameful and tragic secrets of Crythin Gifford, and realises that somehow he must satisfy the furious ghost's hunger for revenge in order to set her soul to rest once and for all.Let's get the bad points out of the way first. Radcliffe is rather miscast as Kipps, clearly too young to be believable as a suicidal lawyer with inner demons and a tragic past. His performance is quite good in all fairness, but he just doesn't suit the role. What we have here is an example of cynical studio execs exploiting an actor's fan base to raise the profile of their film, rather than casting the right actor for the part. Also disappointing is the absurd ending to the movie, altered somewhat from the book's ruthlessly bleak finalé and probably a good deal less unsettling as a result. Apart from that, The Woman In Black is a good, solid ghost story, crafted with an impressive eye for the macabre. Its aim is to build dread, to keep the viewer's stomach in knots, and its sets about achieving this goal with a relentlessness that is well sustained throughout. There are plenty of genuinely jumpy moments, and even a few sequences that could be described as truly scary (there is, I believe, a subtle difference between jumpy and scary). The film is put together slickly and professionally; an effective fireside scare-story which provides a welcome antidote to the increasing number of OTT gorefests presently swamping the genre.",7,0,0,8 March 2012
Signs," Alien invasion yarn told from a personal perspective, with a subtext about keeping one's faith (for those who want it).
","There can't be many films which divide the audience more than 'Signs'. Even a cursory glance at the user comments here on the IMDb shows some people rating it highly and singing its praises, while others give it the dreaded 1-out-of-10 verdict. Similarly, many professional critics have been split over this film with Jonathan Ross stating that it left him 'terrifically let down', while Cosmo Landesman hailed it 'a wonderful sustained slice of American Gothic'. I have a theory about why there are such polar opinions of the film. I believe that many people read the plot summary on the back of the video case, notice that the film features big stars like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and start expecting something along the lines of 'Independence Day' or 'The War Of The Worlds'. But 'Signs' is not that kind of film - it is not concerned with laser gun battles and aliens having their guts splattered all over the place, nor is it concerned with the spectacle of entire cities being decimated by gigantic alien spaceships. For that reason, many people who were hoping for explosions and destruction on a grand scale come away feeling cheated.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest living on a very remote farm in Pennsylvania. He lost his faith following the tragic death of his wife in a car accident. Also living on the farm are Graham's children Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin), and Graham's younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Merrill was once a minor league baseball player, famous for hitting the longest ever shot but, paradoxically, famous for suffering the most strike-outs in the history of the sport. One morning, the Hess family discover a huge crop circle in their field. Their initial bewilderment gradually gives way to paranoia and fear as they learn from the TV news that such crop circles have been appearing all over the world. Before long, UFOs are sighted above cities and scaly alien creatures are filmed sneaking around on Earth. The Hess family fear that an invasion is imminent, with the crop circles like the one in the field adjacent to their house used as landing points. They board up their farmhouse and take refuge inside, hoping to survive the night against whatever it is that is trying to get in.All the way through the film, Shyamalan refuses to get carried away with the bigger picture of the alien invasion. We only see and hear of the destruction caused by the invaders via the Hess's TV and radio set. Instead, the story is approached directly from the perspective of the Hess family, making it much more intimate and personal than the usual alien invasion entries. Shyamalan uses seemingly insignificant little details and overlapping flashbacks to build up his story, and makes his main themes those of the power of fate and the need for faith. In fact, the whole alien-invasion aspect of the plot is relegated in terms of significance and used merely as a backcloth for the story of Graham's regaining of faith. We are being told here that EVERYTHING happens for a reason and that even the most innocuous of events or conversations has a bearing on the future. This preachy approach - almost religious, in a discreet kind of way - is likely to irritate some viewers, though the more spiritual among us might find it absorbing and affirming. 'Signs' is very slow-paced and intricate, certainly not the kind of film that encourages repeat viewings, but in the end I think it delivers. I certainly didn't come away feeling 'terrifically let down', as Mr Ross complained. I've seen many better films, but I've seen a heck of a lot worse too. 'Signs' is good, suspenseful stuff, with thought-provoking themes for those who can be bothered to pursue them.",6,3,7,29 December 2005
The Deer Hunter," Compelling study of the effects of war, excellent in parts but not incisive enough as a whole.
","The Deer Hunter is a powerful, disturbing, but somewhat overlong film about life for a group of young American steelworkers before, during and after Vietnam. In fact, this was one of the first films to deal with the Vietnam conflict. The middle section, set in SE Asia and dealing with the experiences of the men in a Vietcong prison camp, spares us nothing whatsoever in its depiction of the horrors of war.Three young Pennsylvanian steelworkers head off to fight in Vietnam. First, there's Michael (Robert De Niro), an emotionally strong and determined type who is almost homo-erotically protective of his friends. Then there's Steven (John Savage), an unassuming and naïve guy who gets married just before heading off to war. Finally, there's Nick (Christopher Walken), outwardly a normal everyday guy but after the fighting the most emotionally shattered of the trio. After attending Steven's wedding, the guys head up into the mountains for a deer hunt. Soon after that, they head for 'Nam, where they are captured by the Vietcong and imprisoned in a half-submerged swamp POW camp. Occasionally the men are taken out of their cages and forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors, a lethal game in which two men take it turns to place a gun loaded with one bullet against their head  the loser being the unlucky one who clicks the trigger when it gets to the loaded chamber. After traumatic experiences in the Vietcong prison, the three guys finally escape but are separated as they make their getaway. After various adventures, Michael makes it back to America, where he discovers that Steven is now a crippled paraplegic following an accident during his escape from the Vietcong. Worse still, he learns that Nick is still in Vietnam, no longer a US soldier but instead a suicidal wreck who plays Russian Roulette night after night in seedy alleys and bars to make money. Michael returns to Vietnam to persuade Nick to come back home with him, but finds the nihilistic influence of war has pushed Nick's mind beyond the point of no return.The performances in the film are absolutely brilliant. De Niro is memorable as a natural born survivor. Savage evokes aching sympathy as the just-married kid who ends up wheelchair-bound before he can enjoy fulfilment with his wife. John Cazale is terrific as Stan, one of the guys from back home who doesn't go to war and who cannot understand how it is that his friends come back so dramatically altered. And best of all is Walken, simply stunning as the vulnerable man who becomes locked in a doomed obsession with the game of Russian Roulette. Less impressive is the rambling script by Deric Washburn, which features heavy-handed symbolism and fails to make any of the film's three main sections as incisive as they ought to be. The script rises to moments of undeniable power, but in between there's a lot of meaningless extraneous detail to be waded through. The moving score by Stanley Mann and John Williams is actually lifted from an earlier film (The Walking Stick, released in 1970) but suits the mournful mood of this film just as perfectly. Heavily symbolic and flawed as it is, The Deer Hunter is still a tremendously compelling movie. and it actually grows in stature the more times you watch it.",8,2,4,1 October 2006
Speed," On the whole, a terrific actioner, but slightly let down by the final fifteen minutes.
","Speed is one of the only action movies I can think of in which the phrase 'all-action' is completely accurate. There is only one scene in this entire film which isn't an action scene, and that comes near the start when Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels are seen at a party celebrating the receipt of a bravery award. Other than that, every moment is taken up by some kind of outrageous stunt, electrifying exchange, or hair-raising chase. The story is very simple, but very exciting. Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an L.A. bomb disposal maverick, thwarts an attempt by a mad bomber to get his hands on a multi-million dollar ransom by threatening to kill an elevator full of people. The bomber (Dennis Hopper) is quite annoyed to have his scheme quashed, so he sets up a new threat, He plants a bomb on an L.A. bus. When the bus reaches 50 m.p.h the bomb becomes active, but the moment its speed falls below 50 m.p.h from then on the bomb will detonate. Jack boards the bus and tries to keep it going at the necessary speed, aided by gutsy lady passenger Annie (Sandra bullock), but it's some challenge amid the chaotic morning traffic of downtown L.A. The film uses its simple premise to wonderful effect. There's nothing complicated or confusing about this.... if the bus slows down too much, the ride is over. The very concept of keeping the vehicle going so fast for so long in such a clogged traffic environment gives plenty of moments of excitement. Reeves actually gives one of the first really good performances of his career, and is ably backed up by the wacky Hopper, the appealing Bullock and the likable Daniels. The film isn't perfect. The final fifteen or twenty minutes takes place off the bus and seems a rather superfluous sequence. I feel the film would have been far better if it had ended on the bus, but there's a somewhat absurd episode aboard an underground train which feels like it was originally conceived for another movie but somehow made it into this one. Still, I'm willing to forgive the film this one minor mis-step, because until that point it was right up there with the greatest films in its genre of all-time.",Null,0,2,5 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Splendid end to a splendid trilogy.
","The Return of the King is the most complex of the three books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I was afraid that Peter Jackson and his team might struggle to do it justice. For a start, the story fragments into so many sub-stories that the job of maintaining continuity is staggeringly difficult; for another, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields is such a massive battle in the book that it requires technical bravura beyond anything ever witnessed to be brought to life on the screen. I need not have worried. The Return of the King is an absolutely fantastic film. A major achievement by any standards, and one of the greatest films ever made which can easily rival its competition (including Lawrence of Arabia, The Grapes of Wrath, The Wild Bunch and any other undisputed top 100 movie you could care to mention). The story picks up where The Two Towers left off. Frodo and Sam are still trying to find a way into Mordor, guided by the corrupt Gollum (who plans to lure them into a dangerous cavern where a man-eating spider awaits). Aragorn and the other companions, having just survived the exhausting Battle of Helm's Deep, are trying to get the long-uncooperative kingdoms of men to join forces to face Sauron's orcs, but must somehow persuade the stubborn steward of Gondor to put aside personal pride for the sake of Middle Earth. Worse still, the army of orcs they must face is the biggest army ever assembled and they have but a fraction of that number on their own side. Thnkgs look pretty glum unless they can find extra fighters from somewhere.... There's nothing that I can say about The Return of the King that hasn't been said here on the imdb already. It's only fault is that there are slightly too many moments where all seems lost only for a last minute reprieve to be granted (The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is all but lost only for Aragorn to arrive with his army of the dead; the Battle of the Black Gate is all but lost only for the eagles to arrive just in the nick of time; and as Mount Doom crumbles around them Frodo and Sam seem lost, only for Gandalf to ride toi the rescue on an eagle, etc.) However, these events happen in the book and the makers are merely being faithful to their source. In every other aspect, the film is outstanding. It has blood, guts, romance, humour, fear, rousing heroism and scenes capable of moving you to tears. Congratulations to Jackson and co. for making this trilogy the awesome experience that it has been.",Null,2,4,29 February 2004
Apollo 13," Excellent recreation of a factual drama-in-space.
","As if to prove that the number 13 is truly unlucky - as superstitious people have been telling us for years - the 13th Apollo space mission was a catalogue of disastrous mishaps from start to finish. Ron Howard directs this film version of the events surrounding the ill-fated mission with great attention to the technical detail, making it almost documentary-like in approach. But while some documentaries are rather cold and distant, Howard remembers to keep the emotional drama in his film tense and involving, just as it must have been as the events unfolded for real back in the spring of 1970.Astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) has long dreamed of setting foot on the moon, and gets his chance when chosen to be a member of the Apollo 13 moon landing mission in 1970. The three man team also includes Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton). During their flight to the moon, the three astronauts make regular live transmissions that they believe will be televised down on Earth. However, their TV slot has been axed without them knowing it, as no-one seems particularly interested any more in the rather dull and technical terminology associated with space travel. The mission is destined to become the centre of everyone's attention, however, when a routine oxygen tank procedure goes awry and leads to an explosion. The Apollo shuttle is suddenly marooned in space, with little power, little control and little air. The objective of landing on the moon is replaced with the sole aim of getting the astronauts back home alive. In Houston, scientists struggle against the odds to plan a way to bring the astronauts back to safety, working around the clock to solve various logistical problems facing them. Meanwhile, Lovell's wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must hold together her family as they face the terrifying possibility of losing their beloved Jim. And aboard the shuttle itself, the three astronauts endure several days of unrelenting doubts and fears as their very lives hang by a thread.Apollo 13 is a superb recreation of the true story. Its most impressive achievement is that it manages to generate genuine gnawing tension in spite of the fact that most viewers already know the outcome. The performances are first-rate throughout, with Hanks, Bacon and Paxton exceptional as the endangered space travellers, Quinlan totally convincing as Lovell's distraught wife, and Ed Harris in commanding form as the mission controller sweating it out down in Houston. William Broyles Jr and Al Reinert provide an excellent script, which makes absolute sense of the potentially confusing technical dialogue, and also explores the emotional toll of the ordeal realistically and effectively. The final scene especially, in which communication is lost as the astronaut's re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, is so taut that you can feel your heart thumping inside your chest. The film is a celebration of human determination  some have criticised it for its unapologetic flag-waving and patriotism but such criticisms seem, to me, to be missing the point. This is not so much about America conquering the odds, more a film about the human spirit in general conquering the odds. And that's a message that we should all take from the film with open arms. Apollo 13 is an outstanding film indeed.",9,9,12,17 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Fabulous sequel to Star Wars  best of the series.
","This sequel to Star Wars is actually even better than the original, and the best of the entire series. In The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas allows his story outline to be scripted and directed by other hands (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay, Irvin Kershner on directorial duties). It is a triumphant science fiction epic, a film of great invention and excitement, with remarkable set pieces and tremendous special effects. The film has a darker quality than its predecessor which lends a more complex and mature feel to the proceedings. It also manages the near-impossible job of being a thoroughly satisfying 'transitory' movie  you have to remember that this movie doesn't have a start in the normal sense of the word since it continues a story already begun in an earlier film, nor does it have an end as such because much of the plot is left unresolved in preparation for the next movie.The heroes from the first film  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher)  are continuing their struggle to free the galaxy from the control of the Empire. All those loyal to the Rebel Alliance are hiding out alongside them on an icy planet named Hoth. After a galaxy-wide search the Empire, under the rule of Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), finally discovers the true whereabouts of their Rebel enemies. A massive evacuation is mounted by the Rebels as the forces of the Empire lay siege to Hoth in an effort to destroy them. After the battle Luke separates from the others and goes to the Dagobar System, where he hopes to become a Jedi under the tutelage of wise Jedi Master, Yoda (voice of Frank Oz). Meanwhile, Han Solo spends most of the film trying to outrun the Empire's star fleet aboard his spaceship the Millennium Falcon. He decides to drop in on his old buddy Lando Calrisian (Billy Dee Williams) for help, but upon arriving at Lando's city in the clouds there is a nasty surprise in store..The Empire Strikes Back is really exhilarating stuff. It moves along two fronts, cutting from Luke's adventures and Jedi training to the thrilling chase sequence involving Han Solo. Both sections are brilliantly handled, with plenty to keep the audience engrossed. The performances in the Star Wars movies have never been the centre of attention, but there's much to enjoy in this one in terms of acting  Hamill's Luke Skywalker has evolved from the simplistic hero of the earlier film into someone more ambitious and tormented. Ford manages to make the roguish Han Solo cooler and more likable than ever, while Fisher's Princess Leia is no longer a helpless victim in need of rescuing but has a much tougher, more resourceful side to her character. Highlights of the film include a stunning battle on the surface of the ice planet Hoth, a space chase through an asteroid belt, and a prolonged closing duel between Luke and Darth Vader during which Vader makes a shattering revelation!! A great film.",10,1,2,16 September 2007
Saboteur," A lesser work for this director, but still an engaging enough wartime chase thriller.
","Saddled with actors he didn't want and a script full of improbable characters, Alfred Hitchcock still manages to shape Saboteur into an absorbing enough thriller. In some ways, the film can be viewed as a precursor to the later (and better) North By Northwest. A falsely accused hero undertaking a cross country odyssey to clear his name, pursued by the law and the bad guys, with a climax atop a famous landmarkthe similarities between the two films are clear to see.Aircraft mechanic Barry Kane (Robert Cummnings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging the factory at which he works during WWII. As the police close in on him, Kane realises he is going to have to clear his name alone. He goes on the run, hoping to track down the real saboteur, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd). Kane's journey quickly becomes an epic cross-country chase, made all the more dangerous when he discovers that Fry is working for a large spy network with enemy agents all over the country. One of the only people Kane can trust is Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), a headstrong young woman he befriends along the way. Together Kane and Patricia make it all the way to New York City, where they find themselves in the house of a seemingly sweet old rich lady, Mrs Van Sutton (Alma Kruger), who is, in fact, another link in the spy chain. Finally, they corner the saboteur Fry on the statue of Liberty, where a struggle to the death ensues on the high torched arm of the famous Lady Liberty.Saboteur is not really one of the better Hitchcock movies, but it still has its moments. There is a dryly amusing scene in a travelling circus van populated by circus freaks; a clever shootout at the Radio City Music Hall; and, of course the famous finale on the Statue of Liberty. Too much of the dialogue is uncommonly stilted for a Hitchcock movie, and the performances are merely competent without standing out in any way. Sometimes the narrative seems to jump to the next incident or set piece in a rather jerky, jumbled manner (again uncommon for Hitch) but happily it just about manages to pull its various loose ends together by the end. Overall, Saboteur is a perfectly watchable and entertaining film, albeit dated and not quite in the very best tier of the director's work.",6,1,2,8 August 2010
Gangs of New York," Well made though overlong piece of early New York history.
","Gangs Of New York is an over-dramatised but compelling story of the struggle to make New York City into a place of law and decency. Set in the 19th Century and shot on incredibly convincing sets, the film is a triumph of design. However, it is not without certain flaws - notably excessive length, artistic licence taken with some of the facts, and the wrong actors in a few key roles. Martin Scorsese directs the whole affair with a sense of great importance, and a few political statements simmering away in the background, but his epic vision was largely snubbed by the Academy Award voters who cynically - and perhaps correctly? - presumed that the director was almost trying TOO hard to make an award winning film. Where Scorsese should receive a nod of approval, though, is in his attempts to revise certain falsehoods about American history. In the Civil War, the Union were promoted as great heroes and protectors of freedom while the Confederates were presented as racist thugs, but Scorsese shows how some pretty disgraceful attitudes towards foreigners (both black and white) existed on all sides. Also, America has always been hailed as the Land of Opportunity, but Scorsese shows conditions for the arriving immigrants to be terribly hostile and unwelcoming in those early days.In New York City in the mid-19th Century, the streets are littered with stench and decay, and various gangs battle for control of the lawless neighbourhoods. Father Vallon (Liam Neeson) is angered by the hostility and squalor in which he and his fellow Irish immigrants exist, so he challenges Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a fight for control of a district called The Five Points. Bill is in charge of the Natives, a gang who despise the endless influx of foreign filth into their land. Vallon is killed during the bloody street battle, and his young son witnesses his death amid the carnage. Sixteen years later, Vallon's son - who has grown up in a reform house - returns to the Five Points under the name of Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio). Amsterdam finds the district under the absolute control of Bill The Butcher, who seems to have even the lawmen and the politicians in his pocket. Over time, Amsterdam works his way into Bill's employ and even becomes a sort of son-he-never-had figure in the eyes of the brutal Butcher. But New York is on the verge of imploding as the army constantly ignore popular opinion to round up citizens and immigrants to replenish the Union Army - this forced drafting of new soldiers eventually climaxes in a citywide riot. In the midst of this bloody confrontation, Amsterdam finally comes into his own private conflict with the Butcher for the revenge he has lusted after since his father's death.Day-Lewis is utterly fantastic as Bill the Butcher, cleaving the skulls of his enemies with a machete and spitting vehement hatred at incoming mongrels with terrifying conviction. The Butcher is truly a screen character destined to be remembered for all-time. Di Caprio is less impressive as Amsterdam - yes, he looks more beefed-up than in other pictures and, under Scorsese's direction, he gives a passable performance - but he just isn't the right choice for this role. Diaz, as a woman who comes between them, performs decently enough even if her character is rather under-developed. The film is shot with great impact by Michael Ballhaus, who captures the filth and local colour of this pit of criminals in stunning detail, and makes some of the street battles seem very urgent and shockingly gory. Less impressive is Howard Shore's anachronistic score, which really sounds all wrong for this period locale. Gangs Of New York is a flawed but fascinating story - a film that ultimately reaches just a bit beyond its grasp but manages to be enthralling and magnificent in defeat.",8,0,1,2 April 2006
Moon," Ingenious science fiction offering, packed with thought-provoking ideas.
","As a movie genre, science fiction seems over the past ten years to have returned to the standard B-movie approach which involves good guys and aliens blasting the hell out of each other with lasers. More philosophical and thought-provoking science fiction has been harder to come by. 'Moon' - Duncan Jones's debut feature which premiered to considerable acclaim at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival - is a wonderfully clever sci-fi story, featuring a remarkable performance by Sam Rockwell. It takes elements of '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Solyaris' and 'Silent Running', and weaves them into its own uniquely fascinating story of isolation, madness and human exploitation.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the lone worker at a moon base called Sarang, where he monitors and occasionally repairs giant harvesting machines. The machines are gathering helium-3, which provides Earth with energy. Sam is in the final fortnight of a three year contract, and is desperate to get back to his wife and child on Earth. Hardly surprising, since his only companion during three years at the base has been a robot named GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). Worse still, a communications malfunction means that Sam has only been able to send and receive pre-recorded messages to his family – live chats have not been possible. Whilst out on the moon's surface driving a rover to one of the giant harvesters, Sam accidentally crashes the vehicle. He comes round back at the base and is told by GERTY that he's had an accident but when he goes out to the crash site to investigate further, he finds a body still in the wreckage. His own body! Now there are two Sam Bells on the moon and neither is sure which of them is real. Gradually the two Sams piece together the answers and learn that they are victims of a shameful conspiracy which will drive them to the edge of sanityJones not only directed but conceived the original story, with the final script being penned by Nathan Parker. They deserve credit for creating such an engrossing, thought-provoking story and filming it so inventively. Rockwell's performance as the multiple 'Sam Bells' is absolutely superb. It's no exaggeration to say the film relies on him immensely – it wouldn't work were it not for his believability in the role. Kevin Spacey's vocal work as GERTY is also noteworthy, evoking memories of Douglas Rains' chilling voice-only performance as HAL in '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Clint Mansell's score has a haunting, deliberately repetitive rhythm which suits the story perfectly. There are, perhaps inevitably, moments where the film has a slow-moving quietness about it (how else could Sam's loneliness and tedium be conveyed?) but on the whole this is an impressive movie and one which I think will stand the test of time.",8,2,6,19 October 2009
True Romance," Ultra-violent, foul-mouthed crime thriller with pop culture references galore and an unignorable level of style and energy.
","Take a look at the credentials of True Romance. Firstly, director Tony Scott - brother of Ridley - had made a series of visually hyper-active and ultra-violent action movies (Beverly Hills Cop II, Revenge, The Last Boy Scout). Secondly, writer Quentin Tarantino had penned and directed the ground-breaking Reservoir Dogs. Thirdly, the cast comprises of a gallery of supporting slimeballs played by edgy character-actors, each of whom had given the world some of THE unforgettable screen characters in their earlier films (Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Ed Lauter, Bronson Pinchot). Anyone expecting True Romance to be a quiet, low-key, gentle crime caper would have to have spent their lives on Mars! True to the form of its blood-obsessed talents it is an energetic, foul-mouthed, relentlessly violent, curiously comical crime thriller which commands attention in spite of its intentional excesses.In Detroit, young comic book store worker Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) hooks up with a prostitute named Alabama (Patricia Arquette) at a late-night movie theatre. Within a few hours they are in love, and soon after that they get married. But Clarence still feels the urge to confront Alabama's pimp, the dreadlocked psycho Drexl (Gary Oldman), on the one hand so that he can claim back her suitcase full of personal belongings and on the other because deep down inside he wants to hurt the pimp's pride. Their confrontation turns ugly and Clarence ends up killing his vicious rival; afterwards he leaves the scene with what he believes is Alabama's suitcase, but it transpires later that he has walked away with a different suitcase containing a fortune in uncut cocaine. Clarence and Alabama skip town and head for Hollywood, hoping to offload the drugs onto a movie star or producer at a cut price. Unfortunately, both the cops and the drug kingpins are keen to get hold of the suitcase full of cocaine too, so they put men on Clarence's trail. Clarence meets up with his old pal Dick (Michael Rappaport), now a struggling bit player in Hollywood, who via a contact arranges a drug sale with an ace movie producer (Saul Rubinek). Unknown to each other the various parties who covet the coke-loaded suitcase draw nearer to a fatal, blood-drenched rendezvous in an LA hotel room from which no-one can expect to walk away alive....True Romance is full of terrific hard-boiled dialogue and comical pop culture references. Slater is brilliant in the leading role, as is Arquette as his likably weird wife, but it's the gallery of crooked supporting characters who rule this movie. Walken has a chilling one-scene cameo; Hopper is terrific as Clarence's estranged father; Brad Pitt turns up briefly as a totally spaced-out drug addict; and Oldman is instantly fearsome in his electrifying scenes as the sadistic pimp. Tony Scott piles up the body count with one stylishly violent scene after another, all set to a soundtrack that is a trash-culture aficionado's wet dream. All the cursing, blood-letting, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll eventually lose their impact through sheer repetition, but even then there's still the acting and dialogue to fall back on. You may need to have an amoral streak - or certainly a degree of tolerance - to enjoy True Romance, but if you like your movies fast, mean and outrageously raw you'll probably have a blast.",7,11,15,21 May 2006
Donnie Darko," Incredible film - an enigmatic treat that throws up more possibilities each time you watch it.
","'Donnie Darko' is the very quintessence of cinema. Enigmatic, absorbing, humorous and thought-provoking - it is a film that throws up endless possibilities and debates, and ingeniously allows a whole range of interpretations that viewers might wish to pursue. There are many viewers who prefer films that provide immediate closure. In the minds of such viewers, films like 'Donnie Darko' are unsatisfying or irritating or, worst of all, pointless. Then there are viewers who like to be challenged, perhaps even teased, by films. I would urge everyone - regardless of their usual preference - to give 'Donnie Darko' a go. Even those who are usually dead against subjective and open-ended films of this kind will almost certainly find themselves questioning and pondering over what they have experienced. And those who revel in the mysterious, the enigmatic and the downright peculiar will absolutely LOVE this film.Troubled teenager Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a mountain road on the morning of October 1st 1988, having either cycled there in his sleep (one interpretation), or as the result of being trapped in a month-long time loop that begins in that place and on that date (another interpretation). In the early hours of October 2nd 1988, Donnie is awakened from his sleep by a giant, grotesque bunny rabbit named Frank, who lures him away from his house to a nearby golf course and reveals to him details of the imminent end of the world. While he is out of the house, a plane engine mysteriously falls from the sky and smashes into Donnie's bedroom: bizarrely, there is no indication of where the engine fell from as no plane lost its engine in that area on that night. Having apparently cheated death as a result of his hallucinatory relationship with Frank, Donnie spends the rest of the month experiencing incredible, and often disturbing, events as time ticks inexorably towards Frank's terrifying deadline. Guided by Frank, he carries out irrational actions - such as burning down the residence of behavioural guru Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Each time, Donnie's actions - however mad or misguided they may seem - lead to worthwhile consequences (e.g Cunningham's house turns out to be the site of a child porn ring, which is uncovered when firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze started by Donnie). It eventually transpires that Donnie is living in a tangent universe which began on the night he evaded death in the plane engine accident., and only Donnie can set straight this potentially catastrophic time corruption.... even though it will mean sacrificing himself in the original October 2nd accident.'Donnie Darko' is a superb film on so many levels. Richard Kelly directs the film with an incredible eye for striking detail and his script is full of quotable dialogue and inventive, philosophical ideas. The narrative, which seems initially confusing, is proved by repeat viewings of the film to be extremely clever. Even if repeat viewings never fully clear the confusion, the ingenuity of the story comes from the fact that it invites and supports several different readings of what the film is really all about. Nothing is made explicit, everything is left open, and for that reason the film remains a fascinating experience regardless of how often one re-watches it. The music and photography (by Michael Andrews and Steven Poster respectively) are brilliantly atmospheric and add yet more to the film's incredible bag of goodies. 'Donnie Darko' is quite literally life-changing - a film like no other, and one of the very best movies of all-time.",10,11,15,25 January 2006
The Wedding Singer," Well-made, engaging romantic comedy.
","Adam Sandler had made generally second-rate comedy fillers prior to The Wedding Singer. Films like Billy Madison, Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore  very straightforward, run-of-the-mill comedy films. The Wedding Singer has a lot more to it than that, and is a surprisingly enjoyable and witty romantic comedy. The trick is very simple  it's a film about people. No fancy plot devices, no special effects, no action thrown in to spice things up  just real and funny characters caught up in a situation that anyone can identify with.In the 1980s, wedding singer Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) makes friends with a pleasant waitress named Julia (Drew Barrymore) at a wedding party. The pair of them get on incredibly well but neither notices the chemistry between them as both are already engaged to their respective lovers. In Robbie's case, the attractive but incompatible Linda (Angela Featherstone); in Julia's case the successful and materialistic Glenn (Matthew Glave). When Robbie is jilted at the altar by Linda, he sinks into depression but is helped through the tough times by Julia. During this time he realises that he actually has feelings for her, a fact that Julia herself also awakens to. Julia begins to have serious doubts about whether she truly wants to spend the rest of her life with Glenn but her family and friends convince her that she is merely suffering from a few pre-wedding jitters. However, when Robbie finds out that Glenn is a love rat who sleeps around with other women he realises that the time is right to declare his love to Julia. But circumstances conspire to jeopardise his plan, and Robbie has to chase Julia to Las Vegas before she unwittingly marries the wrong guyWhat makes the film better than a standard romantic comedy is the clever '80s background, with clothing, fashion, hair-styles, music tastes and phrases all perfectly captured from the era. In one great scene, Robbie instructs Linda to stop wearing his Van Halen T-shirt: 'please get out of my Van Halen T-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up!' Little subtle gags like this run throughout the film and make it a pleasure to come back for repeat viewings. The dialogue is generally very good, with lots of quick witted sarcasm and one-liners. But the film remembers also to set aside time for the emotional and romantic elements, so that it doesn't just become a soulless gag-fest. Sandler proves for perhaps the first time in his career that he is a likable and subtle actor, capable of creating a character with personality rather than sticking to type. Similarly, Barrymore gives her sweetest performance in years  the chemistry between them is unexpectedly warm and genuine. Indeed, the entire cast create memorable and amusing characters, right down to a hilarious cameo from Billy Idol. There's really not much wrong with The Wedding Singer  it's a little conventional and the outcome is wholly predictable, but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise well-made, engaging and genuinely funny comedy flick.",8,3,3,29 February 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Part 3 in the Indy series.... an exhilarating action movie.
","After the enjoyable but rather soulless Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg returned with a story similar to the original Raiders of the Lost Ark for his third Indy flick. The Nazis have been re-instated as the bad guys, Jones is once again in pursuit of a biblical artifact of extraordinary value and power, and to add to the proceedings Indy's father is also cast into the mix. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a lightning-paced adventure movie which refuses to let up for its entire duration.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), fresh from retrieving the Cross of Coronado after a lifelong hunt, is approached by rich entrepreneur Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) who wants him to lead a search for the Holy Grail. According to biblical legend, anyone who drinks from the Grail will be blessed with eternal life. Jones points out that he is perhaps not the right man to be selected for the quest. His father Henry Jones (Sean Connery), has spent his lifetime piecing together clues to the whereabouts of the long-lost Grail... so Jones Jr suggests that Jones Sr might be a better candidate for the job. Unfortunately, it transpires that Henry has already been working on the hunt for the Grail and has mysteriously disappeared in Venice. More than a little worried for his father's safety, Indy sets off for Europe with the dual objective of finding the Grail and his missing dad. The trail leads from Venice to Germany, to the Middle East, where Indy and co. learn that the Nazis too are keen to find the Holy Grail (presumably to immortalise their war-mongering army).Highlights include a thrilling speedboat sequence in Venice; a tank chase in the desert; glorious interplay between Ford and Conery; and an exciting ending in a booby-trapped cavern. Placed into context, this is probably the second best of the series ('Raiders...' was just a bit fresher, and featured a stronger female character in Karen Allen - in this one, Alison Doody's role is sadly a bit on the lightweight side). John Williams' instantly hummable score is as rousing as ever, and the pacing is so fast that there is rarely a moment to spare. Best moment in the film? A Nazi soldier on a motorcycle closes in on the Joneses, who are on a slower motorcycle of their own. Unable to shake the pursuer, Indy jams a pole in the front-wheel spokes of the Nazi's bike, throwing the Nazi rider spectacularly in the air. Indy laughs - clearly impressed with his improvised escape - while Henry fiddles with his pocket-watch and flares his nostrils with disapproval! Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade is the big screen equivalent of a roller-coaster ride... so strap yourself in, whiten your knuckles, and enjoy the ride!",9,0,0,12 April 2005
Warm Bodies," Interesting and unusual zombie film, a fair bit better than it sounds.
","I know what you're thinking. 'Oh dear Lord, no not another teenage-girl-falls-in-love-with-a-monster romance', right? After five mediocre and depressingly humourless. A quick glance at the plot synopsis certainly suggests that Twilight-with-zombies is the best that one could hope for here. However, appearances can be deceptive and Warm Bodies (adapted from a hit novel by Isaac Marion) is a pretty enjoyable and original twist on the concept, bristling with wit and a lot more fun to watch than the afore-mentioned adaptations of Stephenie Meyer's books. It's not perfect by a long shot, but is nevertheless worth a look.Following a worldwide apocalypse, most of the population has transformed into zombies. In an un-named American city, a handful of human survivors exist within a walled compound. They are surrounded by suburbs full of staggering zombies, hungry for a hearty meal of human brains (weirder still, after devouring brains the zombies are able to experience some of their victims' memories and thoughts). One zombie, known simply as R (Nicholas Hoult), is different from the others. Although slow-moving and barely able to speak, somewhere in his mind there remains a flicker of curiosity, a wider contemplation about what has happened to him, and a dim desire to uncover his past. He lives on an abandoned plane out on a deserted runway, where he collects old bric-a-brac that he has scavenged from the ruined city. During a run-in with human hunters, R spots a human girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and something within him is inexplicably stirred. He rescues her from being eaten by the others and smuggles her back to his plane, where he promises to protect her for a few days after which he will return her home. Against all odds, R's time with Julie reignites his long-inactive heart, and he begins to gradually metamorphosise into something more 'human'. Julie herself becomes attached to R, and their blossoming relationship stirs human emotions within the other zombies too, suggesting that it may be possible to cure them rather than blowing their brains out. The problem is that Julie's father Grigio (John Malkovich) has dedicated his life to wiping out zombies, building an army of soldiers who go out on regular sorties to kill as many of the walking dead as possible. Will Julie and R be able to convince him that there is another way, or has his frenzied bloodlust driven him past the point of no return?It soon becomes apparent that Warm Bodies owes more to Romeo and Juliet than Twilight. It's no accident that the main characters are called R and Julie, nor that they find love when their people are meant to be sworn enemies. Just in case you're not getting the parallels, there's even at one point an amusingly played twist on the famous Romeo and Juliet balcony scene. The film gets a lot of mileage from its wry humour and continual insistence of flipping conventions on their head. Hoult gives a warm performance as a character who should be anything but warm; Aussie actress Palmer shows a decent emotional range as the heroine of the piece too, delivering a winning performance which will no doubt result in us seeing plenty more of her over the coming years. Malkovich is his usual dependable self as the grief-stricken zombie killer whose humanity may be too far gone to save. It's a small role but exceptionally well-played, but then you wouldn't expect anything less. There are weaknesses along the way, such as occasional logic loopholes and disappointingly clunky CGI villains in the shape of the 'bonies' (skeletal zombies who have peeled off their flesh and are beyond redemption). With its relatively brief running time, one also wishes from time to time that Warm Bodies would milk its own possibilities a little more – there certainly seems to be scope for an even more in-depth and satisfying look at this fascinating divided apocalyptic society. The film scratches the surface but leaves one lamenting that there isn't more. Overall, however, Warm Bodies is better than expected. The zombie genre is already far too heavily populated, but this film manages to find some new and interesting angles to justify its existence (it's certainly one of the first films – maybe THE first – to be told from the zombie perspective). Give it a look – you could do a lot worse.",6,1,3,1 May 2013
Evil Dead II," Sequel to Evil Dead opts for laughs - 'slapstick gore' as its has been labelled. Give me the original any time!
","As a trilogy, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series doesn't really weigh up. The first film is an ultra low-budget – but quite suspensefully made – gore film, containing many genuinely unnerving moments thanks to its clever camera work and editing. The second and third films in the series change the tone and style completely, aiming instead for a cartoonishly over-the-top comedy feel – 'slapstick gore' as it has been described in some circles, reminiscent of a Three Stooges movie except that it's full of dismemberment and other such bloody delights. If you're after a serious, genuinely scary style of film, then Part One is the one to watch. If you're after something spectacularly bloody yet simultaneously humorous, then numbers 2 and 3 fit the bill. For me, the original Evil Dead is a quintessential master-class in low budget horror-making skillful, tight, often very frightening. This sequel doesn't really work, showing too much affinity for its madcap gore and monsters. Evil Dead II has a much larger cult following than its predecessor but, at risk of upsetting this army of loyal fans, I'm going to stick my neck out and admit I really don't like it.Survivor of the original film Ash (Bruce Campbell) is unable to escape from the woodland cabin where he so recently endured the mother of all bad nights. Trapped for yet another evening, he prepares himself to endure more freakish horrors as the light begins to fade. He is joined by four outsiders – Annie (Sarah Berry), whose parents originally unleashed the demons in the cabin whilst researching the Book of the Dead; Ed (Richard Domeier), a professor who is also Annie's research partner and boyfriend; Jake (Dan Hicks), a white-trash handyman; and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva), Jake's air-headed trailer-trash girlfriend. The five inhabitants of the cabin are left to endure various spooky events, bloodthirsty demon attacks, bodily possessions/invasions, and so on and so forth, before they finally figure out a way to send the demons back from whence they came.Raimi's bigger budget proves a curse rather than a blessing here. He doesn't need to build up to the shock moments slowly and carefully this time around. If he requires an elaborate monster to pop up suddenly, then that is just what happens if he needs gallons of blood and bile to gush forth rather than a mere trickle, then gallons is what he gets. The unfortunate thing is that the original worked so well because Raimi had figured out that often less can be more – his slow and skillful build-ups created real intensity. That philosophy is completely dismissed here, as Raimi opts to throw a non-stop barrage of gross and gooey carnage at the viewer right from the start. There's still a degree of inventiveness on show, especially in the scene where Ash has to sever his own hand after it becomes possessed. The sight of his uncontrollable 'demon hand' smashing plates over his head and trying to gouge at his own face, not to mention dragging his unconscious body across the floor, is rather funny. Sadly, in other parts of the film much of the humour over-shoots the mark, coming across as 'frantic' and 'hysterical' rather than genuinely funny. The acting is pretty terrible all-round. Campbell has a goofy self-confidence which enables him to nearly get away with it but the others simply look inept, their hopelessly amateurish efforts serving only to damage the film further. Evil Dead II will undoubtedly appeal to some, with its penchant for bad taste comedy and breakneck slapstick carnage. However, if its outlandish sense of humour is not to your taste, you may find this a very long 84 minutes indeed.",4,3,8,29 May 2013
