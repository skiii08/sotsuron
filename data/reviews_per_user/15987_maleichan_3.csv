Skyfall," Atypical Bond-flick
","Skyfall is an atypical Bond movie, in that it is a lot less extravagant in its plot and gadgets, and focuses a lot more on the person of James Bond himself. The quintessential Bond-girl is also missing, this time around. Still, I found the movie thoroughly enjoyable, even if it missed the wow-factor of Casino Royal. Decent script, good action (especially the opening sequence), beautiful title song by Adele.Skyfall introduces new actors in the roles of M, Q and Moneypenny. We might expect to see them in future movies as well.Javier Bardem wows as the wonderfully wicked villain.",8,0,8,23 November 2012
Argo," Suspense with a 70's feel
","Argo is directed by Ben Affleck. The movie is based on the story of six American diplomats who escaped the American embassy in Tehran at the time of the hostage crisis in 1979/1980 and hid out in (among other places) the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran. Affleck is cast as the CIA agent who is tasked with getting the six diplomats out of Iran. The movie breathes the 70's in clothes, facial hair, settings, etc. If you had come across it on the television, you would believe you were watching a rerun of Airport. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, especially during the second half, when the exfiltration operation is under way. It has a solid script and the acting is good. (Look for a lot of familiar faces in support roles.)Still, Argo didn't blow me away like the other movies that Affleck wrote and/or directed did. That might simply be because I am not a huge fan of the based-on-a-true-story-genre. Because, in truth, there is very little wrong with this picture.",7,1,2,23 November 2012
Pitch Perfect," Music makes this the best chick flick I've seen in a while
","You do not need to watch Pitch Perfect for the storyline. New member joins downhill-sliding club, changes things around, and everybody lives happily ever after: been there, done that. Also, the film's humor is on more than one occasion in exceedingly bad taste: think dubious sexual references and several scenes with vomit that could have come straight out of an Adam Sandler-movie.You do need to watch Pitch Perfect, however, for its music: the vibrant musical episodes make the movie sparkle and the audience dance in their seats. The picture boasts some strong vocals (contrary to, for example, High School Musical), although it is a shame that the actors are mainly lip-singing. (And I do hope that we are hearing the actual singing actors themselves, instead of 'ghost-singers'.) The obligatory love story is not quite as predictable as in other chick flicks, and the main protagonists make a cute couple.",8,1,3,5 January 2013
