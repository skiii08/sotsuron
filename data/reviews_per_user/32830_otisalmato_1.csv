Mission: Impossible III," The Best Mission Than The Previous Two!
","Dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb.. Dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb.. Soon when the theme by Lalo Schifrin starts to play after the teaser opening, my blood vessels felt like injected by an excitement serum and my eyes didn't blink for a millisecond till the line up of co-stars ends with a loud bang. I know its gonna be a hell of a roller-coaster ride by then. And I was right. Around 1.45 minutes later, I have reached my final conclusion about this film.. Mission: Impossible III is by far the best series than the previous two!Synopsis: Super-spy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from active duty to trains new IMF agents. But he is called back into action to retrieve a captured agent Lindsey (Keri Russell) from the toughest villain he's ever faced - Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an international weapons and information provider with no remorse and no conscience. Hunt assembles his team - his old friend Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), transportation expert Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), background operative Zhen (Maggie Q), - to travel the globe pursuing Davian, and inadvertently puts Ethan's love, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), in a very great danger.I was really-really thankful for how I underestimated this movie before. When I step inside the Cinema, I have put down my guard, no expectations, and just plainly want to enjoy Mr. Cruise's screen persona which never failed me, and Keri Russell who I have crushed since 'Felicity'. Apparently all I got is way more than I bargained for. M:i III is back to where the original of the TV series are rooted. Firstly, I love the fact that this film is not an ego-driven vehicle like the first two films. When I got to see Ethan's team hand-in-hand in every mission from start till end of this film, I said to myself, 'This is what I'm talking about!'. I've been a fan of the TV series, and the Mission: Impossible movies (so far) really didn't work that much for me.. Until I saw this one!I love every aspects of the film. I love the script which focuses on Ethan's personal life, and stresses that teamwork is the key to success. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the perfect slimy piece of s**t named Owen Davian. Seeing him match wits with Cruise's Ethan when both of them are at the top of their respective games is worth the admission price alone. I love the rest of the cast.. Ooohh I love them. Laurence Fishburne is always delivers gritty one-liners. Keri Russel does action bits, are lovely (I love the hair Keri!). The comic stir-up by Ving Rhames, are entertaining. Michelle Monaghan and her sweetness, aside of her being casted is suspiciously because of her resemblance to Katie Holmes. And as for the rest of the cast, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q, although their character are one dimensional, I could understand that this film based on Ethan's point of view. They're there to finish the job, then that's it that we need to know. Too bad, Billy Crudup's character are so underwritten that I couldn't understand and missed the part where his involvement took place.But that one tiny bit of flaw is already forgotten and forgiven once I saw the 'Facemaker'. Yep, I guess that's what it's name. It was the tool where the agents used to copy the face of their subject, done it into a mask, and, voilà a perfect undercover. And the gadgets to copy their subjects voice are also fascinating. I love the scene where these utilities are written, they're gripping. Just like in the TV series.I also love the ending. The twists of 'the-who-dunnit' ending really fooled me. Which is good, that this means the film is out of the cliché universe. Overall, I love the action scenes. The real star of this movie is, the one and only Mr. Tom Cruise himself. I'm sure he got beaten, battered up, bruised up, knocked down several times to complete these magnificent scenes. I believe his totalitarianism throughout this movie are not in this world. A double thumbs up on his instinct to believe this project directed by J.J Abrams from 'Lost' and 'Alias' stardom.I cant wait for the Special Edition DVD. Sign me up!",9,1,1,21 April 2012
