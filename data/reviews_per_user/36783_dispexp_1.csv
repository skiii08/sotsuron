Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not the better half
","Lacks the style and action of the first volume and there should have been some warning that the second part would be absolutely nothing at all like the first part. Actually Tarantino did give a subtle warning but the first part can be greatly misleading. However this movie gets better every time you watch it. It more typical Tarantino fare when compared with the first half. The expected dialog is long and detailed. Most of the scenes and acting have been done flawlessly. However, had it had just one major, well choreographed fight scene at the very end, it would have so much better. The ending is thus quite disappointing. Overall, the first part, as a wild explosive party was just so much more fun and memorable.",Null,2,4,6 July 2006
