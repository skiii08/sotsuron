Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," OMFG! How can one guy be so funny
","OK first off if you are offended by anything at all, you should not see this film! especially if you are offended by Pamela Anderson or by naked dudes fighting.moving on, borat is a work of genius. the movie, mixing unsuspecting American reactions with 2 or 3 very disturbing scripted story lines (his obsession with Pammy, his relationship with his fat (and i mean fat) manager, and the fact that a very large black prostitute falls in love with him). despite these stories, it is the Americans who make the film as funny as it is...be it him nearly getting lynched at a rodeo because he sings the Kazakhstan 'national anthem', bringing a black prostitute to a dinner with devout Texans, drinking while trying to pass his drivers licence...all of which bring about cringe worthy reactions from his less-then-tolerant peers as a film it successfully mixes extreme slapstick with political satire, Sascha Baron successfully uses his Jewish background to offend and to show a shocking acceptance of pretty much anything by the Americans. his speech at the rodeo shows how Americans hear only what they want when it comes to the war in Iraq ('we support your war OF terror') overall never has a film so successfully mixed comedy with a serious message about the tolerance of the worlds biggest power. if you haven't seen this film, but want a conformation of how intolerant Americans are - see this film.if your open minded and like a comedy - see this film if your easily offended you shouldn't even be looking at this page!",10,21,32,15 February 2007
