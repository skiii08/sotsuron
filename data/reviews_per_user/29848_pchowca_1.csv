Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Surprisingly good, well exceeded my expectation.
","Beautifully shoot. Great acting. Surprisingly believable story line. Enough tension to grip my attention thru out. Nice ending. The vampire killings were done in good taste FX. This is the best movie for me so far in this year although I liked Avenger, Promethus and John Carter. It reminded me the excitement that I received from watching Raider of Lost ark for the first time. Many people would not see it because they think it is just a vampire killing show. If I were the director, I would change the title something like Abraham Lincoin, the untold secret. Go for it if you are not sure if this movie is right for you or not. I recommended this because this movie is so well made.",9,4,8,28 June 2012
