Requiem for a Dream," Brillant. Period.
","This film's effect is blinding....you don't realize the impact of all you've seen until after the viewing experience.  Though the content seems initially depressing, this film's draw is in the realistic portrayal of drug addiction's trance.  Every character is caught in the trace, so much so that their inevitable downward spiral still catches us offguard.  We are hopeful that some redemption takes place, but the director is brave enough to give us realistic resolutions that are, oddly enough, satisfying in their honesty.  Every performance hits notes that are honest, subtle, overt....true life.  Marlon Wayans' performance is so refreshing....there IS someone home....and he was finally given an opportunity to show a range of colors and emotions here...he deserves much praise for a great performance. Jared Leto, and, especially, Jennifer Connoly's performance, is heartbreaking.  See this film, as hard as it may be to watch, it is an unforgettable experience.  Thank God Ellen Burstyn has returned....bravo!",Null,0,0,22 October 2000
