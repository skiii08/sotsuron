Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good
","I expected alot less from this film, i left the theatre very happy, George lucas said that he released the middle three first because they were the most exciting, so basically this was just to fill in the gaps. The only problems i had with it were, the kid who played annakin, and Darth maul, the kid becasue he was such a bad actor that he was making me uncomfortable, and darth maul because he was criminally underused, other than that, great film 10/10",Null,0,0,7 April 2000
Ali," Amazing
","What an amazing film this is. I walked out of the cinema in awe of what i had just seen. Will Smith truly did one of the most amazing transformations in the history of film, he is Muhammad Ali, he walks the walk and talks the talk perfectly. The supporting cast also were incredible, my only dispointment comes from the fact that for the director could have used the length of the film to cover more of the champs life rather than just focusing on those years, but i can't complain to much, he did a wonderful job with what he did. Fantastic film, 10/10",Null,0,0,4 March 2002
Minority Report," Amazing!!!
","I would have to say that this is one my favorite movies this year, i absolutely loved it. I have a few complaints but the positive stuff definately outweighs the negative. I think that the reason i love it so much is because unlike other science fiction movie, the future is a pretty realistic vision, theres no flying cars, cities in the sky and not everybody walks around in a silver jump suit with anti gravity boots on. The acting is amazing, Tom Cruise is at his best as John Anderton, and even though i have never been a huge fan of Steven Spielberg, this was a very well directed movie by someone showing us he is more than just a grown up kid. The plot is one of the best ideas ever, what if we could catch criminals before they commit crimes, is it right to arrest someone for something they haven't done yet, definately a moral dilemma. My only disappointment is the last 15 minutes of the movie, with the 'every ends up working out for the best' ending, i think it could have been done a lot better. Overall, great film, great performances, 9/10",9,0,0,23 July 2002
Fight Club," Great Film
","Fight Club was one of the best films of 1999, Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden, Ed Norton is equally as good as the narrator. From the Visually stunning opening sequence to the credits, fight club had me glued to the screen, it was not at all hard to follow, and the violence wasn't as bad as i'd expected it to be. Alot of people over-analyse films like Fight Club saying that they will trigger copycat violence, i think these people should stop looking to the movies for excuses to explain why such tragic things happen in our society. Anyway, great film. 9/10",10,0,1,12 February 2000
Memento," Brilliant!!!
","I saw this film when it first opened and it jumped straight in to my top five list, all i can say about this is that it is absolutely brilliant. The premise is fantastically original, a man with no short term memory trying to find his wifes killer with the help of someone he doesn't know at all, or at least thats what he thinks. I think the film going in reverse while inter-cutting in forwards action is a brilliant idea and it works fantastically in this film. Guy Pearce deserves a lot of credit for pulling off the role of Leonard Shelby, he is amazing, as is the supporting cast. Like Fight Club, this film was severly overlooked at the oscars, adding to my opinion that the oscars mean nothing whatsoever. Overall, brilliant, everything is great in this movie 10/10",10,0,2,23 July 2002
Insomnia," Excellent
","I just came out of this film and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. I won't even try to compare it to Memento because they are such different films. This is a slow moving, claustraphobic film, with great performances by all involved, Al Pacino is one of the best actors in the world and can always be relied for a fantastic performance, Robin Williams also gives a great performance, a lot of people have said that he was scary/crazy enough, but for me the character was played perfectly, as someone who really didn't believe he was a killer but was really just a lunatic waiting to boil over, Hillary Swank was good in a smaller roll. The direction from Christopher Nolan was excellent, i loved the little flashes of light and the use of sound as a distraction for Will Dormer who hadn't slept in six days and couldn't concentrate on anything, little things like that are so often overlooked. Overall, great film, brilliant performances, a little bit slow 8/10",Null,0,0,25 July 2002
Snatch," Brilliant
","SpoilersDespite what others say about this just being a copy of lock stock, it has a lot more class and style and has a much better plot and cast, it goes along the same lines, but shows ritchie has matured in to a better director since his last film. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond that everyone is after and bareknuckle boxing fights that are supposed to be rigged, but keep getting ruined by a pikey, (irish gypsy), who keeps knocking his opponents out. The story is very interesting and moves along at a fast pace making sure you don't get to caught up in the plot, some parts are funny, others brutal, and others just fantastic to watch, (the final fight with micky, and a car accident involving three different sets of main characters, shown from three different angles, brilliant). The main characters are interesting and likeable, (all apart from, brick top, who i thought was a bit nasty when he could of been a bit funnier), turkish is a good lead, and brad pitt puts in a fantastic performance making you wish he was on the screen more often. Great film, and will probably have american appeal because of the varied cast with names americans will recognise.10/10",10,0,1,17 September 2000
U-571," Good
","If good films are measured by how much money they make, then the shawshank redemption, (which bombed at the box office), is a bad film. Now we all know that isn't true, but going by what the idiot who posted a comment on here said, it must be. Just because a film makes so much money at the movies doesn't mean it is a good film, it means that there is a total lack of good films for people to see. This is an o.k film, but not the best i've ever seen, it's loud and it has lots of action, and sometimes that isn't bad. I am English and i studied history and i know that the Americans had almost nothing to do with the capture of the enigma machine, but to all you brits who are complaining, Get a life, it's a movie, they ignored the facts probably because when the british did get the enigma machine, it was so god damn boring that it couldn't be made in to the movie, i know a lot of english people who hassle the yanks for being so patriotic, take your own advice and let it go, if it's entertaining, then thats all that matters.",Null,0,2,24 April 2000
Ocean's Eleven," Great cast in a great movie
","This film is one of the reasons why i love films so much, sometimes a film can come together like this that exceeds all your expectations. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, what a cast all directed perfectly by steven soderbergh. Goerge Clooney is the charasmatic leader of the bunch, who, with the help of a very cool Brad Pitt, puts together one of best robberies ever, three casinos in Las vegas. The film is great, the cast is top notch, a real achievement. Overall, 9/10",10,1,2,23 July 2002
Mulholland Drive," A fantastic Puzzle
","*****SPOILERS***** O.k, so Betty is really Diane and shes having a dream about something that happened to her except she changes everything in the dream to suit herself, i.e she came to hollywood to become an actress, in reality the part went to Camilla and in her dream she makes it so that the director was forced to choose Camilla when he really wanted her, meanwhile she has already landed herself a part in a different movie, notice that the director mentions that the girl who auditioned before her had brown hair, a reference to rita/camilla, they say her performance was forced, this is her way of making herself a better actress than camilla, at least thats what i think is going on, you can never be too sure. That is the beauty of this film, after my first viewing, all i could say was... What the??? Only on the second viewing did i pick up little things and come to those conclusions about the dream. I love films that make me think and especially ones that confuse me as i am not easily fooled with movies, Memento did to a certain extent last year and this definately did it to me this year. I can't fault this film at all, music, cinamatography and acting are all done perfectly, the only thing i do have a problem with is the significance of one scene, the scene being the one with the hitman killing his friend over a black book, it is never really explained and i don't know what the black book was for, maybe it was tied in to why rita was getting shot in the beginning but i really can't figure it out, oh well, i guess i will just have to watch it again. Fantastic, surreal, beautiful, perfect, i love this film. 10/10.",Null,0,1,22 July 2002
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Great Film
","Let me start this review by saying i hate vampire films, i think they are all crap and have no point to exist at all, but like with everything, there is one exception to this rule, and it's this movie. Maybe it was the fantastic cast that did it for me, i think Tom Cruise was prefectly cast as was Brad Pitt, the acting is great and the story was interesting enough to keep me watching. Overall, great film, great acting 9/10",9,1,2,23 July 2002
