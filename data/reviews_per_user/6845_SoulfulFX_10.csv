Howl's Moving Castle," Howl's Moving Castle
","This is a Miyazaki film but not his story, rather a story he took on for a colleague. We have Sophie, a young girl in an early 20th-century-esque war-torn country who gets cursed by a witch to turn into an old hag. To break the curse, she seeks out Howl -a powerful wizard- and his mobile magical castle. Also dwelling there are the fire demon Calcifer (which also holds Howl's heart), and a young boy learning magic. As the story goes, Sophie and Howl fall in love with each other while trying to thwart the witch's curse on Sophie and somehow restore Howl's heart without destroying both him and Calcifer. This is a really touching love story and well worth watching how the supporting characters, magic, and vivid environment bring Howl and Sophie together.",10,1,2,7 March 2007
Star Trek," A new 'all-time' movie
","I loved this movie through and through. It has all the elements of a great film...tons of action, comedy, adventure, and even some dashes of romance.The new crew pull off their iconic roles superbly, many of them looking like dead-ringers of their characters' former selves. But these were not copies. These were honest refreshing portrayals that stay true to the characters Roddenberry created while giving the 21st century a fresh breath of the 23rd.The new Enterprise is beautiful! I understand Abrams was taken with the introduction of the ship in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and I can see the influences in the presentation of the vessel in this movie.The plot is a good mix of old and new. There are some drastic departures from Star Trek canon which were intentional and I thought appropriate for Abrams goal of re-envisioning the story. There are enough of the classic elements, phrases, tech, and relationships to keep the old fans sated while new twists open up infinite possibilities for more stories.Can't wait for more!",10,2,13,9 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","This turned out to be a great finale for the 'POTC' movies. Don't be discouraged by its runtime (2 hours 46 minutes)! The movie is so well paced and full of action that you never notice the time pass. The movie includes the gags and jokes that have made its predecessors so much fun and the Keith Richards cameo was a nice touch. There is some room for romance the heartbreak between Davy Jones and Calypso versus the union between Will and Elizabeth. There is the fun foiled banter between Jack Sparrow and Barbossa plus the rest of the familiar faces and a few new ones. There is one heck of a battle sequence near the end, a truly awesome duel of ships! In short, this is a job well done! Don't miss it! Go now!",10,3,5,27 May 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A destiny beyond green destiny
","This film is simply marvelous. I'm a huge anime fan (Dragon Ball, Rurouni Kenshin, and the like) and if I were going to do a live action version of one, Crouching Tiger would be a nice film to model after.
Helped along by fantastic martial arts action, sword-play, and some nice flying effects.... this story beautifully wields the lives of its characters into a captivating film that gets its viewers lost in in the beauty of the environment as much as the intrigue of the people. Love, treachery, honor, and even boredom with high-class living all bare their teeth in this gorgeous piece of cinema.No spoilers here...go see this movie...no person with a working pair of eyes should live without seeing this.",10,0,1,7 September 2003
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Amazing!
","This is incredible! I happened to own another Miyazaki masterpiece, 'Mononoke-hime,' and this is comparable. It's gorgeously animated with thoughtfully crafted characters from Nausicaa herself to her rival kingdoms.The story in a nut-shell is you have Nausicaa trying to keep the peace between rival kingdoms and toxic/mutant insects leftover 1,000 years after the last major war on earth with nuclear weapons.So you get provincial fighting, abuse of nature being punished, a charming relationship between Nausicaa and the jungle, and a lot of lessons learned.Now...go get it!",10,0,1,27 February 2005
Transformers," Transformers
","'Transformers' - A really splendid adaption of the once 1980s toyline and spawner of numerous TV animated series. The movie takes a little time to get started, a slow introduction, but it picks up pace very quickly and there's no shortage of robot-mashing action and explosions throughout the film. There is actually a decent attempt at character development with some humorous moments between Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his would-be girlfriend (Megan Fox). Basic plot is pretty simple as it is throughout 'Transformers' lore... Autobots and Decepticons came from the planet Cybertron after it was torn apart by war to the Earth to find a new source of energy for machine-based life. Witwicky is a decendent of a colonial-era sea captain who had found Megatron inadvertently frozen in the Arctic and who had accidentally left an imprinting of the power-source's location on the great-grandfather's glasses which are now in Sam's possession. Sam and Mikaela team up with the Autobots to destroy the the source-cube and fend off the Decepticons with the help of the military and a cagey Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight who has become LaBeouf's real-life mentor). I was pleased to see the robots not coming off goofy or over-wrought. Michael Bay has done a great job bringing the old-school toy series to realistic life on the big screen.",8,2,6,4 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
","At 2 hrs and 18 mins. this is actually on the short end of runtimes for 'Potter' films, but delivers plenty of bang for the buck. The Dursleys make a reappearance, the angst from the 4th film continues, and the wizarding world is in plenty of uproar over whether or not Voldemorte is really back. Harry and Dumbledore endure repeated attempts to sully their word as the Ministry for Magic asserts the dark lord has not returned. A special group of wizard, the Order of the Phoenix, knows better and rescues Harry from Privet Drive after a surprise dementor attack. Once at Hogwarts, only a handful of students believe Harry and Dumbledore while the rest openly mock him or keep their distance. Harry meets Luna Lovegood, a classmate who has seen death like him and so can see magnificent flying beasts called Thestrals. But also on the scene is Dolores Umbridge -a Ministry hack under Cornelius Fudge who interferes at Hogwarts and replaces Dumbledore at the school when her strict rules and underlings discover Harry has been teaching other students how to defend themselves against the dark arts. However, Harry has also been plagued by mental contact from Voldemort. Snape has been trying to teach Harry the skill of occulemency to block these invasions but Harry continues to see visions including an attack on Arthur Weasley and a faked attack on Sirius Black to lure Harry and his friends into the Department of Mysteries so he can retrieve an orb of prophecy regarding him and Voldemort. A battle ensues between the children, the Death eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix climaxing with Sirius's death and Dumbledore's reappearance to defend Harry from Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (murderer of Nevelle Longbottom's parents).Of course there's an enormity of material in the book that doesn't make it to the movie. Some scenes that do make it in include Harry's half-hearted courtship with Cho Chang and the Weasley twins' celebrated escape from Hogwarts while Umbridge is control, and a few others. All-in-all, I think the movie did an admirable job with the volume of material it had to pack into a feature length film. Can't wait for the next two!",9,0,0,15 July 2007
The Last Samurai," A respectful film
","I was pleasantly surprised by this film.The landscapes, characters, and respect shown to the Samurai and their craft makes this film truly great.The violence, while strong, was not the least bit gratuitous which is rare in movies these days. The striving of two cultures to understand each other gave this movie something great to latch on to.I recommend this film to anyone looking for a movie that can treat this culture with a decent amount of respect.",8,1,2,13 December 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free Or Die Hard
","'Live Free Or Die Hard': A great action film in the traditions of the 'Die Hard' series. Lots of explosions, John McClane taking out the bad guys, and good guys winning the day. This movie introduces his daughter character I believe you do glimpse in the first movie as a child as well as a hacker kid McClane has to keep alive while the U.S. government (mostly the FBI) tries to thwart cyber terrorists that have shut down most of the nation's key systems ...transportation, communications, financial, utilities, etc... That being said, the plot is pretty progressive and straightforward, no real twists or surprises... just a lot of cool explosions and stunts (the taking out a helicopter with a car scene is worth the admission!). So, no Oscar here for best picture, but a good couple of hours of popcorn popping. And yes... he does say THAT line at least once !",8,0,2,1 July 2007
Midway," Midway
","Really brackets the historical events prior to Midway well--especially from Enterprise's perspective. Nice inclusion of vignettes from the lead up, and battle itself. Some gloss over on the intel build up, but I expect that's due to runtime constraints.While this has the usual war film embellishments, I think it does well for tackling so much in the time it had--definitely worth a watch.",10,66,118,8 November 2019
