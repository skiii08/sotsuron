The Blair Witch Project," How DID they make it, anyway?
","I'm sure you've all heard that the kids (actors) were thrown into the woods and shortly after they were disoriented and scared by the directors. Sounds neat?  Well it would be, if that were how it was done.  I watched the movie knowing all this, and all I could think about was the four dollars I wasted on renting it.  Throw the kids in the woods, they get lost... I can believe that.  Throw in a compass, and make them end up walking around in circles for 3 days... now thats hard to believe.  If you follow a compass going one direction, it is impossible to go in circles.  Really.  The trio knew what they were doing the entire time... the fact that the directors purposely got them lost was just another piece of the overwhelming hype that was Blair Witch.Oh and a sound track for a musicless movie?  Thats downright shameless.",Null,0,0,25 October 1999
