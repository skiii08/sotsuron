The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Gave me hope
","Several things about this movie made me cringe: the recycled 'unique girl that likes cool unpopular music', classic novels, a really cute kid who is bullied for no good reason, or Emma Watson's poor American accent. But truth be told, the movie got better as it went on. I really loved the characters though, especially Charlie. A really lovable movie that gave me hope, that's really all I can say. I hate life a little less because of this movie.",9,1,2,25 July 2017
Whiplash," The worst goddamn movie, infuriatingly bad
","I knew that Damien Chazelle was overrated after witnessing the immense hype over La La Land. It was good but not 8.3 good. This movie certainly is not 8.5 good. It's utterly disgusting to me that this movie received such high praise. I can see what it aimed to do but it failed so miserably in my eyes.I can't fault the cinematography. The performances, I admit were also spot on, both Teller and Simmons are clearly good actors (even though I've never seen Simmons play anything but a barking dog).The entire movie I was waiting for a moment where the tyrant would crack or be punished or change, but it never came and by the end, I hoped to see him get hit by a truck too. When that lawyer showed up I thought 'finally! That kid's gonna stop that bastard from abusing him or anyone else' but he was like 'whatever, do what ya want'. Queue truck number two.I don't understand how a movie that condones and encourages the absolute disregard for human rights can be rated so highly; I don't understand how the misogyny and homophobia are brushed over. Someone killed themselves because of that jerk and he still doesn't regret any of his actions.Chazelle is obsessed with ambition (and with jazz) and he prioritizes it over humanity and love which I can't stand. He makes his characters self-centered and selfish in the name of ambition and art. He sure has a way of making me not care for the protagonists. I mean, what does it matter if you are a household name and made really great music -or any other type of art- if you were a bad person? What the hell is the meaning of a nice-sounding jazz song if there is no beautiful feeling behind it? This movie's ultimate message is that to be an artist you must abandon your humanity and loved ones and that is something I cannot accept.This movie has given me a headache and it's not just because of the loud drums.",1,3,10,31 May 2017
