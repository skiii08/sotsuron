The Blair Witch Project," A Disappointment
","People will say the movie is amazing because of its subtlety and nuance. They will say the movie is about real people in real danger blah blah. I say that is pretentious hogwash.The movie was an utter disappointment. I feel cheated. I call this movie a lie in the sense that the title does not hold true, nor does the movie result in anything remotely close to horror. I call this movie a waste of your time. That is all.",1,5,8,13 June 2017

","I regularly do not write reviews, but after reading a few unjust and nonsensical reviews concerning this movie I felt I needed to. I'm not going to try to explain some of the ideas applied in the movie, I'm only going to try to talk briefly about them and maybe validate their significance. I'd like to first just say this movie is indeed an experience of a lifetime, and if given the opportunity to see it in IMAX, I urge anyone and everyone to re-watch it. The cast is just spectacular, their chemistry speaks more than my review can ever. The story is an original take on an already claimed frontier. Where the underlying theme, and conflict of the story is not in the science - although it will be the main topic of my review - of it, but the family values.Now for what I feared would happen before this movie came out, and what certainly did - the inability to understand the science. This movie follows the laws of physics the closest any sci-fi movie ever has. If you don't believe me, pick up a copy of Dr. Kip Thorne's 'The Science of Interstellar'. Thorne has spent the majority of his life dedicated to the study of physics, when a man of his caliber is consulting on the science aspect of the movie how can anyone say otherwise. Sadly, there are some viewers that do.I was reading the reviews and I came across one that was basically a parody synopsis. As amusing as it was, it was radiating the writer's inability to understand simple plot-points of the movie. The one I'd like to address; Time-Dilation and Relativity. The writer criticized on how preposterous it is for time on one planet to be slower than the time on our own, and then followed up by saying 'where's Einstein when you need him?'. Ironically, it was Einstein who successfully explained this phenomenon, and to the readers I just want to say it is scientifically accurate. Also, it's kind of strange that the user would have trouble understanding it when several times do Romilly and Brand bring up the idea of relativity, oh well.The Wormhole: In one of the reviews here on IMDb, a user placed quotations around the word, and talked of it, as if it were a fantastical idea. No, in fact it has been mathematically proved for this phenomenon to exist. It is called an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, the name is sufficient. It was studied and validated by one of the greatest minds of our species, and is still being studied by some of the smartest people on our planet.",10,3,7,20 March 2015
