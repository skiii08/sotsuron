10 Cloverfield Lane," Um...what?
","I gave it 3 stars because of the halfway decent 'contained' thriller plot line, though somewhat predictable. John Goodman did a pretty good job as the creepy, tense underground caretaker.Then aliens show up.I realize it had a connection with the original 'Cloverfield', but never in my life have I felt like a different film started playing in the last 15 minutes. It was completely disjointed and 180 degrees from what you believed the premise to be. And not in a good way. It completely killed the movie for me. Like taking a bazooka to a housefly. Utterly ridiculous nonsense. Obviously, opinions vary, and I just got done reading the glowing Variety review of it - which I really can't figure out for the life of me - so enjoy it for what it is, I guess.",3,0,1,11 July 2016
Fury," Good Grief
","This movie is terrible, and I'm only 47 minutes in. There's no point, other than glorified carnage and body parts, which 'Saving Private Ryan' already introduced us to years ago - in a much more realistic manner, I might add. The sound of the German tank in 'Ryan' is terrifying, something this film fails to capture in any essence. Just a scared kid and the hardened tank crew that can wipe out scores of Nazis and never suffer a scratch, apparently (I won't watch it all the way to the end, so I guess I won't find out).I have really enjoyed the roles Brad Pitt has selected for himself throughout his career, but this one is deeply disappointing. It should be a rule that only Kathryn Bigelow gets to direct war movies from here on out, heh.",1,7,15,30 January 2015
Steve Jobs," 'Steve Jobs' Parallels 'The Social Network'
","I love Sorkin as a writer, but after screening 'Steve Jobs' last night, I realized what I hate about his lead characters in both 'Jobs' and in 'The Social Network': they're emotionally-stunted fanatics who talk and process more like a robot than an actual human. While I'm sure both Jobs and Zuckerberg share some similarities - being driven to succeed and wanting to see their vision through - you end up not liking the subject throughout the film. By the time Jobs warms up in the last five or six minutes, it's too little too late. I spent most of the film thinking, 'this guy's a jerk - why would I find this entertaining?' There's nothing to root for.Aside from an unlikable lead character, I did think Fassbender and Winslet played their roles very well. I had forgotten Seth Rogen was playing Woz, and thought he did well enough in comedic relief. Overall, I give it a C+.",6,0,0,20 February 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great performances, inspiring story
","I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness. This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain a bit transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.",9,175,234,7 December 2006
