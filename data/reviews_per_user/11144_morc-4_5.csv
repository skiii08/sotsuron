Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Best Tarantino Film
","Yes.. I know many of you will disagree and claim that Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs is the best QT film. But as I did, you will also grow up and see the splendour that is this film.I first saw this movie 3 years ago and found it quite boring, actually. I thought that Kill Bill 1 was better and had more fighting in it. Now 3 years later, I just watched them again and I can't believe how unobservant I was back then. This time, I could see 1000 things more than I could 3 years ago. This is not only about violence, but also about the sheer beauty of atmosphere and dialogue.Tarantino has topped his career with volume 2 of Kill Bill. The atmospheres he captures in this film is among the best I have ever experienced. The music and sound is the best in a movie since Pulp Fiction. The dialogue, especially with David Carradine is so sophisticated, that I demand an Oscar for Carradine for the way he carries that out. Sitting in front of the fireplace playing his flute and telling stories. Surprising Uma with her child and charming her and being so cool about every situation always coming up with brilliant lines. Bravo! A guy I didn't even know existed, made me shiver with his performance and he does it just as good as David Carradine. Kill Bills 'father' played by Michael Parks delivers one of the best performances, I have ever witnessed. He plays some 80 years old Mexican-American whorehouse manager far out in nowhere whom Uma Thurman drives to see to get to know where Bill is. An Oscar to Michael Parks would have been in it's place. He is so slick and disgusting and I don't know what it is he does with his face, but it is genius! That calmness of his voice. A Don Juan and with an accent and a way of speaking, that I have never seen before. Wow! Michael Parks also plays the father of the two cops we see in kill bill one in the church, and I liked him very much in that part as well.David Carradine deserves an Oscar for his role as the boss Bill. He is so great and sophisticated, so well articulate and cultivated, so charming that you almost get to like him. But you can always see through him and you know that he is an evil soab and you are never sure where you've got him. You are never sure, if he really has good intentions. Remember to see the deleted scene on the DVD! Here you get to see him fight. You don't in the real film.Uma Thurman is also extremely brilliant in this movie. In the scene, where she is at the wedding rehearsal and meets Bill outside of the church, I could read her mind. An expression tells more than a thousand words.Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah have great roles as well and carries them out beautifully.The last character I would like to mention who contributes to making this film as great as it is, is Pai Mei played by Gordon Liu. He is the comic relief of the film and he does an excellent job as the mysterious supernatural Chinese mentor far out in the jungle. He actually also plays Johnny Mo in Kill Bill 1! I could go on and on.. The bottom line is, that every word spoken in this film and how it is carried out has been put thought into. If you like great acting, you have to see this film. If you love great fighting scenes, you should see it as well as they are totally amazing. All of them.10/10",10,2,4,25 August 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Levels below the first 2 Pirates..
","This was a big disappointment. What a boring story. I am not even sure, there was a real story, and if there was, it was too confusing and uninteresting to even care following it. The movies starts out really boring in the underworld trying to make it humorous with Jack Sparrow being confused in a desert with some stones turning into crabs, but it is never funny at all.. Then in several parts of the film, copies of Jack Sparrow turns up and the way Jack interacts with these clones is supposed to be funny, but it isn't.It just felt like they wanted this trilogy to end but couldn't come up with a good story, so they just stuffed the boring almost 3 hours with sword fighting, a heap of confusing facts and a lot of weirdness with Jack Sparrow, that isn't funny but very prolonged and boring instead.A forced choking love scene is added to the end, that didn't feel natural. So they wanted to make a legend out of this love story, but really, we wanted Jack Sparrow to get the lady and it felt forced. The Bloom character is just too fruity. We didn't even care about those two characters anymore. I am glad this is over. The first two Pirates.. is a couple of levels above this one.I can't wait to see to see the next Johnny Depp movie, though :) How about him and De Niro in the same movie. That would make my day! 4/10.",4,1,3,17 November 2007
We Were Soldiers," Propaganda alert!
","This was when I lost all respect for Mel Gibson. What does an Australian get for making such a horrible American propaganda movie about the Vietnam war ? A lot of money i hope, but too bad the devil doesn't take credit cards, 'cause Gibson will surely be going to hell after this and be joining Ben Affleck after Pearl Harbour! How can Gibson live with himself after making this piece of garbage ? This must be the work of the American government! They must have financed the whole thing. How can you actually believe, that the world would actually fall for these lies? But hey, many of the reviewers here seem to like it and can't see what so obviously is going on. How very very sad that many are so naive. Wake up from your slumber please! This is not how it was during the Vietnam war! Not at all! The exact opposite is much more likely to be the case! This is pure propaganda from the American government. What will be next ? A movie about the heroic prison guards on Guantanamo Bay fighting the evil inmates and about the noble intentions by George Bush Jr. (Sr.)?.One of the three worst historic films ever along with Pearl Harbour and World Trade Center.1/10",1,5,10,9 August 2007
Pearl Harbor," One of the worst movies ever
","Maybe one of the worst movies ever with this kind of budget. Unbelievable pile of American rewriting of history we are heroes bullshit. This is why the world is hating USA more and more. Could you perhaps cover your intentions a little better ? Only mind numbingly stupid teenage girls who watch Ricky Lake reruns all day long can find this movie the slightest bit interesting. And that is only because of Ben Affleck. They have no idea what war was actually going on when they are done watching. The one point goes for the air raid of the American base. That was actually something I enjoyed, and it was very well done and with great sound effects.",1,1,4,9 August 2007
World Trade Center," Another Pearl Harbour
","I knew this was going to be utter hail America bull even before watching it. We have a club of 10 people, who regularly attend the theaters and watch random movies. Believe me, if I had a choice, I would have never had any interest in watching this. But anyway, as I predicted, well as we all predicted, actually, we were bored through the whole film. Except for those moments where we along with the rest of the theater were laughing at especially the marine and the other cheesy moments in this disaster of a film. When it was finally over, people just stood outside laughing at how bad the film was and talking about this marine, who wanted to dig through tons of rubble with his super fantastic American marine knife!! 'Don't worry, I won't leave you! I'm a marine!' Yes! He actually says that! And then we are told, that he goes to Iraq for 2 years to get revenge. I ask then, was he one of those enraged psychos who raped Iraqi women and murdered their families down there then ? And what has Iraq to do with WTC ? What a joke.What an insult to the people who died or had friends or family members who died at this terrible tragedy. I will never see a Nicholas Cage film again nor an Olive Stone one. What maniac thought up the lines of that marine ? I'm baffled.1/10.",1,90,158,9 August 2007
