The Legend of Bagger Vance," Uhg...
","What an incredibly boring and stupid movie.I wanted to just say that but I'm required to write more. I sat through this in the theater years ago and thought it couldnt be as bad as I remembered, so i decided to watch it again free on Amazon Prime.Needless to say, dialogue was cheesey, acting was terrible by everyone and the premise and overall story just plain stupid.Dont waste your time with this hideousness. Cheers. :-)",1,2,5,14 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Hated Last Jedi? No need to worry, JJ did well!
","For all of those out there like me that thought the Last Jedi was horrible, you WILL like this movie!!! It has some flaws but overall it had a cool story and plot and plenty of action. It also ties the trilogy into a neat bow and undoes most of the nonsense the Last Jedi produced (Thank Goodness!) It doesn't completely save this trilogy (nothing could after the Last Jedi fiasco) but it comes pretty close! It was well done and for most Star Wars fans I think they'll enjoy it. I'm actually looking forward to seeing it again!",8,0,3,21 December 2019
