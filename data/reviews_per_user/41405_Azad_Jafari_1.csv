Black Swan," Black Good and White Evil
","Take a philosophical idea of the film 'Black Swan'Azad JafariThe confrontation of good and evil, one of the most important issues of philosophy and thought, whether as absolute or as mixed (eg, ethics) - which has long attracted the attention of thinkers and theorists, and everyone according to their understanding of its sphere of human existence Paid. The movie 'Black Swan' director Darren Aronofsky one of the films nominated for the Academy in 2010 was the argument that in view of the special issue of the categories of intellectual and moral philosophy. But 'Black Swan' is really a film about the conflict between good and evil?So we must first clear definition of good and evil on which to judge the content of the film's look. Certainly in this article, a venue to discuss all that has been said on this subject in the history of philosophy even be quite brief and unavoidably short and after a particular conception that is more fundamental and more authentic. With the exception of determinism, all agree on the principle that man is essentially autonomous, and therefore his action is preferable to operate freely and autonomous compulsory and imitate him. What a man thinks and if the other person does not. Man is the only creature that has a so-called time, Because it can build the future and the next day. The reason for this is the future of both the authority and discretion, the effect force human beings to utilize longer. The next day like today like yesterday and today he is human, not coming because yesterday and today and the next day one. He is just like all the other vegetable and animal organisms. Like a pine tree or branch wheat. Like bees to a lifestyle that is millions of years, and have historically inevitable algebra parent. Other creatures of their time but they are inscribed in the earth. But when the man except for his own time because he thinks and chooses and why that define the sound of the distinguishing characteristics of the animal he believed. Angels are timeless because they lack the authority and if your good you have not picked well.Now back to the main theme of the movie 'Black Swan' and the first question is whether the subject of the film is the conflict between good and evil? Fortunately our videos to rule on this matter closed and they can cite clear evidence that it did any good in there, and said that he is opposed to evil. The film 'Black Swan' is opposed to evil with evil! But look at the film 'Black Swan', real good as black and white as the real evil.Good or white in Aronofsky film is being Angel. The moral act without any choice, choice, and freedom. In contrast, black or evil is the human being. That is His will, and will complete, immoral act out. The film 'Black Swan' is a film in praise of evil (because evil is necessarily arbitrary and based on freedom knows) and condemning No Natalie Portman played Nina, a person is innocent despite the desire to sin, but not because they themselves are kept clean, but because they do not sin willingly to the wishes of its drive to prevent it. His little girl's eyes and ears closed as a result of his strict upbringing if he can not be guilty. Is this ignorance, and this transformation unfolds in the film, as whiteness is really good? And whether it is freedom, self-aware, and it is going to happen to him in the search results black swan is really evil? In the film Black Swan, changed the word good times instead of good and evil, negative and positive word evil. But what's the problem? Do you truly not right with Darren Aronofsky?Immanuel Kant's 'Critique of Practical Reason' wrote: 'Knowledge to give' voluntary 'Will the law, with restrictions that the only reason we inevitably imposes on all desires, the same respect for the law. Obviously, the law requires and implies that respect, but not a moral law (because nothing else can exert any direct influence on the will of all tendencies to stop). The action according to the law and the terms of any origin tend Apr rejection, ostracized objective practical terms, 'task' is read. '(Critique of Practical Reason, Immanuel Kant, the translation of mercy, God willing, page 135)The words 'will' and 'duty' are emphasized in this expression is directly related to the arbitrary will of the moral duty and it is integral. However, in the film 'Black Swan' We no longer see the good will and without the knowledge and authority and against the evils we see a direct relationship with the 'optional determination to give awareness to the law' is. But the moral law is not the law but the law is immorality.So it must be said in the movie 'Black Swan' comparison is not a fair comparison between good and evil because evil weighs heavily on the available platform built on the platform whether it is empty. Suggests that this comparison is unfair, incorrect result will follow. What this erroneous result, deliberately and with the intention to be the creators of what is unconsciously and unintentionally. In any case, 'Black Swan' suggests leaving one evil for evil other. There is no good here.",6,0,0,2 February 2020
