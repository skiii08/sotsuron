Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Truly an incredible movie.
","Ok, this movie was a tad bit disappointing, and lacked some character development.  And yes, there was too much in the way of kiddie moments and corny jokes.  All the same, this truly was a great movie, worthy of the line.The effects are great, but they're not the point.  Critics complain about lack of character development, but we already KNOW almost their entire life story.  It's great to be able to put new pieces into the puzzle,Being too young to see the original trilogy, this was the greatest movie experience I have had.  The only negative is that we will have to wait three more years for the sequel.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most frustrating movies I've ever seen
","I think it's best to write about this move now, having given it some time. I am a fanboy, if you will, on of these people who knows the dialogue of the original trilogy by heart, and stuff like that.  I saw 'The Phantom Menace' when it came out in theatres the first day, and I expected to see it at least ten times in theaters.  It turned out to be two - so, having gone back and watched it again, I feel I have a better perspective. It would be silly to see this and not hold it up against the original trilogy, so here goes:Simply put, for whatever reason, this is not a very well-made movie. Neither the acting nor the storyline are particularly bad, but there are so many unnecessary elements. First off, something must be said about Jar Jar Binks. Clearly, this movie is aimed for a far younger audience than the originals, and this is unfortunate. There was comic relief in the original trilogy, but it was subtle (such as Luke and Han starting to fight over Leia in 'A New Hope', or Leia insulting Luke and Han's plan to rescue her in the same film), not the kind of overly blatant schtick present with Jar Jar. Apparently, despite the negative reaction he received (I have yet to have a single person tell me they enjoyed the character), George Lucas is bringing him back for Episode 2, which is a shame.Another problem for me was the special effects. It's hard to express this properly, but they were too good. Part of the appeal of the original trilogy's effects was that cold, heartless, outer-space feel given both to the ships and most of the Empire, especially the stormtroopers. The effects work because they're minimalist, simple, and look coldly technological. Everything in 'The Phantom Menace' is bright and vibrant, which is not the right mood for a Star Wars movie. Furthermore, even though this movie is supposed to take place before the original trilogy, the technology appears quite improved (for obvious reasons), which is confusing in itself. The movie is far too in love with the effects, and it backfires - sometimes too much technology is a bad thing for a movie.I said before this was simply a poorly made movie, and there a couple things that really bother me.  There is a scene in which Anakin asks Qui-Gon to explain what 'midi-chlorians' are. It's not necessarily that the movie takes time to explain the concept, as most fans want to know everything about the Star Wars universe. It's simply that the dialogue is such a blatant attempt to give the movie a chance to explain, it's shameful. You almost feel as if you're watching a child's movie, watching Anakin ask a question with no real purpose other than to explain this new concept.For all familiar with the Star Wars universe, this is what really bothers me, though: at some point in the movie, virtually every Jedi, including Yoda, Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, etc., are in the presence of Senator Palpatine (WARNING: major spoiler ahead if you are totally unfamiliar with the larger plotline), who is, of course, clearly the evilest Sith (Dark Jedi) Lord around. Why can none of them sense the dark side in him? Even if his power covers it, how could they have never sensed it before? Furthermore, the movie is too isolationist at this point: everyone know Palpatine is a Sith who later becomes the Emperor - there is no need to work around the fact, or be coy around, cause we all know it happens.While we're on the subject, Anakin's character is just a bit too happy-go-lucky here. Just as we know what happens to Palpantine, (WARNING #2: major spoiler for those unfamiliar with the SW universe) we all know Anakin will eventually become Vader. Everyone I know came into this movie expecting to see hints of what he was to become, but there was very little intrigue. It also says something to me about the casting when the only character who is really able to convey the potential danger in Anakin properly is a wrinkled, green, 3-foot tall puppet (Yoda). Sam Jackson just does not fit in this universe, unfortunately, and no other members of the Jedi council said much.There were certainly, some excellent parts to this film, most notably the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan, and the pod racing scenes certainly draw acclaim. The movie was entertaining, yes, but really a letdown after the original trilogy. The beauty of the first three films (especially ANH and ESB) is their subtlety is developing the plot, and the interplay between characters. 'The Phantom Menace' is simply a direct, in-your-face approach, in a galaxy filled with with annoying Gungans and a hero/villain who buries his shoulder in a 14-year old girl's lap and everyone calls 'Annie.'  The difference is comparable to that between, say, Chewbacca and Jar Jar. You have to go for the grizzled space ape over the annoying, clumsy lizard-creature any day. Certainly, this film is watchable as part of the Star Wars universe, but I think most hope the second episode is a great deal more similar to the original trilogy than this overmarketed, overdone number. Thanks for letting me get that all off my chest, and may the force be with you.",8,0,1,31 May 2001
Happy Gilmore," The best of Sandler's comedies
","While calling a movie Adam Sandler's best may be damning it with faint praise, this is pretty well-done as dumb comedies go. Sandler is in his element as the goofy hockey wannabe trying to raise money by using his 450-yard drives to win money on the PGA Tour. Playing off the indignant Christopher McDonald, a pro on a hot streak bothered by the popularity of this working-class hero, the comedic timing here works out well, and there are some good scenes when tempers flare (a notable one with both McDonald in a bar and TV's Bob Barker).The movie will become a lot funnier if you happen to play golf, or even watch, it, because the antics of Sandler on the golf course (he plays in a Boston Bruins jersey and putts like he's using a hockey stick) are ridiculous enough to be funny. There are some good laughs from various places on the course, and Ben Stiller gets some chuckles as the insane and sadistic orderly at the nursing home Sandler's Grandma is staying in while he tries to win back her house.As a final note, you can't hit a golf ball that far like that. I've tried , my friends have tried, anyone who plays golf and has seen this movie has tried. Everyone just hits a 50-yard worm burner. Standard Sandler fare, but good for a few laughs.",6,1,3,20 May 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," their revising the musical!
","This movie has been much maligned by a lot of people who assume it is stupid and immature. These people are right, but the movie is really funny.  It does a good job of switching between hilarity and a long line of anti-MPAA jokes.This movie also has a lot of songs, which you may not like, but the songs are done with South Park's usually over-the-top, out of place sincerity. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, and has lots of laughs.",9,0,0,4 July 1999
X-Men," Plenty of bang for your buck
","This movie is the perfect example of a summer blockbuster done right. All the elements were in place. There was a well-developed storyline 30 years in the making, and director/co-writer Bryan Singer (from 'The Usual Suspects') spends enough time on character development and story that the movie does not adopt the feel many sci-fi/action films do of simply being a vehicle for destruction.The action is good, but not overwhelming, and the better parts are based on the interpersonal relationships between the characters. The acting is very good. The movie has one actor from about every other extremely popular sci-fi movie series: The two leading mutants are Patrick Stewart (a.k.a Capt. Picard), who is perfect for this role. Ian McKellen (Gandalf in the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy) is also quite good as the evil genius Magneto. I really liked Ray Park's (also Darth Maul) character 'Toad', the only bad guy other than Magneto with any personality.Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are very good as Rogue and Wolverine, the central characters here, though if you're a familiar with the comics, Paquin will look a little strange until the end. Rogue is portrayed as too much of a kid here for my tastes, but it doesn't detract largely from the story. The other are fine as well. The relationship between Wolverine, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen, from the Bond series while I'm at it) provide the wittiest dialogue. Halle Berry's Storm is sort of removed on a personal level from the other X-Men, and her dialogue is the worst among them, but the makeup and appearance of her character more than make up for it.Overall, this was a really enjoyable movie, well worth the two hours it ran, and has me looking forward to the sequel.",8,0,0,15 July 2000
American Pie," Unbelievably formulaic
","Let me start off by saying: Just where is this high school? Seemingly everyone in the film in attractive, and no one actually looks like they're in high school. The school is clean and well-kept. Also, among the hundred or so students we see, a while two of them are minorities.
This is a wierd film, when you think about it: a strange mix of There's Something about Mary, Animal House, and Stand by Me that just doesn't sit right, somehow. The whole story (if you can call it that) is pathetically obvious. If they let everything be about sex, that's one thing - but there's some abstract issues here the film wants to play in but doesn't really try to understand. Lip service is paid to 'love', but everything makes more sense when the characters just want to get laid.The movie isn't all bad - there's some funny scenes as the main character (Jason Biggs) and his dad (former CTV star Eugene Levy) try to broach the subject of sex in a fatherly manner, but  there isn't much else.",5,1,2,24 June 2000
The Shining," Among the best horror films ever made
","I think the makers of such effect-induced, plotless, pointless movies like the more recent 'The Haunting', 'Deep Blue Sea', 'The Faculty', and many other such films should be forced to sit down and watch this movie, maybe with 'Vertigo' and 'North by Northwest'.  Kubrick can draw more from a small group of actors, a non-alive house (except maybe the elevators), and axe and a small, repetitive manuscript than most directors these days get from $100 million dollars.Granted, this movie couldn't have been made without Jack Nicholson.  This may be a backhanded compliment, but no other actor has the ability to play a creepy, crawling-under-your-skin, all out psycho like Jack Nicholson. This is one of his best performances, and here he is in expert hands.The whole cast and set is made to give the perfect effect.  There is very little actual violence in this movie, but it's ten times scarier than most of the so-called 'horror' films we see out today.  Kubrick is a master at using suspense to a real effect.  It seems that any type of movie he made, it became one of the definitive movies of it's genre, and this is no exception.",10,0,0,5 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," A good movie with a great concept.
","This is an inspired, twisted movie.  The much-talked about concept, where actors actually go inside John Malkovich, is an excellent twist, but would not have worked were the plot and acting not so good in themselves.In truth, Malkovich is a catalyst for the plot.  A weird love triangle occurs between John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Cameron Diaz.  Instead of the average movie with such a premise, where the actors pretty much spend an hour and  a half lamenting their situation, the three of them act upon their instincts using a portal in Cusack's office they find that takes you into Malkovich's head.The wonderful thing about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.   While there is real emotion and tension throughout the movie, it's mixed in with the weirdness of the whole situation, and ends up with a very good balance between the comedic aspects of being able to go inside someone's mind, and the feeling the characters have for each other.A word about the acting: Everyone is good.  Cusack and Bean play straightmen of sorts, and are very good at it.  Cameron Diaz tries to shed her beauty glow, and it almost works, though at times she tries to hard to seem downbeat.  There are two excellent performances: One is Catherine Keener, as the vixen who enchants everyone she meets.  She plays the part with a real sexual energy you don't often see. And...John Malkovich is great.  He really plays three characters, and plays them all expertly.  He is really a comic relief of sorts in this story.  He allows the movie to poke all kinds of fun at him, and his performance is great.  Better than the one where he play a jewel thief. (if that doesn't makes sense, see the movie).All in all, this movie is a real departure from the usual Hollywood drivel. I highly recommend it.",10,0,1,6 November 1999
The Usual Suspects," An Amazing Film
","Surely, if you haven't seen 'The Usual Suspects', you know of the great reputation it carries. Well, it deserves every bit of it. It is simply a wonderful combination of inventive film-making, a great story, and absolutely wonderful acting (and casting, for that matter).I'm not sure I've ever seen a film where every actor in the cast was this good, especially an ensemble cast. The absolute best scenes are the dialogue that occurs between Spacey (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but has the most screentime of anyone) and Chazz Palmintieri, who is really in his element as a tough-guy cop. He never seemed to feel right in numerous bad guy roles, and he  gives a great performance here as what I would term the most moral character. There are a number of underappreciated actors who are excellent here. I've always been a big fan of Kevin Pollak, and this is by far his best dramatic role. The sam can be said of Stephen Baldwin, who luckily found time to be in this this between such forgettable films as 'Bio-Dome'. It was nice to see Giancarlo Esposito, who's another guy that deserves more acclaim. Dan Hedaya, who has had one of the stranger acting careers in recent memory (remember Nick Tortelli on 'Cheers'?) is fine in a bit role. This is the only role I've ever like Pete Posthelwaite in, and Gabriel Byrne and Benicio Del Toro round are very good as main characters. I mention all these people because they were all that good.The plot is original, breath-taking, and engrossing. It takes you through twists and turns you never see coming, but never takes a turn that leads to complete unbelievability (a la 'The Sixth Sense'). The plot is so engrossing that the name Kaiser Soze has become part of popular lingo, despite coming from a low-budget film. The feel of the film, from the sets, to the lighting, to the actual dialogue give the perfect film noir mood.Also - the ending is the absolute coolest (the best word I can think of) you're likely to ever see. It's and ending where you see it, and just kind of go, 'Wow.' This film is easily my favorite movie, and I've seen quite a few. Nothing really matches it in the ability to have every aspect of the film of such high quality.",10,0,1,7 August 2000
The Usual Suspects," One of the best-made films in quite a while
","This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies.  I've seen it a number of times, and it gets better every time, as you see new things that tip you off to the final clue.  If you've never seen it, don't let anyone tell you what happens, because this is one of the best endings you will ever see.I cannot think of anything remotely lacking in this movie.  The acting is incredible.  Kevin Spacey gives an incredible performance as the quasi-lead (the story is told from his perpsective, but he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), and the ensemble cast is great.  Gabriel Byrne pulls off the dignified, gentleman robber well.  Stephen Baldwin is in his element, the best he's ever been, as a raging phsyco (makes you think, huh?).  Kevin Pollak is outstanding as the cool guy, and Benicio Del Toro fits in right as a sort of Jekyll to Baldwin's Hyde.The supporting cast is also excellent, with a lot of character actors you'll remember from other movies turning in performances of a life team.  The plot is second to none.  It goes slow enough to let you think you've got it figured out, with enough action to keep you interested, then simply pulls the rug out from under you with a spectacular ending.The last five minutes of this movie are among the best in American cinema. I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie and can tell me it is not the best ending they have ever seen.  It really pulls the movie together, and just makes you sit up and think.  You will not forget the ending to this movie for a long, long time.",10,0,1,20 September 1999
Man on the Moon," An enigma, wrapped in a puzzle...
","Much like the man himself, 'Man on the Moon' is a biopic on Andy Kaufman that tell you pretty much nothing you dindn't already know. The performances are outstanding, but it plays more like a highlight show that an introspective.First off, Jim Carrey is great. You get the feeling if there's one person who might get Andy Kaufman, it's Jim Carrey. He seems to hit all the characters just right. Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda is the best of the supporting cast, and there are a number of interesting guest cameos of people playing themselves.The only problem is that all the movie seems to do is show you his various acts in succession. There's no attempt to make Kaufman out to really be anything other than the actor he was, no attempt to see what was behind the characters. Milos Forman fails to make anything out of Kaufman, to suggest anything of his persona. This is strikingly different than his last movie, 'The People vs. Larry Flynt', and this technique lacks a little. There are a couple of various, really obvious attempts to show everyone's aware he's a little nuts, not no real probe into his physche. There's also a somewhat mysterious ending, something in the true Kaufman spirit.
The bottom line is basically, if you thought Andy Kaufman was funny, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, it will likely appear a bit hollow, though good for a laugh. Still, it seems the movie could have somehow been a bit better. After all, if the filmmaker's didn't stick to the facts, as the opening suggests, why not take some guesses into his inner thoughts?",7,0,0,22 December 1999
The Princess Bride," A Film everyone should see
","I have yet to meet a person who watched this move and didn't find it evnjoyable. It's a simple, yet innovative idea: they made a classic, archetypical Dark Ages hero/romance flick, but set it right on the edge between satire and earnestness. The whole story is, supposedly, a book a grandfather (Peter Falk) reads to his sick grandkid (Fred Savage). It should tell you all you need to know about this film when, the first time the two estranged lovers find each other and embrace, you all of the sudden hear, 'Wait, I don't wanna hear about kissing.'The principle actors here are all very good. Cary Elwes is fine as our dashing hero. Mandy Patinkin is his foil/friend, with his own subplot. Robin Wright is fine as the damsel in love and distress, and Chris Sarandon makes a good evil, scheming villain, and he's a highly underrated character actor (see 'Dog Day Afternoon' if you don't believe me).The real beauty of this film, however, is the performances turned in by such actors as Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Carol, Kane, and that noted thespian, Andre the Giant. Shawn, for instance, is the con man with a list who is the early (not final) villain. His character is short, has a lisp, and uses the same word (he prounounces it 'inconthievable') to address every situation (which leads to the best quote of the film, Patinkin's response 'You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.') It's this kind of dialogue that seems out of place in such an action/romance film. 'The African Queen' or something or the like, while being fine movies, would never have a character like Billy Crystal's 'Miracle Max', who plays a sort of caricature of a Jewish parent (to me, anyway).The beauty of this film is that you aren't quite sure if you should be laughing, or should be caught up in the story, and the beauty is that you can do both.",9,1,2,30 July 2000
Mulholland Drive," um......huh?
","I'd like to go ahead and start out by saying that I saw this film amidst a good number of students from the Tisch Film School at NYU, and they don't get it, either.This is because you aren't supposed to get it. The point of a non-linear narrative is that there is no actual story, just a general idea. From a filmmaking perspective, there are a lot of goodies here, absurdities that are genuinely funny, and I think this film reads best as a dark comedy.It is definitely not hard to see where we make the switch from proposed TV pilot to forty minutes of wierdness. The last part of the film sees the characters switch roles, and also sees the story (well, ok, the quasi-story) overlap itself a couple of times.The acting is fine, and Lynch has a key eye for making his film artistic and clean looking. But there's a lot of stuff in here that's just off-beat to the max, pure David Lynch stuff, that shouldn't make sense unless you're on acid, basically, because in isn't supposed to make sense in any natural way.A good movie to see if you don't mind the fact that there isn't a point to the plot.",5,0,2,9 October 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Not one of Kubrick's best
","The much hyped 'Eyes Wide Shut' didn't really meet my expectations as a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's works. While I am more enamored of his less artistic works to begin with, such as 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange', this movie didn't even meet the levels of '2001'.One of the best parts of most of Kubrick's work is that he keeps you enraptured throughout his films, never taking your eyes off the screen. Not so here. The first 45 minutes seem to stretch on endlessly. Nicole Kidman, especially, is simply playing a bad character. She isn't so much the wife on the protagonist, Tom Cruise's Dr. Bill Hartford, as much as she's another aspect of the libido we explore throughout the film. This is symbolized ad nauseam, mainly in the fact that Kidman takes about 30 seconds between every word she speaks, so as to give the impression of a far off angel, I suppose.There are some good spots, when Cruise's character hits the street. Vinessa Shaw, a lady of the street, and Todd Field, an old friend who shows him another world of sorts, are very good. There are some moments that make you sit up and say 'Wow', the kind of thing only Stanley Kubrick can do. The problem here is that Kubrick tries to inject too many of those moments into his film, instead of letting them come naturally, and it doesn't have the same effect. All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but not as good as you might expect given some of the names working on out. There is layer upon layer of symbolism and insight, and sometimes it crashes upon itself, and you're left wondering what exactly Kubrick was aiming for with certain scenes. The movie is worth seeing, but don't go in with your expectations too high, especially if you're familiar with some of Kubrick's earlier works.",6,0,0,14 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," Good Movie undermined by a colossally bad ending
","It is hard for me to really comment on this film without talking about its ending (I won't). For about an hour and a half, this is a spectacular movie, well-acted, with excellent script and dialogue, and moving at a good pace. I think it's something of a cross between film noir and thriller, and it has that eerie 'Silence of the Lambs' feel to it (though much tamer).This movie lasts one scene too long. I heard someone remark once that some movies 'are great or awful depending on the ending'. The very last scene in this film is absolutely preposterous; instead of wrapping up the story neatly, with maybe a tiny plot hole, the last two or three minutes brought to mind at least 20 or 30 gaping plot holes immediately. I have a friend who told me he could guess the film's 'secret' thirty minutes in. Things like that usually don't surprise me, but this was so unbelievably, outrageously stupid I had no idea. I felt like screaming at the screen and demanding my hour and a half back based on that scene alone.The only reason I don't consider this movie among the worst I've ever seen is because it is quite good for awhile. Haley Joel Osment is excellent, and the only good reason to see this movie. Other than that, I can't believe this thing was as popular as it was. The ending left me feeling so cheated, I wanted to break the screen in two.",4,2,3,9 July 2000
The Producers," Don't you see, it's so simple....
","'The Producers' is Mel Brooks' first film - it is also his most original, the only one to win him and Oscar (for Best Screenplay), and to many (myself included), his best. There are certain filmmakers who seem to create their own sort of film with a different style than anyone else (people like Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, for instance), and Brooks is one of these. There isn't anything else that has the ribald, comedic, sarcastic, and overly theatrical tone of a good Mel Brooks film.This is, in such a sense, Brooks' master work - the film is imbued with a natural theatricality in the way each character is seemingly caricaturized, and the presence of Broadway favorite Zero Mostel in the leading role just adds to the effect.The movie is of course, about a play - a work entitled 'Springtime for Hitler' (a spring with Hitler and his lover Eva, showing the Fuhrer's lighter side), which ought to tell you everything you need to know about the sense of humor necessary to enjoy such a movie. The movie is full of blatantly (and purposely) tasteless humor - Bialystock (Mostel), a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, raises funds by wooing little old ladies whom he refers to with such names as 'Hold Me, Touch Me'. His partner, Bloom (Gene Wilder), is pretty much a full-blown wimp who still carries around a 'blue blankie', and together they make quite a pair.The rest of the cast fills out nicely - Kenneth Mars as the yammering German Franz Liebchen, full of love for 'you-know-who' and no grip whatsoever on reality, Christopher Hewitt as the flambloyant director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as Ulla, the secretary who speaks no English, Dick Shawn as Lorenzo Saint-DuBois (or, as his friends call him, L.S.D.), an hippie actor who ends up playing Hitler, and excellent cameos from the likes of Estelle Winwood and Burgess Meredith.It would be amiss to talk about this film now and not mention the current hit show actually on Broadway. The play is, to be honest, probably a bit better. The majority of the best one-liners and scenes remain, but the play fits even better into Brooks' theatrical, over-the-top stylings (indeed, at times the play goes so far over the top as to not be in the same atmosphere as normal entertainment, such as the character of Carmen Ghia in the play). The Broadway adaptation features a slightly different storyline and drops the character of L.S.D. altogether, but it comes out as a more entertaining production than the film. That said, and with apologies to Matthew Broderick and (especially the excellent) Nathan Lane, Mostel and Wilder play these characters better than their newer counterparts, so there is a bit of a balance.The film itself stand alone, and is definitely worth seeing, not only for the greatest musical number ever to grace film stock (also named 'Springtime for Hitler), but for the entertaining feel and pace of the film.",8,0,0,13 January 2002
The Matrix," Good, not great
","Clearly, some people disagree with me, but while this movie was certainly entertaining, I didn't think it was great.  It had it's moments, but all in all, I've seen better movies.  The one thing all my friends kept telling me: 'The Matrix has a great plot' I think it's a sign of the kind of brainless movies being released this days that when any movie with a sniffing of a plot comes out, people automatically take it for the next 'Godfather'.  The same thing happened with 'The Sixth Sense'.  The plot here is passable, but far from excellent.There are two parts of this movie that were really excellent.  Once is the mind-bending special effects, which were extremely well-done.  The other is Laurence Fishburne, who is at his best as 'Morpheus', the leader of this rag-tag group.  Keanu Reeves does  his best no to overact the part, but it's really Fishburne that stand out.Would I recommend it?  Sure.  Is it the greatest thing I've ever seen?  Not by a long, long shot.",6,0,1,19 October 1999
Casino," Very Good, not great
","Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before.  De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in 'The Godfather II', and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in 'Goodfellas'.  This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.There were some interesting points.  Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in 'The Godfather'. The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....).  To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from 'Goodfellas'.All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first.  The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history.  It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past.",8,1,1,20 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Easily the Greatest movie of all-time
","I can not imagine there will ever be anything like Star Wars again.  Maybe other movie will make more money, or win more awards, but no movie will ever become such a part of our culture as Star Wars.  It is hard to believe anything will inspire the kind of craze Star Wars has, and spawn the other industries the way this movie did.As for the movie itself, I was too young to see it in 1977.  But as a second generation fan, I must say that I cannot think of any greater experience I have had as a moviegoer, not even as I sat in the theatre waiting for a brand new Episode 1 to begin. There will never be another movie quite like 'Star Wars', a movie that has truly become bigger than just what's on the screen.It is hard to go further into superlatives in order to describe this movie, but even on the TV screen, there is nothing quite like seeing the quintessential archetypical story unfold, the amazing special effects, still impressive in this day and age.  This movie is the ultimate movie experience.  It is at the same time well-acted, visually enticing, and has an earnest, almost believable quality to it.  Star Wars is the zenith of the movie industry.",10,0,0,25 July 1999
The Replacements," A decent sports comedy
","'The Replacements' is a strange mix of reality, slapstick comedy, and plot lines you've seen a hundred times before that mix to form an engaging, though not spectacular comedy. Their is some decent football action, and some big laughs.Aside from the fact that 80% of this script seems to be lifted more or less directly from the 1991 Scott Bakula vehicle 'Necessary Roughness' (whose script wasn't that original itself), this movie at least had a kind of glitzed up feel that most football movies like to avoid. It didn't get down and dirty in the trenches, like so many movies before it. You'll have seen many of the gags before, but they're well-done, and there is the added bonus of Pat Sumerall and John Madden doing what I assume to be a satire of themselves (how else to explain such Madden quotes as, 'He caught the ball! He doesn't usually catch the ball, but he caught the ball!'Only two things really irked me about this movie: #1 - why the need for replacement cheerleaders? I understand they wanted to take a slightly racier angle (something lifted from 'Baseketball, but used to much greater effect here), but it isn't as if cheerleaders belong to the NFL Players Association. Also, the movie has the strike occur with 4 games left to go in the season. The strike on which this is based (in 1987), happened at the beginning of the year, as do all labor disputes but baseball's. This is presumably to add the dramatic effect brought on by the hunt for a playoff birth, but that's never really present, so it I think it just would've seemed a little less silly if this was all occurs at the start of the season.Decent acting, good football scenes, the occasional big laugh, and nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. But still worth a watch.",5,0,1,11 August 2000
Gladiator," A Riveting Movie
","Chances are you know something of this movie, and have heard the excellent reviews for it.  This is largely to the fact that, as a summer epic, 'Gladiator' is a very watchable  and entertaining movie, delivering all the big-time action some want to see, while still maintaining a level of clean dialogue and plot to spark the interest of the more discerning viewer.Russell Crowe, as the hero Maximus, is very good. He is excellent at playing the outraged but moral good guy stuck in a position he can do nothing about (a la L.A. Confidential), and he is brawny enough to pull off the action hero look.I especially liked Joaquim Phoenix here. The part he plays, the new Caesar Commodus, is partially based on fact (unlike the entirely fictional Maximus). He's the only one here who really manages to convey the sense of decadence and depravity that pervaded the upper classes of Roman society during its decline. In my mind, Phoenix stole every scene he was in.There are a couple problems. For one, director Ridley Scott (who did Alien, amongst others) concentrates more on heads getting chopped off then what could have been a rather engaging plotline, which is reduced to the bare points necessary to drive the action. This movie also falls into the ridiculous assumption Hollywood always seems to make that the upper class of any society has a British accent; it may not be a huge deal, but it's a pet peeve, and it makes no sense. Why would there be any particular accent? The battle scenes, while exceedingly bloody, are also a bit contrived, and don't seem real at all. Scott also makes some incredibly obvious attempts at symbolism using background colors that no one will miss, and it loses some significance because it's just so obvious.All in all, this was a very good movie. It was fun to watch, and I was entertained for 2 1/2 hours. The combination of action, good acting, and semi-intriguing plot makes this a shining example of the blockbuster epic, sure to entertain just about anyone.",8,0,0,17 May 2000
