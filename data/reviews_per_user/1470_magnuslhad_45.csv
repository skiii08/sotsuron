Moneyball," keeping the faith
","Baseball and submarines: American cinema seems to thrive in these two arenas. Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane. Philosophy meets strategy in a perfect pairing, as Billy and Peter go to work implementing 'moneyball' with an almost religious zeal. Pitt brings his now taken-for-granted charisma and complexity to Beane. The casting of Jonah Hill is a gamble that pays off as he manages to give Peter a backbone, when it would be all too easy to lampoon this character. And when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman stepping up to play a small but crucial part, then you have a movie that is intriguing and compelling in equal measure. Very few people have the courage to choose a transgressive path, and of those that do, fewer still will stick with it in the face of adversity. A film of quiet determination, with occasionally explosive conflict, it is at all times humane and authentic. One to watch again and again.",9,6,7,14 June 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," disappointing
","As someone over 21, I feel like an interloper reviewing this film. It didn't reflect my teenage experience back to me, but I was well past that phase in the early nineties. And yet, the American high school, such a tired, over-familiar arena for American cinema, seems not to have moved on at all. Jocks, Jewish-American princesses, closet gays and geeks all populate this film in fairly conventional representations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mental health, but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends, has a loving family, and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has is historical abuse, but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to be unrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy that they did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in the early nineties, but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearly fragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does not explore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms, and it fails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all, a bit flat and disappointing.",5,13,27,15 April 2015
The Equalizer," humdrum
","Denzel Washington makes this film watchable, but even he can't make it soar. A former military man works in a home depot, but has to fall back on his 'special skill set' in order to help those around him. The guy is less Good Samaritan and closer to goody-two shoes. He wants to launch the singing career of a prostitute, and help a tubby colleague slim down to take a test. It is all a bit saccharine and twee, till an intriguing Russian villain shows up carrying real menace. From there the film becomes more action oriented, but still doesn't out-do the Taken or Bourne franchises. Our man goes back to his bosses to ask not for help, but 'permission,' an especially sleek piece of dialogue. The film is tonally inconsistent, and seems too obviously an attempt to re-boot the TV show. Denzel is as charismatic as ever, but his range is barely tested in this role. A decent B-movie action flick, but not much more.",5,5,8,1 March 2015
Fury," Saving Private Ellison
","In the push into Nazi Germany in the closing stages of WWII, a battle-hardened tank crew come up against fanatical opposition. In addition, a rookie soldier is added to their crew and has to be educated in the ways of war. There is grit and rawness here, and the Allies are shown to be capable of brutality, shading the moral tones. The battle scenes are tense and dirty and ring with authenticity. Brad Pitt is magnetic as the leader trying to save his men while keeping as much of a lid on their excesses as possible. The film's flaw is that it shows the men not so much as soldiers, or even heroes, but as supermen, cutting through SS the way Aragorn cuts through Orcs. The ing√©nue Ellison gets to share a moment with a German civilian who is then conveniently, plot-wise, dispensed with in an air raid, though quite who is bombing who isn't clear. The crude moment seems forced in order to have Ellison be told 'This is war!' This is a decent if not great film. If they'd made it 50 years ago it would have starred John Wayne.",6,1,4,16 March 2015
Darkest Hour," shallow myth-making
","There is a lightness of touch to Joe Wright, a frivolity, that invades the tone of this film and sets it off-kilter. Any biopic takes on the challenge of creating drama and tension from events we may already be familiar with. This is perhaps more pronounced when it comes to such a titanic historical figure as Churchill. The film rightly invests its time in showing just how fraught the political struggle Churchill faced to fight rather than negotiate was. Unfortunately, Darkest Hour lacks complexity in its portrayal. Churchill shouts at a secretary, who becomes a cheer-leading personal assistant. His wife is similarly one note, admonishing him while managing to steadfastly encourage him at the same time. Halifax and Chamberlain are reduced to vaudeville villainy, while the king is a pompous buffoon. There are some clunky set pieces, most notably a cringe-worthy outing by Churchill on a Tube train to engage with the good folk of Britain. These include a black man, the only black man on the train, and possibly in the whole film, and the most earnest child in the history of Albion. Stalinist propaganda filmmakers would blush at such tokenism. Oldman opts for acting as impersonation rather than interpretation. It's a convincing impersonation, but still mimicry rather than artistry. Wright's depiction of Dunkirk in 'Atonement' had the showmanship of the circus ring, and has been devalued by Nolan's recent more authentic portrayal. Churchill's darkest hour will no doubt be re-visited and re-evaluated in the future when a filmmaker more in tune with the material takes it on.",3,42,68,14 March 2018
The Maze Runner," trapped
","More than the trite Divergent or po-faced Hunger Games franchises, The Maze Runner strikes the right note of adventure and earnestness for a teen fantasy-adventure movie. A group of teenagers find themselves deposited one by one in a mysterious glade enclosed by a huge maze. In the three years that they have been there, the have learned that escape is impossible, and entering the maze at night means certain death. Then Thomas arrives, and challenges all their carefully constructed rules, some of which have taken on sacred value for some members. Very few iterations of Lord of the Flies get it right, but the young actors in Maze Runner are plausible, and the running, jumping and rolling between closing walls and crashing edifices is tense and thrilling. There is good balance between action scenes and character-conflict scenes, with judicious dashes of comedy. Sure there are some plot holes, but nothing that has you throwing popcorn at the screen. It even gets away with a moment that is usually unforgivable, an ending that shamelessly sets up the sequel. Good fun for teenagers of all ages.",7,0,0,18 March 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," very funny
","Jason Segel screenwrites a film where the protagonist gets to be naked and hug Kristen Bell and then Mila Kunis. And have a montage of sex scenes with various hot women. And then gets himself cast as the protagonist. You have to hand it to the guy - he isn't shy. But, in his defence, he can write. This is a funny, well-acted film that evokes great performances from the ensemble cast. Love him or hate him, Russell Brand riffs brilliantly off his own persona here. Mila Kunis is naturalistic and manages to inject range into her character, with sympathy, rage, pity and anger all brought to the fore at various points in a plausible display that never reaches. There is hardly a missed beat here; even minor characters such as the best friend's wife, only ever seen on a Skype screen, are either cute or laugh-out-loud funny. Good fun, and bears repeat viewing.",7,0,1,3 February 2016
The Babadook," uncanny
","A single mother struggles to cope with raising her troubled child. Having never faced up to the death of her husband, and possibly suffering depression of her own, she begins to suspect a supernatural presence in her home The Babadook is a disturbing genre hybrid, part horror, part psychological thriller. It evokes the uncanny in self-aware tonal moments, when daylight scenes can seem as threatening as the black of night. Amelia (an inspired Essie Davis) wanders around in a fug, sleep-deprived and still grieving seven years after the death of her husband. Amelia's problem is to resolve how she feels about her son Samuel, the inadvertent cause of her husband's death, born on the day of the car accident that took her spouse. How can a mother possibly not love her child? The manual Samuel (a quite startling performance from young Noah Wiseman) provides the answer. Samuel is what less-informed times used to refer to as 'a handful.' Is the Babadook real or a figment of Ameila's increasingly disturbed mind? The film does a wonderful job of exploring this central theme. Budget limitations at times show themselves - shadow is amply deployed, and sound design is a little less complex than required - but they hardly detract from a very satisfying example of a genre typified by Hitchcock's Vertigo. Highly recommended.",7,4,6,17 January 2016
Dead Poets Society," uplifting
","Revisiting Dead Poets' Society decades after first viewing, it is reassuring to see that it has not only lasted, but rewards with repeat viewing. A new English teacher at an elite boys' boarding school brings a maverick sense of teaching to the stuffy institution, injecting vitality into the life of some of the boys, while putting himself on a collision course with the school authorities. Great scenes abound: the walk in the courtyard to teach about the dangers of conformity, Tom's blindfolded poetry read, and the climactic tribute of the boys to their fallen captain, one of the greatest tear-jerkers in cinema. Look at Weir's angle and camera placement - absolutely perfect. His extreme wide shot of a grieving Tom in a snow landscape, and his silent depiction of Neil's demise, all attest to poetry in both script and mise-en-scene. Very few films are faultless, but there is not one word, shot, casting decision or any other element of this film that one would change. Outstanding cinema.",10,2,2,6 May 2016
Orphan," ordinary
","A couple grieving for their stillborn baby decide to adopt an older child and furnish her with all the love that they had for the baby. The premise is an interesting one for a horror-thriller, and Orphan does hit a few highs. Isabelle Fuhrman is quite disturbing as Esther, and not just because of her chilling performance. There is something manipulative and dysfunctional about casting a 10-year-old child as a woman looking to seduce her adoptive father, and using explicit sexual language. Yes, it is acting, but does the actor have the maturity and worldly experience to give informed consent to taking the role? Vera Farmiga is excellent as the protagonist mother, battling more than one demon. There are some jump-out-of-your-skin scares, and the reveal of Esther's true nature is nicely paced. But the film struggles and fails to get over some gaping plot holes. Why would parents grieving for a baby believe adopting a 9-year-old would be a salve? Why would they not consider their existing two children in this discussion? What authorities allow an alcoholic to adopt? Peter Sarsgaard as the husband sleepwalks through a role that is basically a dolt. Even when his son's tree-house catches fire and his son is in ICU he refuses to consider any plausibility in his wife's theory. No wonder his wife drinks if she has had to put up with this unaware idiot for so long. In sum, not a terrible example of the genre, but not an outstanding one either.",5,1,2,19 January 2016
Spotlight," unmissable
","Part docudrama, part social record, Spotlight highlights the crusading efforts by one group of journalists to bring to public awareness the massive scale of child abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests over decades in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Slowly, not only the scale of the abuse, but the cruel indifference of church hierarchy and laity to children's suffering, historical collusion of Boston authorities, and the willful turning of a blind eye by the journalists themselves comes to the fore. This film is compelling and highly uncomfortable in equal measure. The investigation is carefully revealed without ever feeling heavy in exposition. Keaton is superb, and Ruffalo's pugnacious determination becomes the lightning rod for the rising fury of the audience. I came to this film wary of a dialogue-heavy, slightly preachy event. Instead, I left deeply affected, moved, curious, enraged, and humbled by the efforts of these journalists to shine a light on the unspeakable, and reveal the amorality of power. Possibly the best film about investigative journalism since All The President's Men, and a classic in its own right.",10,0,0,19 September 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," plodding
","An aging MI6 agent is tasked with uncovering a mole in the higher echelons of the outfit. This update of an iconic TV series is wonderfully atmospheric and rings with authenticity for anyone raised in the 1970s. But the look of the film is no compensation for a dense, unfathomable narrative that consists of people walking into rooms, talking through stiff upper lips, and staring expressionless at the aftermath of horrific violence. An incredible cast, a beloved novel, and an astute director and yet they fail to inject this with any pace, mirth or empathy. Quite what younger audiences, those who did not live through the Cold War, make of this opaque period piece is a mystery. Oldman's somnambulistic performance is infectious; I literally had trouble staying awake through this film. There is a line between a storyline that is challenging, and one that is remote. I favour the former. TTSS resolutely displays the latter. Disappointing.",4,1,3,5 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," jabberfest
","Eight characters are holed up in a shack together in a blizzard. Not all of them are who they profess to be. Even as a premise, this strikes one more as a stage play than as a film. And the confined spaces and dialogue-reliant plot only further detract from any cinematic experience. A stagecoach stops to pick up a potential passenger. A long dialogue exchange ensues. Then there is another passenger, and another long exchange. Then the four passengers in the stagecoach have a long conversation. They finally arrive at the layover station, where four more travellers await them, and lots and lots of long conversations. This endless jabbering is bad enough, except it is not very funny or dramatic. It's all a bit bland. Samuel L. Jackson going on tediously about stew, long past the mark where everyone got the point, is one egregious example. It is also symptomatic of how the audience is either way ahead and waiting for the film to catch up, or 'surprised' by some revelation that we don't really care about. In sum, this is one of the worst scripts to make it to film in decades.",2,0,2,30 April 2018
Black Mass," tame
","This biopic of a famous Boston crime lord falls flat for a number of reasons. Depp acts his socks off and the make-up and camera departments deserve credit for imbuing a coldness in those blue blue eyes. Cumberbach also copes ably with a role that is a departure from much of his previous work. But the story fails to engage. The main problem is the FBI office. The complicity of the FBI in the rise of this nefarious individual is what makes this story stand out, but the squabbling between the various characters in that setting lacks gravitas. Kevin Bacon is unusually limited. The story chases Boston authenticity, forsaking gripping drama in the process. There is one scene where Bulger plays mind games with an FBI officer over the dinner table about a 'secret' family recipe. A potentially dramatic scene, if we hadn't witnessed it before, beat for beat, in Goodfellas. Taking a cookie-cutter to that iconic 'You think I'm funny?' scene is symptomatic of the lack of ambition and verve in this film. Not a terrible film, but the lack of risk, or surprise, is disappointing. The filmmakers should have watched 'Snowtown' before starting out.",5,2,3,15 March 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," mixed bag
","Three Billboards is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are carnivalesque, outrageous and troubling in one turn, heroic and inspiring at the next. McDonagh quite deliberately does not let you find a moral centre in his tale. There is a 'save the cat' moment very early in the film, a character helping an insect rather than crushing it, that is so mechanical that I flinched. Shame on me for falling so easily into McDonagh's trap. The plot zig-zags and leaves you breathless trying to process each new piece of information. The dialogue crackles with delicious insults. I laughed hard, and often. And then I cried. And winced. And laughed again. There is one scene of quite shocking violence. The performances have been lauded, and rightly so, as Frances McDormand, Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell , and Woody Harrelson bump and smack against each other tied to the roller-coaster plot. Peter Dinklage gets the chance to show his range. But while the praise for the acting is merited, the praise for the screenplay is more problematic. A huge coincidence in the final 20 minutes sets off a chain of events that leads to a redemption that is unearned, and a reconciliation that seems implausible. 'Love,' implores a missive from one character to another, and the moral turn that character takes on that one command is too abrupt and too unequivocal. It also asks for forgiveness of acts already witnessed, and implied, that are far too egregious to be forgotten. A flawed film then, but perhaps all the more interesting for those flaws. Don't make the mistake of seeing it alone like I did - you will definitely want to talk to someone straight after viewing.",8,16,31,18 February 2018
Lion," lost child
","Immensely moving tale of a young child lost in India, preyed upon, rescued - falsely - then rescued again, and shipped off to a new country for adoption. Photography, pace, and atmosphere are all pitch perfect in the opening sequence in India, but what really draws you in is the charismatic performance by young newcomer Sunny Pawar. Dev Patel does a good job, but it is the flashbacks to the five-year-old boy, rather than concern for the man, that keeps you emotionally invested. Nicole Kidman is quietly powerful as a woman who surprises you by her choices and incredible strength. The film avoids sentimentality and completely earned the copious tears I gave up. I have a soft spot for 'lost child' stories, and this is one that rises above the pack.",8,0,0,19 February 2020
American Hustle," unoriginal
","Low-life con artists, glitzy trophy wives, smooth wiseguys, hyped up cops and career politicians all collide in this homage to a time past. In keeping with the adrenaline-fuelled nature of the lives on display, the whole production seems to be on uppers, moving breathlessly from one emotionally-fraught scene to another. Make-up, prosthetics, and acting at the top of your voice are all taken to extremes. Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence all ooze period sleaze and amorality. Bradely Cooper tries too hard, and playing him opposite Louis C.K. tilts things too much towards pastiche. Tonally, the film seems to ride too high and fast. We are barely given time to reflect on any of the absurd, horrid actions seen on screen. Like The Wolf of Wall Street, the film seems to indulge in its characters and period too much, when a more objective scalpel might be called for. The whole aesthetic also mimics Goodfellas far too closely. This feels like a film I saw before, only done better, and with more consideration. Entertaining in parts, there is something slightly unpalatable about American Hustle.",5,2,4,14 September 2014
Rush," speed
","A reckless, feckless playboy pits his wits against a methodical, rat-faced rival in the deadly world of F1 in the 1970s. There are so many ways this film could have faltered into B-movie and/or made-for-TV mediocrity. The premise outlined above practically screams such credentials. Peter Morgan and Ron Howard should take a bow for steering clear of obvious pitfalls and crafting something truly insightful and cathartic from this material. Like many admirers of this film, I have no interest in F1, and actually rather despise the sport as the plaything of airhead rich fools. This film works because it is a classic odd couple formula. It also has in-built drama from the life-and-death activity these men earn their crust from. Then there is that whiff of authenticity they garner from basing this on a true story. The actors inhabit their roles completely, and the sense of mutual loathing and respect is finely conveyed. The narration is slightly annoying, but bearable. Clever, insightful and engrossing.",8,0,0,18 February 2015
Baby Driver," hit-and-miss
","An unfortunate dip in form for Edgar Wright who seems to be trying too hard to chase a certain youth democratic in America, and so ends up sacrificing substance for style. The opening chase is a fantastic hook, and the character of Baby is teasingly introduced. There is a full palette of the much-loved Wright tropes, such as fast cutting and self-deprecating humour. But the musical theme is laid on far too thick, and the soundtrack becomes annoying after a while. The romance storyline is under-realised, with the female character really only a token presence. She is a love interest for Baby, but beyond that we know little about her, and she shows no agency or independence. It's a good performance from Ansel Elgort and a stand-out one from Jamie Foxx, but the film drags in places and lacks sincerity.",5,1,1,19 March 2019
The Revenant," relentless
","A group of trappers are attacked by a native tribe. Their bedraggled numbers make their way home to the nearest fort, their group fractious and brittle all the way. One badly wounded man becomes the catalyst for a cycle of vengeance taking that consumes the group. There is much to admire here: spectacular cinematography achieved in natural light, a stunning landscape, gritty performances, and an epic tale of revenge. There are jaw-dropping moments, most notably when the camera follows horse and rider off a cliff. Writing in 2016 the film comes information-soaked, about harsh conditions, about award potential, about crew walk-offs. In years to come all that paraphernalia will fall away and audiences will be able to visit the film once more purely as a film. At that point, its limitation will become all too clear - the one-note narrative. A man survives hellish odds in order to avenge a murder. His survival tips over from incredible into highly implausible. It also means the film poses no questions. You know when you buy your ticket that there is only one outcome. Unfortunately, all the joy of the journey comes from appreciating the effort it took to make this film, rather than the narrative itself gripping you. Lots for cinephiles to admire here, but it is all done to support a story that is, in the end, a little dull.",7,0,2,19 September 2016
Split," McAvoy masterclass
","Three young women are kidnapped by Kevin, a young man suffering from a split personality disorder that means 23 different personalities inhabit his mind, emerging one at a time when they have control of 'the light.' The story world is convincing and information is drip-fed to the audience at a suitable pace, the active question being 'What does he want with these women?' McAvoy excels in an incredibly demanding role. Dennis, Patricia and other characters are evoked not only through voice and physicality, but in a simple yet decisive change of facial expression. McAvoy's performance alone makes this worth watching, but Shyamalan gets the writing and direction right this time round, as well as the casting. There is a nice little self-aware nod to his own past successes at the end. Well-plotted, well-acted, and thoroughly enjoyable, this is the Shyamalan of Unbreakable and Sixth Sense doing what he does best.",7,0,1,21 March 2018
Divergent," dull
","I'm a fan of near-future films set in dystopian worlds, but this 'Hunger Games' rip-off never tries to reach beyond its obvious 16-24-year old demographic. Young adults are assigned to clan-like groups based on their personality type. Those who do not fit any profile, Divergents, are seen as a threat. This flimsy premise is the basis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes thought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast running, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big guns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she winked directly at camera. I wasn't expecting it to be 'Gattaca', but the fact that it is this flat and predictable is disappointing.",3,3,6,12 September 2014
Now You See Me," hugely entertaining
","Now You See Me starts with a card trick that seems to be played on we, the movie-viewing audience. From the moment the card we picked is seen projection mapped onto the side of a building, there is one question constantly asked: How did they do that? As the bank robbing 'magic' pulses along, a sub-plot involving a fatal attempt at escapology in the past hints at relevance to current events. The cast are outstanding, there is a brisk line in jokes and put-downs, and most of all, the audience is trying to constantly keep up without ever managing to get ahead. The reveal at the end is fiendishly tricky and emotionally poignant. It also has the two qualities required of any perfect twist - it is both surprising and inevitable. Yes, there are plot holes and incongruities, but they only occur to you after the credits have rolled, and the more pedantic viewer can have a field day going over them. Some films you just have to give yourself over to and enjoy the ride, and Now You See Me is a perfect example.",8,0,1,1 August 2015
Yesterday," heartwarming
","A struggling musician wakes up in a world where The Beatles never existed, and sets about re-writing all the songs as his own. The film has decent comedy, especially in the female manager who is not shy about her avarice. Her shark-like persona is a nice counter- balance to the nervous, low self-esteem hero. There is a very nice switch-and-bait with two minor characters at the end that trips you up, but also makes a lovely comment on the hero's project. My favourite moment is when the character is having his Dark Night of the Soul moment, and is sent off to meet a certain individual. It was not a moment I expected, and I have to admit it got to me. Curtis can be sentimental at times, but when he walks the line rather than rushes over it, he can really break your heart. This was one such moment. Not as brimming with humanity as Four Weddings, but also not as shallow as Love Actually. Clever (high) concept, well executed. A fun experience.",6,0,1,28 January 2020
Foxcatcher," the decadent rich
","An isolated, pathetic heir convinces an Olympic wrestling star to utilise his wealth and resources in return for some reflected glory. When the flaws of the mentor seep into the mentored, the star's brother gets involved, with tragic consequences. Carrell has rightly been lauded for his beguiling performance of a deeply damaged individual whose access to power allows him to corrupt others. Looking small wandering around his vast property, having arid, brittle exchanges with his emotionless mother, he is both pitiful and sinister. Tatum also nails the immature, needy and therefore vulnerable younger brother. But it is Ruffalo who impresses most as the most conflicted character in the narrative. He wants to look after his brother, gain access to the benefits the mentor offers, and maintain a relationship with the mentor while keeping him at a safe distance. The complexities of all that are brilliantly captured by Ruffalo, who is fast taking character acting to new levels. E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman fashion an engrossing, tight narrative that crackles till it breaks. Based on a true story that it is best to know little or nothing about before watching.",9,3,8,7 February 2015
It Follows," relentless
","A young women is pursued by a terrifying demonic force, a curse she inherited through the act of sexual intercourse. The only way to buy time for herself seems to be by passing on the curse through sex to someone else. This premise has echoes of 1998's 'Fallen' with Denzel Washington, but the execution is much more lush and laden with deliberate ambiguity. Jay is marked for victimhood by Jeff, who in his own tortured angst sees no alternative than to put Jay between him and IT. He at least gives her a sporting chance, explaining the rules of the game as he understands them. Jeff's explanations underpin the ambiguity: the IT he sees seems far more able to blend in with the common population than Jay's perception of IT, which is almost always dishevelled, if not downright naked. Does IT always take the form of our own nightmares? If so, what exactly is the psychology behind the form IT takes in the climactic encounter with Jay in a swimming pool? The film does a wonderful job of creating a brooding storyworld. The ravages of fiscal and political immorality threaten youth as much as casual sex, as Jay and her cohort drive numbed and hunted through economically ravaged landscapes that seem to belong to a time not of their making. The film plays on dread, self-aware in its evocation of 70s and 80s horror, down to the cars people drive, the incongruous TV sets they watch, and the electronic score. Maika Monroe as Jay is the able conduit for this sense of dread, plausibly unhinged by the fearful and uncanny episodes of IT's ineluctable approach. Keir Gilchrist as the love-struck Paul embodies the frustrations and bitter compromises that his generation have had foisted upon them. There is no American dream here, no bright future, just the day-to-day coping with an unpalatable present. Jay swims to a speedboat, Paul buys time with hookers, and another character seems to use his female classmates as a buffer, but there is a sense here of simply delaying the inevitable, both plot-wise and thematically. The film works to make assets of its limitations, throwing up more questions than answers. The ending is somewhat abrupt, smacking of first installment rather than finality, but that open-ended full stop also sparks conversations. Disturbing, intelligent and lovingly crafted, this film gets under your skin and lingers.",7,5,8,29 February 2016
Gone Girl," twisty, engrossing tale
","A man's wife goes missing, setting in motion a media frenzy that affects not only the husband, but family, lovers, neighbours and law-enforcement. There is biting satire to be had here, most notably on the institution of marriage. Why some people get married, and why some others stay married, defies all logic, and this narrative takes that premise to the extreme. The inanity of our media-soaked culture is also caught in the cross-hairs, as dumb tabloid TV personalities are revered, while peripheral players to the central drama clamour for their attention. Ben Affleck does an outstanding job as the hard-to-pin-down Nick Dunne. A few men will squirm in self-aware discomfort at some of the decisions Nick makes. Rosamund Pike gets to test her range and does not miss a beat, while Neil Patrick Harris takes on a tricky role, making the incredulous credulous. He is perhaps the only character who comes closest to receiving unreserved pity from the audience. The superlative element here is Fincher's pacing. The narrative is a masterclass in setting up and paying off on active questions, with three put in place and answered in each act. And it is the third act that will test the tolerance of some audience members, but delivers, for me, the deliciously dark ending this story requires. As much as we'd love to see pure justice delivered, it is, more often than not, the tawdry compromise offered up here that prevails. One of Fincher's best, and that's saying something.",9,0,4,3 January 2015
Room," chains
","The kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly difficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how damning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over authentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly plausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor in order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie Larson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves affection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is utterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a banality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour, your boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon him in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys the psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about Ma's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father is wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the difficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not help - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of an everyday dark fear appeal. The ending is low-key, but is in its own small way triumphant, a full stop placed right where it was needed. These two characters will go on. They will heal. Thoughtful, mature film-making that stays with you after the curtain closes.",8,2,4,28 March 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," heartwarming
","Ben Stiller is a master of acting through reacting. This kind of role, where he is the straight-laced guy forced reluctantly out of his comfort zone into action, is the one he is made to play. As Walter Mitty, a man with no words to complete the 'been there, done that' field of his online dating profile, he gives a touching, genuine performance of a man who learns to enjoy life, and gets what he wants by doing what he fears. The trailer is full of the CGI explosions, helicopter jumps and shark attacks. But this film works best in its low-key moments: Walter's awkward exchanges with Cheryl, his chiding of Sean's haphazard handling of #25. There is a funny, lovely hug with a colleague in an elevator. And the final shot of this film, revealing a photo that I thought we were destined never to see, is truly moving, a quiet, powerful moment all too rare in cinema. The script has heart and resists the temptation to go for easy pastiche. A simple tale, well told, and honest in its appeal and payoff.",7,6,10,16 March 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," vastly entertaining
","An angry, confused son attends his mother's deathbed. Fading fast, and heavily medicated, she babbles about angels and shafts of light. When she passes, the boy flees the hospital, and is abducted by aliens. Many years later, he is a seasoned space traveller, a kind of hunter of space salvage, and a complete loner. Through scavenging a mysterious orb, he forms an alliance with a green female assassin, a literal-minded hulk, a wily raccoon, and a simple-minded but deadly tree. Everyone needs a family, and this becomes his. Guardians of the Galaxy is a bombastic space opera that throws postmodern self-reflexive humour, and homage to 70s music, into the genre mash. It all blends perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, the characterisations contrast superbly, and the humour is literally laugh out loud at times. Most of all, the film has heart in a way that most European art-house posers will be snotty about, when secretly they would give their right arm to have this much emotional bang. Shamelessly sets up the sequel, but that is forgivable when they get this much right in the first film. Kudos to the screenwriters whose work underpins everything that succeeds here.",8,1,4,14 June 2015
The Imitation Game," private and public battles
","The heroic and the tragic tale of Alan Turing has long been Britain's (not-so) secret shame, a wrong that has recently been righted by representations such as The Imitation Game. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an award-bait performance in bringing Turing's odd genius to life. All the cast are convincing, with Mark Strong as an MI6 agent being especially charismatic. The period is solidly evoked by the stand-up production design, and the script, while slightly too expositional, manages to straddle three time periods in Turing's life, noting how the imperative to conceal his homosexuality crippled him socially. Technically the film maintains a high standard, though there is nothing outstanding in the direction. The cracking of the Enigma Code is arguably the greatest achievement of the British war effort. The personal cost to the man we have to thank is a stunning tale, especially given the secrecy it has been cloaked in for most of the 20th century. In sum, this is a very good biopic that entertains, informs and does justice to Turing's legacy.",7,2,6,25 January 2015
Jurassic World," Termiraptor
","CGI has hardly moved on since the first Jurassic Park movie, so in order to evoke a 'Wow!' factor the latest iteration of the franchise has to rely on narrative innovations instead. What they come up with is a genetically modified killing machine that crosses raptors with T-Rex, and a herd of raptors trained to take orders - kind of - that have the potential for militarization. Yes, it is as lame as it sounds. My pre-teen son was bored, so it fails the litmus test right there. At one point the main character says 'Do you listen to yourself when you speak?' It's a cute moment of pastiche, but the line could basically be applied to 70 percent of the dialogue in this film. Two vanilla boys are the dinosaur bait this time, mashed up with some spurious worries about parental divorce, an irresponsible aunt, and an Indy Jones wannabe dinosaur trainer who is some kind of mixed up eco-warrior. Probably. The baddie is so cardboard and pantomime he should be wearing a cloak and mask. And there is a hipster in the control room who may be Jeff Goldblum's illegitimate offspring, but clearly got his humour gene from his mother. Bland, tonally uneven, with unengaging characters. Meh.",4,2,6,24 March 2016
Silence," frustrating
","Two young Jesuit priests travel to 17th-century Japan, where Christianity has been outlawed. The priests wish to verify whether their mentor has apostatized, but end up facing their own crises of faith. Silence is a huge disappointment, mainly because the main premise, a young priest having a theological crisis in the horror of Godless Japan, does not transfer well to screen. It may well be riveting in the original novel, but the interior world of Garfield does not sufficiently become exterior. This despite ample narration from the protagonist himself, and the bizarre introduction in the last 20 minutes or so of an as yet unseen character, a European merchant whose heavy-handed exposition is, I suspect, intended to close the narrative in a way the images and momentum to this point have failed to do. Garfield performs well, Liam Neeson is reduced to a cameo, and Tadanobu Asano is similarly under-used. An implicit critique of Christian missionary in foreign lands is under-developed. What the Japanese made of these interlopers would be worth exploring, but the film shows little interest in the Japanese point of view. For the first time ever, I was bored by a Scorsese film. Silence is dull, and lacks vision.",4,22,36,27 January 2017
La La Land," sparkle
","La La Land is pure entertainment. 'I am not a fan of musicals,' is a mantra of mine, and while I did not exactly have a Damascene conversion here, I was drawn in by the sincerity of the mission, the scale of the production, and most of all, by Emma Stone's moving, complex performance. Her comedy is spot on in the auditions where she is given some wonderfully awful line readings. But the next moment she is brittle and vulnerable, and the switch and range is quite brilliant. Gosling struggles to match her, achieving pass marks rather than a gold-star performance. The ending is a masterclass in visual storytelling, an extended sequence that plays out without dialogue and will resonate with anyone who has wondered about two diverging paths in a forest, and what lay down the one we chose not to take. La La Land is escapism, Hollywood fairy-tale at its best. The clue is in the title, of course. Give yourself over to it, and you will not be disappointed.",8,1,7,18 March 2017
Steve Jobs," chat
","The Social Network meets Hamlet in this biopic that limits the action to three product launches in the early history of Apple. The whole film takes place indoors, except for a climatic scene of change and redemption that moves outdoors. This is the one directorial flourish in a film limited by its locations, and Sorkin's trademark need to have characters stand around barking eloquently at each other. The acting is very good, with Seth Rogan carrying particular appeal. The directing is straitjacketed in the limited locations. Sorkin's dialogue and characterisation, so finely done in The Social Network, does not stand up here. Everyone sounds like Sorkin, which one becomes weary of after a while. A different writer bringing more nuanced characterisation and idiosyncrasy to the dialogue might have served this project better.",5,1,1,15 July 2018
Whiplash," excess
","Genius is often attained at the cost of sanity, and/or dignity. Tough love is an outdated concept, but its necessity still lingers for some. In Whiplash, an ambitious, driven young man thinks he has found the mentor to take him to the top, but the teacher's methods become increasingly unhinged. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons give outstanding performances that fuel this high-octane piece. Standards of sanity are never relevant here; it is all about how far you can go, how much you can take. Two strong personalities knock hard against each other with no give expected, till a conciliation, or symbiosis, emerges in the end. For me, the only plothole was the fact that Fletcher's violence came as a surprise. In every school there is a teacher who is fearsome and that earns them a reputation. Fletcher's 'methods' would have been the talk of the campus - for Andrew to finally gain entry to that classroom having heard nothing of Fletcher's violence and vitriol was a beat that badly deflated the narrative. That one gaping wound aside, this is a gripping, visceral ride of a film.",8,1,2,26 September 2015
The Big Short," rage
","Cinema should inform, entertain, edify, provoke and incite curiosity. The Big Short has it all. It takes material that is difficult - deliberately fabricated to be difficult, as they point out - and makes it easy to understand without condescending to the audience. Having well-known celebrities explain the fraud highly-paid bankers, raters and other morally bankrupt individuals deployed is a marvelous, startling conceit. Breaking the fourth wall to explain what actually happened, and what the filmmakers added for dramatic effect, is simple, elegant and gratifying. Watching this in 2017 gives added hue - as the film presciently states, the poor and immigrants are being blamed for a crisis that a bloated, self-absorbed, callous elite brought down on our heads. And to our shame, we have forgotten, moved on, and seem destined to repeat the same mistakes. Outstanding performances from all the actors, doing an incredible script the service it deserves. Humorous at times, it also strives to be corrosively satirical, and empathetic to the true victims of this narrative. A perfect film, that I will watch again and again.",10,1,1,18 March 2017
The Iron Giant," delightful
","A young boy befriends a metal-eating giant from outer space. With the help of a beatnik scrapyard owner, he takes on a government agent filled with Cold War paranoia in order to save their iron friend. The Iron Giant is funny, thoughtful and has heart. The script respects the intelligence of young and old, and the under-90 minutes running time attests to the brisk pace and judicious lack of exposition. Our hero Hogarth has a child-like curiosity about his new friend, and a fierce loyalty, all the while keeping sentimentality in check. A quasi-religious theme is lightly threaded through, and an anti-war message is more more strongly foregrounded. But none of these elements detract from an engaging tale of a young boy who is bullied at school looking out for his new-found friend. A good example of what animation can achieve when the screenplay is considerate of its audience.",8,0,1,22 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," brooding
","Metropolis is recovering from the Kryptonian invasion and has a guarded attitude to its new alien protector. Gotham criminals are hunted down by a bat-like vigilante who brands them, a mark that is as good as a death sentence. Batman versus Superman does a decent job of meshing these two characters in a plausible narrative that foregrounds the inner demons both men carry. Affleck's gritty, slightly creaky Batman is a more psychotic, sadistic iteration than Bale's. His drinking is more problematic, even if it is Ch√É¬¢teau Margaux, and his womanising a sordid footnote. Superman is more moral, upstanding, and in a monogamous relationship with Lois Lane. That naivety (he isn't human, after all) makes him fall victim to the machinations of Lex Luthor, Eisenberg at his quirky, irascible best. The film overtly evokes post 9/11 sensibilities and there is a clear motif of Christian iconography threaded through the images. Critics will hate it simply because it is another superhero film in a seemingly endless conveyor belt of them. That's a valid concern, but putting that element aside, this one works with complex characters that do not always get overwhelmed by the CGI, not until the final 20 minutes anyway. You'll have to tolerate some heavy-handed moments as they set up the coming films in the DC Comics/Warner Bros franchise, but these do not intrude too much on a narrative that is intriguing and, despite all the fantasy and machismo on display, all too human. Go with it, and you won't be disappointed.",7,5,10,28 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," satisfactory
","No film has ever carried such onerous baggage as The Force Awakens. You cannot talk about it as a film without seeping into its role as the seventh installment in a franchise, and/or the first part of a new trilogy. The film is expected to both homage revered elements of the past (Han, Chewy, Leia, etc) and exorcise its demons (e.g. the white-heavy cast of episode 4). On reflection, this is a near-impossible task, but the writers and director do just enough here to create anticipation of a fitting climax to the Star Wars saga in episodes 8 and 9. The greatest achievement is the new generation of characters. Daisy Ridley as Rey is a feisty, pugnacious incipient Jedi, much less marzipan than Luke was when we first met him, and far more prepared for the fight. John Boyega as Finn brings comic potential and real spine. Marked out in the beginning by a smear of blood, a darkness in his backstory is hinted at, and should offer up narrative gold if correctly handled. BB8 is also marvelously animated and seems to be starstruck by R2D2. Darth Vader is gone but his spirit lives on, and seems destined to grow. The beloved characters from the original are threaded in astutely, and give the film most of its emotional kick, including a genuinely moving climax, that still hits you in the chest even though you see it coming. Less successful is the cookie-cutter storyline, about a droid carrying secrets that require the Resistance to blow up a planet-destroying weapon of mass destruction - shamelessly and embarrassingly cut-and-pasted straight from Episode 4. Star Wars also gets away with using coincidence far more than any other franchise, but still there is something egregious about the timing of R2 joining the action. Excellent production design sees the Empire (re-branded as First Order) become more overtly menacing and 1940s nuanced, and the planets seem to have culture and grit. Not an outstanding film then, but a competent one, that fashions to work in its own right while whetting the appetite for what is to come.",7,1,17,26 December 2015
Easy A," ho-hum
","A high school girl becomes the victim of rumours after another student hears her tell a lie about losing her virginity. She decides the best form of defence is attack, and allows others to take advantage of her strategy to improve their own situation, while worsening hers. A decent premise, and there are some chuckles along the way. Emma Stone is charming, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are amusing if highly implausible and eventually a bit too smarmy and self-satisfied. The biggest problem is the main character's motivation. She decides to lie for everyone, then asks them to undo the lie for her, because she is fed up with it. That's it. No drama with her parents, and her love interest is devoted to her throughout the tale. Plot-wise, there is little or no development beyond that. All in all, a slightly odd, and bland, piece of storytelling.",4,3,4,2 September 2016
The Great Escape," perfect
","Very rarely do casting, script, soundtrack, editing, performance, cinematography and direction gel so sublimely. Re-visiting this for the sake of childhood nostalgia - Hilts motorbike slide into barbed wire and Christmas post-turkey trifle are forever entwined in my brain - I was struck afresh by the perfection of this film. The mix of derring-do and comedy takes on a shadow with Bartlett's arrival, and then goes a shade deeper with the death of Ives. By the time the men are machine-gunned down in an open field, the tonal shift has moved deftly to the other end of the spectrum. The making of moonshine, and the reaction of the brewers - three simple 'wows' - is a masterclass in economy in scripting. Ditto the rhythmic use of the baseball smacking against the wall in the cooler. And the score - once heard, never forgotten. Quite simply, this is arguably the greatest film ever made.",10,0,2,8 July 2015
Her," profound
","The Turing Test asks humans to decide if an unseen interlocutor is a human or a computer. 'Her' posits a computer OS that is so plausible it not only passes the test, but gives love, and is loved back. The film also extends The Turing Test to ask, implicitly, what happens if AI exceeds human intelligence. At that point, what 'tests' of plausibility would AI set for us? This is a wonderfully observed, thoughtful piece, that functions as both a bittersweet love story, and a contemplation of our fragile, flawed humanity. Joaquin Phoenix is Theodore, struggling to cope with the collapse of his marriage, till OS Samantha (seductively voiced by Scarlett Johanssen) provides the crutch to see him through - though the cruelty (or is it clarity?) of human words burst his bubble. As more and more of us conduct our relationships online, or inhabit the same physical space with strangers while carrying on (sometimes intimate) interactions with distant, disembodied others, 'Her' suggests the dysfunctional, melancholic future we may inhabit. One to watch and discuss.",9,0,3,17 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Furiosa
","Mad Max trips you up because Max is not the centre of the movie - Furiosa is. Once you figure that out the film is much easier to digest. Max just really goes along for the ride but doesn't seem to drive the action in any meaningful way. Technically, the cinematography is very well done and the bendy poles swinging in and out of the frame was inventive. The electric guitar shooting fire was wonderfully bombastic and signals that subtlety will play no part in this film. Immortan Joe was a little too derivative of Batman's Bane, and the romance sub-plot between the harem wife and the fanatical War Boy pushed credulity to its limits. It's a big, loud, sumptuous post-apocalyptic opera of a film, and pretty much delivers on what it promises. Pure escapism designed to sell popcorn, and does it very well.",6,1,2,28 September 2015
The Martian," surviving
","A mission to Mars has to be aborted when a massive storm hits the surface. One crew member, believed killed during the storm, is left behind. NASA and crew mates all suffer over how to get him back, but not as much as he suffers himself. The Martian surprises with its emotional range, at times funny, poignant, contemplative and uplifting. It is 'Castaway' in space, but less concerned with existential crisis. It is also not as po-faced. At one point Damon says 'We are going to science the sh*t out of this,'' his emphasis on 'science' and 'sh*t.' Yes, less rigorous authenticity in the science department, but despite the less than subtle sub-text - Damon practically winks at screen when he says the line - the Internet is full of finger-waggers who have scoured their A-level Physics textbooks to trump the screenwriter. Don't watch this if you want a science lesson, but do come for some great acting, gentle amusement, and a good cry at times. And if mid-70s pop is your musical bag, you are in for a bonus. The last 20 minutes are fairly over-cooked, and they too eagerly chase China box office, but the good elements more than make up for these minor flaws. Entertaining and moving fare.",7,3,4,10 February 2016
