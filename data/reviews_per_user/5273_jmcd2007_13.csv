The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Surprisingly Good Film!
","First things first, I would not label myself as a huge Hunger Games fan by any means, and I have also never read the book series, but I went to see this film with a friend, in which I also saw the first film with him as well. It should also be mentioned, though, that this film takes place directly after the events of the last film in the series, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' unto which I'll admit that I did not see, but was rather filled in by my friend as to what happened in between the first Hunger Games film and this one. While I initially expected to see the usual heavy battle sequences and so forth, I was pleasantly surprised to see something quite different from the previous films. Gone were the usual moderate action sequences of Katniss and her crew incessantly fighting and killing others from rival Districts in order to survive and advance. In my opinion, that got sorely repetitive in the first installment, which also seemed to go along slowly, but since this is the Hunger Games, they were probably just trying to stay true to the book. In any case, with this film, the Director somehow managed (and succeeded) in compensating less action for more intense dialogue and a gripping story plot that has Katniss deemed the 'Mockingjay' of her District, while acting in defiance against the Capitol, led by a very ruthless President Snow who dares Katniss to try and stop him. At the same time, Katniss also attempts to rescue Peeta, who exhibits a different demeanor toward her, from the clutches of a rival District, only to find him strapped to a hospital gurney at the end of the film, thrashing about like a wild animal. My only compliant of this film, however, is that they shouldn't have broken it up into two parts. Granted, if they didn't, I'm sure the film would have had an impressively long running time. Moreover, I know some of these filmmakers love to string their audiences along with cliffhangers, but this film felt rather incomplete in that sense. Oh well, I guess that's what Part 2 is for. Hats off to the cast and crew on this one, though, for you now have my interest on the next and final film in this series.",7,4,17,27 November 2014
The Hunger Games," A Dull and Repetitive Film...
","This film felt really repetitive and, quite honestly, did not hold my interest at all. Being that I have never read the book series, I don't honestly have a clue if the writers managed to stay true to the book here. One would at least hope so. In any case, having 80-85% of the film have what felt like re-hashed fight scenes and death after death isn't my cup of tea. Mockingjay, Part 1 was a much better film in terms of an engaging story plot and more intense dialogue. I've also heard that Catching Fire was quite an improvement over this film as well, in which, yes, I'll admit, I have never seen yet. For now, this seems to be the only low point in what, undeniably, has been a very successful film series in Hollywood today.",2,4,5,28 November 2014
Creed," 'Creed' delivers a knockout punch!
","This film is fantastic! I did not expect some of the twists and turns at all...such as Rocky being diagnosed with lymphoma cancer or Paulie dying (on that note, Burt Young, who played Paulie, does not have any screen time). Stallone is always great as Rocky, but Michael B. Jordan really did a great job as Apollo Creed's son, Adonis Johnson-Creed too.'Creed' finds Adonis Johnson-Creed, son of the late Apollo Creed, yearning to have the now retired Rocky Balboa act as his trainer for an upcoming boxing match in Liverpool England, where he will face 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan, who is a British fighter and current world light heavyweight champion...all of this despite his mother, Mary-Anne (played brilliantly by Phylicia Rashad) advising against this career move (before Adonis was a boxer, he had a job at a local agency, and was even promoted, but quit because the line of work just 'wasn't for' him. At first, Rocky is hesitant to agree to Adonis' request, but eventually gives in and even has Adonis move in with him, a place in itself where they train even harder using most, if not all of Rocky's methods and equipment. Beforehand, Adonis meets a singer-songwriter at his apartment named Bianca, who is also his love interest throughout the film. Things with Adonis' training go along as planned, when suddenly, Rocky collapses at the training facility. He is rushed to the hospital and it is revealed that Rocky has a type of lymphoma cancer, that was fortunately caught early enough to the point where it is treatable through chemotherapy. Reluctant to go through with the procedure, Rocky explains to the doctor that his deceased wife, Adrian, had to go through the same procedure and didn't make it. The doctor tells him to at least take the treatment literature and think about it. Adonis ends up stumbling on this literature when he finds it in Rocky's coat pocket and tells him to go through with it before it is too late...telling him that if he (Adonis) can fight, then Rocky can too. Rocky agrees and Adonis even trains beside Rocky as he is in the hospital receiving his chemotherapy. Reluctant to go by the name 'Creed' over 'Johnson' during his first big match ('Johnson' is his mother's maiden name) Adonis eventually agrees to go by 'Creed.'Despite his chemotherapy treatment, Rocky presses on with Adonis and they both make it to Liverpool for the big match against Conlan. Before the match, however, Adonis receives a gift from his mother. It is a pair of American flag themed shorts (similar to the design of Rocky and Apollo's boxing shorts) with the names 'Creed' and 'Johnson' stamped on both sides. It should be noted, however, that Adonis' mother, Mary Anne, actually appears to have more of an estranged relationship with him as, in the beginning of the film, she came across her own son in 1998 when she came back for him after he got into a fight with a couple of minors in juvenile hall. She confessed to him that she was, indeed, his mother and that she was aware that he never actually got to meet or know his father, Apollo, due to the fact that he died before he was actually born. If not a bit nervous, Adonis, otherwise known as 'Donnie' Johnson-Creed, steps out onto the ring and goes an incredible 12 rounds with 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan. Conlan actually ends up winning the match, but it is Adonis Johnson-Creed who the crowd actually cheers for. After the match, Conlan tells Creed that he is the future of the light heavyweight division. The film ends with a slowed down Rocky Balboa climbing the famous 'Rocky' steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art with Adonis. Rocky then jokes that it feels like 'they added more steps'...most likely as a nod to his advanced age and his character's chemotherapy treatments. In summary, this film is a great addition to a legendary and well respected series and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the 'Rocky' series...and to those that aren't, too!",9,2,5,28 November 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Decent film...but WAY too politically correct
","First things first, I will always regard the Maguire era as Spider- Man's 'Golden Era.' With that being said, this film was indeed slightly better than any offerings from the Garfield era. Unfortunately, however, '..Homecoming' suffers from its use of crude sexual humor (Peter's classmates repeatedly refer to him as a male body part throughout the film) and overt use of political correctness, largely thanks to Zendaya, who is a strong supporter of far left groups like 'Black Lives Matter.' When her character announced to everyone that she had to 'get in some protesting' and then tried to link the Washington Monument to slavery, I nearly gagged. Her instructor didn't help things at all after he followed up on her comments by saying that 'protesting is patriotic.' Spare me. The writers really went overboard on the diversity of the cast too. We are suddenly led to believe that Peter Parker has an Asian friend, while The Flash is a Middle Eastern jock. Meanwhile, the Vulture is white, while his wife is black. They end up having a mixed race child whom Peter befriends and then has a crush on. Oh and everybody can't stop hitting on Aunt May too. Meanwhile, Peter agrees to an internship with Tony Stark, who just so happens to be the creator of Spider-Man's suit. To make matters even more untrue to this franchise, Aunt May also discovers that Peter is Spider-Man at the end of the film too and lets out an f-bomb before the film cuts to the end credits. Really? In summary, the only reason why I saw this film is because of Robert Downey, Jr. It's too bad that he didn't have more screen time, though, because he was really the best part of the film. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Stan Lee's cameo was pretty good too. On that note, I don't have high hopes for the sequel, but will likely see it while hoping for a better and more mature storyline.",5,13,24,8 July 2017
Ant-Man," Way too much forced comedy and not enough action or fight scenes
","This film was just plain terrible. This was actually the first film that I saw that had Paul Rudd in it. Besides that fact, being that I've enjoyed most other Marvel films, I decided to give Ant-Man a try. This, film, however, was simply not good. Once the film was finished, I actually walked out of the theater somewhat happy knowing that I used a free ticket that I got through my theater's rewards program to go see it. Otherwise, I would've regretted even spending money on it. As a superhero, Ant-Man seems to be one of the weakest links in the Marvel superhero chain, as his only special ability is to shrink to the size of an ant while confusing his enemies of his presence at the same time. Not much of a superpower, if you ask me.My biggest gripe with this film was that there was WAY too much forced comedy in it. Michael Pena had to be the most annoying person in this film, with his constant carrying on about almost everything, aiming to be funny when in reality, it's just annoying. Quite a few of Paul Rudd's jokes in the film seemed to fall flat, too. The story plot seemed incredibly slow, too, aiming to focus on more of the main character's relationship with his ex-wife and family than anything else. Just when things couldn't get any worse, the biggest head scratcher in the film seemed to be an unnecessary cameo from Falcon, who seemed terribly out of place. The fight with Yellowjacket was lame, too, as it didn't even seem to last that long. One thing I will mention, though, is how well they managed to make Michael Douglas look about 30 years younger in the beginning of the film. So whoever was in charge there, well done! Moreover, perhaps the funniest part of the film is when an ant is super-sized and was seen walking out of Lang's house. Not only that, but when Lang's daughter Cassie had her toy train (Thomas the Tank Engine) super-sized and then came crashing out of the house onto a police car...that in itself was also moderately amusing. Aside from that, this film wasn't anything to ride home about, and I can only hope that Marvel realizes that by not making a sequel to this...EVER. I'll take The Avengers and Captain America film series over this film any day.",2,60,131,2 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Tom Cruise delivers! This film is a must see summer blockbuster!
","From what I gathered from the trailers, I went into the theater expecting a great film...and I couldn't have been happier with the end result! This film was awesome from start to finish and had what I thought was one of the best villains in the series to date. Sean Harris (who played villain Solomon Lane) did an excellent job in his role, keeping Cruise and his team on their toes throughout the film. Cruise himself also did an excellent job here, too, instantly proving that he still has what it takes to continue on with this role many years into the future.The central focus of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation revolves around a mystery group called the 'Syndicate' who basically work like an anti-IMF, with a sole focus of spreading terrorist attacks around the world, while working to establish a sense of new world order and overseeing the dismantling of the real IMF. Besides this group standing in their way, Ethan and his crew must also deal with Director Alan Hunley (played brilliantly by Alec Baldwin) who is bound and determined to think that Ethan is crazy and that the Syndicate is just in his imagination. Because of his doubts with Ethan, Hunley brings up his concerns to the oversight committee and it is decided that after the events of Ghost Protocol, which saw landmarks like the Russian Kremlin destroyed, that the IMF be dissolved effective immediately. Not long after, Hunley and his crew end up putting Ethan on a most wanted list and try to track him down to no avail, using what appears to be Agent Brandt (Jeremy Renner) as his mole, even though Brandt is working with Ethan. We later find out that Brandt was on Ethan's side all along, and simply tricked Hunley into thinking that he was really helping them, when in reality, he wasn't. The conclusion of the film reveals that the Prime Minister of England, whom Ethan and the team practically kidnapped in order to satisfy a 'request' from Lane, actually had inside knowledge of the Syndicate after Ethan is revealed to be the Prime Minster's associate, Atlee, in disguise, to the instant disbelief of Hunley. Once the real Atlee arrives, Hunt subdues him and gets him to admit a cover-up with the Syndicate ever since Lane hijacked the project and went rogue.Not long after the fact, Hunley and Brandt return to the oversight committee, where Hunley requests to re-instate all members of the IMF, claiming the reasoning behind its initial phaseout was due to allowing Hunt to go undercover. Although doubtful, the committee approves Hunley's request and the movie closes out with Brandt addressing Hunley as 'Mr. Secretary.' So in summary, whether you have been a fan of this series since its inception or just started following it after the third or fourth installment, trust me, you will love this one! It's worth every penny!",10,5,10,2 August 2015
Gone Girl," Over-hyped and dull
","Words cannot describe how awful this film is in terms of an interesting and engaging story plot and holes within said story plot, especially toward the end, which in my opinion, was all over the place. Although I won't spoil anything, I will say that there were some areas of the film that felt unrealistic to me when speaking in terms of common sense, the overall intelligence of some people and real world scenarios. What happened, Affleck? I thoroughly enjoyed 'Argo', but this one just didn't keep my interest at all. I guess I'll check one more movie off in which I didn't go with the critics on. Oh well, hopefully he'll redeem himself with Batman vs. Superman.",2,13,29,23 November 2014
The Bourne Legacy," A Decent Film Coming From An Outstanding Series
","First off, like many others, I was also surprised to hear that the producers were moving forward with the Bourne series without Damon at the helm. However, unlike the Bond films, which have seen a countless amount of actors take over the same role from each other, the Bourne series takes a very different turn here, although the plot is similar to the previous films. Jeremy Renner, who offers a fine performance here, is introduced as agent Aaron Cross a.k.a. Kenneth James Kitsom, who is a member of the black ops program 'Operation Outcome.' However, once Operation Treadstone and Operation Blackbriar are publicly exposed, thanks to Jason Bourne's actions in the previous installments, Cross finds himself pitted against the very organization that he thought was once on his side. Along the way, he meets biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing, played by Rachel Weisz, who in all honesty, slightly overacts her role at times. Cross and Shearing end up traveling to the Philippines to obtain the 'chems' (medication) needed for Cross to survive...a part of the film in which I'm still trying to figure out, but is explained in further detail in a deleted scene that should've really remained in the film for that purpose. Granted, there are 'flashbacks' that show what looks to be a tortured Aaron Cross speaking to some sort of government official or mercenary, but they could've done a better job in explaining that situation more thoroughly, because it left me with more questions than answers there.Bourne's presence in the film is minimal, as are certain characters from previous films such as Noah Vosen and Pamela Landy. In this film, both Vosen and Landy are in hot water with the government after the Bourne situation and end up testifying over the matter. Moreover, although Damon does not officially star in this film, his character's presence is primarily limited to word of mouth and pictures, as despite revealing earlier on in the film that Bourne has been spotted in New York City, he is never found.Perhaps the most surprising, if not darkest part of 'The Bourne Legacy' is the murder-suicide scene, which takes place in Dr. Marta Shearing's biochemist lab. One of Shearing's supposed co-workers, Dr. Donald Foite, abandons his post, opens fire and kills up to five of his co-workers before turning the gun on himself once security arrives. He manages to kill everyone except Dr. Shearing, in which we also learn that he had a possible secret obsession with her, which is why he may have let her live.The film also features impressive scenery as well, with my personal favorite location being Alaska. In the beginning of the film, Cross was there for a training exercise, where he goes 'off the grid' to meet up with exiled Outcome operative 'Number Three' in a log cabin.Finally, although there is less action in this film when compared to previous installments, it still satisfies. Despite having a 2 hr. 15 min. running time, this film did more than enough in keeping my attention.For anyone that already misses Damon as Jason Bourne, fear not, for he he is reprising his role as Jason Bourne, with Paul Greengrass returning as director, in 2016 for the fifth film. However, it has also been suggested that Jeremy Renner will be returning as Aaron Cross as well, so the next installment should certainly make for an interesting film.",7,0,1,7 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Complete Waste of 2 Hours
","Why on earth was this film nominated for so many awards? All I got out of 'Birdman' was that the 'actor' the film followed was washed up and was looking for something to redeem himself. Instead of a genuine story, however, the viewer is forced to suffer through a half- written clunker that seems to focus more on crude sex jokes and innuendo than the actual story plot. The film itself just does not make much sense at all, which makes it challenging to tell where the writers are going here. I also found Riggan's unrealistic 'ability' to levitate and move things around without even touching them to be incredibly stupid. The ending, in itself, was even worse, as Sam, Riggan's daughter, finds a hospital bathroom window open, where Riggan was staying at the time after it was revealed that he botched his own suicide, only to discover that he is not there and has assumingly 'flown away' with the birds into the sky. The film ends as Sam looks down the street, slowly up to the sky and then smiles. What a lousy film. If this really qualifies as 'quality entertainment' these days, then I think it's safe to say that some of these movie critics should either retire or be out of a job altogether.",1,5,10,25 September 2015
Black Panther," One of the best films of the year!
","'Black Panther' is one of the best films of the year in my opinion! The all-star cast is superb and Chadwick Boseman is the perfect fit for the role of T'Challa, otherwise known as the 'Black Panther.' The film itself is also visually stunning as well. Aside from tackling real world issues that relate to oppression, the film also follows T'Challa as he works his way to the throne in a fictional third world country known as 'Wakanda' which is based in Africa. Meanwhile, he also works with CIA agent Everett Ross and a few of his natives to try and stop the villainous Ulysses Klaue from stealing any more Vibranium whilst trying to get an ancient artifact back from him that Klaue and his thugs stole from a British museum earlier in the film.Klaue ends up ultimately betrayed and murdered by Erik Killmonger, son of N'Jobu, so that he (Erik) could challenge T'Challa for the throne back in Wakanda. Killmonger ends up defeating T'Challa and throws him down a waterfall. Fearing that T'Challa has died, the natives of Wakanda reluctantly crown Killmonger as their new king. Killmonger's reign is short lived, though, as we find out later in the film that T'Challa has been saved by one of his natives. Later in the film, we see that T'Challa is mostly covered in a snow / ice like material and it is this material that revives him. T'Challa and some of his natives then develop a plan to overthrow Killmonger. A massive battle commences and this puts both T'Challa and some of his natives briefly at odds with one another as who to protect and who to defend since Killmonger was just crowned the new king of Wakanda. Quickly seeing Killmonger as 'too hateful' however the natives eventually turn on him and start defending T'Challa once again. Killmonger later dies in front of T'Challa. T'Challa himself is then rightfully reinstated as king of Wakanda. Just as the film ends, we see that T'Challa is in California with one of his natives. They are standing in front of the same building that his father and uncle were once in (it's basically like an apartment complex and was featured in the beginning of the film). T'Challa then mentions that has plans to turn it into a wellness center for Wakanda natives. The film itself then draws to a close shortly after that. Lastly, Bucky Barnes from the Avengers is also shown at the very end credits sequence and is referred to as the 'White Wolf.' Stan Lee also has his traditional cameo in this film as well. In summary, this is a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone. Once this releases to Blu-Ray, I will definitely be picking it up! No matter if you're a fan of the Marvel films or not, this film is definitely worth your time and money!",10,3,9,9 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A love letter to the franchise! Superb!
","I had a chance to see 'The Force Awakens' in 3D, which made my experience even better, despite my viewing starting 15 minutes late due to a problem with my theater's projector. In any case, this film was extremely well done and felt very similar to the classic installments. Keeping in line with the traditional beginning and ending credit sequences was a nice touch, too.Not only are Ford, Fisher, Hamill and the rest of the gang back (although Luke Skywalker was only primarily seen at the end), there are also some newer characters added into the mix as well, which is fine. If anything, I thought that the newer characters actually added to the story. Resurrecting the Millennium Falcon was awesome, too! My only chief complaint, however, is that the original characters seemed to have far less screen time than the newer characters. Not too big of a deal, I guess, but I was hoping to see more of them throughout the film considering the fact that they haven't played these characters for decades. I was glad to see, however, that Ford and Fisher were used pretty well throughout the remaining half of the film.Whether you or a 'Star Wars' fan or not, 'The Force Awakens' is THE film of the year to see. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",9,5,17,23 December 2015
Spectre," 'Spectre' misfires...and is full of plot holes
","I had high expectations for this film after 'Skyfall.' However, they fell short after about halfway through the film, and the ending in itself isn't much better. Although there was some impressive action in this film, the story in itself is rather mediocre. Played by the underused Christoph Waltz, Franz Oberhauser, otherwise known as classic Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, basically 'pursues' Bond throughout a majority of the film via 'surveillance' all because he was having 'Daddy issues.' Not much of a story plot if you ask me. Moreover, with all of the 'Nine Eyes' surveillance talk, NSA leaker Edward Snowden came to mind, but that's beside the point.As previously mentioned, Christoph Waltz and Monica Bellucci were severely underused. Moreover, the campy style of some of the jokes were just a tad overdone, too. The DB10 is also hideous, but it was nice to see the classic DB5 at the end. Now for some plot holes in the film: 1.) The 'Spectre' ring - Made no sense and added nothing to the plot of the film. Are we led to believe that this ring was passed on from one Bond villain to another? 2.) The airplane scene - This was just one of the most unrealistic scenes in the film. Bond chases Mr. Hinx by plane after Dr. Madeleine Swann is kidnapped. As Bond continues to chase Hinx, he lands, clips some trees to where the wings shear off, and uses the plane as a battering ram against Hinx's vehicles. After he shoves the vehicles a few times, Bond takes the plane through a barn, where he nearly crash lands about a foot down. Ironically enough, he is still able to steer the plane perfectly and it never explodes, despite all of the abuse that it took. If this were a normal plane that took such abuse, it would've exploded a while ago. 3.) Dr. Madeleine Swann - I never understood why Dr. Swann and Bond felt any sort of attraction for one another, as Dr. Swann was nothing but rude to Bond throughout most of the film, by screaming and saying things like 'get away from me' and 'if you touch me, I'll kill you' while in bed. The fact that they even had a makeout scene actually had some people in my audience laughing (not a good thing). She also proclaims to 'not like guns' but uses one anyway to help Bond defeat Mr. Hinx in the train car. Furthermore, to add insult to injury, however, she actually leaves him at one point in the film, after saying that Bond's lifestyle isn't for her, but somehow reunites with him at the end of the film anyway. For that reasoning, Seydoux's character seemed very complex to me. 4.) The 'dentist chair' drill torture scene - This is another scene that I had a problem with. After Bond is pistol whipped and knocked unconscious, he wakes up to find himself tied down in a dentist style chair, with Dr. Swann and Blofeld sitting not far from him. Blofeld then tells Bond that he is going to use a drill on his head that will affect his vision, balance, and hearing. He proceeds to drill into Bond's head and penetrates his skull, making this scene almost hard to watch at times. After Bond cries out in pain (who wouldn't), Blofeld uses a second drill bit to penetrate one side of Bond's neck. This nearly seems to kill Bond, but despite what he just went through, he still manages to communicate with Dr. Swann. Not long after, Bond somehow manages to slip his watch out and hand it to Dr. Swann after they kiss each other. The watch is thrown in the middle of the room, an explosion occurs, and Blofeld is thrown out of his chair. A battle ensues, Bond breaks out of his chair, and he runs around with guns blazing as if he was never affected by the excruciating trauma that he just went through. A very unrealistic scene indeed. 5.) Toward the end of the film, how did Blofeld know that Bond escaped his guards? As Bond escapes from more of Blofeld's men, he heads toward the MI6 building, which is currently still in ruins and comes across a memorial plaque, which has his name spray painted on it. He also finds arrows pointing in different directions throughout the building, only to find Blofeld standing behind bullet proof glass. After Bond shoots at Blofeld and it hits the glass, Blofeld then arms a bomb that he has crafted and tells Bond that he has 3:00 minutes to evacuate the building before it explodes (he is also tasked with finding Dr. Swann, who is held hostage somewhere within the building). Bond finds Dr. Swann in a nearby room, unties her and they escape, with not a second to spare, as the MI6 building completely implodes behind them as they escape in a fully functional boat that they just so happened to find within the dilapidated building (another small plot hole). With that being said, the fact that Blofeld knew that Bond would be there not only contradicts his faith in his own men, but the fact that it would be literally impossible to determine that, especially being that he had no leads indicating that Bond would even be there. Blofeld's last scene was also pretty disappointing, too, considering the fact that Bond didn't even throw so much as a punch toward him. Instead, M only had him arrested. Besides that, as mentioned, Bond somehow reunites with Dr. Swann and they are seen walking away from the bridge. The film ends with Bond walking into Q's quarters. They have a brief conversation and the film ends. To even have Blofeld as Bond's 'half brother' is ridiculous...and it totally contradicts all of the Bond films of the past. Not a very climactic ending at all, in my opinion.",6,18,38,8 November 2015
Furious 7," Awesome Film...and a Fitting Tribute To a Wonderful Character and Person (R.I.P. Paul Walker)
","I walked into the theater knowing that this film would be Paul Walker's last...and also knew ahead of time that there would be a tribute to the him at the end credits, while also having his two brothers act as stand-ins to complete the film. My expectations were completely blown away. The addition of Statham as the villain (otherwise known as Deckard Shaw, who is out for revenge against Toretto's crew for the death of his brother Owen in Fast 6) was excellent, and really showed off his acting ability well here...not to mention his fine martial arts skills. The early battle between Dwayne Johnson and Statham were great too, with 'The Rock' himself delivering his famous finishing move, otherwise known as 'The Rock Bottom' to Statham through a glass table. Not only does Statham do battle with Dwayne, but with Vin Diesel as well, with the largest fight occurring toward the end of the film. Surprisingly, however, Dwayne's role is more limited here, as he spends a majority of the time recovering in the hospital after being thrown out of a building from a mine that Deckard detonated within Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) police headquarters. It really wasn't that big of a deal, though, as Dwayne kicks back into action once realizing through local news reports that trouble is brewing right outside his window.As mentioned however, this film marks a somber note, and final goodbye, to one of the Fast & Furious franchises' most beloved character and actor, Paul Walker. Walker, who died at only 40 yrs. old in a horrific car crash on November 30, 2013, was featured prominently in the film, with his character, Brian O'Connor now getting used to the family life. Toward the beginning of the film, he is now driving a minivan and has one child with Mia. However, once Dom's house explodes thanks to a 'package' that Deckard Shaw had sent to his residence, they all soon find themselves back into the 'game' for 'one last ride.' Were there a few semi-impossible stunts and a decent amount of CGI used in this film? Yes, but we must remember that this is a movie and movies generally do tend to go this route sometimes. That's why they call it entertainment. Let's also remember that some CGI also had to be devoted to Paul Walker, too, who only completed around 60% of this film before his death, while his two brothers graciously stepped in to fill the void. If it weren't for them, this film might not have happened at all. In any case, this film had everything in it that I ever expected...and more. An emotional tribute to a great character and actor that will make even the most unemotional person cry. During the beach scene at the very end, you could tell that the actors themselves were no longer acting. Like many fans, they all looked very shook up over Walker's death, and from that scene on, you could tell that it was all real life from there on out. The movie closed out with Vin and Paul driving on a two lane highway, and then splitting down separate roads. The screen then faded to white and simply said...'For Paul.' If he were alive today, I'm sure Paul Walker would be very proud of this film. Even though I had no involvement in it whatsoever, I know I was. I'm sure his family would be, too.",10,2,6,7 April 2015
