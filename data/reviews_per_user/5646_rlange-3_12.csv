National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good but not great entertainment
","Another Indiana Jones style knockoff with a lot of tie ins with American history and some funny interaction within the cast, a car chase, and some minor intrigue. All a lot of fun, and well worth the entertainment value as a family film. Kudos for the directors for keeping it that way.There are some detractions - I thought the whole Rushmore part came off as a hodgepodge; it just felt very slapped together. Ed Harris's character was all over the map, not because of Harris but because of his wild and unexplained swings in role. This movie is hardly an in depth look at innermost character angst so why introduce the erratic ambiguity? Cage was fun but not outstanding.Still, well worth the entertainment value if you are looking for some diversion and a few laughs. I gave it a 7.",7,0,2,25 May 2008
Cloverfield," Really Great and Scary Entertainment
","Not Alien but it is a very scary movie, very well done. It's surprising to me that so many reviewers panned it. If you really can't stand the Blair Witchy hand held camera stuff, perhaps this isn't your movie.The first 20 minutes are slow and marginally entertaining at best, but they lay the groundwork for the nonstop action for the rest of the film. There are several simply spectacular events and a handful of very spooky ones. The characters are not necessarily ones you like as individuals, but they are well acted and seem very real. By the end of the movie I thought they had all showed some unexpected sterling qualities. The only thing that annoyed me slightly was the lead female running around in heels or at times barefoot with broken glass everywhere -- I think she would have swapped them for something more functional. But that's a minor point.The dialog was not a high point of the movie, but it added some significant depth to the main characters. What some are complaining about as bad lines are pretty much what you would expect from a guy like 'Hud' in my opinion. In fact it was nice to see ordinary people facing an extraordinary situation without superheroics.Both monster types were genuinely scary, and I am rarely scared even though I want to be. Marletta's wound was especially well done, as were the final scenes of her agony.It was also great to see a movie in which the military was portrayed as the military, with no evil plotting general or totally incompetent or uncaring individuals. And while there is an overlay of a defense project gone amiss, this is not a movie in which we are lectured by the antimilitary crowd -- a major improvement.If you liked the movie (I saw it on DVD), check out the special features, especially the documentary on the CGI work. Very well done.In summary, unless you strongly dislike hand held cams, this is great entertainment. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,8 May 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Could have been a good movie without the propaganda
","First, the good. It was an inspirational film both in demonstrating the personal heroism and humanity of the reluctant heroes and the deep and abiding love between the hotel manager and his family.Unfortunately the film was apparently intended as a piece of political propaganda. Anyone familiar with the issues involved will find some of the points put forth by the film ridiculous and an insult to their intelligence.The horror of war was, if anything, thoroughly sanitized. Over a million people were killed in the real war, and Kigali as the largest city was the center of much of the violence. Yet we see a few hundred corpses scattered about with no closeups, and few if any people actually being killed. This is not to demand a gore-fest, but if thousands were hacked to death by machete wielding tribesmen, why not grudgingly give into the reality and show how cruelly disgusting it was?While the violence was clearly and overwhelmingly African on African, much of the moral outrage expressed in the movie is directed at the Europeans. And, of course, the Americans. As if it were our responsibility to save the Africans from themselves. Kipling would have been in full accord with the 'white man's burden' concept underlying the moral themes of the movie. This is furthered by an interesting piece of history presented on the origin of the Hutus and Tutsi. Guess who's fault all this is? Why, the Belgians of course. Never mind the fact that the area was originally held by the Twa who were conquered by the Hutus a thousand years ago and then taken over by the Tutsis probably 500 years ago, long before there were any Belgians around to muck things up. The film delivers the preposterous concept that all was love and Kumbaya until the Evil Europeans showed their faces and separated them intro tribes. Utter balderdash.Then we have the UN. Forget the fact that UN peacekeeping forces on this planet have been found to be regularly engaged in the sex trade for children and common bribery. The UN troops in the movie are all Sir Galahad's from another planet, riding here and there to the rescue who's sole problem is that they are hopelessly outnumbered. I practically expected a 'Donate the the UN Support Group' phone bank number to flash on the screen every time Nolte appeared. While there is plenty of moral bashing against Europe and America there is no attempt whatsoever to ask the counterpoint -- why should it have been the responsibility of Europe and America to intervene in the middle of a massive tribal war? One can debate the point, and certainly good people can draw conclusions on either side of this issue. But the issue is simply never raised. It's all about how cowardly America and the French are for not sending in the Marines. And now that you mention it, why America and not China, Egypt, South Africa, Japan, Russia, or Germany? Belgium may have had historic interests there by certainly the US never had African colonies. How did we somehow become part of the select group of the guilty?Overall, it was worth seeing, but only if you open your eyes and see the baloney sandwich you are being served, and hold your nose when you smell it. A major disappointment.",2,18,81,19 April 2005
Ocean's Twelve," The fun runs out before the movie does
","You will do your first double take at the very beginning of the movie when you find that the group that was portrayed as brilliant, gutsy sharpsters in Ocean's 11 falls to pieces at the demand that they repay the guy they robbed in the last movie. Say what? The lack of credibility might have been bridged by great acting or great chemistry but this movie has neither. It degenerates into a series of photo-ops of the beautiful people, strung together in a manner that is neither convincing, or for that matter, particularly entertaining.I was personally quite surprised at how good the modern Ocean's 11 was, considering that the original Ocean's 11 with Sinatra and the rat pack left some pretty big shoes to be filled. But Oceans 12 is a stereotyped sequel -- an attempt to capitalize on prior success on the cheap.",4,1,2,22 April 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Has its moments is about the best you can say for it
","Movies can either get us to suspend belief, or to view them as tongue in cheek enjoyable performances. The problem with The Bourne Ultimatum is that it takes itself far too seriously to accomplish the latter, but is far to ridiculous to get us to suspend disbelief. Ultimately, it has enjoyable sequences but falls far short of being 'the best action picture in decades' which is how it is billed on the rental box.Technically, it is well done with good camera angles, a great deal of variety, and decent acting. It is entertaining, which is always a redeeming feature. Bourne is treated as a superhero, able to leap from tall buildings, jump out of all manner of car wrecks without a scratch, dodge bullets with impunity, and otherwise perform amazing stunts with ease. The actors are good across the board, and in isolated scenes credibly portray tension, anger, and intrigue.But the plot itself is absurd, as are the capabilities of the CIA which are portrayed. Murder for unknown reasons at the highest levels of the operation, never really explained. This is paranoid delusion, the kind of thing you expect from a stoned out hippie at 3 AM who relates how 'they' are killing people left and right but only the real 'insiders' know about it. Yet somehow proof is never offered, nobody ever leaks the operation, and Americans just get shot willy-nilly without a trace of integrity or remorse. At its most fundamental level, this is just another Hollywood attempt to turn Americans against the CIA. We've got people being blown up all over the world by terrorists, but the movie industry seems to be obsessed that the bad guys are always Americans who are ostensibly patriotic. This meme gets boring after a while.What is outright ridiculous is the capacity the agency is given to have a camera in every hall, on every building, and in every street and alleyway in the world. This all gets piped in to the top secret war room as if you are right there on the scene, courtesy of some wildly concocted surveillance system that never even goes out of focus. It's a little too much to buy into even in your wildest dreams.That would be humorous, and perhaps enjoyable if it were done with an occasional wink to the audience. Instead, it is treated as fact and becomes part of the movie taking itself too seriously for the content it is delivering.",5,0,2,18 February 2008
2012," Spectacular special effects but the biggest disaster is the humans
","Whiny, annoying, preachy, with over the top ham handed idiocy for Glover, Harrelson, Cusack, and double for the President's daughter and that moron science adviser. I can hardly fault them for what was written into the script but a barf bag should have been provided for stunts like the President suddenly deciding to stay behind and the science adviser risking the survival of the human race for what was a drop in the bucket group when billions had already died.Worth seeing for the utterly spectacular disaster special effects, even if many of them are tongue in cheek as when the novice pilot flies a plane through the collapsing buildings of Santa Monica. Still, much of it looks like it might actually look given some latitude on science and the unlikelihood of a tsunami cresting the Himalayas.Somebody in the studios should get smart and release a version that spares us all the histrionics and keeps the special effects.",6,0,0,12 July 2010
Alice in Wonderland," I'm stunned by how underwhelming this movie was
","Alice in Wonderland is an amazing story on both a child and adult level, in large part because it is so clever and filled with double meanings pervaded by a sense of unreality. Take an awesome story like this, combine it with a great actor like Depp and an obvious master of CGI like Burton and one expects to be blown out of their seat with wonderment and magic.Unfortunately the reality is not so much. None of the characters are particularly endearing -- although Alice gives it a try -- nor memorable. The card/soldiers were actually better in some of the cartoon versions of the story -- at least they had faces and expressions. These were neither scary nor did they show discernible emotion but came off like characters in a low resolution video game. The 'hookah smoking character' we know and love was a complete dud. At least the Red Queen was mildly amusing, but never much more than that. And Depp, incredibly enough, was more boring than anything else.What can I say? Ouch.",4,1,2,5 September 2010
Avatar," Starts out superbly but rapidly devolves into classless stupidity
","During the first half of the film we are introduced into the marvelous and alien world of Pandora. Special effects are top flight and oonceptual science fiction elements are tightly woven.Alas this marvelous setting is squandered on some kind of wacky morality play in which evil humans driven by overbearing caricatures of the military and corporate worlds act like monsters to destroy the hippie wonderland.The whole second half is boring and rather predictable, although I'll admit I never thought it could plunge to this level of crude self=satire. By the end I was reminded of Sigourney Weaver's plan to 'nuke the place from orbit', just to rid of these ridiculous stereotypic Natives being saved by the Great White Hunter and his renegade sidekicks.There is no subtlety at all in the second half morality play. We are being force fed a phony morality until it is reborn in a massive episode of projectile vomitus of hovercraft brought down by pterodactyls. Enough. The beautiful people with their private jets and hundred million dollar self aggrandizing lectures don't expect to have to live in the jungle. They expect us to live their, in obeisance to their Angry God of Carbon.Way to ruin what could have been a very good movie.",4,4,6,24 September 2010
30 Days of Night," Very spooky, entertaining horror movie
","I love horror, I don't like gore. This movie had plenty of both, and the fact I rated it this highly is a tribute to the all around excellence of the acting, the production values, and the unique location in Barrow, Alaska. Unfortunately there are also a number of flaws which keep this one well down from a top rating. Fortunately, most of them are stuffed into the last quarter of the film.Good - We didn't get a lot of vampire mythology. They weren't glorified or turned into hip objects of admiration. All that made them far more believable as a force of heartless evil. It would be so easy to go over the top in portraying the evil but this film does a great job of not throwing a lot of unnecessary emo into the vamps. Excellent job.The setting is superb. Cinematography first rate. Crane scene breathtaking. It seems a bit warm most of the time for the season but that's quibbling. The 'heroes/heroines' are played well and most importantly not overplayed. This is not a movie where one guy stands there blazing away with automatic weapons in both hands while dozens of bad guys fall dead. It's quite believable in terms of the outcomes of fights, up until the end. The 'conversion' of the children was especially eerie.Bad - Some of the survival decisions made by the dwindling group of humans seem rather... bone headed. It's not clear why they could not have weaponed up a bit more. It wouldn't have taken much to have the rugged mountain man saw the barrel of his shotgun down, for example. If 'UV lamps' worked like magic phasers, why wouldn't they have taken some back to the power station? There seemed to be no plan at all for interior defense. Surely the middle aged woman had the guts to wield a weapon, but I don't recall her having a gun. etc etc.Awful - Good grief, the last ten minutes just about flushed the whole movie down the commode. They are a couple hours away from daylight and the Sheriff does what??? Then he goes off and fights the leader of the vamps while they all stand around and watch??? And his wife, instead of running like she's supposed to just walks up to them??? huh? The ridiculous melodrama with the sunrise just caps off a sequence of pure schlock. If the whole movie had been like the last ten minutes this would indeed have deserved a 1. It's too bad they couldn't have found a better way to end it other than this near comical series of ruinously improbable events.",7,1,1,31 March 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," If you like silly movies, this one offers some good times
","This one is a low brow mixture of silly and potty humor with low impact but has its moments. Personally I liked the 'Brick' character, but all of the main cast did a pretty good job hamming it up. However once it hit about the 60th percentile of hilarity, it would back off and spin its wheels, never really breaking through. The fight scene for example was zany and with a clever start but by the end it was just ridiculous with no real closing punch. That description works for the movie as well. The skit was over and so the movie just kind of petered out.The cat show set the stage for a great punch line that never came. The escape from the bear scene was funny, but not a rolling in the aisles funny. The pattern is one of an-orgasmic humorous interruptus, and on to the next vignette.However it's fun if one's expectations are not excessive.",6,2,2,14 May 2005
Hancock," The plot is too stupid to make this a good movie
","Obviously a lot of people liked it, and it certainly wasn't a terrible movie but in spite of decent acting and action scenes it ends up being lame by forcing us into a plot that is simply stupid. The message is apparently that there are no real superheroes and companies should give away all their products to make the world a better place. And while it is a comedy with a few funny scenes it takes itself entirely too seriously to escape into an absurdist parody of the pretense.Look at how ridiculous the ending is for example. I won't spoil it, but the movie tries to pretend it is a critical look at the shortcomings of the less than ideal superhero while ending on a note that is so sickeningly saccharine and idealistic that barf bags should be passed out in the theaters.",4,4,8,14 December 2008
Beowulf," Not as bad as some are saying, Not as good as you hoped
","Given the power of the cast and the budget, you perhaps hope for a movie which is stunningly entertaining and in some way expands your consciousness, if only for a brief 90 minutes or so. Unfortunately you get neither, just an action movie with a rather twisted and unhistorical plot. The acting does not shine through the CGI very well. Maybe it's because I am in my 50s and did not grow up with CGI, but I keep feeling like I am watching a cartoon, which is to say the least distracting.I can certainly understand that in such spectacles as the monster fight, CGI offers at least an approximation of realism. But in scenes where human interaction predominates, CGI falls far short of communicating human expression and emotion and leaves me cold.There is a lot of discussion of the historical 'accuracy' of this movie. I did a little research, and it seems that there are major gaps in the major historical document (literally, much is missing or has crumbled away), and how it should be interpreted. Given this, it seems peculiar to pan the latest rendition of a reality that causes great controversy, even among academics. I do agree that Beowulf is portrayed in a very unflattering and unfavorable light by the movie.In the obvious comparison CGI movie, the 300, the producers emphasized the myth. In Beowulf, they denigrated it. Neither, by itself, is reason to reject the movie itself. But 300 sold itself as a CGI production, and exceeded expectations. Beowulf sold itself as an exceptional human drama and fell flat on its face, saved but hardly exalted by its action scenes.",6,8,15,15 March 2008
