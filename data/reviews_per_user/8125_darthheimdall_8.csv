Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Should be renamed 'JarJar Gone Wild'
","The Phantom Menace was less of a Star Wars prequel and more of a playground on which to display George Lucas's new CGI toy:Jar Jar Binks. Aside from being amazingly animated, he was basically Roger Rabbit with a Jamaican accent. He received too much attention(was in at least half of the scenes in the movie), and did almost nothing useful whatsoever, unless being a total buffoon is useful.Qui-Gon Jinn, played by Liam Neeson, was the only character who did any good acting, and when he died, so did the movie, which was already on life support. I would comment on Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan, but aside from a couple of funny lines (Have we picked up yet another pathetic lifeform?) he wasn't allowed to do much of note. Natalie Portman was terrible as Padme Amidala-if they just wanted someone to stand around in different costumes like a mannequin, they should have used an actual mannequin, not wasted one of the best young actresses around. Jake Lloyd was too happy to be a slave-he mostly ran around and said 'Yippee'. He was also too young: the scenes with him and Padme, where Lucas obviously tried to hint that they were going to fall in love, because of the vast age difference, made Padme seem more like a female pedophile than a politician. The Sith were almost completely pushed into the background, and did not do many particularly evil things except hide under black hoods. It was a shame, because Darth Maul had some serious potential and could have been a fantastic villain if he had not been killed off after only doing two fight scenes and saying only two lines. The Jedi were completely pushed in the background, only appearing to say that Anakin was dangerous and evil, although the only thing bad about him was his character development. If I had two words to sum this movie up, they would be 'wasted potential', because Lucas had the elements he needed to create a good movie, but because he wasted so much time on Jar Jar, he forced a nearly all-star cast into the toilet. This is a perfect example for not seeing the forest (the whole movie) because of the trees(special effects like Jar Jar).",1,2,4,13 March 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Strong start, mediocre finish
","This movie had a lot going for it. An interesting take on Wolverine and Sabretooth as brothers and showing their relationship as initially positive as they watch out for each other from childhood in the 1800s to Vietnam. A tragic love story with a folktale that explains why Wolverine chose his name, and his decision to trust the devilish Stryker in order to fulfill his quest of revenge against Sabretooth for killing the woman he loved.And it is all wrecked by a ridiculous twist in which Kayla Silverfox winds up alive, making Wolverine's vendetta pointless, bringing the plot to a crashing halt, and leaving us wonder why the writers chose to cop out with an unbelievably absurd conspiracy plot when the movie was doing so well. The film would have been much stronger if they had stayed on the dark, dramatic course they started on to explore whether Wolverine's quest for revenge would truly bring peace or destroy him. Not to mention the film was far too short to do justice to all the characters thrown into it, and that the best acted villain in the film, Sabretooth, is later shelved in favor of Deadpool, who would have been better developed in a sequel then randomly thrown in to fight at the last minute of this film.While it is not as bad as all the haters claim it is, it's not great, either. Rent it on DVD to watch with your friends, but don't expect anything more than mild entertainment.",6,0,3,6 October 2009
Spider-Man 3," The darkest, most complex, and best of the three
","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious 'black suit'. There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his 'nerdy' core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious 'evil twin nerd' version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!",10,101,152,5 May 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," An innovative blend of fantasy and reality
","There is a rare class of movies that get better every time you watch them. Pan's Labryinth is one of those films. After viewing it the second time, I love it even more than when I first saw it in the theatre.There are two plots that are woven together. The first is about Ofelia, a young girl who embarks on a quest to return to her kingdom in the underworld by a mysterious Faun. The second is about her nurse Mercedes, and her quest to dispose Ofelia's Fascist stepfather, Captain Vidal. Ivanna Baquero, in spite of her young age, can act circles around many of Hollywood's best in her role as Ofelia, coming across as a mature but still imaginative young girl who must deal with a cruel stepfather, a civil war, and a dying pregnant mother on top of a dangerous quest for immortality. Mercedes is excellent as she spends day after day serving her fascist master so that she can gather intelligence and supplies for her brother and his freedom fighters. Captain Vidal is a cool, sadistic villain, while still sympathetic in his concern for his unborn son. The doctor, while pessimistic about overthrowing the fascists, does the right thing in aiding Mercedes against them. Overall, this movie is a perfect blend of fantasy and reality, and would be enjoyable even to those who stopped believing in fairy tales when they were ten. As both plots combine into a tragic but optimistic story, so do the genres of war and fantasy combine in this film to create a dark but excellent movie.",10,3,6,15 December 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-men: The Last Slouch
","I saw the first X-men movie on F/X. Aside from a few nitpicks (not enough Sabretooth), it was very well done. Only saw the last hour of X-2, but what I saw was brilliant. Both of those were in a whole new class than X-men 3.Plotwise-Ratner should know that it is impossible to juggle two major plots in a movie that's only one hour and forty minutes. Furthermore, in the 'cure' storyline, it was like they copied lines straight from the gay,lesbian, bisexual and transgender movement (i.e. 'They're treating us like a disease?'). Regardless of your views, it is never a good idea to blatantly copy and paste a major movement so obviously that it ruins the narrative. The Dark Phoenix story arc is completely butchered-Jean kills Cyclops, dryhumps Wolverine, kills Professor Xavier, then stands around looking bored for the remaining hour of the movie, until Wolverine kills her in the cheesiest way possible ('I love you'-stab!). Oh, and all the major confrontations at the end (Iceman versus Pyro, Wolverine versus Magneto) only last about five seconds each. All that build-up for nothing.Characters-Cyclops gets killed in the first 15-20 minutes. This was completely ridiculous, considering that Cyclops is, for all practical purposes, the leader of the X-men. The fact that Wolverine, who HATES Cyclops, is the only one who cares, makes it even worse. Beast is brought in as a welcome addition, but all the other newbies (Angel, Juggernaut, etc.) are so poorly developed that one wonders why they were put in the movie in the first place. The returning cast (Wolverine, Storm, Jean, etc.) manage to put on great performances in spite of the lousy screenplay.Special Effects and Setting-Good, but the other aspects are so poor as to render these icing on top of a burned McDonald's pastry.Dialogue-There are some good one-liners (When Wolverine fights a guy who can grow arms, he finally just kicks him in the nuts and says 'Grow those back!'). But overall, nothing special.Overall, this movie is simply not worth the time to watch, because Ratner did not put in the time required to make it good. Hopefully, he will not be allowed anywhere near the Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs.",4,1,1,5 May 2007
Hero," All style, no substance
","I heard good things about this movie so I stayed up to watch it when it came on TV at 3 a.m. The visuals were stunning, and the action sequences (especially the 'mind battle' between Nameless and Sky in one plot) were fantastic.However, from a plot perspective, this movie is terrible. First we get one plot of how Nameless killed the three assassins, which is false, then another detailing what the Emperor thinks happened, which is false, and it just kept going until I didn't care anymore. And why did Broken Sword get stabbed in every single plot? And I still don't understand why Nameless didn't kill the Emperor. If the cryptic 'Our Land' message was supposed to be the reason, it simply wasn't good enough. I don't see why a man who had his province oppressed would kept from killing a tyrant for the sake of unifying with other provinces he's probably never seen, much less cares about. This is more proof that the critics, who have overwhelmingly lauded this movie, are out of their minds.",1,7,15,11 July 2007
Transformers," Biggest disappointment of the year
","I loved the cartoon series as a kid and, after seeing the commercials, thought it would be freaking awesome. Instead, I wound up stuck in a movie with a ridiculous plot, too many irrelevant characters, and too much sex humor for a movie that is supposed to be about giant robots wailing on each other (I am in my twenties and male, so I can hardly be considered a prude. The fact that even I cringed at the mother making masturbation jokes means that there is such a thing as a limit for that sort of humor). Most of the Transformers do not even show up until the movie is halfway over. The subplot of the signal detection team (who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the network-a no-brainer) could be cut without losing anything of note (except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's on-screen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool). And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent, and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar, but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie. If you copy and pasted scenes from Independence Day, Matrix Revolutions, a bunch of US air force commercials and Bad Santa all together on your computer, you would wind up with basically the same mess.",1,91,150,11 July 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Brokeback Mountain meets Nascar
","The trailer was funnier than the actual movie.Pros: -It had a good, but deceptive, trailer, since no mention of the Gay Formula Run antagonist played by Sasha Cohen was made. If I knew how obscene and disgusting his character would be, I would have never watched the movie.Cons: -Will Ferrell is playing the exact same role of a senseless buffoon that he does in other movies such as Elf. -The plot was nonexistent. It was basically 'let's watch Will Ferrell act like a moron for 108 straight minutes'. Also, the angle where his best friend steals his wife, then still tries to be his friend, is not funny so much as dumb. -Jean Girard is revolting. He goes from patting Andy Richter on the butt, to creating images of men kissing each other in his victory lap, to making open sexual passes at Ricky Bobby. By the end of the movie, most of the audience looked ready to puke. -The 'Baby Jesus' scene was in really poor taste. Just because you don't agree with a religion does not give you the right to mock it for ten minutes on the big screenOverall, this is among the worst movies ever made. I personally will never watch another Will Ferrell movie ever again.",1,1,6,5 May 2007
