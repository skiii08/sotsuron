The Rock," The best movie of all time
","This movie kicked ass!The acting of Harris, Connery, and Cage were awesome which made it even better. The action was amazing, and the movie was never boring. There were extremely funny lines in this movie, which lighten up the movie so it is not that serious which makes it even better. The best part is the crazy car chase, through the streets of San Francisco, and the amazing explosion with the street car.",10,1,1,26 September 1999
The 13th Warrior," exciting
","This movie was really exciting.I found Antonio Banderas was good in the movie as were the other actors. The action was really bloody and nasty, but were exciting to watch. The scenery was incredible, and there was lots of good laughs throughout the movie. Overall a good job by john mctiernan, who also directed the horendously boring the thomas crown affair.",10,0,0,23 September 1999
Pearl Harbor," awesome!
","This movie kicked ass! It had such good acting in it, a great cast and a kick ass battle scene. The love scenes were a bit to much but that was the only complaint. I thought it was a historical view of pearl harbor and i don't know what the critics were complaining about. It showed exactly what happened to pearl harbor and how both the Americans and Japanese were planning for it. GOod job and great action",10,0,2,26 May 2001
Man on the Moon," good
","I thought that Jim Carrey was excellent in this role. I was watching this special on the life of Andy Kaufman and showed many scenes of him which were also shown in the movie. Jim did them perfectly, and was also very funny too. I also thought the director did an excellent job of recreating the scenes. ALl the actors were excellent in the movie especially Danny Devito.",10,0,0,28 December 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Much better then the first one
","This one was extremely exciting. I was on the edge of my couch every time i watch it when ever the dinosaurs attacked. Even though this movie lacked a story like the original it was still extremely entertaining. I though that Jeff Goldblum should have been funnier, and the ending was fun to watch but was somewhat cheesy at some parts. I give this a 5 out of 5",10,5,13,20 September 1999
The Green Mile," Excellent
","This movie was one of the best one's ever. The acting job of Hanks and the guy from Armageddon was very good in this movie. There was the perfect amount of humour, suspense and drama to keep me watching it to the very end. All the actors were excellent and all of them I knew from previous movies such as the warden and the prison guards in the movie. The execution scenes were realistic and shocking to watch. I give it a 20 out of 20",10,0,1,28 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," A classic
","This movie was very entertaining. The acting of morgan freeman and tim robbins, were exceptional, as well as the other actors. Even though very violent, it's extremely entertaining. The script was very good, and had some humorous lines, which were hard to notice. This movie is one of the best ever, and should have one for best picture, best actor and best director. One of Stephan Kings best novels, to become a classic motion picture.",10,0,0,26 September 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," an instant classic
","This movie was hilarious. The two actors were awesome in the movie, and the dancing was very funny, and good. Overall an excellent job in filmmaking. There are many good lines in the movie, which i remember well. The ending is the best part, when they use a jerry maguire scene",10,2,3,26 September 1999
The Matrix," wicked
","This movie kicked ass. It was weird at times but all the action made up for it. Keanu Reeves was especially good in the movie, and the martial arts seen with him and Fishburne was funny as well as cool. THe ending was the best part",10,0,0,23 September 1999
