Sucker Punch," I'd like to punch all those suckers who say that 'Sucker Punch' sucks.
","Zack Snyder directs this very surreal film about girls in the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. Sucker Punch' stars Emily Browning as Baby Doll, a supposedly 20 year-old girl whose mother, after her death, writes in her testament that all of her property would go to her two daughters. Baby's evil stepfather is outraged and on one faithful night, beats the crap out of Baby's sister, killing her. Baby witnesses this, grabs a gun, and shoots her stepfather. He lives and sends Baby Doll to the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. That's when the movie really begins.Upon arrival to Lennox, she meets with fellow inmates Rocket, Sweet Pea, Blondie, and Amber. All you Vanessa Hudgens fans, Blondie is played by her. It is then that we come to understand that Lennox isn't a mental institution, more of a bordel. We also meet Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski, the coreographer' of the girls' dances, which they perform to men who eagerly expect so. Baby Doll befriends her fellow inmates and while performing for the first time, comes up with a plan to escape the facility. That's when all the crazy action sequences begin in the film, which is contrary to popular belief, actually pretty good.Most critics have panned this film. Richard Roeper gave it a D and it's received a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That's just 2 percent higher than what the site gave to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,' so you know Sucker Punch' should be bad. But movie critics aren't always to be trusted, and as much as I respect them, I've gotta say that I believe they're horribly wrong to rate Sucker Punch' negatively. I've read reviews for the film and most of them say that the film never explains what the crazy action sequences are about. It actually does, but nobody ever pays attention to what's going on in an action film, and then afterwards they complain why they didn't understand anything that was going on.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'd rather have that you go out, see the movie, pay attention throughout the film, and then tell me whether you got it or not. I certainly did, or if the Snyder meant something else, then I didn't. Whatever I got, however, was enough to make me interested in the movie throughout.I think that the reason why many didn't pay attention throughout the movie, was because it was directed by a man who is primarily known for directing mindless' action flicks such as 300,' which is actually a very good movie. In 300,' Snyder catches our (or at least mine) attention with gorgeous visuals, here he does the same. All the action sequences are masterfully choreographed and you always know where the enemy is, and the protagonists are.That said the movie does have its flaws. The dialogue is often a bit too corny, the film was perhaps a bit too stylistic, and it is definitely not to be compared with Snyder's masterful previous work. But in overall, Sucker Punch' is whether you get it or not, an undeniable visual treat with a jaw-droppingly epic soundtrack, and if any of you dare say that it just looks like a video game, I'll reply: Well, I like video games.'Rating: 3/4",7,12,23,11 June 2011
Thor," 'Thor' is indeed almighty!
","Kenneth Branagh, the man who brought us Shakespearean masterpieces such as 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V', directs 'Thor', a marvelous summer-starter (even though there's still one month till summer begins).'Thor' stars Chris Hemsworth, a relatively unknown actor, as, you guessed it, Thor. Now from the trailers, it seemed to me that this was going to be yet another wannabe superhero flick with kick ass special effects and fight scenes, lacking any depth, and starring a talentless six-pack. Well I was wrong. 'Thor' is probably Marvel's best film, and I'd even go as far as saying that it is the third best superhero film of all time (right behind Christopher Nolan's masterpieces).The plot is as follows... Thor, the bloodthirsty warrior and heir, is banished from the eternal kingdom of Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), after disobeying his command, to a distant realm... called Earth! Now he needs to get back, but his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who was previously living in Thor's shadow, is proclaimed temporary king after his father collapses on a staircase, or something, and he doesn't want to let his cool brother back home, so Thor has to stay on Earth, with all the puny beings. He then falls in love with Jane (Natalie Portman), who is somewhat of a scientist, and changes his mind from 'kill everybody who threatens my well-being' to 'now wait a second, let's reason a bit here'.The movie's directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of masterpieces such as 'Henry V', in which his also starred in, and received two Oscar nominations for both directing and acting. He may also be known to some as the goof-ball professor Gilderoy Lockhart from 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Here, he takes a break from acting, or producing, or writing, and just directs this masterpiece. Hollywood is really heading in the right direction with hiring artsy directors to direct explosion-explosion films. Another great example would be the upcoming 'Captain America: The First Avenger', directed by Joe Johnston, who brought us the very good coming-of-age story, 'October Sky'. I hope 'Captain America' is gonna be as good as 'Thor'. A part inside me somehow doesn't want it to be better, I don't why though.Alongside Hemsworth, star Jane's friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy... something (Kat Dennings); Thor's friends Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and Fandral (Josh Dallas/Cary Elwes-lookalike); and the nosy SHIELD agent, Coulson (Clark Gregg). The ensemble cast all give great performances, which aren't meant for you to remember, aside from Ray Stevenson, who is always awesome.The movie references a few other superhero films/comics, which is quite appropriate given the fact that 'The Avengers' movie is getting closer and closer. We can also see Jeremy Renner in a cameo probably as Hawkeye, he's also gonna play Hawkeye in 'The Avengers'. And, I didn't stay in the theater until the credits were over, but IMDb tells me that Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo after the credits as Nick Fury. - How exciting! I'm thinking of seeing it again just for that.'Thor' is the second superhero film out this year so far. The previous one was 'The Green Hornet', which was just a horrible attempt at mixing comedy with action. 'The Green Hornet' was however the first 3-D superhero flick. 'Thor' is in 3-D too, but I'd rather go with 2-D on this one, since there are too many shiny lights in the Asgard scenes, which would make my brain explode with 3-D glasses on.There are five superhero films in 2011, three of them are still unreleased. They are: the crappy '...Green Hornet'; the amazing 'Thor'; the comes-out-on-my-birthday 'X-Men: First Class'; the gonna-be-awesome 'Green Lantern; and my most anticipated film of the year, 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I sincerely hope that they are all on the level of 'Thor'. I don't like repeating myself here, but something inside me forbids me from wanting the other films be better than 'Thor'. Maybe I'm crazy, I don't know.'Thor's special effects are spectacular, and deserving a Best Visual Effects Oscar nomination. From the epic battle scenes between the almighty gods, to the amazing scenes in Asgard, 'Thor's special effects are probably the greatest ones I've seen since 'Avatar', yeah! Plus, 'Avatar' kinda sucked from the story perspective, and 'Thor' is good on every level, so 'Thor' > 'Avatar', that's probably gonna set a certain individual off, I hope.Anyway... Under Branagh's gentle direction, 'Thor' is by far one of the best films of 2011, and right behind Nolan's Batmans as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, featuring a star-making turn by Chris Hemsworth - a Hollywood newcomer with a six-pack, and brains!Rating: ★★★★Comment on review here and sign up on my site: http://carlkevad.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6882606-the-god-of-thunder-",6,8,15,29 April 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced.
","Let me start off by just saying that 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is much more better than its predecessor.I'm not what you'd exactly call a fan of the Michael Bay-directed Transformers film series. I didn't particularly like the first film with it's excess of cheese and CGI. I hated 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,' which was even with it's action sequences less interesting than watching paint dry in a dark room. It was muddled, and after 30 minutes of watching the movie, I started to begin to have chronic headaches. Luckily though, Michael Bay has picked up the pieces, and directed the awesome 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon.'I'm not gonna bother writing a detailed plot description, since it doesn't really matter a lot, but the film is practically the following Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has to once again save the world from total destruction. He once again needs to help his Autobot friends. He once again has the hot girlfriend, this time a new one, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, who's replaced Megan Fox. She is what Megan Fox was, hot and not getting too much dialog. She's effective at what she is supposed to do.Thankfully, there's less and more humorous humor here. Coen-favorites John Turturro and Frances McDormand star alongside John Malkovich to provide us with subtle humor. Turturro's character, the retired agent Seymour Simmons, who tried to laugh us in the previous films, actually succeeds here. From it's cast to the amazing special effects put to display here, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a carefully made action picture. It succeeds as one on every level.That said, there are still mistakes in 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon.' The plot is too complicated for the adolescent 12-year-olds it's mainly made for, and it drags quite a lot in act two, but 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' was the fastest two and a half hours I've ever experienced. I mean that in the best possible way.There's a huge cast in 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon.' Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Hugo Weaving, Kevin Dunn, Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and even Patrick Dempsey as Whiteley's boss.Bay is known for directing bad movies with great action sequences. He doesn't create a good movie here, but he creates a movie that's action sequences are so good, that we don't really care about anything else. He's obviously done a lot of work here. Remember all you haters, Michael Bay doesn't write the dialogs of his movies. Ehren Kruger does that in 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon,' and I give Bay extra credit of making the action so good that we forget about Kruger's horrible dialog writing.Apart from the action sequences, the 3D is amazing here. It's as good as I've seen in a long while. In fact, I believe that the only movies with good 3D I've ever seen are 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Tron: Legacy.' I didn't see 'Avatar' in 3D. The second act dragged a bit, but the engrossing act one and the frantic act three with the epic destruction of Chicago in amazing 3D, more than make up for act two's mistakes.He said it himself, Michael Bay wants to 'entertain the summer audience'. He will with 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon,' which is the best film I've ever seen that he directed. This isn't a great movie, but it's wildly entertaining. It's got the explosions, it's got the frantic action, it's got the Victoria's Secret model, it's got robots beating the **** out of other robots, and it's got the amazing third act of total destruction. What more could you ask from a summer action flick?Rating: ★★★ (7/10)",7,1,5,29 June 2011
