Resident Evil: Afterlife," This movie was like watching a train wreck
","Before I begin I'd like to preface this review with some background on my taste in movies. It isn't sophisticated, it isn't special, it's actually pretty average. I enjoy action films just as much as the next guy. Sit me down in front of a mediocre action film like Wanted, Ninja Assassin, Death Race, or Crank 2 and I'll enjoy killing a couple of hours without a single complaint. Do they have flaws? Sure. Do they have occasional stereotypes? Of course. Are the stories that great? Of course not. But that's all beside the point, the movies are all meant to be enjoyed for the carnage that people enjoy in any action film.Having said that, I'd like to talk about Resident Evil: Afterlife. This movie absorbs every bad stereotype from every bad action movie ever and mashes it all together into one. Scenes that make no sense (a totally normal human being walking away from a plane crashing into a mountain at hundreds of miles an hour), fighting that blatantly rips off other movies (the opening fight scene looked like a recreation of the lobby fight in The Matrix), and insanely stupid transitions between scenes (Claire magically has showered, put on makeup, and found clothing before they get in the plane?).There is so much wrong with this movie I cant even fully explain it words. Please don't go see this movie. And if you enjoyed it, I truly truly pity you.",1,19,36,11 September 2010
