Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't be fooled, there's nothing brilliant here
","Although I wasn't originally inclined to see this movie, I was convinced by all the reviews hailing it as a comedic masterpiece of political satire. 'Challenges political correctness and sensitivity' and 'exposes the dark underbelly of American society' were common phrases.None of that is true.'Borat' turned out to be little more than cheap toilet humor. Entertaining at times, but growing old quickly. There's nothing groundbreaking here.You don't 'challenge' political correctness by making fun of rednecks and Christians. Southerners, republicans, and Christianity have always been perfectly acceptable targets. The only thing in this movie that might offend the tolerance police is the scene depicting Kazakhstan. Borat's phony racism and misogyny are obviously just tools used to get reactions from his victims.One could travel across any region as big as the United States and find loads of ignorant morons, especially when you get to cherry pick the worst. The world is full of idiots--soccer hooligans in England, rampaging neo-Nazis in Germany, extremists who think drawing a cartoon picture of Mohammed warrants the death penalty. This doesn't say anything about America.There were plenty of laughs, but there's no deeper meaning to this movie. It doesn't make a statement on American society, or if it does, its not a valid one.",Null,408,816,16 November 2006
