Catch Me If You Can," Stunning film worth a 2nd visit
","Very well made and well constructed film with great lead performances by LDiCaprio, THanks and CWalken which don't steal the show. Although they occupy most of the screen time (there are about 6 films within the overall story) the supporting cameo performances by MSheen, AAdams, JGarner are very strong and so well done. Great analysis of the american dream, how to break it and ultimately, make it stronger.",10,1,2,26 December 2019
Law Abiding Citizen," Great moral tale with biblical moments
","I liked the set up from frame one at the very beginning (albeit brutal but necessary) and the main question - 'What would you do / how would you feel, if it happened to you?' It's quite easy to feel sympathetic for the LAC as his life decend's into murderous chaos. There is some key dialogue exchanges which highlight the moral dilemma beautifully. Possibly the best exchange is half way through the film, when Sarah asks Nick the big, hypothetical question 'Would you have made a different decision based on what you know now?'. His lack of audible answer speaks volumes.",8,0,0,29 December 2019
