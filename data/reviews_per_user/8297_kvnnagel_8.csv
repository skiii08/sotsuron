Ford v Ferrari," If there's a Heaven
","It's certainly filled with some of the fastest in Motorsports. RIP Ken Miles, Dale Earnhardt, Gilles Villeneuve, Dan Weldon, Ayrton Senna, Greg Moore and the Great Caroll Shelby...This was a Great Movie.. and if you're a fan of Racing.. it's Perfect",10,1,1,13 February 2020
It," Good Enough.. For Now
","Now that I've watched the deleted scenes I think a Directors Cut would add quite a bit to the overall fear in this flick. I'm sure that making this movie main stream took away lots from not only the book but the final cut. Still liked it, but I'm glad I waited for it to come out on The Movie Network and didn't Pay $20 for a slightly higher than Average Horror movie.",6,0,2,9 July 2018
The Impossible," Fantastic movie about survival.
",Watching this and being a student of 'Situational Awareness' all I have to suggest it ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN... IN ANY SITUATION and THINK COMMON SENSE.. especially in foreign counties. Separating Family members in a Disaster was silly. Leaving an 8 and 6 year old to go look for your wife was a terrible decision. Walking wounded do not make good search parties. Thailand did a real good job under dire circumstances. But very few of the success stories happened at the disaster zone. Medical facilities become where the Impossible does happen... for some.,9,1,2,18 January 2020
Suicide Squad," Not giving up on this being a good franchise
",Joker and Harley's back story and injection of Joker throughout the movie just muddled the storyline.. backstory.. character.. backstory.. character.. plotline was all over the place ... the joker should have made one appearance.. the last scene. Viola Davis reminds me of Lynne Thigpen from 'Where in the World is Carmen San Diego' it needed a bad ass General cast..,4,1,1,9 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," And...
","Just judging by all the terrible reviews it's hard to understand why people who don't truly understand this particular style or genre even
Bother with a Review... I thought it was almost perfect, inglorious Bastard styled cinematic genius. The Academy understands .. most of the User Reviewers DONT.",10,10,12,16 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A happy ending... not what I expected
",What a fantastic movie... I absolutely loved it. You already know most of the story from history ... the best part was listening to Damian Lewis's monologue on Sharon Tate- Roman Polanski and Jay Sebring. Playing as Steve McQueen .. which was so spot on it was making me belt out in laughter. Perfect McQueen. Loved the new ending Leo and Brad are perfect together.Instantly made top 3 best Q.T. All time. But it's hard to knock Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fictiin from the top of the podium.,10,13,18,16 January 2020
Joker," Question your own sanity
","First off, I absolutely think this was a cinematic masterpiece. And ties together the Batman universe with its deadliest foe. But the backstory on Joker was so relevant to the storyline. An ENTIRE movie where you question what he's seeing is real or in his head was almost impossible to pull off.. Fantastic... I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.. then I loved it. Phoenix .. you deserved the Oscar.. very few could have pulled that performance off with such detail.",9,2,3,11 February 2020
Midway," Barely touched on Facts...
","You can't tell the midway story in the last 50 minutes of a movie. There are too many story lines, many failures on the Japanese side. A whole afternoon of evasive manoeuvres by the Japanese fleet. A very very watered down account of the total desist ruction of 4 Japanese Carriers and the sinking of the Yorktown and most of its crew. I think this needed less backstory and less of the Doolittle Raid ... and more of the real facts.. pinpointing one pilot is actually impossible.",5,2,4,22 February 2020
