Hereditary," Is there an opposite of Oscar I can award?
","This film was so incredibly bad it bordered on being funny. When the film ended I looked around the cinema to gage other people's reactions. Pretty much everyone looked bemused. There Is not a single positive thing I can say about it and I am genuinely flabbergasted that it has had positive reviews. The acting was so wooden and over the top that at times, I thought I was watching a comedy.Terrible film which at best should have gone straight to DVD. This is a couple of hours which me and my partner will never get back.",Null,1,3,5 July 2018
