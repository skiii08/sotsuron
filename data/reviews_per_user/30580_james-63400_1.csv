Blade Runner 2049," worst three hours of my life
","I've never wrote a review or rated a movie... This movie was so bad that it made me make an account on IMDb just so i can rate this awful stupid long movie. Not only did i waste my money, but also three hours of my life. Don't watch it, don't waste your money and more importantly, your time.",1,17,37,12 October 2017
