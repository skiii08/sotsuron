The Sound of Music," The dumbest movie ever.
","This is the most unbelievable, and stupid movie I've ever seen. A family of singers runs from the Nazi's, and every few minutes they stop to sing about their 'Favorite things' or how 'the hills are alive with the sound of music.' If I were running from the Nazi's, I wouldn't stop to sing every two seconds about the stupid hills! If this is based on a true story, then I'm the Queen of England.
Score: Not even 0, it doesn't deserve that many points. It owes us points, that's how bad it is.",Null,13,36,23 July 2003
