The Blair Witch Project," A scary experience !
","This movie, or documentary, it's a scary experience. Since The Shining and The Exorcist I hadn't seen it a so scary film ! Many people that watch it provably didn't like that ending at all, where we can't see what was haunting the three filmmakers. If it was really the witch or provably some crazy person. But, if you're one of them, try to understand that, that's the scariest thing on the film ! What we fear most than what we can't see ? I give four full stars to this film.Ironic observation : Even after dead, Heather had The Blair Witch Project released.",Null,0,1,8 July 2000
Carrie," One of the best Stephen King's adaptations to the movies !
","Stephen King is one of the best authors ever ! Carrie is my favorite book. And it's even better on screen, with Sissy Spacek playing the role of Carrie, the rejected young high school girl that discovers she has a terrifying power. The power of move things with her mind.The prom sequence, when Carrie use her powers to revenge from everyone it's fantastic ! I totally recommend ! Five full stars !",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
