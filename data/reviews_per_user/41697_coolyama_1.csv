Mission: Impossible III," Best sequel ever
",I loved this movie right from the beginning to end. First I was really skeptical about this movie being the third in the series and wasn't sure as to what I can expect. I would say this movie is like the 'Bourne Identity' or the American version of 'James Bond'. I am big fan of spy movies and I have enjoyed this whole movie and times it was gripping. The movie starts with Tom Cruise being tormented about revealing the truth about the where abouts of a 'Rabbit Foot' as opposed to getting his girl friend killed. The beginning is explosive and the location shots were excellent...I really enjoyed the chopper scene and It has been a while since I have seen such adrenalin rush.,8,47,96,3 May 2006
