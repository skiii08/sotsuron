Blade Runner 2049," Such a disappointment...
","Not entirely sure what the plan for this movie was - but the result is a garbled, weak-minded, tedious film that just kept going on forever...Scenes were stretched out creating long pauses which though trying to instigate 'theme' just had be constantly yawning.Was so much looking forward to this which made this that much more upsetting.If you have a spare 3 days, give it a look, but beware, you'll need a constant supply of coffee to see it through to the end.",2,2,3,21 January 2018
Aquaman," Oh my, what have they done... again
","It looks as though DCEU just won't learn from their mistakes. Like Batman vs Superman, the movie fails to grip the viewer in almost any way.Characters are not developed and an over reliance on CGI makes one feel detached from the film and OMG - the backing sound, in a word is awful! I defy anyone to like the 'electronic tune' that accompanies some key scenes.I think the DCEU powers have to sit down and watch ALL the Marvel films of late, so as to see how they are a very distant 2nd to any of them.",3,5,15,21 December 2018
Concussion," Good, but...
","As Ridley Scott put it to Will Smith...'this role is a gift'. Great original story which i can only feel wasn't directed to fulfil its potential. Will was great in his depiction, but significant characters, like the one portrayed by Alec Baldwin are just not explored to any degree to provide depth. The same can be said for most the movies key folk.Perhaps if Ridley had the directing role it could have lifted the film. Though the conclusions drawn are fairly obvious, the movie is still tells a story which should be told, and I am happy to have seen it.",8,1,2,7 January 2018
Molly's Game," difficult to want to watch, but...
","Been meaning to watch this for months, so today, I thought why not..What a pleasant surprise. Its well paced, very well acted and though I didn't know at the time, script was near perfect, and then I found out it was Aaron Sorkin, so figures.I will not go into too much detail, as I feel one should watch it avoiding all trailers - but I have to say, its based very closely on a true story, and I spent over 2 hours researching everything after the movie.Always a good sign.",9,4,7,14 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rian 'WHO' Johnson
","To take on a movie dynasty like Star Wars was always a daunting task... and when Disney got involved, I thought 'I've got a bad feeling about this'.... luckily with JJ on the case, The Force Awakens was very good, and more importantly, very true to the nature of the saga.Then, for reasons i will never understand Rian Johnson gets the gig... I mean I loved Breaking Bad and The Fly episode was very memorable cos it was so quirky. Then Looper - an ok movie, made ok.. How on earth does this guy then get this gig ?!?!?Relatively unknown and told he can re-write almost the entire script... what do we then get - a very long movie, trying to tell lots of stories (almost all not to a decent standard), a major lack of character development and then well, you get an ok movie which is almost entirely received as meh !Lets hope IX can make amends, please.",6,1,2,23 December 2017
Hotel Mumbai," wow and woah....
","Simply a difficult watch but definitely worth it.Without knowing the detail, I was expecting a fairly heavy movie, but is actually wasn't. The movie was at a good pace with a good level of detail too.The time just slipped by. I found a couple of moments where it was difficult to watch, but this was due to being totally immersed into the movie.My only negative point, and it is minor, is that I would have liked to have seen even more of the bravery of staff, like the make-shift bullet proof vests and the staff running back in, to help others.But, that aside, this is a must see film.Love to all the heroes in India at that time!",9,6,20,4 October 2019
Joker," difficult to watch at times, but a must see!
","I shall keep this brief... as a suffer of a mental illness, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch, but the acting and direction of the movie were of such high quality, it must be seen.This will be considered a modern great, and the depiction of The Joker will have shrinks coming out of every orifice.Go see it before you hear too much!",9,1,1,9 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," what can i say...
","Having just re-watched this last night for the 3rd time, I remembered the entire movie within 2 mins, but as always, I was totally gripped.Timeless classic, forever one of the best movies of all time.",10,0,0,23 March 2020
Black Panther," Is the Hype worth it...
","Well, I have to say, I love the MCU and a big fan of all the new movies, but when i heard they were going to make Black Panther, I thought to myself, maybe its a step too far.I just can't get enthused to watch it... I usually do not watch any trailers for movies i know i will watch, but having seen about 20 seconds, and with all the hype and constant adverts, i decided i'll give it a gp... Well, OH YES !Never have i been so wrong about a movie. Maybe because i was not expecting much (but I don't think so) the movie was very impressive. I will not go into any level of detail here, so as to avoid spoiling any of your pleasure, but in a time when few films are worth the ticket price, this is definitely worth it.Its not perfect, hence my rating, as some bits feel tagged on, especially near the end, and the running time is a bit too long for my liking, but if you are in the mood for an Iron Man 3 type movie with a strong storyline, plenty of action and a good social aspect, this is a must.Enjoy !",8,1,4,21 February 2018
Annihilation," What....?
","I consider myself to have above average IQ, and have watched movies of varied genres... but all i can say to this is...what ? The movie, though slow, goes at a pace that just keeps you interested, then about half hour from the end... it begins to get more and more weird... I don't mind open endings like Inception, but this just didn't make any sense,",3,1,2,23 March 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Urm.... Wow !!!
","I am a massive movie buff, and as such watch most movies within a month of release...however, I am not a fan of Andrew Garfield and coupled with a war movie where the main protagonist is anti-war, I struggled to get around to this film.But, as my rating suggests, wow. I, as is my way, will not say too much about the plot, but suffice to say, though it is a bit of a slow burner, by the end i felt exhausted and in floods of tears.I am sure there were many heroic deeds done at the time, but to see what this young man did was amazing.If you are in a mood for a grown-up movie, and can handle the graphic nature of war (very well depicted here), then you need to look no further than this very moving movie.",9,1,1,29 December 2017
The Great Gatsby," Just don't get the hype...
","Great cast, huge budget, but such a let down.The movie felt like small snippets stuck together, and as such was very difficult to get into. I have to admit, I almost dreaded sitting down to watch this, as the reviews were so mixed, but with Leo and Toby, it had to be seen.Not quite sure what Baz was after but the gloss (which I love esp in Meet Joe Black) was so over the top that everything looked as though it had been artificially touched up - adding to the feel of distance to the characters.I would say, watch with caution.",4,0,1,29 December 2017
