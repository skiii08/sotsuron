Ali," You either love or hate this film
","Now I had huge expectations for this film because I've always been interested in seeing how Ali would be portrayed by hollywood. And after watching this film, I think it was done pretty well...it showed the good and the bad sides of Ali and what his life was like. I would have liked it better if a smaller actor played Ali instead of Will Smith as this film should have focused more on the life of Ali instead of being fueled by the fact that Will Smith was Ali. You either love or hate this film and the people I watched it with hated it..I still recommend you check it out as it was well done",8,0,0,28 December 2001
Memento," Best film I've seen in a long time
","I haven't heard a lot about memento till my friend told me about it, and after hearing bits and pieces about the general story, I was totally psyched to watch it. I had heard good things, but I never expected to be blown away, this immediately jumps in to my top 10 favorite films of all time because it was so cleverly written and shot. The way the film works is so detailed that it makes the watcher remember almost everything. As my friend says, he always judges how good a film is by how much people talk about it after it ends, and we stood around for easily 30 mins just talking about the movie. I give the highest praise to this movie and I would suggest everyone who likes movies to watch it.",10,0,1,20 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very well done, a tribute to the novel
","When I first heard rumors that they were going to make a film about the lord of the rings novels, I had my doubts as I have found that the majority of films that have been made based on novels have never lived up to the book without seriously being adapted. As the release day came closer, I began to re-think my perspective on these sort of films, so when I watched the lord of the rings the other day, I must say that it was incredibly done!! It melded live actors and computer effects seamlessly and didn't try to overwhelm you with special effects even though you knew they were there. I STRONGLY recommend this film to anyone who enjoys fantasy or adventure films...this was such an enjoyable experience, from start to cliff hanger ending.",10,0,0,28 December 2001
