Mission: Impossible III," Lots of explosions no substance
","If your idea of an action movie is limited character development, not much dialog a weak storyline BUT with lots of fancy stunts and things exploding. Then MI-III is the film for you.However if you like even a minimal amount of intelligent dialog, character development a more detailed plot and reason for these characters to be engaged in this high octane behavior then MI-III fails dismally.There was the weak, extended and boring party scene early on that only served to highlight Ethan (Tom Cruise) loves his wife to be so very much and he can read lips. Plus everyone smiles a lot and all go to the same great dentist.Oh yeah Ethan loves his wife to be so much that an out of the blue mission to save a former female infatuation of his results in Ethan accepting the mission almost immediately.Such love but I guess that childish paternalism with a former employee is greater than your new life with the most important person in your life right? Oh well I guess the film would have stopped there had he refused the assignment, so off we go on a wild goose chase for some 'holy grail', 'preperation H', 'rabbits foot', 'mojo' 'x' who cares? who knows? nobody it's just an excuse to break into places and blow things up.I saw it on the big screen and can only imagine how boring and shallow such a production would look watching on small screen.The overall impression I had was a shallow story, nothing to drag you in and keep you hooked. Zero suspense nothing had me on the edge of my seat not even once. Cardboard cutout characters would have more life than the ones developed in MI-III.Unless you really like things exploding and watching Tom run, you'd probably get more enjoyment burning your money.",1,29,51,7 June 2006
Finding Neverland," Flat stale unimpressive.
","OMG how can this film have a rating of 8.3 on IMDb (boggle) This movie is atrocious, it offers nothing new. It gives us the same rehashed climax given in The Polar Express 'Believe'. (At least the polar express was more genuine.) EVERYTHING in this movie and how the characters interact was clich√©d, struggling mum, father who passed away due to sickness, child having difficulty coming to terms with dads death. Mum in the process of dying herself but being very stoic about it all. Overbearing grandmother, who is like an evil witch but is redeemed in the end, she does have a heart after all.Enter a writer who has yet to find his true meaning interacts with the above family and presto 'genius' play script results. He sorts out the whole familys problems, everyone is told in the power of 'Belief' and we all live happily ever after.The scene with the children in the theatre who laugh was so contrived so fake that it made me cringe.This is one of the worst films I have seen in quite a while. The performances are good but hardly inspiring, I shake my head at the 8.3 rating.2/10",3,15,31,2 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," Hit and Miss
","This is a reasonable film which does make you laugh, it's main fault is the over reliance on the focker jokes, which quickly become repetitive and stale. The child actor part of the story as well as the dog and cat element I found TOTALLY unnecessary.Strong points are the interplay between the two families with a different sets of value priority. On the one had the fockers are open, like to hug and kiss, talk about sexuality, are proud of their child irrespective of material success. The other family the Byrnes are very uptight, reserved and dominated by a type Alpha male.This is where Streisand, Hoffman and in particular De Niro shine. The issue of trust in relationships is nicely done if somewhat glossed over, I guess for comedy purposes.7/10",7,1,5,27 December 2004
The Good Shepherd," Just found the film slow and boring
","This film was far too slow paced with not enough happening to draw the viewers interest in.The lack of any elements that make you identify with individual characters is so sad, this film could have been so much more.There could have been a deeper emotional attachment by FOCUSING the people involved more intimately instead you have a far flung mish mash of events and characters and nothing really drawing you in to their world and their reason for being the people they are.You know whats sad is that when the female Russian asset gets thrown out of the plan you are jolted that something important has happened to impact a persons life, but almost immediately you get pushed into more of the films drudgery and non eventfullness.I found this one of the greatest cinematic bores of all time. I would like to see a remake with some PASSION in it! As opposed to the mindless drones inhabiting this lifeless feature.I can't remember Matt Damons character getting really angry or wildly happy just the same sombre stoic zombie state that flowed on to the whole movie. As I said slow and boring.",Null,3,6,10 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," A very boring film.
","I started watching this film with high expectations, with a great cast playing a war drama.Instead the audience is subjected to a disjoint, pointless and utterly unconvincing miss mash of imagery, dialog and characters.This is one film that I got close to walking out of I stayed because I generally like war movies and I remember continuously looking at my watch thinking how much longer before this film is over or develops some sort of point.In summary my experience was that this is a bad film, it's boring pointless and will take three hours from your life that you will never get back. Avoid it at all costs.3/10",3,26,47,30 December 2004
