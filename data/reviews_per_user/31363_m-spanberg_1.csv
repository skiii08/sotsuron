Requiem for a Dream," Mind numbing!
","It seems that most people either hate or love this movie. I do both.Yes, it did make me feel numb for the past hours and it IS a powerful movie the first time you watch it.For me, the true power of this movie lies in the shock value. What I mean by that is that they throw so many awful things in your face time over and over again and it just gets worse and worse and worse. Your brain gets kind of 'uhm...oh...wow'. It didn't make me think. It made my brain numb.If you really look deep in to it though, you'll not find much other than the message that 'Drugs are bad, just look how awful these people's lives has turned out!'. There's not much more to it. The characters don't really have any deep struggles (other than drugs of course), at least not that we see. They are pretty one dimensional.In the end, I didn't really feel sympathy for them per se, because they didn't really tell me anything other than 'wow...oh...this is just awful' and they where just so incredibly pathetic, the whole lot.On one hand, I hate this movie for making my brain numb and removing my thinking, and by that ignoring that this movie ISN'T that deep. It'll make you it is, but really isn't.Once again, it's the shock value. This is really thanks to the whole feeling of the movie and the way it's filmed and the lovely soundtrack it has! It's really powerful, but there is not much behind it.The acting is good.I give this movie a 5 out of 10, just because it's so impressive how the movie affected me.",5,19,32,29 January 2011
