Antz," Great adult fun
","I don't know if this is a movie for kids, but it rocks for adults. I have rarely seen so many good punchlines and one-liners in a movie. The voices are fantastic - you can really connect them to the actors behind them.*MILD SPOILER PERHAPS* Again, the one-liners. After a revolution in the ant-colony you can hear an ant worker quoting Marx: 'It's the workers who control the means of production' and similar things. I can't remember last time I laughed so much in a movie as in Antz.At least 9/10",9,0,0,15 December 2001
Memento," Not as good as the first impression
","To say that I was amazed the first time I saw Memento would be a grave understatement. The ending was so spectacular that I thought that this was the best movie I've ever seen. I called all my friends and told them of this wonder. This euphoria lasted for two days or so. Then i got some perspective on things.Memento is technically very good. It has a very slick execution and you believe the story. Still, it is just pure entertainment. It doesn't have any deeper meaning.Very well executed and intelligent film. Very fun. Very good. Witty. Not the best movie of all times. 9/10",9,0,1,14 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good movie? Yes! Bet movie? No!
","I almost choked when I saw that The Fellowship of the Ring was ranked #1 on the top movies list. Come on people! That is just absurd. This was a good movie, but nothing amazing. I believe that too many voters think something like this:1) The movie is a very good adaptation of Tolkiens work.2) The Tolkien books are the best books ever written.1,2=> The movie is excellent.I don't like Tolkien, but even if I did, I have to say that there is more to be required of the #1 film then to be a good adaption of a good book. It also reflects that the IMDB voting system should be reviewed.Rating 7/10",2,1,2,4 January 2002
No Man's Land," Not bad
","No man's land is a very good black allegory about the bosnian war. It sometimes too simple and trivializing, but pretty good on the whole.Good directing and good cast. Kusturicas Underground is still much better.The cast was good and the directing too (although very hollywood - clever cuts and so on).",Null,0,2,4 March 2002
Braveheart," Horrible Directing
",The cast is good. The story is good too. The directing is one of the worst I have seen. This movie would be 30 min long if the director skipped all the poorly timed slow-motion sequences. Remove those and you have a pretty decent flick!,Null,0,2,6 January 2002
