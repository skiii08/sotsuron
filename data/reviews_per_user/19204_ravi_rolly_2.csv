Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A Masterpiece..!
","When we go to a theater to watch a movie, there is one desire that always crawls our hearts. The desire that the movie comes out to be entertaining. But this one, I assure, will raise that desire to new heights for the movies yet to release in your lifetime. It is not an 'entertaining' movie. It is a creation of a Masterpiece. I have not read the Sherlock Holmes books. So may be, many would disagree with me on the thought that no movie could have justified the character of Holmes better. But my friends, I have seen more than a couple of thousands of them. And that perhaps grants me the ability to praise one when I feel like. I will give the movie 9.9. 0.1 deducted, because the word 'Perfect' is not heard in this world. Call it fate, I could not watch the movie when it came to theaters. I got the chance just a couple of hours ago. And I am glad that I got this pleasure on a day which had not been very good for me. Hats off to Robert Downey Jr. for a performance even he himself will not be able to forget in his life. And special gratitude to Guy Ritchie for crafting the Masterpiece out of a great character. Looking forward to July, when my love, Christopher Nolan, would present me another masterpiece as 'The Dark Knight Rises'.",10,2,6,16 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Can any fiction be better than Harry Potter?
","Harry Potter is back. And is back with a bang. The days are done when we used to watch movies for its storyline and action kind of crap. Its more about the feel of it now. WB takes us to another mind wobbling journey of Howards School. (though this time the story plays more outside). Harry Potter has grown tall. Harmaine is fantastic. Ron is awesome. Well you always expect a HP movie to be awesome. But let me tell you ,this one is mind blasting. The addition of 3D to harry potter is a 'go wow' thing! The movie is just perfect. The only minus factor being you can't resist yourself to wait for the part2. Go Watch it if u have not seen yet..... AND GO WOW!!!!",6,2,4,3 December 2010
