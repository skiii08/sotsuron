Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not quite up to scratch, but doesn't deserve the criticism
","Ok. Fine. This film is not quite as epic or brilliant as (two of) the three films it predates, but it is still not bad as a forerunner for what will hopefully be two excellent follow-ups. George Lucas has clearly displayed the fact that he is far better suited to directing animation over real people, but the specials effects are brilliant and Lucas' vivid imagination shines through in the dazzling array of creatures, ships and devices throughout the film. There are two problems I had with this film. Jar Jar Binks, and Darth Maul. Jar Jar was an unnecessary attempt to appeal to the younger generation, who would have loved the film without him, he brings an element of immaturity to the film. Its very hard for a film to be epic when you have a stupid, unfunny character distracting you from more important things. And secondly, Darth Maul doesn't say anything cool. When Obi-Wan fought Darth Vader in the original, the battle was replete with memorable lines left, right and centre. Darth Maul never even spoke to Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan, and the battle, while spectacular, left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.But these two complaints aside, this was still more than satisfactory entertainment and a good start to a new trilogy.",6,0,1,6 April 2000
Citizen Kane," Not quite the greatest ever, but pretty darn close.
","Seeing Citizen Kane for the first time, my expectations were difficult to define. On one hand I was seeing a film lauded by many as the greatest ever, while my natural cynicism told me I was destined to be disappointed. I wasn't. Mind you, I don't think this IS the greatest film in history, but it is an outstanding character study of one man's bid to find happiness. As a wealthy tycoon, Kane had it all, yet died alone and unhappy in a decrepit, abandoned Xanadu. The final word to pass his lips spoke of his dear wish to return to the one time he was truly happy: as a child before he was introduced to his life as a wealthy man. There are many facets of this film which make it great: Welles' direction is superb even by modern standards (which is spectacular in 1941), his brooding plot which slowly draws out more of this fascinating character also envelopes the viewer. The controversy caused by the obvious fact that the film was based on (the very real) Randlof Hurst also increases its allure (as only controversy can). But all things aside, even though there are so many great aspects to this film, it just would not have come together were it not for the brilliant performance of Welles in the title role. He brings such a stunning array of emotions to one man that his inner conflict and struggle are painfully obvious (yet gloriously understated) to any who watch.It may not be the greatest film of all time, it certainly isn't the greatest story, but the character of Kane makes it ONE of the best ever.",9,0,2,4 September 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," One of the snappiest, wittiest comedies of the nineties
","The comparisons to Pulp Fiction as numerous stories gradually intertwine, with hilarious consequences, are inevitable in this, one of the best films to come out of England in the past decade, perhaps ever. This film is a refreshing departure from the generic Hollywood style and the cockney London slang and accents are an absolute delight. With the four lead crooks extremely likeable, this film is a winner.",10,1,1,3 May 1999
