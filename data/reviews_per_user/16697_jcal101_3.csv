Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely and Utterly a Steaming Load of Crap
","Ever wonder why Paris Hilton is famous? Has she ever done anything meaningful with her life? Is she brilliant and talented? Is she funny or principled? Is she even modestly attractive? The answer is of course, no, on all counts. But Hilton is famous because somewhere, at sometime, some idiot in a PR firm created the image of Paris Hilton, Hollywood skank and party girl. Like Hilton, Borat is an embarrassing monstrosity of a movie (the worst I've seen in MANY YEARS) that has gained in popularity not because it is good, has a message, or is even slightly funny, but simply because it caters to the lowest common denominator- idiot teenagers. I have never walked out on a movie before in my life, even after seeing some true garbage, but I finally did in Borat (with about 20 minutes to go in the movie). Anyone who finds this mindless, tasteless, low brow, stinking, festering, corrupt, and offensive drivel funny really needs to seek the aid of a professional psychologist. Now, to be fair there are about 15-20 minutes of MILDLY humorous bits in the movie. The rest of the movie is just scatological and homoerotic gibberish devoid of any real meaning or message. One reason I went to see this rubbish was its billing as a political satire Â– well, it's not in any way, shape or form. The political messages, where they exist at all, are obvious and clumsily handled (for example, the war of terror bit at the rodeo). The movie is totally devoid of social satire, mistaking mean spirited and deceptive pranks for insight into the human condition. The movie is often blatantly offensive, racist, and just plain stupid. Finally, though rated R, this film really needs an NC17 rating- the MPAA must have been asleep at the screening of the movie and any producers out there that have the NC17 label slapped on their movie should be able to point to this train wreck as a prime example of how their rating system is fundamentally flawed. Especially egregious are the close-up photographs of the genitals of an (apparently) under aged male (ha!, that's so funny!). Finally, I'd like to close with saying that Larry Charles and Sacha Cohen are talent less hacks and dolts. With any luck at all these two blathering idiots will sink into total oblivion never to be heard from again to the betterment of the world as a whole (and take their mindless fans with them).",1,38,75,4 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," In a word: Overrated
","If I had to describe Star Wars: The Force Awakens in a single word, it would be overrated. Or, perhaps, plagiarism. Or maybe nostalgia. All three apply pretty well.In the end, SWTFA borrows way too much from the original movie and cuts no new ground at all, including technically. This cannot be said of the original movies, where the first three minutes, consisting of a Star Destroyer chasing down Princess Leia's diplomatic shuttle, set the gold standard for science fiction movies for two decades and still is considered one of the most amazing openings in movie history. I have a lot to say about this movie, but my time is precious and I've decided to limit my critique to bullet points as wasting more time on SWTFA is not something I'm happy to do.* J.J. Abrams is VASTLY overrated as a director. Not as bad as M. Bay or that ilk, but really lacks vision and took no risks what-so-ever with this movie. One upside is that he is a marginally better story teller than Lucas is and does not sacrifice story telling for visuals as much as Lucas does.* Acting is largely wooden and stilted, even from the old veterans. Han is not the Han of old for instance. It is always a mistake to have too many old characters and settings appear in a spin off series such as this.* Way too much borrowed from the original A New Hope. New death star, new rebel alliance, new empire, yadda yadda yadda. Really, there are no new ideas at all in this movie and no risks are taken to advance the story or expand the universe.* Poor casting and poor use of the acting talent. The new Vader, Kylo Ren aka Adam Driver is about as intimidating as a kitten with a ball of yarn. He is supposed to be easily unhinged and loose control, but he comes off as silly. Every scene he was in reminded me of Severus Snape (from the Potter series) or Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (from Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves). Captain Phasma is hardly used at all. * Was there background music in this movie? I don't remember any and one of the great things about the originals was the incredible score by John Williams that set the scene transitions and really added dramatic emphasis. * Nothing really special in the special effects. None of the battles are all that spectacular or special. Many of the X-wings and tie-fighters seem to be physics free even in the atmosphere of a planet. * Poor pacing, especially in the middle of the movie. The most compelling story in the movie occurs when Rey is having flashbacks about the past and the Jedi. Expanding on this would have made a far far better movie. They should have also supplied some exposition or, better yet, actually shown the Battle of Jakku. Again, would have been much more compelling.* Splurged for 3D. Really not worth it. There was only one scene where 3D was impressive, and that was simply a stationary Star Destroyer. I'm glad Star Wars is seeing a rebirth, but this movie was a rough start. I'd say worse than the hated prequels. They did leave a direct lead in to the next movie and I hope that the mistakes made in The Force Awakens are examined and learned from to make better movies, but I doubt that will happen.",6,16,25,29 December 2015
300," Essentially a Greek-themed Kung-Fu movie totally lacking in meaning or depth
","'300' is one of those truly amazing films that can only be made by someone who has never seen a single second of war or combat themselves. Full of simplistic bombast, silly nationalistic speeches, and 1000 yards of black spandex jockstraps, '300' rates as one of the most juvenile movies releases in the past five years. Even if one can manage to suspend all knowledge of the real history of Greece and Persia (not to mention Greek geography, agriculture, weapons technology, and basic Spartan sociology), even if one knows nothing of Newtonian physics, and even if you can believe that the world is populated by freakish mutants, there is nothing to recommend this film. The soundtrack sucks (reminding me of watching Flash Gordon without the expected camp factor from watching Flash Gordon), the CG is bad (from a wolf that looks more like a wet cheetah to an amazingly poorly produced standing vertical leap made by the king on his way to the oracle (she is the only good thing in this movie- lets see more of her in the future)), the script is ludicrous (and made no better by the acting that, if called wooden, would be an insult to wooden actors the world over), and the costumes and fake facial hair are downright hilarious. The complete bastardization of the story of the battle of thermopylae, the 100s of anachronisms (I understand this is not a documentary but a work of art, well, maybe not art- fart sounds more like it), the lackluster cast, and the truly low grade writing all produce a film that ranks among the worst I've seen this year. Like most Kung-Fu movies, with heroes that fly through the air, villains that happily wait to take on the hero one-on-one despite numerical superiority, flesh wounds for heroes, mortal wounds for villains, and so on and so on, watching this movie REQUIRES the complete suspension of belief. Even then its tedious and too stylized to be any fun as a straight swords and sandals movie, more akin to Conan or Red Sonja than anything else. 2/10 stars- one for the oracle, one for pity.",2,2,5,25 May 2007
