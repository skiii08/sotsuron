Skyfall," An Austerity Bond
","Am not in the majority but ...Reasons I hated Skyfall:-Bardem is a laughable and contrived Bond villain.Sexism back, M's role as mother figure to the central protagonists was overplayed. The prostitute who was the main sex interest was disposed of via a brutal murder as easily as Bond obtained sexual access to her.M is head of MI5 but uses a torch in the dark making her getaway – This is a ludicrously lazy plot device.Craig looking pretty haggard and very miserable throughout. He seems to hate being Bond.The scene where villains that arrived in Scotland looked like footage from Assains Creed.The franchise seems to have lost it's nerve –this film was neither old school enough or brave enough to progress Bond as a more layered character, something Craig had done brilliantly in his previous two outings.",4,7,17,13 November 2012
