The New World," a deep artistic pleasure
","The New World reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4 Filing out of The New World, completely speechless and without notes, I could fathom only single adjectives to describe the experience. Looking at these listed words on my memo-pad now, they read 'Thunderous, True, Beautiful, Solemn, Forceful, Gripping, Honest, and Slow.' And for those who watch The New World with a calm countenance, an open mind and a ready cache of patience, Terrence Malick's long-awaited picture will have a similar effect. The film is a masterpiece thirty years in the making. His goal is plain enough: to affectively and honestly portray the love Pocahontas experienced in those first years that Europeans cut their first, fresh swath from the New World. But Malick goes far beyond a simplistic love story. I was at the screening for Casanova a few days earlier, where the film's objective was essentially the same: to portray the love between Casanova and Francesca in the days of Inquisition Venice. But where Casanova approaches love at a bubbly, comedic perspective, The New World throws itself into a headlong narration of love's sorrow. Every frame of The New World reflects this painful, aching emotion, utilizing the sounds and images of environment to incredible, innovative effect. The first shot of the film--an extended shot several minutes in length--finds the camera staring into a river. It's clear and pristine, carefree and surrounded by the blissful sounds of an unperturbed forest. Soon ripples begin forming, and we notice the quiet droplets of rain pit-pattering around us, causing the water to flow a little, bringing about a contented onslaught of lily pedals. The scene continues on, drawing us farther and farther into Malick's deafening reality with only the sounds and images of nature. He creates a calm within us with these images, a kind of serene canvas for him to later paint the vivid brush-strokes of human love later in the film. In this entire first act, little is even said. But these scenes rarely grow tiring. He finds rich beauty with every situation. His forest is lush and his settlements picturesquely Dickensian. Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Few filmmakers would have the cool audacity to create a film so primarily reliant on nothing being said. The first and most important of Pocahontas' (Q'Orianka Kilcher) romances is with the infamous John Smith (Colin Farrell). He's brought to the New World bound in a cage, punished for earlier mutiny. But because he's the only soldier of the expedition, Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) opts to let him free on a strict probation. Their first encounters with the Naturals, as they're called, go coolly enough, with curious interest from the Naturals and tense hesitation from the settlers. And even here Malick plays with flights of romantic whimsy. These scenes of first encounter are shot in windswept, overgrown grassy fields, with Pocahontas dancing and twirling about them with her brother, catching the spry interest of Smith.Soon the settlers hear of a great city of Naturals down the river, and Smith is sent to investigate. Things have been going badly for the settlers and Captain Newport has left back for London and a new store of food and supplies. Smith's expedition is cut short, however, when he runs into a narrow, maze-like complex of swamps and is ambushed by warrior Naturals. He's taken prisoner by the Naturals, but granted life because of Pocahontas' curious interest and her favoritism with Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg). This catalyzes our entrance into The New World's most prominent territory. The scenes of Smith's time with the Naturals are Malick's best. They're those first strokes of paint on his canvas and the seeds of that palpable, historical romance.But admittedly, even with The New World's supreme sense of confidence and slow-moving progression, it sometimes wanders into the realm of self-indulgence. It especially grows tiresome in the final act, when we're brought from Virginia to London, our beloved Smith left behind to be replaced by John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and his stonewall courting of Pocahontas. I'd even venture to say that Malick could have left 30 minutes of these segments on the editing room floor, re-attaching them later to the Extended Cut DVD release that's sure to come. But movie-going patience is the mantra of the Awards season, and so some bottom-dragging in films is what's to be expected.What was not to be expected, however, was Q'Orianka Kilcher, the debuting actress playing Pocahontas. Few words she says, but dialogue is not always what makes a forceful performance. Her body language and expressions are allowed to do the speaking for her. She's advantaged also by her strong, muscular features that often betray hints of divine femininity. Farrell also does well, particularly in his somber narration. He reads it as though he speaks the words to himself, whispering them almost, for only his imagination to hear. But his physicality is manipulated nicely as well, exuding bubbly chemistry for Kilcher. The two mix ideally. Their sorrow and love and deeply resonated emotions are echoed about with their strong performances and Malick's supreme direction. And although Christian Bale strides into picture in the latter parts of the film, our hearts lie with Smith and Pocahontas, and we find ourselves resentful of Rolfe's advances. But this is just Malick's narrative trickery. We find ourselves raggedly torn between these two equally honorable men, and put almost into the same position as Pocahontas. It's precisely the reason we go to the movies. We've let the director take his grip on us and lead us down the path into characters and identities of his own creation. And with Malick leading our way, and with characters as tastefully dimensional as these, movie-going becomes a deep artistic pleasure.",9,261,437,15 December 2005
Walk the Line," Walk the Line is everything Ray was not
","Walk the Line reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating: 3.5 out of 4Director: James Mangold Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon Screenplay: James Mangold, Gill Dennis (based off the Johnny Cash autobiographies) MPAA Classification: PG-13 (language, drug content)To be honest, I've never been a fan of Johnny Cash's music. I listened to it every now and then when flipping through the presets in my car, stopping to sing along to the few lyrics I knew, but I never gave the musician much thought. Until now. For me, Walk the Line is everything Ray was not. Ray was plagued by an uneven screenplay, but got enough sentimentality and acting points for people to look past its flaws, and managed to nab a Best Picture nomination. Walk the Line, however, is worth all the press it's likely to get. With acting work just as impressive as Ray's, music just as affecting, and a screenplay that hits all the right chords, Walk the Line is a fine, fair biopic for Mr. Cash. The film faces the threat of what music critics call 'same-songiness'. A volley of biopics have been released in the past year making it only a matter of time before American audiences call it quits for the genre. Making matters worse, the story arcs for Ray and Walk the Line are essentially the same. A small time musician with tragic childhood memories goes on to become an international sensation, but finds himself wrapped up with extra-marital women and illegal drugs. Yes, it sounds like a re-hash of Ray, but believe me, Walk the Line's storytelling works much, much smoother. Also, what Ray lacked was romance. Yeah, yeah, I know, there was that cute scene with the hummingbird; but that little tidbit will be soon forgotten when Reese Witherspoon hits the screen. Taking on the role of June Carter, Witherspoon takes a page from her role in Vanity Fair (and not Just Like Heaven), and completely inhabits her character. Her pairing with Joaquin Phoenix yields beautiful chemistry and makes their romance believably realistic, something I frankly didn't feel with Ray. There's sure to be some trepidation over the fact that Director James Mangold used Phoenix and Witherspoon's real voices for Cash and Carter's songs. Again, I'm not really an authority on Johnny Cash music, but from what I've heard, Phoenix and Carter nail it. And Cash enthusiast Roger Ebert, who was in the same screening room as me and heard the same songs, stated afterwards that he was incredibly impressed by their mimicry. To extend my comparison between Ray and Walk the Line, I found James Mangold's directing style for Cash's biopic to be very similar to the formula used by Taylor Hackford in Ray. Each put a strong visual emphasis on the musical scenes and neither busied themselves with distracting camera tricks or visual pizazz. There are beautiful shots to be found in both films, but this is no Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener) behind the camera. Instead, where each director plays his cards is with the screenplay. And this is where Walk the Line truly shows its colors.Biopics are difficult in that a coherent story must be told over a great span of chronology. Films often run into the problem of trying to fit too much into a two hour film, an issue Ray suffered from. For instance, when Ray starts his downward spiral with Heroin and begins poking himself with needles, there were often straight cuts to joyous scenes of his son being born, or him returning home to his wife from a tour. The story never let itself settle down with a mood and tell a coherent story. Instead, the film jumped around so much, it left audiences dazed and numb to the emotions on-screen. But Walk the Line avoids this problem with James Mangold and Gill Dennis' screenplay, which is based off of Cash's two autobiographies. The script gives Walk the Line a backbone for the story to follow, keeping a foundation for the sub-plots to wrap themselves around. This foundation is Cash's obsession with June Carter. His childhood story and even his music are motivated by this romance. She was the center of his life up until his death, and she's the center of this film. And with Witherspoon's performance as terrific as it is, the foundation is solid as rock.If the American public is still willing to pay money for a musician's biopic, then Walk the Line's their film. Of the recent four I've seen (De-Lovely, Ray, Beyond the Sea), Walk the Line's the finest. -www.samseescinema.com",8,153,209,19 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," everything that Star Wars should be
","Star Wars: The Phantom Menace reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4In taking up this momentous task of creating an entire trilogy that chronologically precedes his legendary original three films, George Lucas is a madman. Although I wasn't alive during the original's release, this new generation can at least relate to the complete chaos that it sparked. We have The Matrix. And when the prequels roll around in another decade or so, which you know they will, all us 35 year old geeks will be on tip-toes in line to get the midnight tickets too. But that isn't what The Phantom Menace is about. The Phantom Menace is about bringing to life what has been swirling around in the inconceivable depths of Lucas' mind years before Star Wars: A New Hope was even pitched to Universal Studios (and actually turned down). It's the opening act to a nine-part saga (the last three of which probably won't see the screen) that unites all humanity under one big foundation of a Japanese legend created by Akira Kurosawa in The Hidden Fortress (which we'll get into with a later review). The film opens with the trade blockade of a gorgeous little planet named Naboo. There to settle disputes with the Trade Federation and the Republic are two Jedi Ambassadors, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), meeting with the Federation Viceroys. But when the Viceroys are ordered by a mysterious robed force to kill the Jedi's and begin the invasion of Naboo, negotiations are ground to a halt. Already old-time Star Wars fans are shaking their heads in confusion. Why are there Viceroys and Ambassadors? When did Star Wars become a bad analogy for the United Nations? Well, that's an aspect of these three prequels that people are just going to have to get used to. Instead of haphazard adventure and swashbuckling Han Solo, we get galactic politics. One reason behind this shift in perspective is in the simple fact that Science Fiction films have become undeniably more 'intelligent' in the last 30 years. Releasing a prequel that contains little more than adventure and romance would do nothing for the saga. In order to impress both the last generation of Star Wars fans and the new one, Lucas had to smarten his films up a bit. Also, he has to start the lineage that leads to Luke Skywalker while, at the same time, start a civil war within the Republic. He has to mix the politics of the war with the beginning of events the that lead to Luke's birth. And while doing this, George Lucas also has to create three films that work as complete entities all on their own. Pretty tricky stuff if you ask me. Anyway, after Naboo is invaded and the Queen has been captured, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jin rush in to rescue her with the help of the controversial sea creature Jar Jar Binks. To put it simply, old-timers hate him, young people love him. Lucas' way of hitting up the new generation for ticket sales. From there, the three and company have to escape to the Outer Rim planet of Tatooine (ring a bell?) and find some parts to repair their ship. What Lucas preserved from the original films is their spectacular sense of pacing. We're taken across the galaxy, to three drastically different planets that all have their own dialects, life forms, climates, architecture, and political stance. The sense of adventure, despite the inclusion of heavy politics, is still blissfully present. We're still treated to blistering chases, this time in the form of a visceral 'pod race', epic battles, now between the indigenous Gunguns and the Federation droids, and lighting fast lightsaber duels, now between the menacing Darth Maul and our two favorite Jedi. It's all still here, but sometimes now plays to the influence of a new generation of film. What really helps The Phantom Menace is its cast. Although Jake Lloyd playing Anakin has some trouble with his lines, casting choices like Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are all spot on. They fit so ideally in their roles, all being well-known actors but not tabloid superstars, making their inclusion more fitting than box office slimy. If I were to see Brad Pitt as Obi-Wan and Julia Roberts playing Queen Amidala, tears would come to my eyes. But what everyone wants to know is if The Phantom Menace is a fitting addition to the Star War legend. In my opinion, yes. People debate that it's too wordy and political for Star Wars, but in reality, the politics are kind of a relief. They pull us deeper into Lucas' universe, making us understand it instead of simply letting it become the backdrop. And the politics play ideally into the lineage of Luke Skywalker and the division of the Republic. Also, The Phantom Menace manages to keep itself contained. As a stand-alone film, The Phantom Menace still holds up. Its plot, although another link in the chain, manages to hold its own as a viable story and plays itself out in traditional adventurous swagger. It's everything that Star Wars should be, a swashbuckling adventure that lifts us out of our world and into one that lived 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.'",9,1,3,19 May 2005
Lords of Dogtown," little more than an afternoon endeavor for only the most hardcore of skaters
","rating: 2 out of 4  Director: Catherine Hardwicke Cast: John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, Heath  Ledger, Victor Rasuk, Nikki Reed Screenplay: Stacy Peralta MPAA  Classification: PG-13 (drug and alcohol content, sexuality, violence,  language and reckless behavior-all involving teens)  The problem with Lords of Dogtown lies in its approach to the material.  Written by Stacy Peralta, one of the three 'lords' mentioned in the  title, the film seems to want to tell a story about rebellion,  teenagers, and skateboarding, but this novel effort is eclipsed by box  office pressures of the Summer film release season. The big wigs at the  distributors don't want an art-house film on their hands during June,  they want high-profile adrenaline charged action that will pull  teenagers in by the droves. This pressure probably led to a neutering  of the original screenplay and the old snip-snip of explicit content  which would make the film R, instead of a profit-producing PG-13.  Consequently, Lords of Dogtown is a 'bleh'-quality sports film that  only brushes the surface of its potential.   Skip (Heath Ledger) is the king of Dogtown, which in reality is Venice,  California. It's the sixties, and surfing in California is a rapidly  growing fad. Skip owns Zephyr surf shop, dedicated to the philosophy of  allowing his workers to surf and work on their own hours and terms,  consequently leaving him with the bills piling up. An idea sparks when  new skateboard wheels arrive at his shop and open up the possibilities  of skateboarding becoming a sport, not a hobby for when the waves are  flat. He decides to start the Zephyr Skate Team. Hired for the team,  among others, are Jay (Emile Hirsch), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), and Sid  (Michael Angarano). The only one with a smooth temper and a fair head  on his shoulders, Stacy (John Robinson), is also the only one left out  of the team. But this all changes when Zephyr attends their first Skate  competition. Amping up the tunes and transforming the gymnastic-like  sport into one of style, Team Zephyr lands Jay the bronze and Tony with  a potential gold had he not picked a fight with an opposing coach.  However, Stacy decides to show up without a team and ends up with the  silver, proving his talent to Skip. Now with Team Zephyr complete, Jay,  Tony, and Stacy take on the Skateboarding world and make their way to  the top. But when a reporter from 'Skateboarder Magazine' does a cover  story on the boys everything changes.   What's so agonizing about Lords is all that it actually has going for  it. There's obviously great potential here, but the screenplay just  never pulls through. Most noticeably, the time period director  Catherine Hardwicke creates is nearly flawless. The soundtrack features  great tunes from the era of sixties hard rock, instead of a cop-out  rap/techno backdrop that haunts many of these period sports films  nowadays. The town of Venice is also stylishly re-created. The sets  achieve the mood of a laid-back surfer town with postage-stamp  developments of a suburbia from the fifties. I found it easy to sink  into Hardwicke's world of Dogtown and believe every inch of it.   Also impressive is Heath Ledger's performance. Even though the  screenplay never completes his story, as it does with the 'Lords',  Ledger's character is the most convincing. Shaving his Australian  accent, Ledger holds a perfect drunken Californian drawl the entire  film. And of all the characters, his is the most dynamic. His character  isn't bound by the stereotypes the others are. He's pathetic,  motivating, rousing, obnoxious, rewarding, and lovable all at once.  He's essentially human. He's the sort of guy we all know. The guy we  aren't quite sure if we love or if we hate. If for nothing else, Lords  of Dogtown deserves a bit of recognition for Ledger's portrayal of  Skip.  But Skip aside, Lords' characters are flat. Their written as  one-dimensional stereotypes that never grow or react to their  environments. Also, none are all that likable. Even Stacy, the kind  one, is sometimes too kind and eventually ends up abandoning his roots  for fame and fortune. We're constantly being alienated from these  characters because the story never allows us to like or even relate to  them. They're kept the one-dimensional characters they started as, even  if their hair-dos may have changed.   How can a film about the sixties, rebellion, teenager-hood,  skateboarding, and revolution be rated PG-13? Since when was the  rebellious behavior of the sixties a tame subject? Lords of Dogtown  likes to believe it was. They try their best, they really do, but with  a PG-13 rating strapping it down, what chance did it really ever have?  Language is kept absent, sex is suggested but not witnessed, drugs and  alcohol are the same, and mostly, Lords skips around every aspect of  the sixties that made it what it's known for. This castration of  material makes the film disappointingly less believable. And with  one-dimensional characters and some poor acting on the parts of Tony,  Jay, and Stacy, Lords of Dogtown is little more than an afternoon  endeavor for only the most hardcore of skaters.   -Sam Osborn",5,56,123,5 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 3.0 out of 4More, more, more seems to be the theme running through Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There's more adventure, more violence, more pirates, and more myth. Not to mention that two and a half hour running length. But while Superman Returns may have dragged some in its 150 minutes, Pirates hurtles along at a pace only expected from the offspring of a Disneyland theme-ride, rarely slowing for piddling bits of nonsense like, oh say, story. Of course, story's not the point of these flicks and it surely doesn't have to be. There's entertainment enough to be had without all the other hodgepodge. And Pirates 2, for all its expansion, manages to dodge common sequelitis pitfalls. It doesn't overdose on a memorable character from the original (cough, Matrix Revolutions, cough) or over-broaden it's scope (cough, Matrix Reloaded,cough). Dead Man's Chest is a continuation of the original Pirates adventure, just with a couple extra unmarked sails tacked onto its deck. The plot has something to do with ole' Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, of course) and his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Debts, as we've all learned by now, are not things Mr. Sparrow is most proficient at repaying. The Dead Man's Chest factors in as it holds Mr. Jones' beating heart, which was ravaged by the likes of a lady whom he loved in the past. The English Navy blowhards also seem to be after the chest, and blackmail William Turner (Orlando Bloom) to seek out Capt. Jack's magic compass, which supposedly points toward the treasure. Held in a cell is Will's fiancé, Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), under charges of assisting Capt. Jack in the franchise's last swashbuckler. What it boils down to is a mottled mess of a chase to find the key to Davey Jones' chest, and avoiding his gargantuan beast, the Kraken. The myth itself wrings deeper than the original's, with Davey Jones and his seafood cohorts rendered with an unholy amount of CGI goodness to make them squirm convincingly in all their scaly, slippery evil. But the plot doesn't hold much water, same as the first, though plot was never the point. As long as it paints a tastily mythological backdrop for our pirates to plunder, we're kept smiling. And even though the picture has all the weight of a paperclip, the franchise has at least matured since it's last time around. The mood has thickened and no longer can we tell that the film is a shameless translation of its Disneyland ride. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio take efforts to develop each of our three heroes separately, using individual sub-plots to fill in the otherwise empty molds left dry from the original. Will Turner has a family reunion with his father (Stellan Skarsgard), enslaved by Davy Jones and appearing as though he's slowly evolving into a starfish. Will's fiancé, Ms. Swan, escapes from her cell and hides as a stowaway on a trade vessel. And Jack, of course still functioning as the star of the show, develops his slimier persona with delectable cowardice and deception. Ironic that the teenagers of America have chosen Mr. Sparrow as their most prized character in film. Oh, wait, that honor instead belongs to Napoleon Dynamite. Perhaps we should be nervous about our country's future? Anyway, along with the characters the adventure is also thickened heartily; though probably not by consequence of the writing, but instead because of the greatly inflated budget. Our friends are volleyed about the seas, facing the enormous sea monster, the Kraken, whose plunger-like tentacles crumple vessels like copy-paper. Swordplay is more indulgent too, with Verbinksi going so far as to mount a chivalric swordfight inside a huge, rolling waterwheel as it bounces along the island's foliage. Verbinski juggles these stunts with ease, proving once again his film-making versatility. If you'll remember all the way back to last October (I know, in Hollywood-time nine months is an epoch) Verbinski made a quiet, gloomy little character study called The Weather Man. And before that, Verbinski also directed The Ring and Captain Jack's first adventure in 2003. Yup, this guy's the real deal. In the waterwheel sequence, Verbinski chooses not to succumb to any mere CGI trickery, and mounts a camera on the wheel's axis to show that at one point he forced Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom to swordfight on a giant spinning wooden wheel. And he's more artistic than your typical Brett Ratner-esquire director, finding a visual aesthetic perfect for a pirate's tale. But art and pretentious critic fodder aside, Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment. It's rich and exciting and chock-full of Captain Jack-isms for high schoolers to repeat over and again. And the life of pirates is still a chunk of history that Hollywood has been unwilling to bite into for a while. Pirates of the Caribbean, for all its feathery, lightweight fun, gorges on this chunk and keeps us hooked on the adventure, waiting along with all the local eighth and ninth graders next year for the midnight showing of Captain Jack's trilogy capper.",8,171,275,2 July 2006
Hostel," a grim refreshment among the lamely malignant, tired duds that have passed for the Horror genre so far this year
","Hostel reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 3 out of 4I can't attest to honestly enjoying Hostel. In fact, I often had to resist the reflexive temptation to leave. The film is simply disgusting. I worried that my fellow audience members would be drenched in a fresh, steaming coat of my own vomit, to be absolutely truthful. Someone asked Writer/Director Eli Roth after the screening how he managed to convince the MPAA into an R-rating. Roth laughed at this, mentioning off-handedly that Rob Zombie was to thank. After Zombie returned an astonishing nine times to earn his R-rating for The Devil's Rejects, Roth believed the MPAA just didn't care enough to fight a new director. He even wrote Zombie a thank-you note. The film surrounds three young men, Josh (Derek Richardson), Paxton (Jay Hernandez), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), and their horrific backpacking trip through Europe. We meet them as they enter Amsterdam, eager to exploit the nation's liberal laws concerning marijuana. But when the night is through, the trio arrive back at their hostel past curfew, only to find themselves locked out. Luckily, Amsterdam native Alex (Lubomir Bukovy) comes to their rescue, offering them a spot at his pad for the night. Alex informs the boys that Slovakia is the untapped gem of Europe for backpackers; that beautiful women simply await strapping young Americans like themselves to steal them away. And, of course, our heroes buy the lie and the next day trek out towards Slovakia. Once they arrive, they find there are already reservations in Oli's name at a luxury hostel. And when they walk into their room, the boys find Natalya and Svetlana (Barbara Nedeljakova and Jana Kaderabkova) casually nude, sveltely inviting them to the spa. By the end of the evening the group gets itself into bed together, but wakes up the next morning to find Oli missing. No matter, they think, it's just crazy Oli. But things get even stranger when Josh wakes up in a dungeon, only to be drilled through the kneecaps and sliced with a scalpel through his achilles tendons by a businessman-turned-surgeon (Jan Vlasak). What, you might ask, is this dungeon? Well, it's a lucrative business that allows insatiable, adrenaline-addicted citizens of the world's upper tier to pay $5-50,000 to chain an innocent human to a chair and torture them how he/she pleases. Roth read of such a business (explaining the 'inspired by true events' curtail) on a website, later explaining the idea to Tarantino, who encouraged him to put the twisted idea to paper. Whether or not the web site speaks truth is immaterial, explains Roth. It's just the fact that somebody thought of it. Anyway, Josh meets his destiny quite quickly (in a nod to Psycho's elimination of the protagonist twist) and puts the aggressive, dodgy Paxton front and center. Paxton starts digging deeper and deeper, questioning the conniving girls as to Josh's whereabouts, and soon he finds himself in a similar situation. Chophouse films like these, particularly those most prominent of the genre from the seventies, have always been hindered by technology. Make-up just hasn't been good enough to make the gore convincing. But Hostel clearly leaps this hurdle. The film is fun and over-the-top, but holds enough solemnity to tug the audience straight into its torture scenes. The film is so gory that when we watch as two fingers are vengefully dismembered with a scalpel in the final scene, the gore seems tamely benign. Roth fondly recalls the most squeamish of scenes as 'the eyegasm scene.' All I'll divulge is that the scene has to do with a blowtorch and only one half of a woman's face. I'm confident with my movie-watching habits to proudly brag at an adept tolerance, and even affection, of quality gore. I'm not one to turn away from blood and flailing limbs. But what Roth does to us in Hostel could cause even a mortician to cringe. In short, it's the goriest film I've ever seen. Many wonder what the 'Quentin Tarantino Presents' headline stapled to Hostel denotes. First of all, it doesn't mean Hostel is Tarantino's creation. As Roth explains, Tarantino is a large advocate of the budding filmmaker. He occasionally has 'movie nights' in which a gaggle of blossoming directors are invited to Tarantino's pad to check out some films. There, Tarantino riles up the directors and gets them psyched for their upcoming projects. After seeing Roth's first feature, Cabin Fever, Tarantino invited Roth to one such shindig and offered to help out with Hostel. Roth pumped out a first draft script, Tarantino helped with the edits, and agreed to offer the 'Quentin Tarantino Presents' headline. From there, Roth took the reigns during the shooting process, and Tarantino returned to help out with post-production and MPAA rating strategies. Technically, Tarantino played Producer of Hostel, but in more ways than one, he was the film's mentor. As aforementioned, I can't admit to having enjoyed Hostel. I certainly wouldn't watch it again. But for those die-hard fans of the chophouse slasher genre, Hostel's the American masterpiece. Takashi Miike films have certainly lived up to Hostel's gory watermark, but Hostel is the first American film, to my knowledge, to grace such bloody explicitness. Roth even admits to have been deeply influenced by Miike's work, particularly Audition, and Miike actually makes a cameo as one of the business' clients. But despite my physical aversion to Roth's film, I'll admit that it's a grim refreshment among the lamely malignant, tired duds that have passed for the Horror genre so far this year.",7,16,30,18 December 2005
Oldboy," a twisted, cathartic experience that I absorbed for days afterward
","Oldboy reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 4 out of 4To describe Oldboy would be to imagine Franz Kafka's novella The Metamorphosis mixed with Quentin Tarantino's revenge saga Kill Bill and placed in the cities, schoolrooms, and prisons of South Korea. That would give you a vague idea of what this film attempts. Now add elements of thick brutality, sexual torture, bizarre time-jumps and head-spinning revelations, and you may be able to envision the strange and beautiful symphony that is Oldboy. Oh Dae-Su (Min-sik Choi) wakes up in a room. The window is plastered over with a cheap painting of the countryside, there's a bed, a television, and a small bathroom. Each night, gas is spilled through the crack in his door, Oh Dae-Su passes out and is awakened later with his hair cut. All there is to do is watch TV, beat at the walls with his fists, and chip away at the brick wall. Dae-su is imprisoned in this room eating fried dumplings and being hypnotized into amnesia for fifteen years. All without knowing who has imprisoned him and why they did so. He vows that his only objective when he escapes is to hunt down his keeper and eat him. That's right, eat him. The premise sounds as simplistic as a general revenge thriller but believe me, there is little about Oldboy that could be described as 'simple'.You'll first notice Director Chan-wook Park's take on his material. Like Kafka did with The Metamorphosis, Park skips interim fluff between important sequences and nearly always just cuts to the chase. Rarely are we faced with a scene that doesn't contain an essential revelation or storyline twist. Each scene is essential in constructing Park's maze-like screenplay and does so with a pace that's unrelenting in its speed. Also, Park loves to confuse reality with dream in Oldboy. Again relating the film to Kafka's novella, Park never really discerns between fact and fiction. Many times we're presented with a scene that seems strictly dream-like (a woman on a train inhabited only by a giant ant), only to have the film carry on in the very reality we previously realized only as imagination. And he never lets us settle with characters we believe to be human. For instance, because Dae-Su's only linguistic interaction for the last fifteen years was with his television, most of his words in the real world come straight from the 'truths' he heard from the TV. And many of the characters, despite making human mistakes, take vengeance in the most inhuman of ways. Dae-Su's weapon of choice is a hammer for pete's sake! But much of Oldboy's power comes from its incredible honesty. Park uses his Kafka-esquire plotting to keep us on the edge of our seats, even in the most inhumane of moments. His violence is brutal, his sex is real, and most of all, his taste for revenge is simply palpable. He grips our psyche to mold us to his film's will, drawing us deeper into its convoluted reality and spitting us out when he's all through. It's a twisted, cathartic experience that I absorbed for days afterward. It works on all angles of our cerebral organ, evoking emotions and images that I will not soon forget.",10,7,97,18 April 2005
Superbad," Superbad has the feeling of being absolutely effortless
","Superbad reviewed by Samuel OsbornLike Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad has the feeling of being absolutely effortless. It's a Judd Apatow requirement maybe that no joke should be choked out by its characters. Honesty and chemistry seem to be the only ingredients to his enormously profitable formula. He sits in the Producer's chair for Superbad, letting Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg use their ten year old script and Greg Mottola direct it. But Apatow has ushered in his own era of comic productions in Hollywood. They're low-brow in their premises but entirely human and wholly sincere in their execution. Superbad is no different, pulling focus on two outcasts trying to wiggle somehow into the exclusive social hierarchy of high school before they scoot off into their separate lives at college. Girls are their only concern and like the boys of American Pie, Seth and Evan are looking only to get laid. The simplest way to explain Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) is to say they would have no problem getting along with the stoner Ben from Knocked Up and the sexless Andy from The 40 Year Old Virgin. Molded too awkwardly to exist normally in the social world, these characters are forced into situations far outside their comfort zone. Here Seth, Evan, and their twice nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are asked to score the alcohol for a party that evening at Jule's house, Seth's big crush. Depending on the fact that Fogell somehow has obtained a phony I.D., they boast that they can buy the girls whatever they want; that they do this thing all the time when, in fact, they've never set foot in a liquor store. It doesn't help that Fogell's I.D. claims that he's a 25 year old Hawaiian named McLovin. And as any teenager knows, finding alcohol is never a simple task. The boys' shenanigans drive them deep into the night and late to the party, but glorious in their possession of alcohol for their underaged peers. These peers, thankfully, actually look like their peers. By this I mean that the extras and peripheral characters look believably under the age of twenty-one. I'm so tired of muscled, bearded thirty-somethings posing as bodacious high schoolers. The students here are entirely convincing as real live students. The funny thing about effortlessness is that rarely is it in fact effortless. But the effort involved is so well masked that we accept it as something easy and natural. Like the previous Apatow concoctions, casting and scripting are the main players; minutely calibrated to bubble up a critical mass of on-screen chemistry for the actors to play with. Jonah Hill from previous Apatow films and Michael Cera of 'Arrested Development' fame are superb choices as Seth and Evan. Director Greg Mottola handles Mr. Rogen and Mr. Golberg's script adroitly and manages to funkify what could have been a pop-music mood, bringing in music from the Bar-Kays, Rick James, Curtis Mayfield and The Roots. The result is a swell continuation of Apatow and his crew's success. Samuel Osborn",4,3,12,20 August 2007
Hot Fuzz," A Valiant but Sophomoric Attempt from a Growing, Very Talented Troupe of Players
","Hot Fuzz reviewed by Samuel OsbornHot Fuzz is Edgar Wright's follow-up to the clever UK cult smash Shaun of the Dead. Both films run on the same fuel, wearing the chassis of a spoof picture over a more respectful genre comedy underneath. The formula works tepidly this time around, working off a less compelling genre (what can be more compelling than zombies?) and an even less clever screenplay. The same players thankfully return though, with Simon Pegg in the lead role and Nick Frost returning as his adorable doofus foil. The whole project feels like a valiant but sophomoric attempt from a growing, very talented troupe of players and filmmakers. It's not the kind of transitional failure that's bound to oust Wright and company from the business; but the sort of disappointing follow-up that'll quench their loyalists thirst just long enough to wait for their third, hopefully much-improved outing.Edgar Wright mentioned at the screening last Monday that he and his co-writer Simon Pegg aren't out to make parodies, just genre pictures that are funny. So the chosen genre for Hot Fuzz is the Buddy-Cop Film, popularized by the likes of Lethal Weapon, Vanishing Point, and Bad Boys. Their own version of this cop duo is Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). Angel has been shoved out of the London Metropolitan force for being too efficient. Bill Nighy, in a sly cameo, puts it shamelessly by saying 'You're making us all look bad.' So Angel is relocated to the crime-free village-of-the-year, Sandford, where he meets a dorky gang of police officers sitting around their precinct chowing cake. Without crime there's little need for cops, making Angel an irrelevance. Thankfully, a glib serial killer gowned as the Grim Reaper starts decapitating villagers nightly. Though the rest of the precinct sees the deaths as unfortunate accidents, Angel insights correctly that they're the work a murderer. So as the body count rises, Angel and his cop-flick obsessed partner Butterman, start an investigation of their own. What must be remembered is that a British cop film hasn't been released in a while, probably because police officers aren't allowed to brandish firearms in the UK, rendering much of the drama that officers unload here in the States moot. Wright capitalizes on this fact and makes it a kind of running joke throughout Hot Fuzz. Without the fingering of triggers and clinks and clanks of reloading and cocking of the gun, Wright turns to every other noise to emphasize. Car doors opening and closing, the unraveling of caution tape, and even the application of a super-stylish toothpick all get their own ridiculous sonic exaggeration. The film also gets progressively American, Wright says, the further into the mystery Angel burrows. The dialogue repeatedly gets dumbed-down from talky British humor to single-syllabic American expressions. By the end, the usually over-explanatory Angel reduces his speech to a single, grimaced word: 'Idea.' But it's only these clever directorial tricks that remind us that Hot Fuzz is from the same womb as Shaun of the Dead. Bluntly, Hot Fuzz just isn't very funny. It embraces its chosen genre as fully and lovingly as Shaun of the Dead did, but without the same clever severity. The jokes generally aren't molded to fit the Buddy-Cop genre and are scooped more often from the buckets of broad, common humor. Making matters more dull, the Buddy-Cop device fails to be compelling. Sergeant Angel is cold and mechanical, but not humorously so. He's a yawn at best. And though PC Butterman fishes out most of Hot Fuzz's laughs, he isn't much more than a broad, rounded goofball. The whole thing looks fine enough, as Edgar Wright is a budding, impressive filmmaker with a lot of insightful ideas about the movies rolling off his tongue; but this project is a mild misfire.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Lost its Charm and its Excitement
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End reviewed by Samuel OsbornThe Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has been a menagerie of CGI magic, dreaming up seafaring worlds of swashbuckling majesty, the emptiness of such computerized beauty filled in by the drunkenly feminine charm of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). His personality was big enough for all the rest of the characters, of whom consisted mostly of archetypes we'd expect from a trilogy based off an amusement park ride. The plots are confusing little numbers, spinning half-baked legends around the myriad of story arcs each character was put to. They work mostly to provide coal for the furnace of stunt-work and CGI, both of which turn clenched jaws of suspense into wide-hanging maws of amazement. The characters, even Mr. Sparrow, are corkboards for personalities to be tacked on to. There's no evolution to these people; simply punch-lines and singular motivations. But up until this third installment, the shaky equation worked. I'd give much of the credit to director Gore Verbinski, who achieved the unlikely feat of maintaining an artist's handiwork throughout the duration of the colossal project. (Does anyone remember the creative collapse of X-Men when Brett Ratner took the reigns of the trilogy?) But with At World's End, the tangle of the franchise's formula catches up. The song put on repeat that each character sings has grown tiresome. And the plot mangles itself into a confusing bundle of tedium. After 168 minutes, it becomes a strange and bizarre phenomenon to be bored by such spectacle.Picking up where Dead Man's Chest left off, Will Turner (Orland Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), and their merry band of adventurers seek to bust Jack Sparrow from the confines of Davy Jones' (Bill Nighy) locker. The path to World's End, where the locker unexplainably exists, is held within the map of Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), a Singaporean Pirate Lord obsessed with steam. Finagling a shadowy deal with the Captain, Will Turner manages to secure a ship and a crew to take to Jones' locker with the understanding that Mr. Sparrow will repay a longstanding debt with Sao Feng when retrieved. You see, Turner isn't saving Sparrow for the sake of their friendship. Jack has always had a thing for Turner's fiancée, Elizabeth Swann, and has never been mum on the subject. Will is instead looking to save Sparrow to, in turn, use him to free his imprisoned father on board Davy's ship, The Flying Dutchman. It hasn't been fifteen minutes and already we're confused. Anyway, it isn't long before Jack's busted out and a new plot thread must spool out. The nine remaining pirate lords, for a reason I missed somehow, decide to hold a summit on Shipwreck Isle. And here's where things get really confusing. Between Elizabeth Swann, Jack Sparrow, Captain Barbossa, Will Turner, Lord Beckett, Tia Dalma, Captain Sao Feng, Davy Jones, Bootstrap Bill, and Norrington, there are at least ten different motives for the script to juggle. But since all ends meet at Shipwreck Isle, the entire second hour of the film is spent making deals, betraying loyalty, forging accords, and stabbing backs before the summit is held. By the arrival of the third act I managed to have caught up. And seeing the immense mound of plot the script had hauled forward, it's realized that the epic tangle of characters and motives would be impressive were it not so damned tedious. The plot razes all traces of the franchise's main attraction: charm. Investing fully in the complex web of story, it forgets that we care little for the motives of these characters as they pertain to the plot. Sparrow wants to be a pirate forever. Fine, what else did we expect? Turner wants to free his dad. OK, that's cute, Will. Swann likes the life of a pirate and wants the torch to be carried on. Whatever, she's like that. We care for these characters most in times of their clever verbal jousting, twirling swordplay, fantastic adventures. How they strike accords and deal with British administrative law are mere obligations to a story set in the pirating world. Yet At World's End insists upon putting that piece to the puzzle front and center. It's not a cushy piece of swashbuckling wonder with which to sink our teeth deliciously into. It's a surprising wooden block that our teeth shatter upon. It's boring, in short. But when those clouds clear and the moonlit charm returns, Pirates is still, after all, Pirates. There are moments in those final two hours of this ridiculously long-winded saga that remind us why the franchise has raked in so much money thus far. They're few, but shining. And that first hour, when Barbossa and company go to world's end to crack the lock on Jones' locker, it's glistening, rousing entertainment. But like The Matrix Trilogy a few years back, Pirates of the Caribbean winds itself into a dry wrap of self-importance, forgetting the reasons seats were filled the first time round the ride. And by the time this go-round finally comes to a halt, the excitement has all but faded. Samuel Osborn",5,1,4,24 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric
","Spiderman 3 reviewed by Samuel OsbornMy endless fascination with midnight screenings brought me to the theatre at Union Square here in Manhattan last night, standing in line with every other fanboy garbed in a Spidey costume bought from the Kmart down the street and crushing into a third row/far left seating arrangement that cricked my neck up to the gargantuan screen above. The film rolled up to speed and the requisite clapping and whoops ensued. 140 minutes and a polite applause later we filed out. All of us shook our heads, some shaking in confusion while others shook in unguarded disappointment. This, after all, was not the Spiderman 3 we had anticipated. It was something broader, something simpler, something light. But to call this third entry into the mega-franchise a complete blunder is a gross overreaction. It's more that the big gust of air Spiderman 2 inhaled in preparation for the big trilogy finish is not the same air exhaled in Spiderman 3. The film is still the same gosh-wow cinematic event it was three years agoonly this time around, things have gone a bit goofy. Things are as they were when we left Spiderman swinging through the steel and concrete canyons of the Manhattan skyline in 2004. He's still with the budding Broadway starlet Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and still at odds with his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who now seeks revenge for his father's death. Peter's lost in romance and fame, anticipating a city festival in Spiderman's honor and spinning webs for him and MJ to lie upon beneath the shooting stars. He's pitching the idea of a marriage proposal to his widowed Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and excelling in school with his lab partner/supermodel Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Yep, things are good in Spidey-land; and especially good when Harry awakes from a harsh concussive coma to have forgotten Peter's involvement in his father's death. But leave a particle physics experiment and an alien meteorite alone long enough and you're bound to face a stray supervillain. So inevitably, it isn't long until Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) and Venom are on the loose, robbing banks and infecting enterprising photographers (Topher Grace) like supervillains tend to do. What's changed most here is the text behind the production. The original Spiderman was penned by David Koepp, screen writing veteran of Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible and War of the Worlds. Spiderman 2 brought on board Alvin Sargent, a quieter writer known for Robert Redford's Ordinary People and the adultery riff, Unfaithful. This time around, Sam Raimi and his older brother Ivan penned the script with the help of Mr. Sargent. Sam Raimi's writing credentials include The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness. Though all three films are giddily remembered in all the majestic cheeseball glory, none of them would be considered the right material for the third entry into this multi-billion dollar franchise. And who trusted Sam's older brother Ivan to help put this story into theatres? Ivan's a doctor, not a writer. Anyway, this family pairing gave Spiderman 3 the wily gift of Camp humor. And Camp is something like the ugly lovechild of Satire and Parody: mischievous and unwieldy. When it works, it works (e.g. Evil Dead). When it doesn't work, the backlash from the audience can be fierce. And in Spiderman 3, the backlash will be vociferous. The sequence most in question finds Peter Parker under the control of Venom, the alien parasite that, when infected, transforms its host into the manifestation of its worst character traits. We expect the grimmer, haunting side of Spiderman to rear its head here. Instead, Raimi gives Peter the emo hair-flip and pencils in black eye-liner. He dances in the street and gives the eye to girls walking past. He goes to a jazz club and showcases his surprise piano talents, dancing on top of the piano and picking a fight with the bartender while jutting his crotch out towards the ladies. And if that weren't an awkward enough addition to the Spiderman legend, Raimi poses all of this as a quasi musical dance number. So if nothing else, it is a fascinating and hideous thing watching the colossal Spiderman franchise nearly cannibalize itself in a matter of two short scenes.Luckily, the action sequences are nothing if not spectacles, as usual. The feats of CGI workmanship are as we've come to expect from the Spiderman franchise, the perspective whirling about as if through the eyes of a highly enraged bumble-bee. If you aren't nauseated, you'll be amazed. The villains are the best they've yet been, with Sandman showcasing the state of artistic digital animation and the creepy, parasitic Venom living up to its insatiable hype by the film's end. It's all structured so as to make the action into fresh and sugary prizes for enduring the lesser story bits forced in between. Spiderman has always pretended to be story-driven. And in the first two films the script was convincing enough so that we shrugged our shoulders and played along. But the Raimi brothers have indulged maybe too sloppily into comic book traditions this time and have let their story stray into something of an unintended joke. But for a franchise that relies on the tent-poles of event summer cinema, Spiderman 3 is still a blissful two and a half hour block of escapist fun. Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric. Samuel Osborn",7,1,2,6 May 2007
Zodiac," A Fascinating Portrait of a Mystery by the Master of Loom
","Zodiac reviewed by Samuel Osborn Consider the complications involved in making Zodiac. Fact: the Zodiac killer was never caught. Fact: Robert Graysmith, the main character, survived to write the books the film is based upon and is still alive today. These two very relevant, very essential facts are widely known. So how does a filmmaker go about making a thriller where any suspense surrounding the hero is moot, and where the audience already knows the ending? These aren't spoilers, they're circumstances. They force Zodiac into uncultivated territory, and it makes for the most beguiling mystery sincewell, since the last time David Fincher made a film about serial killers (Se7en).What first must be realized, I suppose, is that Zodiac is probably not what audiences expect. The film was meant for an Oscar slating. Planned for November 2006 release, complications in post-production and the final cut pushed it out to its present low-key March release (exact details are sketchy). Typical March fare is stuff like Ghost Rider and 300 (which, by the way, is a glorious piece of work); pulpy films without the earning power for a more lucrative summer release. What this all means for Zodiac is that audiences walk in expecting a lot of blood, a lot of violence, and a lot of hair-tearing insanity from the type of serial killer that gets a March release. Zodiac isn't that film. This isn't even what David Fincher, veteran of such cult favorites as Fight Club and Panic Room, is known for putting out. Zodiac is long (160 minutes), obsessed with tiny evidential details, and the humble owner of only three death sequences, all of which occur within the first hour. The film takes a very sober look at a serial killer, reminding us maybe of Silence of the Lambs. But let's not get too carried away. It is only March, after all.The film begins with the grim, giddy excitement of discovering an emerging serial murderer. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a straight-laced cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle, one of the three Bay Area publications that, beginning in October of 1969, Zodiac sent his infamous letters to. Paul Avery, a drunken, goofily arrogant journalist played by Robert Downey Jr., covers the murders, putting himself in the way of Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) and Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), the detectives assigned to the case. After the initial popular craze of the Zodiac plays its course, Mr. Fincher locks the story on the Inspectors' investigation. When they run out of threads and put the case reluctantly down, Mr. Graysmith picks it up, volunteering his own bizarre obsession with the killer.Where Graysmith was meticulous with his evidence in the book, it seems Fincher here was meticulous with every element of this picture. There have been reports of him demanding, in true Kubrick style, seventy or more takes from his actors. The results, despite some disgruntled remarks from Gyllenhaal, are stunning performances from all the main players. Ruffalo, Downey Jr., Gyllenhaal, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's second wife all put up careful, driven performances.Mr. Graysmith's book, also enigmatically titled Zodiac, is essentially a documentation of case files. It's dry and painstakingly thorough (read: a back-of-your-seat, have-to-put-down thriller). And when rumors trickled out that Fincher was going to ridiculous lengths to achieve the same level of accuracymurder sequences are supposedly accurate up to the centimeter in terms of the choreographyI admit to having some worries over the same true crime boredom of the book's adaptation.But thankfully, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt has done a laudable job. As much as Zodiac is about the investigation, it's also about the lives of those obligated and those willing to bring the killer's identity to light. Because of this the film doesn't move like most mystery thrillers do; its pacing is steady and quietly propulsive, allowing the true evidence and mesmerizing reality of the case turn the motor. The thrills swing like mean whispers and arise from the actions of its ultra-dimensional characters.And although Fincher might have chosen a slower, more thoughtful script, he approaches the text with the same urban Gothic loom he's famous for. The camera work tickles the dark, provocative underbelly of San Francisco at that time period, dynamically gliding through black and blue shadows and warm lamplight glow. His portrait of a mystery is wide and solemn and ponderous, but never to be mistaken with boring. Its barbs are sharp and cruelly disturbing at times. Like in The Game, Fight Club, and Se7en before it, Zodiac displays Fincher's enthrallment in our natural obsession with human destruction, be it mental or physical. And as usual, his dissection of this ironic fascination is utterly satisfying.Samuel Osborn",9,2,5,1 March 2007
Crash," Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film
","Crash Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com Rating: 3 out of 4 It may sound silly, but Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film. For me, it was good, but certainly not great. You see, it's an ensemble film that has a few great stories out of its many. Like a symphony that has a great violin line, but a mediocre cello. It wows us with one of its elements to cover up the others. And although the others aren't exactly bad, they just aren't up to par with the film's best.Sporting one of the most impressive casts this year, Crash tells nearly a dozen stories that explore the racial aspect of American society post-9/11. Encompassing all races and the stereotypes that follow them, Crash delves into the reasons racial crimes occur. It doesn't criminalize the acts, but gives them humanity, showing us why they occur and not simply condemning the people who commit them. Problem is, Crash sometimes turns into the film I just described above: an educational film fit for a high school Health class. For many of Crash's stories, Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby) fails to bring the characters past the racial crimes they're story into more of a lesson than an actual story. But for the two or three plot lines that do achieve this, the result is nothing short of an emotional powerhouse.Part of this problem can be attributed to the film's short running length. With the reel running under two hours, it's simply impossible to flesh out so many characters. One of my favorite ensemble films, Magnolia, was three hours long. But despite the long running length, I felt like I had read deep into each character and could weave each one into the story as a whole. Crash isn't quite long enough to do that. It allows for the development of some characters, but leaves many out to dry with their overly didactic stories. The characters become defined by their acts, not the other way around.That's not to say Crash is a poor film however. Which is why I say it almost tricks its audience into thinking it's a great film. Except for the script design, every other element of the film is of near-perfect quality. The acting in particular is a high point. I don't have to sing praise for the veterans like Thandie Newton, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, etc because you can already expect their performances to be as good as the script will allow them. The most surprising role, however, came from Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges, the mind behind some of the worst music on the radio today. Ironically, Bridges' (I'm NOT calling him Ludicrous) character is a rightist African American car jacker. He constantly pontificates the flaws of white America and its prolonged discrimination against the black man. In one of the better scenes of the movie (out of pure irony alone) Bridges states his distaste for rap music, commenting on how it's diverged from the roots it began with and deteriorated into material that further incriminates his race. Does this sort of music ring a bell with Ludicrous? I think so.Crash is the sort of film that becomes a masterpiece because of its ability to stay in our memory. History's shown us that if a film's quotable then it has a longer shelf life. But beyond quotability, can the film really hold itself up? In Crash's respect, it can. We may sometimes wonder if we're being lectured on racism by Hollywood, but then we're pulled deeper into one of the two or three stories that truly takes hold of us. And for those two or three stories, Crash is entirely worth it.-Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",8,2,8,19 May 2005
Capote," provocative, stark, and powerful
","Capote Reviewed by Sam OsbornRating: 3.5 out of 4Director: Bennett Miller Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper Screenplay: Dan Futterman MPAA Classification: R (some violent images and brief strong language)It seems that once a year we're treated to a performance so staggeringly magnificent that it seems as if the actor's a shoe-in for the Academy's Best Actor prize. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just that actor for 2005. His portrayal of Truman Capote was best described by Telluride Film Festival's Galaxy Theater host as a 'resurrection'. Like Jamie Foxx's Ray, Charlize Theron's Monster, and Nicole Kidman's Virginia Wolfe, Hoffman's Capote is simply devastating. He stated at Telluride that after first accepting the role and watching a recording of Truman Capote he frankly thought he was in over his head. But throughout pre-production he gathered and compiled all of Capote's mannerisms and began practicing them, slowly and truly becoming Truman Capote. And from the first line of Hoffman's dialogue, with his squinched high voice, and self-absorbed tone we know he's succeeded. The actual film is nearly eclipsed by Hoffman's performance. But Director Bennett Miller and an impressive supporting cast manage to keep up with Hoffman's breakneck achievement. Shot in monochromatic, nearly black and white starkness, the film inherits a raw power that builds to its stunning climactic sequence. And although the film drags some in the middle, it finishes strong and leaves us with much to discuss. It's provocative, stark, and powerful. Capote opens with the discovery of a family of four murdered in the small town of Hokum, Kansas in 1953 (don't quote me on the date, please). Coming off his second novel, Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is searching for his next project. Intrigued by the murders, he takes the investigation, agreeing on authoring an article for The New Yorker. Meeting with the town's Sheriff, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), he's met with opposition in the town for his peculiar manner. But his companion on the investigation, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), offsets his homosexuality with terse, homegrown professionalism.Months later the two killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickcock (Mark Pellegrino) are apprehended by Sheriff Dewey and soon sentenced to death. Finding himself increasingly drawn to the story by the sentence, Truman begins personally interviewing the murderers, particularly Perry Smith, at their maximum security prison. Avoiding discussion of the murders themselves, Capote learns more about their lives outside of crime, finding a humanity never put into print before and causing him to extend his article for The New Yorker into the full-length novel, In Cold Blood. It would be the first True Crime novel ever written. His extensive interviews with Smith lead to a strange relationship open to many terms of controversial interpretation. He feels compelled to assist the men and lead the world's opinion away from demonizing headlines. Capote even goes to lengths to find them a decent lawyer for their Supreme Court appeal. The screenplay deals with this controversy between Capote and Smith with beautiful ambiguity. Screenwriter Dan Futterman leaves it to Capote's character to interpret their relationship for the audience, instead of the story doing so in a ham-handed way. And with Hoffman's performance so obsessively complete, the result is magnificent. We oddly understand Capote's pain and his unique love for Perry Smith. He obviously sees the monster inside, but realizes the human entirely. Some even speculated around the festival that Capote fell in love with Smith. It's incredibly profound. But at the same time, Futterman's screenplay relies too much on Capote's obsession with Smith. Audience's in the 50's were terrified by Capote's humanistic realization of the murderer, but now, that sort of True Crime journalism is accepted, and even expected, from murder investigations. This reliance causes the film to linger too long on Capote's build-up interviews before the shocking, twisting confession he needs to finish the novel. Also, audiences have recently grown tired of the biopic, probably because of the last year's heaping pile of them. This mutes the typical drama that occurs in all dramatic biopics, with the character's slow deterioration. Despite these flaws, Capote is still an arresting portrait of a murder. And to go along with this portrait is the complete resurrection of Truman Capote in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The film works to succeed beyond a simple biopic. It also hits on the difficult topic of true crime, delving into the imagination and conscience of a man that killed in cold blood.",8,82,126,7 September 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic.
","Ocean's Thirteen reviewed by Samuel OsbornBack to basics. This seems to be the mantra for Ocean's Thirteen, which marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy. Twelve, the widely despised sequel, made the mistake of getting creative. They changed the recipe and it made the people squeamish. Critics and audiences alike were held utterly aghast. I went back to it earlier this week in preparation for Thirteen. Watch it again, I dare you. It's easily the best of the trilogy. The film is fun, inventive, and loaded with more style than a fashion magazine, which is more than I can say for Ocean's Thirteen. It's not that Thirteen is bad. No no no. It just follows in the shoes of all the other franchise letdowns to have been released so far this Summer. Between Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, Pirates 3, and Ocean's Thirteen, a 24 hour depression hotline will have to be launched to service the needs of millions of disappointed adolescent girls. As in Ocean's Twelve, Thirteen doesn't waste much time with back-story. Director Steven Soderbergh starts the ball rolling at once. His obsessively inventive camera zooms, tracks, dollies and swivels its way into Danny Ocean's life with great immediacy. Longtime friend and criminal companion, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), has fallen ill. His business partner, Willie Bank (Al Pacino), has conned him into financial failure and left him on the brink of death. Bank is posed to open the hottest hotel on the Vegas strip, looking to nail another Five Diamond Award to his pedestal. Without family to assist him, Reuben turns to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew of thieves for help. The idea is revenge, but the sort of revenge that doesn't involve a funeral. Not the sort that 'is best served cold,' as Tarantino would have put it. Danny wants his revenge served steaming in a fajita of clever wit and tact. His plan, hatched with longtime partner, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), is to break the Bank (their pun, not mine). To rob Mr. Bank, they plan to rig each game on his casino's floor for a small window of time. Within the window, with every game rigged, and with thousands of gamblers winning rigged games, Bank could stand to lose a half billion dollars on the night of his hotel's grand opening. As you might have noticed, the Ocean crew has abandoned the foreign vaults and international heists for a second romp in their hometown, Las Vegas. They're doing what they know best. For Steven Soderbergh, he's just doing what worked the first time around. This is fine, even if the execution is uninteresting. All the same motions are processed successfully, except that the heist, maybe due to a strangely passive Pacino delivery, comes off somewhat ho-hum. There's no big reveal at the end. No twist or turning of the tables. The heist either worked or it didn't. And that's all. What you might not have noticed, however, are Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who play the wily love interests of Danny and Rusty. Their characters are all but absent. We find the men commiserating the complexities of relationships between blueprinting their heist, one always finishing the sentence for the other, but Ms. Roberts and Ms. Zeta-Jones never show their faces. This seems to be a shame since the sly push and pull of the romances in the earlier films made for some of the more satisfying sequences. The chemistry worked. But Danny resolves to not involve Tessa (Roberts), saying 'it's not her fight.' Also missing is the humor. All the old jokes return for repeat go-rounds, including the deep male camaraderie of Rusty and Danny, Linus' (Matt Damon) need to impress his thieve parents, the jock-nerd matching of Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), and all the rest of the inside jokes Ocean fans will fondly remember. But new stabs at humor--including a bizarre sub-plot involving the violent strike of a dice factory in Mexico--fall flat. The boys are all fine at the charming and the chemistry as always, but the new material needs work. Julia Roberts posing as Julia Roberts from Ocean's Twelve was brilliant. Such comic invention seems to be on near-empty here. What the Ocean's franchise has going for it, luckily, is its cast. Put Pitt, Clooney and Damon in front of a camera for long enough and something worth watching will happen. They're the charmers of Hollywood. Just having these three on screen all at once makes for compelling film-making. So, in all actuality, it was never possible for Ocean's Thirteen to be flat-out bad. I guess I just expected something flashier; something as mischievous and as neat as Ocean's Twelve. What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic.

The Bourne Ultimatum," this truly is a magnificent flick
","The Bourne Ultimatum reviewed by Samuel OsbornThe auditorium in which I screened The Bourne Ultimatum was filled to capacity and humming comfortably with the floating refreshment of air conditioning when I took my seat. By the film's end, the theatre was still full to capacity but the room's temperature had risen several uncomfortable degrees. The air conditioning was furiously rattling, expelling refrigerated air as efficiently as possible, but it couldn't keep up with the perspiration-inducing intensity that the film had caused our heart-rates to rise to. The film had indirectly made the room hotter. Talk about global warming. Stoic, solemn, and robotic, Jason Bourne returns for his trilogy capper, The Bourne Ultimatum. Less of a continuation and more of an upgrade from The Bourne Supremacy, this third installment, working off of Robert Ludlum's source material again, invents new memories for the amnesiac hero to remember. What used to be Operation Treadstone has now been upgraded to Operation Blackbriar and Mr. Bourne was (of course) involved with it in some corner of his blurry past. As Ultimatum picks up almost immediately after Supremacy left off, Jason Bourne is still on the run, hurdling cops like leapfrog and outrunning the CIA like they were a pack of blind, one-legged cats. Falling in beside the defensive, calculating Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) as the CIA's resident Bourne expert is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen heads up the Blackbriar gang and has hooked a reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), whose exposure stories on Bourne have uncovered confidential information. Because the information concerns Bourne's past and because it's a matter of national security, Ms. Landy, Mr. Vosen, and Mr. Bourne are all on his trail. Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) wastes zero time in mining the action from this storyline. As a filmmaker, his edit points are quick, his camera shaky, and his close-ups constant. He wants realism and he wants his action to appear in real-time. The pseudo-documentary style he's becoming known for is at its best here, muting the spectacle of his stunts to make room for believability in the play-pretend realism. And since it appears many of his stunts were actually coordinated on setand not in front of a computer monitorthe realism is certainly accepted as, well, real. For this reason, The Bourne Ultimatum sprints as a missile for the moon. It's fast and sometimes infuriatingly so, as it rounds plot corners at double-time, leaving us confused and choking on its dust. But all is forgiven when a clever foot-chase is launched, when Bourne kicks down the clutch of a motorcycle, as he hijacks an NYPD squad car, as he leaps from a roof, etc, etc. Luckily his stunts are as loud as they are intelligent. And since Bourne stays generally low-tech with his tricks, he becomes a sort of spy-version of MacGyver. Though I'm not positive as to how essential this installment is to the Bourne legacy. CIA Director Ezra Kramer is discussing the Bourne subject with Ms. Landy early on in the story. Both are unsure of Bourne's importance to the agency, weighing out the possibility of giving up the search altogether. Landy mentions that maybe he's not involved with this particular quarrel at all; that this isn't Bourne's fight. Kramer shrugs, frowns, and says, 'Well, let's keep looking.' It seems even the fictional players are stretching their connection to Bourne to keep this story chugging. And it's true; the Bourne legacy doesn't require this story to be told. This becomes apparent when the same good joke from the second film is repeated twice more in the third; and also when the action set-pieces are nearly the same, if not extended to a more satisfying length. Like I said, this is more of an upgrade than a sequel.But don't think I'm complaining. The intelligence of the screenplay is a damned marvel. To craft the delicate logic of such a complex CIA tale deserves a merit on its own. And so what if it's a formula their running through the Hollywood factory for another go-round? The last film was the best spy film in ages. Just imagine how good this upgraded version is. And technically The Bourne Ultimatum does have its own (very valid) storyline that jet-sets Jason from Morocco to Paris to London to Madrid and finally to good ole' Manhattan. And though what character building that's continued here may not be required viewing for any Bourne enthusiast, the power that David Strathairn most certainly is. Skeletal and sever, Strathairn's Noah Vosen is a formidable needle of a villain. He's human, as all CIA leaders claim to be, but that trait is buried beneath a permafrost mounted by his overwhelming coldness. Strathairn drives this storyline into a realm of quasi-originality, making The Bourne Ultimatum relevant enough for us to enjoy it unabashedly. Because of him we swallow again the tired conceit of Bourne's lost memory and his lingering guilt. We admit that, yeah, this truly is a magnificent flick. Samuel Osborn",9,1,2,5 August 2007
28 Weeks Later," Now this is the way to do a sequel.
","28 Weeks Later reviewed by Samuel OsbornNow this is the way to do a sequel. 28 Weeks Later draws a terrific blueprint for future horror sequels to follow. As usual, it wasn't possible to bring on board the original director (Danny Boyle of Trainspotters fame) and the original writer (Alex Garland) to work on the sequel to 28 Days Later. Instead, the two worked as producers and found an apt replacement: Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Not many saw Fresnadillo's startling feature debut, Intacto, but those who did remember it well. Intacto was compelling, dark, and precisely intelligent. The same adjectives can quite fittingly be glued upon Fresnadillo's second feature film, 28 Weeks Later.The sequel fortunately doesn't require audiences to have seen the original. Days have turned to weeks and the story of Cillian Murphy's survival in posthumous England is finished; not continued maybe because of reasons similar to the non-return of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Garland. Anyway, 28 Weeks Later brings us up to speed with a concise recap of England's resuscitation by United States and NATO forces. The infected (i.e. Zombies) have been cleared of the island and citizens are slowly being allowed entry into what is called District 1. The United States Army inhabits this region, beginning what is a modest allegory running parallel to the present war in Iraq. The first children allowed into District 1 are Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton), rejoining their father after separation due to the infection. Their father, Don (Robert Carlyle), we learn through the grisly opening sequence, is a selfish twerp who abandoned his wife for the sake of his singular survival. But as a peculiarity in his wife's genetic ordering renders her semi-immune to the zombies' virus, the importance of his children's safety becomes a priority to the United States Army. Without giving too much away, this peculiarity sets off a reaction that brings the virus into District 1's core, causing another gory eruption of glorious, limb-tearing zombie violence. The plot, like in any horror sequel, requires the help of a league of peripheral characters to shore up the holes and contrivances it leaves leaking. Along with the children, there are the parents, the scientists, the Army commanders and the snipers for the screenplay to shadow as the infection pierces the confines of District 1. Luckily, Fresnadillo and his writers shrug off most of the symptoms of sequelitis, leaving only a couple glaring plot conveniences that are cause for unintentional laughter. (Explaining these plot hiccups would spoil some hearty surprises). For the most part they manage to find cleverly plausible situations for all these characters to inhabit, each setting off a reaction for the other to deal with, making for a high velocity of smart storytelling. As in the original, the scares come as frequently as the action, with both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Fresnadillo allowing the suspense to open the throttle onto full-fledged chases and action spectacles. There's no reliance on cats jumping out of dark closets and no reliance on nauseating, bucket-filling gore. His scares are clever and always compelling. The camera is continuously hand-held, finding the candid beauty in all the Zombie-fleeing and sometimes also finding honest emotion in the characters' stories. About the same time I screened 28 Weeks Later I was close to finishing Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-winning novel The Road. The book is another riff on post apocalyptic survival, a theme apparently at the forefront of pop culture's psyche. McCarthy rendered his characters subject to their environment, characters without control over their destiny, no plot convenience to allow them redemption. The novel is devastating and soulful, exciting and terrifying. 28 Weeks Later relies on convenience no more so than any other Zombie picture, but the convenience is still contrivance. The film kneels at the feet of spectacle; required to find shortcuts to flare reactions and achieve emotional benchmarks. It is more important that we don't see two zombies killed by the same means; creative extermination is more important than any character evolution. But the comparison is maybe unfair. What is at stake artistically isn't much to 28 Weeks Later. The bottom line is still a zombie and his appetite. Except, both works employ similar devices to conjure realism: Fresnadillo's hand-held camera is the same as McCarthy's non-usage of punctuation. They're clever immersion tricks. Each auteur wants us to believe wholly in their world, zombie or not. 28 Weeks Later is near to such success as The Road, though hampered by its purpose as spectacle. The spectacle, after all is told, is still spectacular, however undeserving it may be. Samuel Osborn",8,0,2,14 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore
","The Hills Have Eyes reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2.5 out of 4Oh the humanity. Or lack thereof. In Alexandre Aja's remake of the 1977 Wes Craven mutant-fest, characters rip, shoot, tear, bite, axe, swing, kick, detonate, jump, and dismember each other to the bitter, very bloody end. Clearly reminiscent of Aja's last picture (the cult fave/box office sinker High Tension) The Hills Have Eyes has its sights, so to speak, directly on the same horror exploitation genre of the 1970's, where the make-up artist played as much a role as the director. And for the most part, Aja's style rings as true as it did with High Tension. But often Hills asks Aja to branch out into the realm of psychological horror; and here, Aja's direction stalls. A family of seven (a smaller family apparently wouldn't produce enough body bags) is well into a cross-country road trip, tugging a streamline trailer through the barren, hilly deserts of New Mexico. They're given a tip by a scruffy gas station attendee that there's a shortcut up the road; a shortcut that will cut hours off the trip. Lo and behold, the family's car is sabotaged eight miles into the desert and they're hunted by a band of mutant miners. No, the premise isn't rolling heads with its originality. But this is a remake, after all. And a Wes Craven remake at that. But before we discount the film, take into account that High Tension's premise was even less inventive, instead making great advantage of the plot's simplicity. And, for once, isn't it nice not to work out the mucky, ghost-girl-in-the-bathtub mystery we've rehashed a dozen times over by now with the recent tsunami wave of Japanese Psych. Horror? 'Character Arc' apparently isn't a term Aja has learned in his young film-making career. But its exclusion here is another refreshing breath amongst the continual spray of blood. His characters are plopped straight into the film fully constructed, not asked by the screenplay to develop and evolve throughout the film, but instead simply react to the situation. The method works to sidestep dialogue segments and long teary monologues that would otherwise slow the plot. Aja keeps the pace sprinting throughout, eager not to let his audience slouch in their seat in what would usually be a lull in the action for other, more conventional, horror films. The contradiction to this method, however, is that the screenplay asks for a lot of screen-time before the killing starts. Aja deals with these segments poorly, often depending on shadowy figures suddenly crossing frame to keep audiences twitchy. These tricks are cheap and without thrill. They rely on jump factor instead of true terror, letting Aja's trademark pacing stumble early on. They also make idiots out of the mutants. The things just look damned silly at times, chomping on the stump of a dog's leg and groaning like a sing-song caveman. But when the heads start rolling, The Hills Have Eyes finally shifts into gear. The first scene of terror (the first attack on the trailer) is a multi-layered set piece of gratuitous violence. It mixes bloody, horrible tragedy with white-knuckled, unsettling suspense. The scene screams at us with a bloody breath, shouting to us that no character is safe and that visceral is only a euphemism for what Aja intends to throw at us throughout. Alexandre Aja is, after all, the master of modern suspense. And from there the film continues strongly, stumbling only on the occasional silliness of the mutant characters and the laughably overwrought orchestral score. Aja sticks to his old tricks, mounting dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore. His thrills are a whirlwind of intensity, dropping us directly into the scenes of violence and giving them a reality that only heightens the cringe of the inevitable. And Aja spares us no gore. There are no cut-aways here. We see every shocking, bloody moment. But after films like Saw II and Hostel, we're a tad desensitized to such gore, calmly swirling and sipping our slurpees as fingers roll about on splintered floors. The Hills Have Eyes was the obvious progression for Alexandre Aja, stepping from cult indie hit to mainstream remake. But Hills isn't a sell-out film, as indie snobs are keen to point out. Aja keeps to his guns with style here. This is the same gritty director from High Tension, just with a worse script and some silly mutants hanging cross-eyed on his back. -www.samseescinema.com",7,0,0,11 March 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," This year, Sundance's morsel of independent goodness is Little Miss Sunshine
","Little Miss Sunshine reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 4 out of 4The Sundance Film Festival has always been a kind of clunky ordeal. I've never attended, granted, but the films that are swept up by the thirsty studios and brought to mainstream audiences are so unreliable that buying a ticket is more like placing a bet. The level of quality control for the festival is a damned roller coaster. On the other hand, since 2004 I've annually handed out a four star review to a film birthed at Sundance (Garden State, Brick). This year, Sundance's morsel of independent goodness is Little Miss Sunshine.The film doesn't smell of the rawness that often lingers behind the ears of other Sundance hits. Little Miss Sunshine runs on quirk and maturity, often revealing itself to contain an honest sense of experience and a deep understanding of the mechanics of middle-class family life.In its most basic form, Little Miss Sunshine is an awkward travelogue, documenting the zany cross-country road trip a family makes to put their daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), into the annual Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. But the travelogue mold is malleable and shifts to fit the stories of each family member as they all slowly crumble. Greg Kinnear plays Richard, a champion of his own nine step self-help program who's struggling to find an audience. He's obsessed with winners and disgusted by losers, the only two types of people in his world, and forces his family to endure endless diatribes on the everyday applications of his nine steps. Sheryl (Toni Collette), his wife, seems weary of the infamous nine steps, but endures it if it'll put food on her table. The seats at her table have recently increased, though, with the induction of Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) who's arrived back from the hospital after an attempted suicide. Frank was the former leading Marcel Proust scholar until a vicious love triangle with two other men resulted in his romantic betrayer becoming the leading Proust scholar and Frank finding himself unemployed. He mixes well with Dwayne, the fifteen year-old son who's decided to take a vow of silence because of Nietzsche. Dwayne writes on a piece of paper to Frank, 'I hate everyone,' and, looking back at him, Frank seems to understand. Functioning as the bright and bubbly center of the whole debacle is the seven year-old daughter, Olive, who's beautifully naive to the failures of her family, innocently bouncing along to her own lovely rhythm. Her talent at the beauty pageant will be dancing, and her crude, absurd Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is always helping with her mysterious rehearsal.Things start bad at home, but only get worse on the road. And the farther they get, the more dreary the family's situation becomes. Soon their very foundation has fallen out from beneath them and all they have is what's in front of them and what's in front of them, for better or worse, is the Little Miss Sunshine contest. And as the family loses more and falls further away from Richard's central theme of 'winning', the more the Little Miss Sunshine contest becomes the family's very livelihood.But amongst all the sadness and turmoil, the screenplay holds tight to its sense of humor. Even while dissecting emotions of the most harrowing sort: depression, sorrow, suicidal anger, hate--it never once fails to find quirk in the normal and delight in the ordinary. Other family portraits that delve into dysfunction and honesty leave us phoning a shrink and asking for samples of Prozac. Little Miss Sunshine wants nothing to do with lulling us into a depressed stupor.Abigail Breslin, the little girl who plays Olive, is unexplainably wonderful. Her type of strange is so cute that it could be bottled up and sold for billions. She could very well be the elixir of youth because only one look at her dancing to her headphones and wearing a sweatband and cowboy boots, closing her eyes to better feel the music behind huge, round glasses, and it's enough to let us forget all the complexities and intricate annoyances of adulthood. I don't mean to go on about Miss Breslin, as the other actors are nearly as strong and all deserve special mention, but Olive really does steal the show.Little Miss Sunshine strikes on many of the sad, ornery notes of realism in middle-class family life. Things break down and so too, it seems, that life breaks down with it. For this family, life seems to be escaping them and all they've left to do is to not let it escape their Olive. It's a mad dash of a picture; one with a pulse and great humor that muffles the heartbreak of the world. And pain like that can only be muffled by sunshine.Copyright ©2006 Sam Osborn.

Disturbia," A Competent Re-Working of the Rear Window Story for the Modern Generation
","Disturbia reviewed by Samuel OsbornTalking to Dylan McDermott about The Messengers a couple months ago, the topic of remakes was brought up. I asked if people would write his film off as an Asian knock-off of Hitchcock's The Birds. He said, maybe cynically, in response: 'Unfortunately, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't remember The Birds. Nobody cares. The trouble with making movies is that every ten years it's a whole new generation. It's all about getting the teenagers in the theatre. The thirteen year old girl rules this world.' And so now we have Disturbia, a PG-13 remake-in-spirit of Hitchcock's Rear Window. But before we all turn the page and look for a better movie to see, allow me to clarify any misconception. The target demographic may still be the thirteen year old girl, but Disturbia is a competent re-working of Rear Window for the modern generation. Jimmy Stewart had only binoculars and a telescopic lens to perform his long-range detective work. Shia LaBeouf has a cell phone, an iPod, a digital camcorder, live video feeds, and the internet on his side. Technology is this generation's Cultural Revolution and it's shifted the way we are sensitive to those around us. Disturbia is hyper-aware of this development and employs it smartly towards a story that is valid and justified in its re-telling. Sentenced to three months of house arrest for the summer between his Junior and Senior year at High School, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) is bored out his noggin. His mother's discontinued his Itunes account, cancelled his Xbox Live subscription and sliced the wire powering his bedroom television. The punishment arises out of Kale's raging outbreak at school that rounded out the third in a three strike penal system. Charges were pressed and Kale got slapped with an ankle bracelet that has the cops skidding up to his driveway any time he leaves the 100-foot radius surrounding his home. The only thing distracting him is the perpetually swimming next-door neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer), just moved-in from the city. Kale schedules his day around her swimming and yoga cycles, microwaving a bowl of popcorn and lounging in a chair with his good friend the binoculars to his eyes. She catches him one day and mutual teenaged horniness welds a friendship spent trading binos spying on the neighbors. Soon they notice some striking correlations between Mr. Turner (David Morse) across the street and the unidentified stalker lifting women from the city. Wild conspiracies are formed and soon they've launched an impromptu control center in Kale's house, playing detectives with modern technology filling their holsters. Shia LaBeouf, the young actor steadily separating himself from his Disney Channel origins, joins Justin Chatwin (The Invisible), Adam Brody (In the Land of Women), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (The Lookout) in a gaggle of promising young male actors with medium-sized movies releasing this month. He finishes a close second to the moody-faced, brilliant Gordon-Levitt, but nevertheless turns in a compelling argument for casting directors to place him in more leading roles for the future. The rest of the characters are also cast exceptionally well, particularly Kale's parents played by Matt Craven and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss. Director DJ Caruso took on the ambitious, potentially pretentious project apparently without any intention of mimicking Mr. Hitchcock. His style is sometimes inspired, but mostly mainstream. The opening father-son fishing sequence is expectedly touching, lit warmly and with a pleasant orchestral score purring along with the river. The script, penned by Christopher Landon and Red Eye veteran Carl Ellsworth, pulls most of the weight cinematically. Much of our belief in Kale's character hinges on the realism of his pain over the death of his father. One scene is taken to build the connection between father and son (the fishing scene, incidentally), and another scene to kill the father off. Landon and Ellsworth ace the fishing scene with the kind of easy dialogue that's organic enough to not set us off to the father's impending doom. Finishing the one-two punch, Mr. Caruso plays his singular card of directorial pizazz and scares the hell out of us with a cruel scene of vehicular misfortune. The rest of the film finds Mr. Caruso leaning heavily on the screenplay which switches rapidly between Kale and Ashley's romance and the terror across the neighborhood. The romance, though charming at times, is stilted with glib dialogue for Ashley. The writing pair apparently weren't too popular with the ladies in high school and understand them only well enough to make Ashley into an unrealistically seductive vixen. She isn't as human as the other characters, crippling the romantic segments significantly. And as in Red Eye, just as the tension mounts to a level of satisfying discomfort, the story unravels into an extended climax of action-film vapidity. But Disturbia works aside from all the moving parts of its strange device as a spiritual Rear Window remake. The film finds the colorful nature of a teenaged summer spent trapped in suburbia. The obsessions and the romances are mutually desperate and, in the same way, intensely gratifying. What you find holed away in a tract-home existence at seventeen, whether it's a murderer or a first love, is something, anything to hold on to. Samuel Osborn",7,1,7,16 April 2007
Ratatouille," Pixar Redeems Itself with Ratatouille
","Ratatouille reviewed by Samuel OsbornLast year, when penning out the review for Pixar's last film, Cars, I wrote, 'Let's decide that this can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one.' I finished with a suggestion for 'Pixar to go sit in the corner where it can hide beneath its dunce cap.' Well Pixar can come out now, because it has redeemed itself with Ratatouille. Pixar's return path to the throne is led by the likes of a sewer rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt). Remy has a taste for the finer things in life, shunning the scavenged garbage horded by his father and the rat colony. He steals away to the kitchen and the French chef, Gusteau's, cookbook, 'Anyone Can Cook', whenever possible, sleuthing gourmet cooking in secret. This, however, leads to the rightful owner of the borrowed kitchen discovering Remy red-handed with the cooking utensils. Havoc is wreaked and suddenly a rifle appears, ousting Remy and his rat colony from their country living for good. But in the chaos of evacuation, Remy is separated from his family and marooned off to the city of Paris, popping out of the sewer to arrive at the very restaurant of his most admired chef, Gusteau. Here the tales of Remy the rat and Linguini the garbage boy (Lou Romano) intertwine. On Linguini's first day at Gusteau's, he collides with the soup pot, sloshing half of it to the ground. Before any of the chefs notice, he starts refilling the pot with any and every ingredient within reach. Admiring the kitchen from his minute, mouse-sized hiding place, Remy witnesses Linguni's frankensoup. He maneuvers to the scene by means of acrobatic rodent scurrying and puts his culinary instincts to work. It isn't long before Linguini notices, watching as Remy dices at vegetables and tears at the herbs, sprinkling them with zeal into the now delicious soup. An idea is hatched between the two after the night is through. If Remy could somehow cook for Linguini in secret, then Remy could play out his dream of becoming a gourmet chef and Linguini could hold his job. Of course, as when Mr. Incredible attempted to relive the superhero glory days in secret, hiding a sewer rat in the confines of a gourmet kitchen is no easy task. Though Mr. Incredible was dealing with much more weighty circumstances for an animated film, which is the limb found lacking in Ratatouille. The Incredibles, the animated benchmark in mastery and Writer/Director Brad Bird's first attempt with Pixar, handled more solemn themes than the chasing of one's dreams. Its characters juggled middle-aged crises and marital boredom. They felt trapped by a beaming postcard family. Such themes appeared in Little Children, where adultery and sexual catharsis reigned king. But Mr. Bird managed to channel such discontent into a whirling, comic book world of superheroes. The colors, adorable animation, and Oscar-winning sound jostled the little audiences into soaring contentment, while the adults were offered an honest, smart story to sink into. Ratatouille isn't lacking in either of these categories, as the animation is as adorable as ever, the sound as bombastically rousing as before, and the story clever and humble. But it's the maturity of its themes that's absent. This isn't a middle-aged crisis; this is a rat playing puppeteer to a freckled teenage chef. But disappointment over Ratatouille not surpassing the likes of the best in animated film-making is hardly a criticism at all. It very nearly is a compliment. Mr. Bird has proved that he has a supreme knack for finding the animated in the droll. Ratatouille could very easily be filmed using live-action counterparts. Think Garfield in the kitchenick. But by dreaming up the entire affair through the computed neurons of CGI animation, a liveliness is achieved that would otherwise be ignored. Mr. Bird has made rats adorable and French cuisine not annoyingly pretentious. Such feats are magnanimous. And along the way he managed to tell a warm tale of friendship, romance (not between the rat and the boy, mind you), and the joy of cooking. -Samuel Osborn",8,6,13,13 June 2007
Batman Begins," I'm happy to finally be satisfied by a Batman flick
","rating: 3 out of 4Director: Christopher Nolan Cast: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson Screenplay: Christopher Nolan, David S. Goyer MPAA Classification: PG-13 (intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements)Batman has finally caught a break. Through five mediocre films the poor guy's stumbled around without even a superpower on his side. I mean, come on, Batman's just a buff guy in leather. He's one step above an S&M enthusiast. But now, with Batman Begins, ole' bat-ears has found his limelight. This film chronicles Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) rise to power in the New York copycat city Gotham to become the ever-popular Batman. We're brought through his rise from an East Asian prison to the mountaintop sanctuary, training with Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson). There we're told of Bruce's childhood trauma that fuels his hatred for injustice. We're then spun along to Gotham City, where Bruce is looking to save the corrupt city from the clutches of the brutal mob boss, Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). But when Falcone's brought down on charges of drug smuggling, he pleads for insanity and actually wins. This brings Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) into the picture. His examinations of numerous Falcone thugs have led to successful insanity pleas in Gotham's courtroom. Something smells fishy to Bruce. Or is that Batty? And with Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), assistant to the DA and childhood friend to Bruce, burrowing herself into danger with the Dr. Crane case, Batman's got his hands full. Much of Batman Begins success must be attributed to the brilliant star studded cast. I couldn't imagine a better actor behind the mask of Batman than Christian Bale. He brings an ideal mix of vengeance and humanity to a character that's hasn't felt quite right until now. Cillian Murphy as usual also does well. His role as Dr Crane/Scarecrow hits on the kind of evil bad guy that would usually be filled by such an actor as Jack Nicholson. And Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Ken Watanabe, Katie Holmes and Tom Wilkinson all fill in roles that, although are smaller than these caliber of actors are used to, play them as perfectly as humanly able. Director Christopher Nolan is most known for, as of right now, his work in Memento. The backwards time mystery masterpiece has been elevated to a kind of cult classic/critics choice. But now, almost undoubtedly, Nolan will be known as the man that made Batman work. The comic book hero has never looked so good. Most impressive is Nolan's work with his film's flawless atmosphere. Batman Begins is steeped to spilling point in atmosphere; with the perpetual nighttime, overtly common rain showers, and creepy dark alleys, this atmosphere is what brings Batman to a different level of Comic Book genre films than, oh say, Spiderman. Spiderman's world is a geek fanboy's dream. Sunshine spilling from a New York horizon with our nerdy hero staring off from his bedroom window to that of his first love across the street, enamored by the way the sun reflects off her golden blonde hairetc. Batman Begins plays an entirely different tune. This film is spectacularly dark. Gothic (no pun intended, by the way) is really the best way to describe it. We're presented with a man who's trained himself to embrace fear and use it against his enemies. Bruce Wayne is a guy that wants revenge on those that degraded his father's city to the dredges it is today. These grim overtones work to help flesh out what is quite a complex and surprisingly engaging storyline.There is, however, one very disappointing aspect of Batman Begins that I can't help but mention. In a comic book film we all know the best parts are going to be the action sequences. But here Batman, or rather Christopher Nolan, finally disappoints. The film resorts to cheap and overrated quick cuts that dizzy us into distraction instead of letting us actually witness the action. The fights become nonsensical and frankly boring when we're only allowed to glimpse half-second cuts at a time. This ruins much of what could be a very stimulating aspect of the film. Luckily, the rest of the film does not disappoint. Surprisingly, the most interesting aspect of Batman Begins is when it slows down to let us follow the story and look further into the world Nolan has so meticulously created. What I found interesting about the film's story is that it made an effort to incorporate more aspects of Gotham City than simply Batman vs. Baddie. We're presented with a tricky system of corrupt judges, cops, and lawyers; where all these are dealt with and strangely dissected using Rachel Dawes' sub-plot and an under-appreciated straight cop named James Gordon (Gary Oldman). We're also offered insight into Wayne Enterprises by way of Fox's (Morgan Freeman) sub-plot as the director of the Applied Sciences division where Bruce finds all his equipment. And lastly, the history and proud lineage of Bruce is played out by Michael Caine's character Alfred. In doing all this, Nolan looks beyond the simple comic book formula and succeeds in immersing us deeper into his Gotham City, making his crime trail storyline affect us more than we originally thought.I'm happy to finally be satisfied by a Batman flick. It's been a long time coming and with a few straggles aside, Batman's finally got something to look forward to.",8,1,2,15 June 2005
Cars," a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid
","Cars rating: 1.5 out of 4It was bound to happen. After one-upping itself over and again with pioneers and masterworks like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, there had to be a stumble. Pixar's track record couldn't be that good. We just didn't expect Pixar to take a face-plant into a hot puddle of carburetor fluid. If an infant's picture book was the idea Pixar had in mind when they birthed this project, then maybe John Lasseter and his team deserve applause. Their film works on this level, refusing to smarten up or hunker down on any ounce of maturity. The fundamental error, perhaps, is that it asks us to relate to automobiles. Not just a world where automobiles keep their speech skills secret a la Toy Story, but a world made up entirely of cars. Even the flies swarming the light bulbs are VW Beetles. I can relate to superheroes, I can relate to fish, I can relate to monsters, I can even relate to bugs, but a machine that looks like my childhood Hot Wheels? Sorry. Giving a car googly-eyes and bumper lips does not make it human. And for that matter, the cars don't act human. The personalities of these characters mirror most of the characters I remember from a babysitting experience years ago, when I watched 'Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends'. They're broad and smeared with stereotype; kind, easy traits that reflect Cars' story.It's the tale of Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) and his time spent in Radiator Springs, a backwater town that rests on the grave of Route 66. Stranded there a week before his big showdown with Chick Hicks (voice of Michael Keaton) and The King (voice of Richard Petty), Lightning gets himself mixed up with the locals and thrown into jail. The mayor of the town, Doc Hudson (voice of Paul Newman) and the prosecutor, Sally the Porsche (voice of Bonnie Hunt), sentence him to a road pavement job that will requires five days of work. Lightning's arrogant and huffy, steamed that he's stuck in a ghost town with the likes of Mater (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) the rusty tow-truck, and Ramone (voice of Cheech Marin) the custom paint-job fanatic. But his stay turns therapeutic once he softens up to Sally and finds there's more to a car's life than endorsements.Cars is, well, just very silly. Its story surrounds a life lesson, which is a formula that, when put to Pixar, stands a chance. Not a great chance, as central lessons tend to dilute otherwise human stories, but a Pixar-sized chance nonetheless. But the lesson turns infantile and the film moot, sullied probably by our enormous expectations. This stuff will work fine for your toddler, and maybe distract a wide-eyed nine year-old, but trying to compare it to The Incredibles is the only tear-jerking moment you'll have in the theatre. The art can be pretty, sure; but these days digital beauty is standard. And paired with the plastic-esquire car animations, the lovely backgrounds mean even less.Luckily for Pixar, their films aren't known for being Thomas the Tank Engine look-a-likes. Cars, let's decide, can be Pixar's single use of the Get Out of Jail Free card. Now they're back to square one. Their revenues probably won't be dented by this hiccup, since everyone's still giddy from The Incredibles. But when Ratatouille (Pixar's next project) is released next Summer, the film will have its share of skeptics. Ratatouille is headed up by Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles--and hardly anyone from this Cars hack-job is on the projectso we can at least expect a move to square two. For now, however, Pixar can go sit in the corner, hiding beneath its dunce cap.",3,25,148,21 May 2006
The Number 23," It's a fine two-act movie. But that third act
","The Number 23 reviewed by Samuel OsbornPsychological thrillers are a tough gig. You need an ending. The build-up, the suspense, the rising action, all that squirmy paranoia, it's easy enough to build. It's the ending that's the tricky part. Films like Memento do it right; films like Fight Club, too. Their twist, the unraveled knot of anxiety that splays out in explanation and relief, comes with another bulge of knots; it leaves you breathless and troubled, disturbed if you're lucky. But without the ending, without the final flick in the nose and punch in the gut, a psycho-thriller is just a bunch of untied shoelaces. This is the affliction born to The Number 23. It's a fine two-act movie. But that third actwith the climax all flaccid and the end a noiseless wheeze, it leaves us with that let-down feeling of something promising turned instantly to a sham. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say that it's summed up by the word 'typical.' Commonplace is the ending. And commonplace is somewhere The Number 23 has no business being.The rest of the film is a good one; a fine looking few rolls of celluloid, in fact. Jim Carrey plays the lead, still rounding off the sharper edges of his comedy and reminding us happily of Tom Hanks' move from comedy to drama. He's a hopelessly likable actor paired gracefully with Virginia Madsen, who plays Carrey's wife and mother to his teenage son. The family lives comfortably under Agatha's (Madsen) cake shop and Walter's (Carrey) job as an animal control officer. The paranoia enters like a whisper, as feckless and unassuming as director Joel Schumacher can stand. The famously melodramatic director is often thought of as the second-string choice for any theatrical film-making, just behind the dramatic grandmaster Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!). Schumacher revels in colors and camera tricks, over-saturating and under-saturating his images until they're hardly recognizable. The effect here is controlled, but not empty of pizazz. The book Agatha finds (or does it find her?) when waiting for Walter outside a used bookshop is 'The Number 23' by Topsy Kretts. Walter opens the novel on his day off, gorging himself on the minutiae of its hardboiled detective hero and fantasizing himself in the lead role. Schumacher indulges Walter further, fancying 'The Number 23's' Detective Fingerling as a slippery-haired Mr. Carrey in a cheap suit and a dry growl. Much of the story is actually told within the novel itself, with Fingerling getting lost in the numerology surrounding the number 23 and slipping towards the inevitability of murder. Back in reality, Walter is finding uncanny resemblances between Fingerling and himself. It's as if, he once mentions, the author knows him better than he does. Agatha writes it off as an effect of good literature, but reconsiders when she finds scribbled numerology on Walter's arm one morning with the underlined words 'Kill Her.' He's begun to see the number everywhere. It's in his name, his social security number, his birth date, and even the day he and Agatha first met. His paranoia, once a whisper, is now a screech, and he worries for the safety of his own family. Stop there. Just stop the film, put down your popcorn and walk away. Because that's as good as The Number 23 will get. The bouncy humor, the family drama, the rise in paranoia, the fascination in 23, it all works up until here. But it's as if Screenwriter Fernley Phillips lost the thread. It was unraveling with speed and machismo, promising to tower upwards in a great final disturbance. But instead it turned inward and ricocheted blindly backwards. Instead of opening up the throttle and letting the number have real meaning and significance, Phillips turns the plot inward and shells up the climax with a muffled grunt.

X-Men: The Last Stand," The X-Men just aren't as fun as they used to be
","X-Men: The Last Stand reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2.5 out of 4As the X-Men series enters its final chapter, it reminds me a little of the series finale for a long-running serial drama on primetime network television. Main characters have to be buried and memorialized at tired funerals, unalterable twists put to a plot never to be picked up again, and a volley of answers laid into the patchwork of secrets and questions the previous episodes presented. But as in all series finales, there are too many answers that must be handled with directorial TLC and not enough time to fit them all in. So, often answers are plopped in front of us or sloppily dealt with, leaving the taste of Matrix Revolutions in our mouths. But this isn't the main fault line cracking up The Last Stand; the X-Men just aren't as fun as they used to be. The formula hasn't much changed since the last time mutants populated your box office, but it seems the talky-talk side of the X-Men story has worn thin. The previous two talked quite enough, grinding the film to a halt to inject a dose of story when necessary; but then the film was smart enough to ramp back up the excitement and continue with its Juggernaut blast of superhero action. The X-Men puppeteers should have by now realized we don't come to these pictures for their intellectual draw. There's no thickening of emotional binds we have to the mutants with each iteration of the X-Men tale. But Director Brett Ratner and his drove of technical assistants trudge on through a screenplay fattened by an overstretched storyline that draws such transparent parallels to racism, generalization, and most of the recent political issues that call for picketers. And Screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg continue X-Men's tradition of chunky character development, with generous dips into a sour sauce of conventional storytelling. The X-Men movies have never been adept at handling story, but more than make up for it with tremendous set-pieces of comic book action. Does anyone remember the opening sequence in X2 with Nightcrawler? That scene alone was worth price of admission. There's nothing to match that excitement here, and we're left with many solemn discussions on the future of Mutanity (like humanity, see?).The story itself continues the tug-of-war struggle between Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) as they fight to harness the power of the mutant population. Here they're fighting for control of Leech (Cameron Bright), a mutant whose power is to rob fellow mutants of their supernatural abilities, turning them back into ho-hum humans. The government has harnessed Leech's power and formed a vaccine to 'cure' the mutant race. Dr. Xavier and Magneto have different opinions on the subject, and now fight on different sides of an inevitable war between Mutants and Humans. Spicing up things is Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whose powerful dual personality, Phoenix, has become unstoppable in a mood swingy, pre-menstrual sort of way. There are new characters, like Beast (Kelsey Grammar), representing the Mutant race in the White House, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), which is pretty self-explanatory, Kitty (Ellen Page), who can walk through walls and Angel (Ben Foster), who's sprouted feathery, white wings. The filmmakers have gotten progressively more whimsical with their mutants, springing dozens of other characters with fascinating abilities. But only in the final climactic scenes do their powers get put to use. For all its explosive excitement and impressive CGI images, this final battlefield sequence is the only true action scene in the entire film. The rest of the film's action leads up to this ending, refusing to participate in any of the set-piece thrills the previous two films contained. This results in a pitiful downplay of some more intriguing characters, especially the potentially-iconic Angel. Although The Last Stand plunks down as many answers as its 104 minute running length allows, if you stay through the end credits, you'll be treated to the most tantalizing of cliffhangers. At the midnight screening last night, as the cliffhanger moment was revealed, people shouted 'What are they doing?! It's over!' My friend leaned out and said, 'They're making money, people. They're making money.' -www.samseescinema.com",6,0,1,26 May 2006
Shrek the Third," Same old Shrek, for better or worse
","Shrek the Third reviewed by Samuel OsbornSilly green ogres apparently apply to the mantra, 'Some things never change.' Shrek has returned for his third outing, garbed in all the same bells and whistles that made the previous two episodes go down all fuzzy and easy. It's a nursery rhyme told in the time signature of a Top 100 pop song: clean and catchy, cute and simple, clever and empty. What worked in the first was segued to the second. And what worked in the second was bridged to the third. It's a continuation and a repeat effort, showcasing little more than hollow gumption towards the usage of puns, scatological gags, referential pop culture digs, and the successful artistry of a million well-positioned pixels. The pill goes down easy and the magic it works is enjoyable enough. But its luster has gone and the originality flattened. Like I said, some things never change. Shrek is still Shrek. But how long until that charm dims? After marrying the princess and meeting the parents, Shrek (Mike Meyers) is now asked to be king. Far Far Away has lost its toad ruler (John Cleese) and the next in the royal line is our fat green ogre. Declining the offer on terms of being horribly unqualified for the job, Shrek is informed that after himself, a boy named Arthur (Justin Timberlake) is due to be king. I guess the list of Grimm and Disney characters to spoof had worn thin, requiring the Shrek writing-team to dig into Arthurian lore. Such myth is applied to the world of medieval high school, with Arthur (here known as Artie) playing victim to Lancelot's (John Krasinski) muscled jock glory. Guinevere (Latifa Ouaou) plays a cheerleader; the sort of girl whose vocabulary consists of 'whatever' and 'totally.' In the shadowy background lurks Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), bitter about having lost his shot at the throne, now rallying the villains of the fairy tale kingdom for a final showdown between the palace walls of Far Far Away. The Shrek franchise has never been one for sincerity. Its shtick is the sly punch-line; the clever in-joke that only the adults get. With its for-the-whole-family-humor and animated renditions of popular rock tunes, Shrek spreads the vulture wings of a massive demographic, mainstreaming itself for mass consumption. Here the tactic is most obviously at play. Sincerity is wholly lacking in its empty story, which plays most like the spoof of a Greatest Hits mix tape of fairy tale characters. There's a point when Snow Whitein the Shrek world, an obnoxious, caddy brunettesings the original tune from the classic Disney picture. The old recording, scratchy and ancient, is used, reminding us of the sweetness and simplicity of those pictures. Animation didn't used to be so sly, so impatient for the next joke. Shrek is fine, all three episodes of it. It's fun, colorful and bouncily easy to digest. Filled with fiber, let's say. But it has all the viscosity of a stand-up routine. The story itself means nothing, let alone the characters. It's the jokes hidden inside, tucked in all the shadows, that matter. Shrek the Third, as Guinevere would say 'is, like, so totally whatever.'Samuel Osborn",6,0,1,21 May 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," a harmless dry heave of a sequel
","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer Reviewed by Samuel OsbornIt's sad enough when a sequel fails to live up to the quality of its predecessor. But it's an entirely different tragedy when the predecessor, in this case the first Fantastic Four movie, contained no hint of quality to begin with. Its sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer, is not just unnecessary, but achieves a woeful demotion from the comic book regurgitation of the original. That's right, it's even worse.Besides the obvious financial potential of a Fantastic Four sequel, the only plausible reason for Rise of the Silver Surfer to be granted the greenlight by its studio is by way of its title character. The Silver Surfer (voiced occasionally by Laurence Fishburne) is admittedly pretty awesome. He careens from outer space as a meteor into Earth's atmosphere, zipping around the globe and impacting the land with various craters in preparation for the planet's destruction. Never mind his humane intentions and fluffy nice guy interior; the Silver Surfer is a certifiable badass. Composed entirely of candied CGI goodness, he looks like the figurine version of Terminator 2's metallic T-1000 propped up on a chrome surfboard. His sequences are the only fantastic thing about this film, making his supreme lack of appearances all the more disappointing. Instead, we're given the likes of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who still leads the contest for most stupidly overwrought name for a villain. Von Doom soaks up screen time like a diseased sponge, blocking out any opportunity for the Silver Surfer to perform his titular rise.Returning to save the world from interplanetary surfers are the aforementioned four. Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) again leads the spandexed quartet, now mysteriously engaged to Jessica Alba, playing Sue Storm. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans return as the big orange rock, Ben Grimm, and the cocky flamer, Johnny Storm. Each actor's performance lives up to the mediocrity of the first Fantastic go-round, with the exception of Michael Chiklis whose delivery has become as lifeless as the rocks he's composed of. Ms. Alba also loses some of her conviction, which probably is just an effect of the difficulty involved in manipulating a face lathered in entire bottles of golden bronzing. Anyway, the ride isn't very lengthy at a cool 89 minutes and thus can't irritate to its full potential. It's a harmless dry heave of a sequel, amazing sometimes in its technical prowess and also amazing in its complete ineptitude for telling a story. I'd make a sly finishing pun about how un-fantastic Rise of the Silver Surfer is, but I'm sure by now the point is made. This film is bad. Samuel Osborn",4,2,5,20 June 2007
Blood Diamond," Too Distracted by its own Message
","Blood Diamond reviewed by Sam OsbornFilms should be made to tell a story. For me, that's their only function, and it's a function that's beautiful and endless. A message film is a hindered film because it never keeps its eye on the ball. It's like taking a class where your professor is Miss Universe; your attention is directed to the right object, but never for the right reasons. In order for us to believe in a message, we must first believe in the story it has to tell. The message in Blood Diamond, of course, has something to do with diamonds. The title, a delicious double entendre, refers to the pink hue of the diamond in question, and also to the blood spilled in trying to obtain it. The obtainer is Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Zimbabwean diamond smuggler with a South African background. His charge is to hunt the diamonds down, buy them for cheap, and hump them across African state lines to sell them for an illegal profit to Van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a two-faced diamond retailer mirroring the real-life De Beers. The diamonds involved in this trade are known as conflict diamonds, since the groups that initially profit from the sale are warlords and rebel groups who force slaves to do the requisite mining for them. Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a father stolen from wife and three kids to work as a diamond miner, sifting rocks from gems in a muddy West African river. He stumbles upon the blood diamond, burying it just before a happenstance government raid puts him in a Freetown jail. Also in this jail is Danny Archer, having been caught smuggling diamonds under the skin of a goat along Sierra Leonean border. When Danny gets word that Solomon knows of the diamond's hiding place, he spins a deal to bail both of them from prison. And because Danny owes a certain Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) some lost diamonds and Solomon's still missing his family, the two have reason to go diamond-hunting. Jennifer Connelly works her way into the story as Maddy Bowen, the frustrated journalist looking for the inside scoop on the conflict diamond trade.DiCaprio turns in a satisfyingly ironic performance here, seeming to exploit all the reasons people despised him in the first place. He plays a would-be fraternity brother who seems to have been accidentally born into African violence. He's an overconfident prick with just enough oil-slick charm and big-bulk intensity for us not to hate him. Connelly doesn't have much to work with, granted, but her sympathetic maternal stares at Hounsou could have been laced with more condescension. But then again, maybe not. Hounsou hammers out an affecting role from the little he has to work with. The man is best when screaming and barreling through in a blood-soaked fury, and Director Zwick gives him numerous reasons to do so. Zwick's direction is lively and strong, giving Blood Diamond a much undeserved umph. But the screenplay devolves its characters into the African sob acts we've seen played out on the Hallmark Channel before: Connelly's American journalist looking to make a difference, DiCaprio's heartless cum last-second humanitarian, and Hounsou's sad African from infomercial land. And as many lines as they can spew on about the ignorance of certain first-world nations and the schmaltzy National Geographic articles cranked out each month, their own uselessness is always underlined by the film's paucity of power. The story turns like clockwork, all mechanical and repeated, because the characters seem always on the verge of looking straight into camera, asking for a tax-deductible donation to save the victims of the conflict diamond trade.

Grindhouse," Hits like a Spiked Hammer to the Joy Bone
","Grindhouse reviewed by Samuel OsbornTo see Grindhouse is to agree to a day spent at the movies. Me and my two movie-going compadres returned from the 192 minute double-feature and decided promptly upon three-hour naps. Between the film and the effect it has on your body, seeing Grindhouse is a full day excursion. So now I'm wiping the sleep from my eyes, hunched over the laptop keyboard racking my brain for adjectives to explain this whackjob picture. For now let's just keep things simple and say Grindhouse is, if nothing else, a damn fine way to spend a day. It's only sensible to discuss the pictures separately since each is a standalone, full-length feature of a different ilk. To those who've somehow avoided The Weinstein Company's marketing blitz to promote this thing, Grindhouse is double-feature throwback to the seventies theatres of the same name. A person would buy one ticket and see two cheap, gory, exploitative romps in a row, divided only by a round of commercials and previews for coming attractions. And so indie-film legends Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi series, Sin City) and Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) have teamed up to each make their own version of a typical entry into the grindhouse circuit, complete with missing reels, overlapping dialogue, phony commercials, and fake previews authored by directors Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects), Eli Roth (Hostel), and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead). Rodriguez's zombie picture, Planet Terror, hugs to the grindhouse tradition tighter than Tarantino's entry. It runs on a standard zombie storyline and works like a Land of the Dead that has enough humor to not take itself seriously. Bruce Willis has a cameo as the surprise villain, cast for the sole reason of looking irrationally badass, with other main players being Freddy Rodriguez as the frowning, muscular hero and Rose McGowan who most will recognize from the film's ads as 'the chick with an effing gun for a leg.' The film plays as well as any Rodriguez picture, but could stand to have a sizeable chunk removed. Mr. Rodriguez seems attuned, like Tim Burton and The Coen Brothers, to making films that are goodbut only good. Not sharpened up enough to write something truly great, Rodriguez tends to put out solid pictures that leave something to be desired. In a different situation this would hardly go noticed, but up against Tarantino's Death Proof, Planet Terror is plainly inferior. Of course, Tarantino doesn't exactly play by the rules. Though Death Proof occasionally remembers its grindhouse intentions, throwing in a stray missing reel and poorly edited bit here and there, Tarantino gets wrapped up in all his glowing indulgences at every turn. Part slasher film, part fictionalized episode of 'Jackass,' and part road-rage fantasy, Death Proof is a happily uneven mess of giddy amusement. It's brilliant, but impossibly so. By its end, any semblance of a story has dissolved into an empty husk of fun; like taking a straight-shot of entertainment.There was a story to begin with, involving Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) stalking women to destroy beneath his 'death proof' carwhich replaces the knife as the Slasher film's weapon of choice. But after being on the backend of several rounds of Tarantino's absurd talent for writing dialogue, it's time to switch gears into car chase mode. The much-hyped chase--which Tarantino has reported hoping to be in the top three car-chases of all timesheds all progression of its previous story to make way for another straight-shot of adrenaline to the face. But again, maybe Tarantino's cheating. Without giving away the twist, there's an added element to the segment that makes the chase not only fast, but also tense enough to make your palms bleed sweat. And when this extended scene ends in all its brutal majesty, Death Proof is over. To be honest, grindhouse theatres came and went before my time. But what Tarantino and Rodriguez have assembled, in all its previews, features, and commercials, is a strange device for extreme pleasure. The films shouldn't logically work, especially Tarantino's, but they do, and furiously so. It hits like a spiked hammer to the joy bone and leaves you on a high. And like any true experience at the movies, that high doesn't fade for the rest of the day. Samuel Osborn",10,1,6,8 April 2007
The Descent," when you can anticipate every scare in a scary movie, it stops being scary
","The Descent reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 2 out of 4The Descent is a film about the things that go bump in the night. Only, in a cave it's always night and the things that go bump also slither, crawl, leap, tear, and munch on your very intestines. It's a well-trodden formula and one with great potential. But in my history with the oft-attempted premise there hasn't yet been a film that does it justice. The Descent looked promising though, coming straight out of the U.K. after having garnered $5 million and a strong following on DVD release. The preview had grit under its fingernails and blood in its mouth, not to mention that the trailer was scarier than hell. But that's just it: the scene that scared us in the preview is the scariest stunt The Descent manages to pull. Too bad. But don't blame the marketing guys for the film's failure. Writer/Director Neil Marshall opens up the throttle much too wide much too early and leaves little to scare us with after his initial big reveal. The monsters are unveiled without tact and wasted on the paces of a by-the-books creature feature that fails to find its way beneath our skin.The story's no surprise, following a group of spelunkers who are struck by coincidental disaster and forced to find an alternate route out of the cave they've burrowed into. Our spelunkers (heh, I've always loved that word) are a flock of English women venturing into the Appalachian Mountains. The opening sequence tells of a brutal tragedy that befell our main spelunker, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald,) setting up a theme that is continually haunting throughout the film. Juno (Natalie Mendoza), the group's leader, wants the girls' trip to the Appalachians to be her gift to Sarah, attempting to bring her back to their old days of adventuring, before Sarah lost her family. But the gift turns to a curse when Sarah starts hearing the mellifluous giggles of her dead daughter's laugh behind the dark corners of the cave. She thinks she sees something out there in the darkness, something moving. But, of course, no one believes her, and it's only when she captures footage of the thing on camera (the scene revealed in the trailer) that Sarah's fellow spelunkers start taking her seriously. There is something down in the deep, and it wants to eat them.Too bad the creatures, the deadly flesh-eating monsters, look like the lovechild of Gollum and the Orcs from Lord of the Rings. The likeness is simply uncanny. And similarities like these are too distracting to miss and when caught, too difficult to shake. But in truth, the creatures are supposed to be an evolved form of regular old human, created from generations of life in the deep dark. The story tells of a group of spelunkers from hundreds of years ago trapped in the same cave as our ladies. They apparently managed to survive and reproduce, growing traits fit for cave life and avoiding discovery until Juno and her group of spelunkers tumbled in. For me, this tale of the original spelunkers from hundreds of years back, their rapid evolution and inhuman adaptation would be a more interesting story weave than the tired junk Neil Marshall throws at us. His film plays its cards too early. Instead of pulling us along on whispers from the shadows and footsteps in the deep, he throws the lights on first chance he gets and takes the next exit to Slasher-ville. The cave setting all but begs for psychological head games where unseen creatures are more terrifying than those that look like the bastard child of Gollum. But Marshall quickly resorts to a big reveal and falls back into the ruts grinded already by a dozen creature features and slasher films before it. The scares were already written for him. You know, when the character checks the dark corner and finds its safe, only to turn back and face the ugly mug and fangs of the monster. Or when the heroes sneak down the hallway as quietly as their booted feet can muster and as they pass by camera it's revealed that the creature's hanging above them on the ceiling. Or how about this: the nice, innocent character finds the primal instinct within her and turns into Ms. Rambo-ette, killing machine. These would all be spoilers if dozens of other horror films hadn't already given them away for you. And when you can anticipate every scare in a scary movie, it stops being scary.",6,0,2,4 August 2006
Inside Man," the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet
","Inside Man reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 4 out of 4Inside Man is an intelligent film about intelligent people. It maneuvers about its battlefront, moving its pieces back and forth and around and about. There are good guys and there are bad guys. But who we want to win is rarely transparent. Here, the battlefront is the Manhattan Trust Bank. The Cops are Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Denzel Washington, the latter two playing Detectives Frazer and Mitchell. The robber is Clive Owen playing Dalton Russell, who introduces the film staring straight into camera, laying out the who, the what, the where and the when. The How, he says, is where there's the rub. His plan is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. But as in all heist films, the real genius behind the crime is the screenwriter. Richard Gewirtz is Inside Man's literary composer. His approach to the material is one of simplicity. The credits don't roll with our fingers scratching bald spots on our brains. Gewirtz keeps it simple. We are never duped by Inside Man. Mr. Russell tells us in the beginning what his clues are, filling us in on the rest of it at the end. That's right, I heard that sigh of relief. You don't need a PhD. in Criminology to understand this film. There also aren't cheap tricks of style here. No characters are Crazy Johnny, or Scary Sammy, and Fat Jimmy. They are Detective Frazer, Madeleine White, and Dalton Russell. And don't expect the dumb renegade robber undermining the mastermind's authority either. Gewirtz sidestepped that part too. Gewirtz in fact dodged all the usual bullets surrounding heist pictures. His film is smart and crisp, much like the suits our characters wear. They're attacks rarely involve bullets, but are instead borne out of wits and brains. And for this Inside Man feels full. Spike Lee is unafraid of Inside Man's 130 minutes. It's a long running time for bank robber flick, I know; but this is an epic, plain and simple. And Inside Man is lean. Not a frame is wasted here. It's taken at a vicious clip, never slacking and refusing to allow those bubbles of boredom to trickle up. Lee knows the script is magnificent, and lets it do its thing. He instead focuses his efforts on the film's look. Each shot drips with self-importance, which is fine. Lee wants us to believe these characters to be Power Players. They're all working for results, making us wonder on which side of justice each character rests. His aggressive approach to the film mirrors this, launching us past the money in the bank, and onto the battleground's topographical map, watching as the Players propel themselves about on little floating clouds of motive. Rest assured, however, Spike lee doesn't throw to the breeze his penchant for poetic justice. Justice with Inside Man takes a purer approach than laws can offer. But don't take this as a rave for a film of sophisticates. This isn't a bank robbery film without entertainment. If nothing else, Inside Man is the best damn fun I've had at the movies yet this year. It keeps us hooked, with actors behind the characters who are steely-eyed with experience; the kind of cast most film school students have wet dreams over. Spike Lee's film is ingenious and, more importantly, without pretension. Its style lends itself sometimes to indulgence, sure. But its indulgence is the spice that comes with a Spike Lee Joint, and must be inhaled fully. He's brought the heist genre back to its roots. There are no mice in this game. Only cats maneuvering about, waiting for their chance to pounce. And while we're at it, let's change cats to panthers. Because there are no kittens prancing around Inside Man. What Spike Lee has done is the impossible, much like his Mr. Russell is attempting. Mr. Lee has spun, quite possibly, the finest bank robber's tale burned to celluloid yet.Director: Spike Lee Cast: Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie FosterScreenplay: Richard Gewirtz MPAA Classification: R (language and some violent images)",9,2,3,22 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but a solid flick
","rating: 3 out of 4After nearly three years of putting it off, last week I finally picked up and read The Da Vinci Code. Being the 40,000,001st person to read the book wasn't much fun, as a dozen or more people giddily peered over my shoulder, asking what page I was on and oh-so-accidentally letting the twists slip off their tongues. I figured that since all the other 40,000,000 people who've read the book will view the film adaptation in a gnawing, nit picky book-to-film comparison, I probably should too. Trying to review a film from a perspective no one in the theatre will have has never been a winning stratagem. And Dan Brown's book was fun and riling, utilizing convincing art history and extremist theology to thicken its otherwise pulpy tale. As a film, its prospects were titillating: the damned thing was pretty much written to be a movie in the first place. But when put to practice, some key elements were lost in translation. Granted, Ron Howard is a more eloquent storyteller than Dan Brown, utilizing the language of film with more agility than Brown can maneuver the English language; but the script lost something along the way: for all its length, Mr. Howard's The Da Vinci Code has lost its scholarly charm.Now don't go running off thinking Hollywood's done it again; this is a respectful adaptation that constricts its creativity to stay true to the worldwide literary phenomenon. What I mean is that Akiva Goldsman's adaptation seems to rush itself in some of the wrong places. For those of you who're like me and have somehow avoided the book for the last years, here's a little synopsis: a respected curator for the Louvre is found dead with a mysterious smattering of clues surrounding his body. Symbologist and Cryptologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) track these clues down to their historical significance, tromping around Paris and London in search of the Holy Grail, the curator's controversial secret. Going any more in depth is a waste of print-space. I was the only person who hadn't read the book anyhow.The finest moments of the novel, most will admit, occurred when Langdon and Neveu sifted through their encyclopedic knowledge in search of solutions to their international, multi-millennial treasure hunt. We were educated as they whittled down the answers, introduced to stifling theories and tasty little factoids. But with the film adaptation, Mr. Howard seems to skim over the puzzling aspects of the hunt. Answers seem to simply pop into the characters heads. Oh sure, every once in a while an anagram gives them a few seconds of trouble, but Mr. Sauniere's (the curator) brilliance is never properly honored. The trail he laid for the pair was intricate in the novel, laden with double entendres and charmed solutions. Goldsman's script doesn't have time for such nonsense, floating along past these magical moments of scholarly adventure and replacing them instead with other conversations lifted from the text that offer up disappointing substitutes. Beyond this, however, I have no quibble with the project. Put simply, it's the moving picture version of the book we read, but without the clunky sentences. The best people in the business were put on this project and it certainly shows. Not only does Ron Howard prove yet again his careful command of the film medium, but the casting is also watertight. Mr. Hanks and Ms. Tautou strike the chord of off-kilter chemistry that Mr. Brown aimed for in his book, while the ghostly Silas is haunting and pathetic in the form of Paul Bettany. And yes, despite Hanks' much abused hairdo, his performance is the most respectful of all. He's just fine as Robert Langdon.And there's no need to worry about the screenplay taking its own creative liberties. The one major change from the book is well handled and probably a better choice anyhow (it has to do with Captain Fache and Bishop Aringarosa). There are little things changed too, but only shifted to speed up Mr. Brown's otherwise sloppy action sequences. Instead of Sophie hitting the brakes and calmly driving away from the tightly guarded U.S. Embassy, she embarks on a wild, backwards car chase in the deeply congested streets of Paris. Ron Howard knows how to drive his film in these scenes, and his control of The Da Vinci Code is its winning token. This isn't the best adaptation The Da Vinci Code fanatics could've hoped for, but it's a solid flick. The eloquence Mr. Howard delivers is a vast improvement over Mr. Brown's fumbling language, while Brown's adventure is undermined by Howard's slighting of the treasure hunt. This is a fair trade, sure, but it prevents both works from achieving greatness.",8,3,6,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," equivalent in quality to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 4 out of 4Mike Newell is decidedly the right man for this job. Christopher Columbus' work on the first two Harry Potters was rightly put by Terry Gilliam as 'simply pedestrian'. Alfonso Cuaron's work on the previous film, although satisfying, felt too alive and energetic for the literary elegance that must inhabit Harry's world. Newell, however, nails the bolt straight through the bull's-eye with Potter's fourth venture onto celluloid. The film documents, quite simply enough, the famous Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His friends, Ron and Hermione (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) return expectedly, along with a volley of new students from two other wizarding schools brought in for the infamous Tri-Wizard Tournament. The tournament calls for one champion from each school to compete in three tasks of harrowing adventure, fighting to win the all-lauded Tri-Wizard Cup. Things turn awry, however, when the Goblet of Firethe magical device that decides the competitorschooses Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and Harry Potter to compete for Hogwarts. But rules are rules, and soon Harry's off to the first task. Also troubling Harry is a recurring dream that displays a half-formed Lord Voldemort (Ralph Feinnes) with Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and a mysterious third party discussing dark, evil plans. In the earlier films, some of the largest complaints were piled against the acting. Some thought, with some justification, that Ron, Hermione, and Harry were all cast because of their physical likeness to the parts, failing to show true acting prowess. By now, however, they've matured. The three have all developed nicely into blossoming, successful young actors with powerful skill. Along with nailing all the lines, the three all exude great physical comedy. One of the finer segments of the film focuses upon the awkward energy of school when a dance--The Yule Ball--is looming in the future. All three of our heroes deal with asking a young lady or being asked by a gentlemen with charming adolescent drama which, in another world less fantastical and endearing would be melodramatic. Here, however, the tiny explosions of conflict break up the Tri-Wizarding action nicely and are performed so well that's it's a delight to simply sit back and enjoy. Lord of the Rings would be hard put to compete with the adventure The Goblet of Fire offers. The first task of the tournament, in theory, appears simple: retrieve the golden egg from the arena. Hagrid the Gatekeeper, however, soon alerts Harry to the fact that a dragon will also be present in the arena, charged with protecting the precious golden egg from the competitor. What ensues is an incredible feet of CGI magicians' handiwork. The scene takes Harry on a tormenting broom ride, dodging the fiery breath of the fierce dragon and escaping to the shingled roofs of Hogwarts' towers, leaping across them to avoid the fatal claws of his scaly enemy. These fantastic action scenes continue, bringing Harry into the watery depths of a frightening city of mermaids and later, into a towering labyrinth of hedges for the tournament's final task. We're treated to stunning shows of CGI wizardry as well as picturesque real-life sets. Early on, the group heads to the 422nd Quidditch World Cup (a segment that fans of the book will find rushed due to time restrictions). Their mode of transportation to the event, interestingly enough, is an old, beaten boot called a portkey. The camera takes a first-person view as the group sprints towards the footwear, sliding briskly through the grass, the sun silhouetting those running and darkening the rough outline of the portkey in a shot of kinetic, brimming beauty. There's a myriad collection of shots with similarly high value throughout the film, keeping us interested not only with Harry's startling adventure, but also with the film's opulent visuals. With each director, the Harry Potter's world has undergone dramatic transformations in its visual presentation. Some noticed in the last film that Hogwarts turned into a kind of rugged, crumbling castle lost in the cold of the wilderness; whereas one year earlier in Columus' film, Hogwarts was a magnificent edifice among a neatly-plotted spot of land. Columbus took magic at a minimum, and Cuaron let it run amok. Newell, however, finds the perfect chord to strike between the two, opting for a kind of fantasy world interwoven with calm reality and a joyous dosage of magic. It feels Harry has finally found his rightful home in Newell's cinematic reality, which, thankfully, seems mostly parallel to the world spun in Rowling's novels. Some will complain, as they always do, of segments from the novel being snipped from the final cinematic product. But The Goblet of Fire runs at 2 hours and 38 minutes, and unlike the previous films, feels rightly paced. Any more and the film might drag. Any less and it would assuredly feel rushed. My only complaint would be in the casting of Dumbledore, now played by Michael Gambon. His performance is hard and cold compared to warm, light-headed character from the books. A silly criticism, yes, but fans of the books will notice just the same. Other than Dumbledore, however, casting is spot on; especially with the all-important choice for Voldemort. Simply put, Ralph Feinnes is electric. I feel the Harry Potter series has finally risen to the artistic level of phenomena the books have repeatedly achieved over the last decade. This film, if I may so boldly state, is equivalent in quality to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yeah, it really is that good.",10,1,2,19 November 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Simple, unbridled fun
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comRating: 3.5 out of 4Director: Doug Liman Screenplay: Simon Kinberg Cast: Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Vince Vaughn, Adam Brody MPAA Classification: PG-13 (sequences of violence, intense action, sexual content and brief strong language)In a Summer season where ninety percent of the films revolve around pretty people shooting and/or having sex with one another, Mr. and Mrs. Smith almost seems like a parody of itself. In fact, that's what impresses me most about the film. It's a shameless pulp action thriller that's so self-referential that it turns itself into a kind of satiric and ridiculous comedy. The plot is a pointedly simple man vs. woman set up, the action is obviously abundant, and the leads are the two sexiest known actors is the world. In fact, I'm impressed that the corporate big wigs down at 20th Century Fox put this film through production. It's so pulpy and shameless in its approach that we can't help but have unbridled, Summer film fun.The film opens at a marriage counseling office. Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) sit in front of a psychologist, awkwardly assuring him their marriage is running along as smoothly as it did five or six years ago (there's confusion as to how long it's actually been). From this little gem of a scene, we follow the couple back to their white collar house in the suburbs outside New York City. The two eat dinner, exchange a few sentences of dialogue, and each read books under the lamplight of their bedside tables, both hiding the fact that they're assassins for hire working under different agencies. Before heading off to a neighborhood party at the Coleman's house across the street, Mrs. Smith runs off to an S&M club to whip a big-time illegal arms dealer into shape. Mr. Smith, on the other hand, goes to play a fatal game of poker with some associates of his firm. Each return home and smile at the other, both wondering how the other gets through the normal workday in a real suburban lifestyle. But this calm ignorance of the other's secret career ends when Mr. and Mrs. are both assigned to the same hit. Identifying each other, their firms each give them 48 hours to eliminate the opposite hit-man. If in 48 hours the opposing agent is still alive, the firm must cut loose the agent of their own. It's just standard procedure. To put it sweetly, this creates marital tension like you've never seen. Domestic abuse has never been so fun. A film with this sort of set-up (one of shameless formula and potential for car chase sequences) has to be handled by the right director. In someone like Stephen Chow's hands (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), Mr. and Mrs. Smith would be a slapstick action mess. Contrarily, in someone like David Fincher's hands (Fight Club, Se7eN) the film would take itself too seriously and miss the comedic side of its satire. Somehow, Doug Liman is perfect for the role of director. Coming off of the immensely successful Bourne Identity, Liman gives Mr. and Mrs. Smith a tone of controlled seriousness. The comedy is already embedded in the screenplay, so he thankfully decides to let the actors' natural charisma play it out. And on the action side of things, Liman doesn't over-dramatize the violence or attempt to brutalize his characters with inhuman acts. The action is played out as it was in The Bourne Identity; with controlled seriousness, meaning it's an essential element of the film that simply needs to be played out. There aren't thousands of cuts each lasting a fraction of a second, or too many CGI stunt doubles replacing human actors; Liman takes a back-seat and lets the film work itself out in its own pulp action way. As much as we'd like to deny it, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the driving force behind Mr. and Mrs. Smith's PR. Rumors and tabloid gossip aside, the two are no-brainers for their roles. I've come to look forward to all of Pitt's films simply because of his wonderful charismatic style. He rarely changes his approach to the way he plays his characters simply because they all call for charisma, and here it's superbly apparent. On Jolie's side of things, she was made to play the role of a housewife assassin. Liman's said they initially were looking into Nicole Kidman to play the part, but they settled for Jolie. That's right, settled. In my opinion, Jolie is the only option for Mrs. Smith. Satire is a difficult thing to find in a Summer action film, but Mr. and Mrs. Smith pulls it off flawlessly. There's a great sequence, a car chase sequence actually, that initially comes to mind when talking about the film's satire. The Smith's are running away from seemingly dozens of hired hit men all out for their heads. The bad guys are in BMW's and the Smith's are in nothing less than the Colemans' minivan. Swerving down the highway, the Smith utilize every feature of the minivan to their assassin killing needs. In one part, a baddie jumps into the minivan through a side sliding door only to be thrown out the other side by way of the newly standard second sliding door. 'That comes in handy,' says Mr. Smith after his quasi-suburban stunt. Between the wry satire on the suburban life, the blistering action sequences, and Liman's superb direction, I came to find myself having fun. It wasn't any meaningful, Oscar potential experience, but what we sometime lose sight of while at the movies. Simple, unbridled fun. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",8,1,7,13 June 2005
The Departed," Will probably stand as the greatest work of film in this decade
","The Departed reviewed by Sam OsbornMy problem when reviewing a film like The Departed is that I tend to veer towards broad exclamations of cinematic history and directorial brilliance and, at times, a kind of divine intervention with the art of movie-making. Anyone who read my review of Brick will understand my overindulgence in writing about great film. And so with that said and with you readers warned, let me just make my one embarrassingly broad statement about The Departed: if the following three years continue as the preceding seven have, this film will probably stand as the greatest work of film in this decade. Scorsese has a tendency to hold such titles, as his Taxi Driver is often thought to be the best film of the seventies, contending with Chinatown and The Godfather. Raging Bull is often thought of as the greatest film of the eighties, even though it was released at the very cusp of the decade. And Goodfellas, made in 1990, is often thought of as the great American film of the nineties, contending maybe with Schindler's List and Silence of the Lambs. But whether or not my broad prophetic praise is of any worth, it's simple and seemingly natural to admit that The Departed is, at the very least, a damn good slab of cinema. The story is loosely based off the hugely successful Hong Kong action trilogy, Infernal Affairs. I say loosely because Scorsese has made a work of intense originality here. The story may have the skeleton of its predecessor, but screenwriter William Monahan has massaged out a flesh that's boldly American. The characters are the offspring of immigrants; Irish immigrants who found opportunity in this land whether or not it was held under the pretense of legality. The most villainous of these is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the serpent's head to the Irish Mob of Boston. Nicholson is in overdrive here, snarling his vicious lines with every pound of evil his goateed face will allow. When he executes a crying couple on a beach and the woman crumples sideways instead of forwards, Costello chuckles to himself, looks to his partner and snarls while laughing, 'she fell funny.' Opposing Costello is Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his partner Dignam (Mark Whalberg), heading up the painfully secretive undercover portion of the Special Investigations Unit in the Massachusetts State Police. The film works as a quiet battlefield, with each side manipulating the actions of an inside man. Costello's boy, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a quickly rising detective for the police, soon to be heading up the force supposedly hunting down Costello. Queenan's boy, William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is an unlikely cadet turned undercover agent who scuttles his way into the inner circle of Costello's crew. The result is a game of two cats and two mice, all lunging for the same prize of ousting the rat. No directorial prodigy could have made this picture. It's not a debut of unlikely brilliance or any farce of beginner's luck. The Departed is a film that could only have been made by a master of the art form. Without effusing too broadly, it's a work of experience. Scorsese has a deep hat full of tricks, and the choices he makes as to the tricks he'll reveal are choices no textbook, no teacher, and no film critic can explain. Only a man with so many movies under his belt could have constructed this film as it is, and trying to catalogue the vast number of techniques he utilized in the process would probably only reveal that Scorsese knows more than me about the art of cinema. But I can at least say that it's rare for us to be so affected by an action movie. We fall in love easily enough in a romance, we scare pretty easy by horror, and we're all devastated by the sadness expounded in a historical drama. But only in the most original works of the action genre are we left so completely flabbergasted as The Departed left us. Rating: 4 out of 4Sam Osborn",10,0,2,8 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold
","Stranger than Fiction reviewed by Sam OsbornIn Stranger than Fiction, reality and the imaginings of a novelist are bridged by, of all things, a British narration; to be precise, the narration of Emma Thompson. She plays Karen Eiffel, a reclusive novelist struggling with an especially thick bout of writer's block. Her narration, clicked out on a typewriter in her huge, all-white apartment, is mysteriously transmitted to Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), whose every action coincides with Ms. Eiffel's words. His life has suddenly become a narrated event. This would only be a slight annoyance had Ms. Eiffel not foreshadowed Harold's tale with what she calls 'imminent death.'It's a great and clever gimmick for a comedy; a gimmick that could gobble up a whole film without trouble and maybe drop in two years later for second helpings on the sequel. But Screenwriter Zach Helm isn't mining for gimmicks here. Just as soon as he settles in, about to rest on the laurels of his neat plot device, Mr. Helm gets back up and spins the gimmick like a top, letting its breadth span more than the silly expressions on Will Ferrell's face. His hero is a man of routine, one who counts out his steps and times his procedures with quick mathematics and numbers. He's lonely and seemingly mechanized, quietly unremarkable at his job as an IRS tax auditor. But amidst the distracting narration that now plagues his routine, Harold meets Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a grassroots tax-evader who rebels against the government with milk and chocolate-chip cookies from her independent bakery. Harold is assigned to investigate her case and, despite her publicly abusing him at her shop, he falls for her. His routine is thus changed, but his death still imminent. For counsel he goes to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), an expert on literary theory to work up a list of potential authors he might be channeling. In the same way Jim Carrey sang two octaves lower than his usual high-pitched comic screech in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so too does Will Ferrell quiet down for Stranger than Fiction. It's not as though somebody pressed the mute button on Ferrell's antics; his performance is comfortably natural in all its quaint and charming awkwardness. He plucks laughs from the audience, but doesn't whore himself out for them like in this summer's Talladega Nights. Similarly, in her small role as Karen Eiffel's assistant, Queen Latifah turns in a thankfully understated performance. And finally, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal both shine hard and bright under the stereotype characters they're cast under. But great cast work is no surprise from Director Marc Forster. His previous filmsStay, Finding Neverland, and Monster's Ballhave churned out consistently stunning performances from all actors involved. The only words I have for describing Mr. Forster's directorial prowess are a 'natural affinity for movie-making.' Like Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead), his films are driven invisibly. In synopsis and description they're hardly exceptional, but when seen, the films have a preternatural magnetism. They engage us inexplicably close and don't let go until they're through. With Stranger than Fiction, the draw is wonderfully human. It makes us laugh at and love its awkward Harold and let the gimmick work its spinning magic until the whole situation has taken its whimsical turn. It's a wild and delightful success that hopefully won't go unnoticed this upcoming awards season.Sam Osborn",9,1,4,12 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," easily superior to the latest two films and on par with the quality of the originals
","Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 4 out of 4With Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas has created a film that will finally meet the sky-high expectations of even the most die-hard of fans of the 1977 original classic. The last two, although excellent in their own separate rites, were too much of an intellectual departure from the swashbuckling original to truly sate the palette of all you dress-up wookies and Vaders out there. But finally there is closure. And with this closure comes a rewind to the roots that made Star Wars the classic it is today. Essentially, Lucas makes Episode III his masterpiece by carefully tying together the strings left from the politics of Episode II and the swaggering adventure of Episode IV. It forms itself into a symphony finale, a space opera if you will, that ties together and intelligently completes a saga that follows a civilization's collapse, revolution, and destruction that spans the length of three generations and tells its story with harrowing, jaw-dropping excitement. The film opens with the rescue of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the grips of the evil Separatist Federation star-ship caught in the midst of its escape. Heading up the rescue are Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) stills leads the Separatist movement in its as-of -yet successful attempts to divide the Republic. Second in command to Dooku is the aging droid General Grievous (voice of Matthew Wood), whose command of the lightsaber soon causes him to yield a stunning four weapons simultaneously (that's right, four lightsabersway cool). After dealing with the situation with Chancellor Palpatine, the two Jedi return to Coruscant to discuss matters with the ever-faithful Jedi Council, led by the legendary Yoda (Frank Oz) and Master Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). Anakin is still secretly romantically involved with Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman), soon learning that she's pregnant with his son (and daughter for that matter). However, all this success certainly has its price. Anakin has been having prophecies (i.e. nightmares) that foreshadow the death of Amidala during childbirth. To stop the hand of fate, Anakin utilizes his newfound friend, the Chancellor, to help him find a way to save her. As in all the new Star Wars films, the level of sheer, meticulous detail in Revenge of the Sith is stunning. From John William's brilliantly nuanced score, to each of the many tiny insignias on every costume, to the multiple levels of sound effects and editing, to the greatly improved graphics and visuals, Episode III is a gold mine of sensory detail. But of course, I probably didn't need to tell you that. As usual, we're pulled so far into the Star Wars universe that we find ourselves sadly reluctant to leave.This time around, however, the world of Star Wars has gotten a fair bit darker. Lucas pops for the PG-13 rating in return for the chance to successfully illustrate the Clone Wars in full detail. We're treated to a myriad of action sequences involving good-ole dogfights, chase sequences, and epic war-scenes between the droids and the Jenga-Fett based Clone Soldiers. There's essentially a lot more action in Episode III. I use the word 'more' in the sense that the violence has less of a base in politics and more of a base in adventure. The fights now go back to roots. Think of the good old lightsaber duels and dogfights between X-wings and A-wings, where the fights were campier, nerdier, and best of all, geekier. Because although Revenge of the Sith really is the darkest of all the films, Lucas manages to steer it back to the classic science fiction roots it began with. But that's not to say that Anakin's slow, painful turn to the dark side is any less tragic. In fact, the reason for the PG-13 rating is less because of the war sequences, but more because of Anakin's disturbing metamorphosis into the villain we all love to hate, Darth Vader. He performs his fall out of his love for Padme Amidala, not just out of pure villainous hate. This makes the deterioration into something of a Greek tragedy, creating some truly powerful scenes between Anakin and his master Obi-Wan, who's raised him in the Jedi arts since he was a little boy back in Episode I. Star Wars was originally a success because it sketched an entire universe out of a simple Japanese legend and molded it into a pulp science fiction symphony of the highest form. The prequels have damaged this image a tad, not really injuring the film's reputation, but more shifting it towards intellectual and political realms that were originally overlooked. But now Revenge of the Sith ties the two sides of the saga together, mixing adventure with politics, and allowing us to finally see and fully appreciate the entire picture; the supreme masterpiece that lurked in Lucas' mind for decades which has now brought itself to full universal splendor in the hearts and minds of every science fiction geek who's nerd enough to watch it. I believe Revenge of the Sith is a fitting end to what has been a long and arduous journey for the saga. It's easily superior to the latest two films and on par with the quality of the originals. Yes, it's really that great.",10,2,11,19 May 2005
1408," a classically styled, old-school haunt
","1408 Reviewed by Samuel Osborn I remember reading the short story 1408 is based upon. It was a Stephen King yarn, bland in the way his writing gets when the prose aches to be a script. And like most of Mr. King's work, a script was madethe rights to his work apparently aren't hard to obtain from the easy-going writer. The necessary extrapolations were made, cluttering up the short story so it could fill 90 minutes of film and, voila, a movie was made. Between three screenwriters who, combined, have Reign of Fire and Agent Cody Banks to their resumes, a Swedish director with an abysmal American debut (Derailed), and a remarkably mediocre short story for source material, I had 1408 chalked up to be a joke. A sorry stab at the haunted house genre. I, of course, was wrong.1408 isn't 'torture porn' as the Saw and Hostel franchises have been deemed; it isn't a Japanese re-hash like The Ring or The Grudge; and also it's not a slasher glory days re-make like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the upcoming Halloween. 1408 is a classically styled, old-school haunt. And it's very effective.Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a mythbuster for haunted houses. Once a laudable novelist, now Mr. Enslin slinks around the deepest, phoniest hotels dislodging their claims to supernatural fame. As is obligatory to any Stephen King romp, Mr. Enslin is, at heart, a troubled, middle-aged ordinary Joe. He's likable in the film noir sort of way: an agreeable prick. Life's thrown him some punches and Mr. King finds him a few rounds later, beaten but carrying on alright. Separated from his wife and without children, Mr. Enslin lives on the beach and spends his free time surfing and dressing like an idiot. He receives a postcard from The Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan one day, warning him not to enter the room 1408. Intrigued, he calls the hotel and asks for the room. The receptionist hangs up on him.It isn't until he's pulled legal strings with his publishing house's lawyer does Mr. Enslin finally convince the hotel's manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), to allow him the room for one night. 56 people have died in there, he says, either by natural death or suicide. A maid was once locked in the bathroom for no more than a few minutes. By the time Mr. Olin had gotten her out, the maid had gouged both of her eyes out. On this point, even at the risk of over-hyping his main attraction, Director Mikael Hafstrom goes to extensive efforts to make his haunted room a scare even before we set eyes upon it. So when the door finally creaks open, our stomach's already clenched and ready to fling itself up into our throats.And from that moment on, when the key is turned and 1408 opened, we're treated to dozens of goodies from Mr. Hafstrom's big bucket of scares. The film is loaded with them. But what makes 1408 original is their enigmatic nature. There's no name or physicality to the spook that haunts 1408. It's just an awesome evil. And in this way, the curtain isn't drawn to reveal our opponent. We're never sure what we're up against. This gives the three screenwriters carte blanche on the scares their allowed to dream up.The pacing also plays a role, as boring a point as that may seem. The scares, though abundant, do well to sneak up on us, compounding quietly behind our nerve endings where they wait to pounce. It's an old trick from the golden days, when censor boards didn't allow excessive gore or grotesque figures onto Hollywood's screens. Directors were forced to use minimalist tricks to crawl under our skin. So even though all that's wrong with 1408 early on is a preternaturally good housekeeping service, a faulty window, and an annoying clock radio, we're scared out of our wits.But don't worry, Mr. Hafstrom doesn't rely on minimalist mumbo jumbo for 1408's full 94 minutes. The scope soon widens to a point where the reliable troops of CGI are recruited for service. The things this hotel room can do will knock your socks off. And with the ever-lovable John Cusack behind Mike Enslin, the ride's entertainment value is foolproof. And as a note on 2007, between The Hitcher, 28 Weeks Later, Mr. Brooks, Disturbia, 1408, and the upcoming Joshua, this year might be the year for horror's classy comeback.Samuel Osborn",8,0,0,27 June 2007

It's time for an origin story; stepping away from the embarrassing previous film, Die Another Day, and going back to roots. In Mr. Brosnan's shoes now is Daniel Craig, a blonde beefcake with carven features and a stony countenance. He's tougher than Brosnan, and less afraid to get his shoes soiled. He doesn't speak much; his mother apparently only taught him sly comebacks and cheesy pick-up lines. But Mr. Craig is a brusque, youthful version of the Bond we've come to be used to. He's flawed and overly confident, but ineffably charming. Put simply, he'll do. His villain is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson)--I suppose any Bond film isn't complete without an idiotic name for its villain. Le Chiffre has a demented left eyeball that's appropriately scarred over and that intermittently bleeds to give the effect of weeping blood. He's lost $100 million of his clients' (terrorists) money in a botched stock market sabotage. He now must put his prodigious poker talents to work so he can win the $100 million back before the enraged terrorists take revenge. Funding Bond's buy-in at the high-stakes poker game at Montenegro is the Treasury agent Vesper Lynde, played by the illustrious Eva Green. She's not your typical Bond girl (read: she's not a slut). A lot of fuss has been made over the romance that glows between Bond and Lynde, remarking mostly on how much of a sissy Bond would be if he would actually fall for a girl. And he does. For the most part, the love story is handled smartly; but near the end, as the love story blossoms, it quickly becomes too bubbly and sappy for even me (I gave three stars to The Devil Wears Prada for goodness sake). This isn't to say Ms. Green isn't up to snuff, however. On the contrary, she's the best thing that's happened to the series since Pussy Galore. She has acting chops and a face more beautiful even than her body. A more suitable actress could not have been chosen for such an important entry into the Bond series. And so I guess the question on everyone's mind should be answered: Is Bond back? I'll admit to not truly knowing. The days of Sean Connery were before my time, and their recreation on DVD is simply not the same. Bond flicks must be experienced in the present, I suppose, and judging a Bond without the hordes of fans clapping and yelping around you just doesn't add up. But, at the very least, is Casino Royale an improvement over the campy dregs of Die Another Day and the Pierce Brosnan series before it? Well, it thankfully isn't as silly. Die Another Day heightened all the delicious implausibility to ridiculous heights, to the point where the requisite absurdity of a Bond film became distracting. Casino Royale manages here to toe the thin line of camp and quality. The Bond formula hasn't changed; there are still villains who weep tears, girls with big breasts bobbling on galloping horses, lots of machine guns, and acrobatics that rarely adhere to the laws of physics. But Bond doesn't surf a tsunami, as he did in Die Another Day. Bond has returned to glamour and class. The film is strong and adventurous, spanning the globe with bullets and a body count. It's long (144 minutes) and has a sweet tooth for sentimentality. All the elements are here and, perhaps, any Bond film is only as good as the sum of its parts. But I suppose that isn't true. There must be an energy that powers the whole thing; a defibrillator to shock all the parts into place. Director Martin Campbell applies this current liberally, and makes Casino Royale beat with a vicious pulse. It's entertainment of the very first order; meaning that anyone and everyone will have a bloody good time. So, yes, Bond is back. Sam Osborn",9,0,2,17 November 2006
Fantastic Four," Story is proving himself to be a disappointing director
","Fantastic Four Reviewed by Sam OsbornRating: 2 out of 4Director: Tim Story Cast: Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon, Ioan Gruffudd Screenplay: Michael France, Mark Frost, MPAA Classification: PG-13 (sequences of intense action, and some suggestive content)There's so much giddy energy injected into Fantastic Four that it's difficult not to like. Despite so many missteps and problems, the film still manages to endear its audiences to the comic book hokey-ness that's absent from many of the new comic book to film adaptations. Point in fact, Batman Begins dropped the cartoon corniness for an affective grim surrealism. But Fantastic Four embraces the cheesy dialogue bubbles and uses them both to the film's advantage and to its disadvantage.What's most frustrating when watching Fantastic Four is its absurd sense of pacing. For 90 minutes, director Tim Story develops his characters without much concern for the audience's excitement. We're treated to a single fight sequence in that entire 90 minute segment. Albeit, the sequence is amazing, but still, a bit more action couldn't hurt.The film opens with failed corporate businessman Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffud) and his bodyguard Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) heading up to the top story of the Von Doom building in New York City. There they pitch their idea to Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), the richest businessman in the world. Their theory one of a radioactive wave from space causing Earth's planetary evolution. Six weeks from now, another one of the waves will enter Earth's orbit. Reed would like to take a shuttle up to von Doom's space station and use its uniquely powerful shields to study the wave. Seeing it as a grand financial opportunity, von Doom bites and soon enough Reed and Doom's team are scooting around Victor's space station. The team includes Ben Grimm, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Victor's head of Genetic research and love interest, her brother Johnny (Chris Evans), a lover of extreme sports and former NASA pilot, Victor, and Richard. All is going well until unexplainable the wave closes in much faster than expected, catching the entire team by surprise. Not able to get the shields up in time, all the team members are exposed to the wave and consequently have their DNA strangely altered. Gradually, all their newfound superpowers are revealed. Reed is now Mr. Fantastic, with a rubber body. Susan is now The Invisible Girl, who also has the power of conjuring up strong force fields. Johnny is now The Human Torch, having the power to engulf himself in flames and somehow fly. Ben is now The Thing, made entirely out of rock. Lastly, Victor von Doom is secretly and slowly changing into a man made entirely of steel stronger than diamonds. When the former four decide to try and reverse the changes, Victor decides to use his power to take over the world. As if his name didn't give it away.As I mentioned earlier, the desperately slow pace of the film puts a hamper on what could have been an epic comic book adventure. The screenplay strives to build three-dimensional characters, but leaves the dialogue to material we expect only from the little white dialogue bubbles in the comics. These work fine for comic books, but put to the actors the lines come out cheesy and ineffective. But the blame can't be dumped on the acting. Although none of the five main actors put up performances any more than acceptable, the material they have to work with is surely flawed. However, when we do finally get to the action, it's simply stunning. Staying true to the long running comic book series, the film's action sequences utilize all the different abilities of the Fantastic Four. The action isn't minced into half-second shots as it was in the upcoming The Island and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but given large scope, allowing us to witness it in all its glistening entirety. But the CGI work, although abundant, is hit and miss in quality. Some of the earlier shots, a space-ship docking shot in particular, are strangely poor. But work with Alba's invisibility and force-fields are quite eye-widening. There's a great scene where the four are dukin' it out with Doom on the streets of New York; Johnny lights himself to the point of 'Supernova', creating a boiling hot explosion contained by a half-spherical semi-transparent force-field of Susan Storm. In scenes like these, where there's this great mix of beautiful art design and clever action choreography, Fantastic Four finally finds its feet. It's a shame that throughout the rest of the film, the disappointing Dr. Doom and his evil scheming are little more than backdrops to the corny, one-dimensional character development Tim Story tries to create. Some of this lack of comic book violence can be attributed to the film's apparent 'lightness.' It's rumored that an early version of the screenplay would have garnered a PG rating. And today, a PG rating is almost as suicidal as an NC-17. PG-13 reigns king over the summer box office. But even with a PG-13 rating, Fantastic Four still feels somehow light. Dr. Doom isn't all that scary, about on par with Spiderman's Green Goblin. And substituting for action sequences are lame extreme sports endeavors with Johnny Storm. Johnny's one of the more entertaining aspects of the film, but snowboarding and motorcycles rarely live up to superpower combat on the city's streets. I feel let down by Fantastic Four. Tim Story is proving himself to be a disappointing director, coming off of Taxi last year and following it up with this high-profile letdown. The film leaves much open-ended material for a sequel. So lets hope another screenwriter and a drastically different director get behind the helm of our next adventure with the Fantastic Four.",5,0,1,10 July 2005
The Pursuit of Happyness," flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while
","The Pursuit of Happiness reviewed by Sam OsbornFor a feel-good movie, The Pursuit of Happiness sure does want its audience to feel crappy. I don't mean this as a criticism. Rather, I think it's a show of intense bravery for a film stuck in a genre already soaked in sappiness. But it's a long, downhill journey for most of the film's duration, watching as Mr. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is repeatedly pummeled under the American economic system. I suppose it follows Nietzsche's oft-repeated quote 'what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.' And so, to ravage the saying entirely, if the lows of The Pursuit of Happiness doesn't kill the picture, they make its endingyou know, the feel-good part of the recipejust that much sweeter. The grand scheme was to tell the story of the American dream from a new perspective. Such was the motivation in bringing European director Gabriele Muccino onto the project. Feeling that Americans have drawn too close to the concept to pull any focus on it, Muccino takes a step back and looks at our American dream from a fresh perspective. The result is indeed refreshing. The movie comes without any fat around its curves. It's a slim, distilled version of the American dream, where a mana smart, good man in whom most Americans probably see themselvestries to better his living conditions using the American system of capitalism promised in the Constitution. It doesn't come with a side dish of romance or tragic hors d'oeuvre; just a man trying to do right by his family. But Chris Gardner's family is quickly dispersing. Linda (Thandie Newton), his wife, leaves him early on, choosing to fend for herself rather than go down with Chris' sinking ship. She leaves him with their son Christopher (Jaden Smith), whose daycare costs $150 per month. Chris would have to sell two bone density scanners each month to pay rent, daycare and groceries. But he hasn't sold one of the wretched devices in a while and the overdue bills are piling up. Chris is good at numbers though, and can solve a Rubik Cube with astounding ease; so he applies for an internship at Dean Witter. The gig's an unpaid one, but if he gets the job at the end of the course, he's set for life. Problem is, only one in twenty interns is hired; and if you aren't hired, you can't apply for a job at any other stock brokerage firm for six months. The script is a product of Steven Conrad, the same writer who penned last year's The Weather Man. The films are deceivingly similar, each chronicling a series of unfortunate occurrences that slowly slice at the legs of an American man. In both films, Conrad manages to find a sweet and hilarious humanity in bad days, or bad weeks, or bad years. His heroes are good men and American men, who struggle to find themselves something worth having in our system. Much huzzah has been made over the familial pairing of Will Smith and his son in parallel father-son roles. The decision was a smart one, as their performances are as sincere as ever. Jaden may not have many lines, but it's not hard to see that he loves and believes in his father, whether he's playing Will Smith or Chris Gardner. And Mr. Smiththe older one, that ishasn't been lying in his much-publicized interviews that this film is a turning point in his acting career. His Muhammad Ali was a force, but the role of Chris Gardner was built for him.Make no mistake though; for the feel-good genre, The Pursuit of Happiness is a brutal, sometimes cruel entry. But I suppose that's the point, and Chris says it somewhere in the first act: that when the founders of the Constitution wrote 'the pursuit of happiness' into the text, they only promised the pursuit. The chase is a long, mean one; but when the end is found, it flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while. Samuel Osborn",8,2,3,15 December 2006
Cinderella Man," Howard successfully transcends the formula that originally bound him
","Cinderella Man reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 3.5 out of 4Director: Ron Howard Cast: Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig Bierko Screenplay: Cliff Hollingsworth, Akiva Goldsman MPAA Classification: PG-13 (intense boxing violence and some language)Here in America, everybody loves an underdog story. And since Brando said those fateful words in the back of a car in On the Waterfront, 'I coulda been a contender!', boxing has been the all-American sport. Some will argue that baseball rules the cinema as the 'American' ballgame. but boxing is the clear winner. What could be more American? Fans, gamblers, moms, dads, bookies and all surround a small roped-off area where two specimens of the American Dream beat the fleshy pulp out of each other until one of them drops, out cold upon the mat. And with Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger at the helm of a 30's depression era backdrop, director Ron Howard has used this love of the underdog and love of the sport to form this all-American formula that fuels his Cinderella Man. I must admit, initially I was skeptical of this film. Because, come on, we've all seen this film before. But wait! That's where I was wrong, kind of. The formula's still there, pumping away each frame of the film, but Ron Howard manages to transcend the formula and make Cinderella Man more than its underdog story of an aging boxer. In fact, many of the best scenes don't involve the sport at all. Cinderella Man succeeds in that it's a story of a man struggling to keep his family above water, struggling to keep his dignity, and doing it the only way he can. The film opens at the end of James Braddock's (Russell Crowe) first reign in the boxing world. His coach, Jim Gould (Paul Giamatti), has placed him in a fight that gives him the chance to increase his purse back up to $75 per match. The increase in pay would do wonders for the state of living his family has degraded to. His wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger), and his three kids live in an apartment in Jersey with the overdue bills have piled up. Unfortunately, James loses his match in the most embarrassing of ways. It's so bad that his license to fight is revoked. To make matters worse, his right hand's been broken, making his sporadic shifts at the docks a fight to keep his injury hidden. But the injury turns out to be something of a blessing. Because he can't use his right hand, James strengthens up what's usually his weak arm in the ring, making him a brutal force with both hands. A few months later, after having to send the kids off to live at a relative's house, Gould offers James one more fight. He doesn't have the license back, it's just a one night stand in the ring. To the surprise of everyone, even himself, Braddock wins the fight, making headline news and starting the uphill battle for the sport yet again. The problem with Cinderella Man is that if you've seen the preview you know the story of the film up until the climax. From there, you can figure out the ending based simply on the title. It's no secret. But that's not the point of Cinderella Man. The point is in studying the character of James Braddock. There's great humanity in his story. Howard smartly decides to steer the story away from boxing and focus mainly on the family's interaction with the time period. And the time period Howard creates is nothing less than flawless. Cinderella Man is of course set in the American Depression era, with all but a lucky few down on their luck and struggling to keep a decent lifestyle. Howard emphasizes this lifestyle with a great visual style that borders on Film Noir. There's a gorgeous, most memorable shot, where the boxing ring is lit by a spotlight from afar in the far left side of frame. Surrounding the ring are dimly lit droves of people, all seeming to crush closer and closer to the ring. On the right side of shot, strikingly close, is the silhouette of a common man in a hat and suit, watching the show as the audience is, completely entranced. It's this sort of dramatic time period visuals that fuels the emotional power of the film. And completely entranced is what we are throughout the film. Because between the story of Braddock's home life, we're treated to some true achievements in boxing film. Particularly the final fight brings us to the very edge of our seat. And even knowing how the film will end, Howard still manages to keep us on our toes, sweating and twitching in our seat like Braddock's coach Joe Gould beside the ring. By the end of the film we feel satisfied. It's a feel-good film, but not in the cheesy way Miracle was last years. It's feel-good in that we feel alright leaving Braddock to return to his family in Jersey, knowing he's got the cash in his pocket to pay the bills and his dignity still holed up inside. Howard has brought us through Braddock's most important time of his life and immersed us in it through brilliant direction, great acting, and a screenplay worthy of awards. As I said before, Howard successfully transcends the formula that originally bound him. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",8,0,0,13 June 2005
V for Vendetta," a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time
","V for Vendetta rating: 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the near-future paired with an operatic comic book tale of love, mystery, and a Guy-Fawkes-masked rebellion. Our hero is V (Hugo Weaving), a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive, a taste for the eloquent, and a hand for knife-wielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice (or maybe hostage) is Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen (kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world) as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler (John Hurt), whose persona is shown primarily through a five-story tall projection of his ever-angry head. The exposition for this near-future lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middle-eastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra 'England Prevails!' Rest assured, however, this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps; it's a world that's, instead, very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment, refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic, after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th, when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth, V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network, he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution, with the evolution of Evey's politics, the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot, and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. 'Remember, remember the fifth of November.' What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler, the news media is heavily clouded, our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks; not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of today--where the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of Communism--V for Vendetta's answer to that question is a sure-handed yes. But V for Vendetta is no heavy-handed political allegory. At its heart, V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance, V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty bald-headed scene of lust, realize first that there also is a master-grasshopper dynamic between Evey and V. The romance is formed as an understatement and rarely addressed, let to simmer below the surface and lend more chemistry to scenes that would otherwise ring hollow.Natalie Portman may have stolen the tabloid exposure with her shiny shaved head, but Hugo Weaving is the masked performance that steals the show. Much of the role's success lies in the writing, for V is made not to be simply a mask. There's a theme throughout the film asking whether behind masks of revolution, there lie fighting men and women, or only their ideals. V answers this question with charisma. Contradicting the common mantra that masked figures must be laconic, V, in fact, probably has the most lines of all. The character is full and rich with quirks and personality, but still exists with that essential air of mystery. Weaving achieves the same level of iconic performance that he did with Agent Smith in The Matrix. It really is that good.There's been debate over the quality of adaptation the Wachowski Brothers offered to Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Moore has publicly separated himself from the film, quoting in the New York Times last week that 'the screenplay's rubbish.' Well, before we all walk away from the ticket line, remember primly that Alan Moore will be the first to tell you himself that he is a selfish, pretentious prick. He knows it, and we know it. Let's move on. The screenplay's fine. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment. We'll first shake our heads at the sentimental, soft-focus flashbacks and silly sub-plot for 'nuclear human experimentation'; but when mulled over, we realize it's just the comic book mentality showing its spots. After all, V wouldn't start all his sentences with v-words had this film shunned its comic roots. And anyway, V for Vendetta is a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time.",9,560,805,14 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights just isn't funny enough
","Talladega Nights reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 2 out of 4Talladega Nights is for all intensive purposes the sequel to Anchorman. Obviously, the two films don't share similarities in the story department, but each hand Will Ferrell a blank check to do absolutely whatever he chooses to do. They might as well each be called The Will Ferrell Movies Part I and II. There's nothing wrong with this formula as Mr. Ferrell has time and again proved his charm and comic worth. I don't mind if he parades about my theatre screen for ninety minutes because whatever he says, let's admit it, will make us laugh. No, for all the Ferrell exploitation, he's not the film's fault. Plainly and without any critical pretension, Talladega Nights just isn't funny enough. The script gets lost on its way to funny and tries too many back-alleys and shortcuts to get there. It ends up stone dead on the road, engine failed and silent, with only a handful of misused miles under its belt.As Anchorman spoofed the news media corporations and told the story of its outrageous, unexplainable title character, Talladega Nights tries to do the same for the world of NASCAR and another title character, Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell). Ever since he was birthed in the back of a hotrod at ninety-five miles per hour, Ricky Bobby has wanted to go fast. It's an ambition that carries him to adulthood as he works the pit stop crew for a slacking NASCAR racer. When the racer walks away from the track halfway through the Talladega Competition, Ricky is called upon as replacement. Summoning the courage from a well of deep ambition and frighteningly shallow intelligence he takes the car to the finish line in an amazing show of speed and natural racing talent. Soon he's the face of the Talladega Speedway and racing alongside his best friend, Cal Noughton Jr. (John C. Reilly), under the support of a volley of sponsors. It all comes crumbling down, however, when Formula 1 racer, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), ends his winning streak and puts Bobby in the hospital after a horrific crash. With his wife gone and his fortune squandered, Bobby must climb back to greatness from the lowly life of a bicycle-riding pizza delivery boy.Anchorman succeeded in that its spoofs were focused mostly on the Ron Burgundy character. His portrait drew enough satire from the news agency corporations that it didn't need to throw in any extra jabs. Talladega Nights isn't as satisfied with the humor extracted from Ricky Bobby, and tries generating laughs from every southern stereotype racing culture has to offer. The stereotypes, although abundant, don't always mesh to form consistencies. The film wanders off into derogatory homophobia, then to white trash child-rearing, and back around again to the general consensus that southerners are plainly dumb. All of it's given and taken with good humor and no semblance of offense, but often the generalized jokes fall heavily flat and without a shake of laughter from the audience. The flailing humor also often latches onto characters and prevents us from finally connecting with them when sentimentality is offered and sympathy wanted. So when Ricky Bobby goes fast again and wins his life back, it's nothing more than a technicality that draws out the conclusion.But discussing the mechanics of the comedy genre doesn't quite explain the failure of Talladega Nights. The film simply isn't funny enough. When we should be convulsing with laughter, we're checking our watches. Will Ferrell can jump and scream and run around all he likes (and he does), but the screenplay just doesn't make the cut. I wanted to be red in the face and sore in the abdomen when I left the theatre, but instead I was checking the date on the bathroom's calendar, hoping that the upcoming Borat will fill in the gap Ricky Bobby has left.Copyright ©2006 Sam Osborn.
