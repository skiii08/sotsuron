50 First Dates," 'First' time's a charm
","Like him or not, Adam Sandler is a talented guy.  Like many of his films, '50 First Dates' is a combination of frat-house humor and luke-warm romanticism.  The object of his desire is once again Drew Barrymore, and to the filmmakers credit, this is the least annoying she's been in a while.  All of the Adam Sandler Players are present, and Sandler does a fine job of allowing his co-stars some of the biggest laughs of the movie.  He is unselfish in that way, and it makes his movies more enjoyable.  The benefactors in this particular case are Rob Schneider and Sean Astin.  Producer Sandler's true talent though is what he can get away with.  This may be the dirtiest PG-13 movie I've ever seen.  There is no nudity. There is cursing, but it's innocuous.  The movie is riddled with explicit sexual innuendo from start to finish.  It's amazing what the ratings board let go.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't offended in the least.  I actually think movies are better when they're unfiltered and not watered down to get a specific rating.  This could have very easily been rated R though.  Taking pre-teens may not be a great idea.  If you do, you'll have more 'splaining to do than Lucy Ricardo.",Null,0,0,13 February 2004
Elf," Will Power
","It takes a pretty big pair of snowballs to release a Christmas movie this early in November.  The studio has to have enough confidence in their film that it will last at least to Christmas, which is more than a month and a half away.  After seeing 'Elf', I understand why New Line was so confident.  'Elf' is destined to become a Christmas classic.  In the footsteps of Chevy Chase's Clark W.. Griswold III; and Bill Murray's Francis Xavier Cross, Will Ferrell's Buddy the Elf will be rerun for years to come on the Superstation for generations to enjoy.  I was skeptical at first that he could pull it off.  Where Eddie Murphy and Robin Williams have succeeded in making the leap to family films, others have failed.  Ferrell seems at his best when he can be a little raunchy and unpredictable.  His Frank the Tank in 'Old School' was fantastic, but could he do the family thing?  Absolutely.  He has added another dimension to his acting, and this could prove to be a major turn in his career.  Also adding new dimension is John Favreau.  Favreau has made a career writng and directing films that are dialogue driven.  'Made' is one of the funniest films of the last decade, so for him to take on 'Elf' must have been a harrowing decision.  He has eloquently captured the tone of what a good Christmas movie should be, and should be commended.  'Elf' also features great camp performances (which I will not spoil) and James Caan delivers his best performance since 'Bottle Rocket.'  A new Christmas classic is here, one that made this Grinch's heart grow large.",Null,0,1,7 November 2003
Radio," Nothing But Static
","Playing a character with mental retardation must be difficult.  Manyhave tried, few have succeeded.  It's a tightrope walk withconvincing portrayal on one side and ridicule on the other.  Thatbeing said, this year's Juliet Lewis Award goes to Cuba Gooding,Jr.  Take a dash of Gary Busey's teeth, and a pinch of Beetlejuicefrom 'The Howard Stern Show' and you have Gooding's Radio. The movie has no clear direction, and no clear conflict.  I guess themajor conflict is that some of the characters believe that Radio'spresence at a local high school's events are inappropriate, and a'distraction.'  And guess what...they're right.  He is a distraction, hedoes get in the way, and we are just supposed to accept it as'That's Radio!'  The movie's only positive note is Ed Harris as thecoach who tries to help Radio.  Harris is likable and performs anelegant southern brogue.  The true story behind this movie is acute little story.  But it probably would have been more appropriateas a story on Oprah or even a segment on '60 Minutes.'  Twohours of this sweetness was enough to send me running to theconcession stand for some insulin.",Null,0,0,31 October 2003
The Butterfly Effect," A Fine Piece of Ash
","All of life's mysteries are answered in the movies.  That loosely paraphrased Steve Martin line has held true for me for many years. So, how many times have you thought about freezing a moment in your past, and changing it?  Anyone who has seen 'Back to the Future' knows that you cannot alter the space/time continum, but it still poses a great question.  Moviegoers throughout the years would love to implement this tool.  Imagine if you could go back to a point in time when you hadn't yet seen 'Just Married' or 'My Boss's Daughter' and saved yourself the agony.  'The Butterfly Effect' is a whole 'nother can of larvae.  The puzzle-like screenplay is top-notch.  The weaving of the character's stories in various points of their lives is expertly crafted, and sometimes gutwrenching.  Ashton Kutcher holds down the fort very nicely.  It turns out he can do something besides scream really loud.  He VERY toned down.  It's the kind of career turn that he had to make,( if he wants to have a long career) and he does it nicely.  He's got many more turns to make, but this is a great first one.  Let's put it this way, he doesn't do anything to take away from the superb story.  The screenplay is the real star of this film (although is is nice to see Eric Stolz is alive and well.)  I was about ready to send out a search party for him and Spalding Gray.  So, even if you hate Kutcher, this Ash has turned another cheek; and DUDE! is it SWEET!",Null,0,1,23 January 2004
