Blade Runner 2049," Visually competent take on the original material while missing the point entirely.
","You can sum up the failure to understand the original by breaking down the main villains motivation, which is completely incoherent and incompatible with the original narrative. The claim is that the antagonist wishes to populate the solar system but can't produce enough fake humans and so is seeking the hidden secret of reproduction which was solved by the original creator before he died in the first film. So you have fake humans who are so cheap to make that they are deliberately given the lifespan of an iphone and the idea is replacing them with a system of reproduction and learning as slow as our own. 
There is some interesting interaction between the main character and his digital companion but they never really deal with whether the replicants are any less real than the ai. So in the end its barely a blade runner film as it throws away the original dilemma, it just kinds of assumes the answer.",Null,1,1,22 June 2018
First Man," A half baked effort, attempt to focus on a narrow scope fails
","Its an attempt at a character study, the usual personal tragedy drives the brooding, but there is no depth there. The massive scope of the project to put a man on the moon is barely hinted at, all you see is an attempt at a personal story and it still feels empty, you just see a man brood, as if mystery were enough. The lack of depth extends to the mission portions as well, lots of close up of faces, lots of quick cuts, but no clever illustration of what problems he faced and how he was solving them, you see quick cuts, his face, and random disorientation. Its the shortcut of a story teller who doesn't know how to tell a story and that pretty much sums up the movie.There are so many missed opportunities, in one scene Neil is in a class learning about his mission, but they show and say almost nothing. Simply showing the physics equations would have told the audience this was no ordinary man, he was aeronautical engineer who could understand such things. These are rudimentary techniques in story telling on film which is why its so perplexing.Just look at the first scene with the x15, compare it to the first scene of 'When we left the earth: The NASA Missions' which covered the very same flight and compare the impact, this films version just pales in comparison to a documentary's edit from a decade ago. 'Neil Armstrong X15 - When we left earth.' on youtube contains the clip. That 1 minute segment evokes more emotion and understanding than this film does over 2 hours. You are better served watching that well made documentary series than this mess of a film.",Null,1,3,24 December 2018
Captain Marvel," Beyond all the other sins, it is most of all Boring
","So many things wrong with this movie, main character is over powered from the get go so there is little evolution, just powerful to ridiculously over powered.The film has a chip on its shoulder the entire time, the narrative is weighed down by the politicsThe actress can't act, beyond her lack of charisma, every line she delivers is unbelievable. Its captain cosplay.The Skrulls look like rubber masks, the ability to speak and emote isn't there.The pop music soundtrack is just tacky.And something funny they abandoned from the original lore because it was inconvenient, the 'pink skinned' kree are the white n-words of that world, the blue skin rule over them. So a layer of depth was stripped from the story because they only wanted to fixate on gender politics.There are various other plot hole spoilers I won't get into here, but mostly, its just soulless and boring.",Null,13,20,14 July 2019
Passengers," Half baked science fiction so thoughtlessly conceived people understood something was wrong even if they couldn't articulate it.
","Nothing about this film makes sense and that undermines any story they were trying to tell. A 120 year one way journey brings up all sorts of questions, and instead they fixate on the dumbest one. The conceit is that the main character of the mechanic is paying his way to a new colony through his indentured servitude. His skills 120 years out of date by the time he arrives, what corporate waits 120 years for a return, let alone 240 years for their ship to return home with what exactly to pay for this? Space taxes? A 240 year old ship would be obsolete scrap making the round trip pointless. Every crew member on that ship may as well exist outside of normal time, returning home to everyone they know being dead for 240 years at a time, their skills also being 240 years out of date, how are they to continue in their careers. They further dig the hole into self defeating absurdity by demonstrating they have AI on the level of having moral concerns, able to deceive when necessary, and this is what they install on a nothing bot, this level of tech renders the entire crew obsolete, and makes the empty ship unable to interact or help him all the more absurd. Nothing about this world they constructed makes sense, people may have not been able to articulate it, but they felt it. It deserves the low rating it got. I mean seriously, why would anyone build a luxury cruise liner level ship for vacations where if you ever got home everyone you know would be long dead. It was a goodbye forever ship, and they turned it into a silly Jennifer Lawrence vehicle.
It kind of says everything that the mainstream media reviewers fixated on the silly politics of 'wage gaps' rather than the massive holes in the plot and just overall botched conception of the future when discussing this film. It could have been fixed so easily, just make them space Mormons, now they have a motivation which makes sense, and a moral and spiritual conflict to explore. Instead they took the easy route and explored nothing.",Null,1,2,12 March 2018
Knives Out," Decent mystery ruined by Rian's usual agenda
","Its an old fashioned whodunit mystery with Mr Bond putting on his best Kevin Spacey accent, and its likeability rides on de Arma's adorability as always. The problem is the rest of the cartoon is a bit heavy handed, the 'white' family are all terrible people, caricatures to the point where they even mention the kid is alt-right. The good people are of course illegals, but the film spoils its own message that people given everything are ruined with hypocrisy, it is after all an ideology built on inherent contradiction.",Null,2,8,5 January 2020
Ready Player One," Interesting but flawed concept now that people have actual experience with the limitations of VR
","Interesting but flawed concept now that people have actual experience with the limitations of vr its just a bit harder to take, because real vr is like a mummy simulation, you cant feel, you can't move, and your hands are useless, this isn't really solved in the film either and you have people running down the street with vr goggles on at some point. So there's a certain amount of cringe factor, with luscious visuals, but in the end people fighting over a video game is kind of ridiculous. Plus whats with the jewish lead casting in every Spielberg film, its becoming a bit on the nose. There was a time in the past when this would have played better, before the big bang theory and cosplayification of culture made hypersuperficial 'geek' interests mainstream, its gone past cringe at this pointThe fundamental problem with this film is that the world building is incomplete, they didn't make the world coherent and so it feels off no matter how much you try to suspend your disbelief. You have characters doing incredible moves in the game world while we are supposed to believe they are just waving their arms around in the real world. The level of immersion we are shown does not match up with the technology of that world. It doesn't matter if your sensory suit can shock you if you can't pick up even a coffee cup and feel its weight in your hand, the disconnect is simply too severe. If they had gone with a matrix style 'plugged' straight into the brain type experience then yes, all this could have been made plausible, but vr goggles with a bit of spandex simply doesn't cut it. Even if people aren't fully conscious of these problems, its likely noticed by all, and the disconnect simply prevents any real investment in the story. They thought more about the pop culture tie ins than in building the world itself, rendering the film as superficial as the cultural tie ins placed everywhere, almost at random, without meaning.",Null,0,2,22 June 2018
Bird Box," Thin premise taken way too far, only allegory is unintentional
","To save yourself in this society you must close your eyes. The lesson being Sandra Bullock's reality, sold the lie of 'you can have it all', she waited until it was too late and is now the 'adoptive mother' of african children.
The virtue signalling is blatant in this film, every minority is heroic and self sacrificing, the fallen are all white, the gun owner an angry man mad at the gay who again selflessly sacrifices himself as well.
So the only lessons were accidental, the cultural messages being put out by this set are pushing society to self destruction, and even as they are damaged themselves, they try to take others down with them.
Add the ending which was just tacked on as an unbelievable solution and you just don't have much of anything here. Star power in service of nothing.",Null,2,5,1 January 2019
Toy Story 4," Eat Pray Love Bopeep and boring
","The graphics have improved, the story has not, the contrivance wears thin with cloying attempts at cuteness. There isn't much of a greater meaning to the story, its just male doofus characters and the always strangely competent females, it goes through the motions and feels empty, new characters are just new attempts to sell toys.",Null,3,5,8 November 2019
Mr. Nobody," Way overrated on IMDb
","I see so many glowing reviews of this film cheerleading it on in some kind of effort to get a wider release I guess. It's a distortion of reality imho. It's a rather mediocre film that reeks of film subsidy abuse. Its got that bland look and feel of a film made in other countries as location substitution. To make it match, they suck the life out of everything.The sci-fi element just looks uninspired and cheap, even the cg is second-rate. For a TV film it would be pretty decent effects wise, but not for a Hollywood production.and of course the story, its a bunch of 'if only' and 'if I had' navel gazing nonsense. If your thing is watching leto go emo, then sure it might be for you, otherwise its just dull scene after dull scene, the narrative is an incoherent mess that makes you feel nothing at all. Another reviewer brought up the problem of clichés, and that's true, shots/ideas are ripped off from better films. It just all never comes together, and is never convincing as it jumps haphazardly from one version narrative to another, and so you don't care.",Null,15,42,19 July 2010
The Lion King," Uncanny valley of photo real yet lifeless animation
","The power of CG without soul or purpose. I watched the 4k in all its unsettling starkness, crisp hairs beside mud mouthed lip sink animation that just doesn't quite seem real. Like the previous remakes, things passable in animation are just creepy when made real. The animation in general is 99% there which just makes that 1% stand out all the more, and that's the problem, you are never immersed, because its just an examination of the artificial, a second rate copy of a first class original. Add the new woke stunt casting when the original chose the best fit for the job and this just becomes a first rate turd, not entertaining, just insulting to watch.",Null,1,1,15 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Kathleen Kennedy's crusade against the patriarchy #Imwithher the movie
","When the movies poster looks like a period stain, you know there is no one competent at the helm anymore. Star Wars has been dead since the prequels. Everything about this movie doesn't make sense, and is merely cosplay, these are people playing at being the part, all toe further 'representation', but the result is that they and the narrative becomes a superficial hollow shell. Look a girl with force powers, a girl storm trooper, a girl commander, who needs to explain anything, they were 'empowered' women, don't question it, don't think, you are paying for propaganda. I never thought there would be star wars films so bad they would make me respect Lucas's prequels, as bad as those were, they actually felt like star wars. This, just spits on the corpse as it feeds on it, because that is all these social progressive types can do, infiltrate and copy and subvert, they do not create anything genuine because its simply about power, and Kathleen Kennedy is going to destroy the value of the star wars in 2 films after this, and then she will take a swipe at destroying Indiana Jones. This is what happens when you give the #imwithher crowd free reign, they seek to destroy the 'patriarchy' which really means they seek to destroy all things good. They don't understand what makes a good narrative, mythic archetypes and all traditional things be damned, they seek to destroy it all.Kathleen Kennedy's hit list
