Requiem for a Dream," The images will stay with you
","I found this movie to be deeply disturbing.  Artistic, beautiful, thoughtful--and yet--replete with pure horror.  There are many layers of intensity and stress, and at times it is almost too much to take.  It is a shame that a film like this wasn't in the place of 'Traffic' as I believe they are both showing a *user* side of drugs--'Requiem' is just 100 times more powerful and provides an unsmugded picture of the gruesome reality of addiction (be it TV, weight-loss, prescription drugs, heroin...).'Requiem for a Dream' is not for the light hearted.  If you have caught your kids using drugs and want to scare them, I would show them this film.",8,0,0,24 July 2001
The Hangover," From a woman's perspective
","Because of the hype, I decided to give this one a try. I'm a fan of Wedding Crashers, Role Models, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and I expected this film to be of the same general caliber. It was, in many ways.However, this film is definitely a dude-flick (paralleling the *chick-flick*) as it explores the male-escape fantasy through a device I will not reveal due to IMDb's scary spoiler laws. I feel like it crossed the line several times in regards to a woman's sense of humor and her tolerance toward 'humor' using violent sexual offenses, pedophile-related jokes, and sexualized breastfeeding--hard to make the ladies bust out laughing with this list of serious icks and no-no's.The other annoying part of this film was its audience. Sadly, half the theater was filled with 'gentlemen' that had seen it before and were either yelling things like 'OH GOD, I LOVE THIS PART' before the scene happened, giggling during silences in the movie, or naming the item (repeatedly) that is making him laugh so hard in the first place.I think movies like this should be made, and I'm so glad men are laughing and enjoying themselves--but ladies--you may decide to just let the guys go ahead and enjoy this one their own. Having seen 'The Proposal' last weekend, I would definitely save my money and go see that with your girls instead. Hilarious, worth the ticket price, and a genuinely good time.",7,4,8,27 June 2009
Elizabeth," Cate is captivating
","There are a number of laudable performances in this movie, but Cate Blanchett's is truly outstanding.  It is worth viewing just to have her captivate your attention through Queen Elizabeth's story.One of the most interesting things I found about this film is how a woman in that time period was able to attain, and ultimately succeed using the kind of power that would never be connected with a woman.  Elizabeth's struggles, betrayals, and conquests are elegantly shown through poignant direction, and tender execution by Ms. Blanchett.This is a satisfying, powerful film that is enjoyable to experience (even more than once!).",10,0,1,31 July 2001
Closer," Satisfying
","It was nice to finally see a movie with some meaty dialogue--wit, bite, banter--it seems to be missing from so many films lately. Yes, the material is not uplifting, but it was intriguing enough to keep me in my seat. It was hard to buy the absolutely stunning Natalie Portman as a stripper--she was magnetic, spritely, and interesting. It was also nice to see Julia Roberts playing a character against her 'type'--I was quite taken with some of her more difficult scenes. As for those silver tongued British men--well, they didn't disappoint. The passion in Mr. Owen's eyes was so real, so literate--again, interesting to watch. Worth the theater trip.",8,6,11,3 December 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Smooth
","'Ocean's Eleven' was fun, well-oiled, and smooth--like silk on glass.  I'm not sure the actual *heist* logistics were completely intact--but I really didn't care.  It seemed believable enough, and I didn't get bogged down (and frankly, bored) with minutia the way I did while watching 'The Score.'What is to be enjoyed about this film is its perfect finesse, its thoughtful dialogue, its excellent timing, and its numerous comedic bonuses (hats off to Affleck and Caan).  There is a certain elegance about this film that I appreciated--no bullet holes, blood, or violence--yet it managed a real sense of suspense and climactic thrill without them.  Refreshing.This film had class; it didn't tell you that it did, it showed you how it's done.",8,0,0,10 December 2001
Twilight," Aliens, Not Vampires
","Book adaptations are always difficult, and genre fiction has a hard time hiding its generic qualities on film. The Good: Extreme Longshots of Pacific Northwest; Anna Kendrick's astute critiques of the story itself; the unexpected fits of laughter I had with my daughter at emotionally dislocated scenes (we laugh/cried when Jacob & Bella's dad's 'goofed around' in the background. Who pokes a guy in a wheelchair?). The Bad: the costumes, the hair, the lack of humor, Edward's complete lack of confidence, and the Cullens in general. Ugh.There is no way to defend the series as a literary triumph, but they were absolutely fun to read. The film was not fun to watch. I felt sorry for the director who had to stick to the author's color palette, which has the visual dynamism of mop water, and contact lenses that actually made the vampires look like aliens. Instead of being the shrewd students of human anatomy, physiology, & psychology, the Cullens are conspicuous outsiders.I mean, a doctor in the hospital with winter- white painted skin and yellow eyes--in florescent lighting--would be hard to blend in. Are you sick, doctor? Here's the solution: regard the Cullens as aliens, not vampires. It makes a little more sense.",3,0,2,13 November 2017
Dumb and Dumber," Where the Beer Flows Like Wine
","This is, by far, the best Farrelly Brothers comedy to date.  Few comedies can maintain the kind of comedic stamina and brilliance that Dumb & Dumber does from its title to the credits.  It has just the right combination of innocence and absurdity to make it funny.  What is most enjoyable about this film are the numerous and precious one-liners--from John Deere letters to generalizations about senior citizens--it provides so many opportunities to laugh.",10,0,0,3 July 2001
Singin' in the Rain," Back When Sweat Was Involved
","I had put off seeing this movie because of the tremendous amount of build-up it has associated with it.  'The Best Movie Musical of All Time' is a large title to uphold and...well...it just couldn't do it.  Now, before I get pummelled with rotten tomatoes, I'd like to point out the things I really liked about the film.First, and foremost, watching Gene Kelly dance was very entertaining.  He really made it look effortless, and it was so delightful to see a man of his build and facial expressions doing the kind of dancing he was doing.  One just doesn't get the opportunity to see that in film anymore, and I think it would still be received appreciatively today.Jean Hagen's performance was hilarious.  She was very believable and no 'dumb blonde' either (well, of course she was!).  To me she was the true scene stealer who gave a timeless comedic performance that will continue to be revered.I think one of the reasons this movie will not be timeless as a whole, however, is because of the Donald O'Connor character.  There is no doubt this man was a product of a time when Hollywood actors had to work extremely hard to earn their money (I'm thinking of his dancing solo where he defies gravity) but there is an element to his performance that screams 'I'M TRYING TOO HARD TO ENTERTAIN YOU' and it is hard to ignore.    I found it to be really annoying, particularly in the 'Good Morning' segment, which in and of itself, was a terribly silly concept and situation.  Not a funny silly either--more of a preposterous silly.I don't think a film like this could be redone, and I don't think it is supposed to be.  It is just one of those films you are supposed to see because it represents a certain time in American film history, and it can be appreciated for some of the things it is missing.  Hard work was definitely not one of them.",6,4,12,10 August 2001
