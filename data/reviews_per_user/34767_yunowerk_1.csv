Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as people say it is
","Although Jar-Jar and Anakin are incredibly annoying characters I still think this is a great family film and good for any star wars fans (although it nowhere near as good as the originals) overall it is a pretty good movie especially the lightsaber duels but sadly the characters of what could of been an amazing film do grate quite a bit.the story is interesting but as I said not as good as the original trilogy, even some of the new characters are good but pretty much the only one worth watching is qui-gon jinn.Another part I liked was the visuals & sound these were very well made although it can be very goofy at time which a lot of hardcore star wars fans don't like a favourite scene of mine was the podrace that was a plus.overall i think people should try it at least once for the lightsaber duel at the end and the podrace.5/10",5,0,2,5 April 2016
