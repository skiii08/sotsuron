Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Take what you can and give nothing back.
","Despite a number of naysayers telling us that Pirates of the Caribbean has lost its magic, this is completely not the case. Being a fan of all the Pirates movies I wasn't disappointed with this new installment and look forward to more.Not resting on its laurels On Stranger Tides takes the magic of the trilogy and then mixes it up abit by taking a bit of a serious turn, without losing the great humour and characterisation.The story is good and could easily stand on its own without there having been three prior films. I saw it in 3D however having seen other films in 3D I felt it was more of a gimmick than making the film better. I did't feel that the 3D was necessary to the film and felt that the film worked fine without it.The film was a good stand alone installment into the franchise and hopefully paves the way for another trilogy. POSSIBLE TINY SPOILER BELOWKeith Richards makes a return for a cameo as Jacks dad and was as fun as his part in At Worlds End but it would have been awesome if he had had a much bigger part in the film because he plays the character so well.SPOILER OVER AND OUTThe franchise has kept the best parts Jack, Barbosa and Mister Gibbs and then managed to add some new great characters. I thought Black Beard was well played and Penelope Cruz pulled off a good performance.Ultimately this is a great film and any true Pirates fan will love this movie just as much as the others.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Autobots roll out! And never return please.
","This film has no redeemable features what so ever, the few good scenes are overshadowed by the horror. Let me say I'm a Transformers fan & liked the first two movies & expected this to be similar to them, well it isn't.Michael Bay has single handedly destroyed all credibility the Transformers had & that man should never be allowed to make another movie. I wasn't a Michael Bay critic before seeing this film but now hate the man for ruining something I love.What's worse is this movie will be deemed a critical box office success based on all the poor people who pay to see it and go away feeling like I do.If I had wanted to watch a humans vs aliens/robots insert generic bad guy here then I would have watched one of those movies. No I payed to watch Transformers instead I got about 30 minutes in total scenes of Transformers & two hours plus of Michael Bay making American soldiers look cool and badass.Transformers have been fighting a war for centuries, they are supposed to be hardened veterans instead they are used for comic relief & to make humans look cool with the ways they can kill some huge massively armoured and armed robots.The characters are all morons and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is the most annoying talentless person I have ever had to look at, just seeing her face on the screen in 3D no less made me angry and cringe at the same time. Also they shouldn't have called it Transformers it should have been called Optimus Prime because he's pretty much all you are going to see, the other Transformers are just thrown in as faceless, voiceless filler characters. The 3D is also terrible and pointless I have seen several movies in 3D recently and it was totally under used and wasn't even consistent not being used throughout the movie and the movie was about an hour to long, I prefer long movies but this one actually dragged along not going anywhere.Sadly I could keep coming up with things I hated about this movie & very little I liked about it, this is the first time I have come away from a movie utterly disappointed & feeling ripped off. I went with my girlfriend & two friends, she liked the first two movies but wasn't a Transformers fan & she didn't like this movie, like me my two friends are life long fans & are utterly disgusted with the waste of space this film was. I am a very disgruntled fan who going into the movie ignored the negative comments and was very open about what I was going to see, what I saw was utter disappointment.",1,60,105,6 July 2011
