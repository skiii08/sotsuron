Skyfall," Great potential but very disappointing
","The movie had great potential but falls flat because of 2 main flaws1.) technology in the movie is very inconsistent. It feels like the movie is trying to give nods to old bond movie tech, but the setting is in modern day, so it gets 'confusing'. For example, MI6 somehow has the ability to track agents out in the field (with pin point accuracy), but for some reason it's range is limited (suggests radio or air wave based tracking). They never explain what tech is used to track the agents, and why they can track them some times and not others. Since they mention satellites, why wouldn't they just use GPS chips? Later in the movie, Bond gets a distress transmitter, that is radio based, really? radio based? and the size of the transmitter is huge! (size of a SD card) that Bond has to turn on manually!! But somehow, the range of the radio based transmitter is huge! He turns it on on the way to a remote abandoned island with nothing in sight, but MI6 is able to send agents there.And somehow, everything is connected to the network and can be hacked. 2.) for some reason, everyone in the movie is stupid (or just makes the most stupid and wrong decision someone can make). It reminds me of the beginning of Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra is portraying a horror movie victim who chooses a banana over a gun, runs towards to woods instead of the city, etc... Here is a list of some of them<ul><li>Why is the list of all MI6 agents on a laptop hard-drive??? Why isn't it in a server locked behind heavily guarded gates and not connected to an external network??</li></ul><ul><li>In the beginning, when Bond is fighting with the bad guy on top of the train, and his partner has a risky shot and M tells her to shoot. Bond was fully aware of the situation and order (because he had a ear piece) but decides NOT to get out of the way to give his partner a clean shot!! Really?? </li></ul><ul><li>same segment, you are MI6, you know the bad guy is on a train, send freaking backup! eye in the sky, something. </li></ul><ul><li>the bad guy from the beginning of the movie is hired make a hit. But, its so stupid for some many reasons. </li></ul>1. the target is in the company of the employer's location and company 2. assassin goes to this nice building and kills security guards to get to a nice vantage point, to shoot the target in the next building (but that next building is literally right next door (like 50 yards!)!!<ul><li>then MI6 building gets attacked, so they decide to move it to a more secure location. Except</li></ul>1. the attack was later learned to be hacking of the gas line, then what's the point of moving to a new location, when that new location can still and does get hacked so easily!2. the new location had heavy security at the front entrance, but there are a million other entrances that someone can just way in/out of (with no guards or security measures at these other entrances) How is that secure???? <ul><li>later on the main baddie gets caught on 'purpose' so he get in to talk to M. And more stupid stuff follows</li></ul>1. Q, being a ultra smart guy, decides to plug the enemies laptop right into their network!! (really??) and gets hacked2. The bad guy escapes, and then attacks M who is at a meeting with the government. Why bother getting caught if you are not after anything at MI6??3. a meeting with the head of MI6 and government officials, yet the place had really bad security (only regular cannon folder). Really?? 5 guys can just walk in and kill all the security guards without them putting up a fight or alarm?<ul><li>then Bond decides that its a good idea to use M as bait to lure out the bad guy. But more stupid stuff follows:</li></ul>1. why must it be done alone? why not get more guns, ammo, armor, etc... 2. the baddies come for M, its a long road to the house from the gate, where the baddies are wide open as they walk towards the house. Yet stupid Bond and gang does not freaking pick off the baddies. Instead they wait till they are at the house!I really wanted to like the movie, but too many points in the movie I went WTF? really? Why would anyone with some common sense make those decisions??",2,16,30,15 December 2012
