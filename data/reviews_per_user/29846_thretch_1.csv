The Ring," Poorest Quality Control
","The camera crew, the director and production company should all be ashamed of this film.  The boom mike was visible in at least a dozen scenes, many times blatantly so.  Also, a member of the crew was visible in a carved out niche in the well.  Faces were cropped in a pompous imitation of a Bergman film.  The entire theater actually laughed throughout most of the second half of the movie.",3,3,6,11 November 2002
