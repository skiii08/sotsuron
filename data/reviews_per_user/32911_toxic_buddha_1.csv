Hereditary," The meaning of the word horror
","Many movies that came out lately though being called horrors are not horrors in a sense. Some of them are trying to stand out by sudden screamers, some of them - by gore. Therefore instead of actually induce sense of horror in auditory it induces completely different emotions like disgust for example. To really be horror from my point of view movie need an atmosphere not graphic or effects or loud noises. Hereditary has just that.
Everything : sound, acting, environment creating oppressing atmosphere of despair. No jumpscares or gore needed. Add to this pretty elaborate scenario that not so easy to understand from singular view and you get greatest horror i have seen for quite a long time.",9,0,3,20 December 2018
