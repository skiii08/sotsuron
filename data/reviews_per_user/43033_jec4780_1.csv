Saturday Night Fever," Whatta Movie
","Saturday Night Fever, one of the greatest disco dancing movies ever made. John Travolta played the character Tony Manero. Tony was a slick dresser with his bell bottom trousers get up and let us not forget about the slicked back hair. The theme revolves around a young man that wants to be accepted and want to fit in. Tony feels on top of the world when he is dancing. Without his dancing he feels hopeless and has really nothing else going for him. When Tony is in the club performing his dance moves he has so many people routing him and gets the attention he is seeking. At home he received nothing but negative attention and his family is not routing him on and thinks he has nothing going for him at all.The lighting in the film made those white bell bottoms and moves come to life on the dance stage. I enjoyed the dancing and disco music during the show. The outfits with the help of the lighting seem to bedazzle me during the dancing scenes. Even though the move had a lot of dancing it revolved around a young man wanting to be accepted and gaining that acceptance through art. The lighting angles showcased his moves and allowed the glistening of the light to reflect just right and made Tony shine on the stage, man he is good.Amazing to see a man getting ready for his night on the town, different perspective from other movies and these extreme outfits and slicked back hair provided him with the acceptance he desired. The movie also shreds light on unexpected pregnancy and men in general even in this day and time wanting to have sex with anything that walks in the back seat of car and even Tony basis his attraction on physical attributes. The film even though it took place in a different time era the message is still loud and clear even today. Looks seem to be the most important factor.However like the song Neil McCoy sings that has a line that 'looks are not that important just icing on a cake. The world has came a long way with stereotyping and discrimination but there is still work left to do and Tony begins to understand by the end of the movie that there is more to live this looks. Lets not forget that we all get old and loose are hair or gain wait and we won't have our looks for very long.",Null,0,0,15 December 2010
