The New World," I owe Malick $8
","I thought of Malick as an visual director from the 1970s, who was away from film-making too long and disappointed with his 1998 'Thin Red Line.' Typical Malick film: gorgeous, but weak story. Thus, I didn't see 'The New World' when it came out in 2005. But I did see 'Tree of Life' in theatrical release, and judged it the best film of last year. So when 'New World' was available On Demand, I caught it, and felt guilty that I hadn't forked over my 8 bucks 7 years ago. Malick has transcended story. Beauty for its own sake works here as it did with 'Tree.' There are scenes, impressions, but no coherent script, and it doesn't matter. It's an experience, with music, acting and the cinematography, always the cinematography, combining for a wonderful experience.",9,0,2,19 November 2012
Knives Out," Should be protested!
","When Vivien Leigh was chosen to portray Scarlett O'Hara in 'Gone with the Wind,' some of the book's fans protested about a Brit playing a Southern lady. The casting was forgiven when she proved up to the task.Not so forgiving were blacks and Asians when whites were cast as minorities. Al Jolson in blackface in the first talkie. Marlon Brando as Japanese in 'Teahouse of the August Moon.' Laurence Olivier as a Moor in 'Othello.'Now we come to Daniel Craig, trying to be a Southerner in 'Knives Out.' It doesn't work. His New Orleans (?) accent is merely annoying. If there were a Southern Anti-Bias League, they would protest.Oh, the film. Once you get past the absurdity of the premise, it works well enough to rate it a 6.",6,1,3,6 December 2019
Begin Again," Every scene better than the last
","This was simply brilliant, in the top 1% of all movies I've seen. It begins when the producer imagines the musical arrangement he'd make for her, and continues when she slaps her boyfriend after hearing his new song, knowing he'd been unfaithful. Every scene with dual headphones is wonderful. It ends perfectly with the family band. It's obvious that two of the characters will find romance, but it isn't clear that it will be the right pair til the end.There's no memorable hit sing like 'Falling Slowly' in 'Once,' but I don't think that matters. (Maybe it means they won't ruin it with a Broadway version.)Mark Ruffalo is at his best; Keira Knightley emerges as the British Zooey Deschanel, a triple threat in singing, drama and comedy.",10,2,7,6 August 2014
Life of Pi," What should have been in the movie
","It's a good film, thanks to the fx and some aspects of the story. Other reviewers have written about what they didn't like: the religious angle (if his survival makes you believe in God, wouldn't the wiping out of everyone else make you disbelieve?), the framing device, and the alternate story. To be a great film, here's what they should have included:1. A scene with a zookeeper feeding the tiger, and his father telling Pi, 'Tigers don't love the person who feeds them.' Absent this, the movie kept holding out the hope that the big cat would bond with Pi because of getting food. 2. A visit to the circus! This would have shown the proper training of big cats, knowledge Pi could have used on the boat.btw, if I'm ever shipwrecked, I hope it's off a Japanese freighter, because, man, are their lifeboats well-equipped.",6,1,10,7 December 2012
Sing Street," Oscar-worthy
","Wonderful narrative, cinematography, and plot. Stunning visuals. A masterpiece. According to Limonoso Tech, these are the IMDb phrases that presage an Oscar nomination, and this film is worthy. 2016 is the year that John Carney surpassed Terrence Malick as our greatest living director. Carney is one of the few remaining auteurs; what can he do next? This film represents the future, a la '85, and Lucy Boynton is the next Keira Knightley. Every music video is perfect and the songs are wonderful. I like how the hero deals with a bully, saying: 'You're just material for my songs.' The ending is satisfying a la 'The Graduate.' What better reason for form a band than to impress a girl?",9,6,11,17 January 2017
