The Rock," In my top 10
","1 of my favourite movies of all time.
From start to finish it has a amazing score that i can listen to just the music and puts a smile on my face. Have seen this well into double figures and still enjoy it as much as the first time. The action, humour (including some well placed sarcasm) and grit is perfectly balanced throughout, add the musical score and it also gives me goosebumps even to this day. The Rock has stood the test of time and think it always will. Great cast and story not been any like it since. I believe a lot have tried but just end up being over the top and just pure cheese.",10,1,1,13 June 2020
The Irishman," Good to have them back together.
","Was a good movie in general, worth watching. But I think that there's a few area's of political correctness that really stood out considering the era its set in, which did have an effect on the feel of it, to me anyway. Cast gave great performance's and great to have Joe not playing a lunatic, fantastic work.
Will be watching again soon",8,2,5,3 December 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Awesome!!!!!!!
","This was long awaited. but it was well worth it. it was awesome. i was a bit unsure about Anne Hathaway as catwoman(Selina) but was very surprised with what i saw it was great.The story was great,the effects were just fantastic.Again Christian Bale still got it, great as normal.But for me the person that stole the show was Tom Hardy he didn't have a lot to say throughout, his presence was just wow so happy he got the part such a great actor and showed it in this movie. Although it was a long film i enjoyed every second of it. I also took my partner with me and she wasn't impressed when i told her how long it was but she also enjoyed it as much as i did. All i can say now is it was a great end to a great all round trilogy.",10,5,10,5 September 2012
