Scarface," Grandiose, bloodyminded and implacable
","This is one of my all time favorites.If the movie has a flaw, it's that it comes at you like a raging bull. It doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him. ''Scarface'' is as voracious and unyielding a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination.Moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, it wails and gnashes, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate.Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress, ''Scarface'' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.",10,327,478,18 December 2004
Billy Elliot," Unprepossessed, humorous and genuinely moving
","There are so many things that could have gone terribly wrong with this film. It could have turned out as dreary, faux-realist prole-pornography. It could have turned out as a swooning paean on Northern English sensibility, replete with postcard cinematography. It could have turned out as a grimly activist protest against bourgeois conformism and capitalist oppression.It turns out to be an aptly scored, superbly acted and strikingly shot masterpiece. Vividly edited and briskly plotted, we follow young Billy as he fumbles his boxing lessons and discovers ballet during the great miner's strikes in the 80s.The inevitable tension that develops between Billy and his father is played out among a cast of memorable characters: Billy Fane's appearance as the seedy, misanthropic piano player is brief but hilarious; Julie Walters' rendition of the chain-smoking ballet teacher is simply iconic.The depth and detail in this movie evoke countless bittersweet images: the way Billy's gritty neighbourhood is framed so as to show the majestic and tranquil sea in the distance, glistening with Olympian indifference; the menacing, surreal omnipresence of authority in the form of the British police force; the dignified despair of a town library which has been relegated to a mobile home.Unprepossessed, humorous and genuinely moving.",9,3,4,13 March 2005
Lost in Translation," Sweet and brimming with atmosphere
","True to its title, Lost in Translation forgoes writing and dialogue in favor of richly textured photography, carefully selected music, and subtly implied significance.It works, up to a point. There's only so much you can convey by implication, and this may leave the movie feeling either pretentious or shallow.That said, there is an undeniable sensitivity to the production. The camera gorges itself on swirls of grainy color, while delicate and precise editing keeps it from being self-absorbed. The musical choices give off all the right cues and frequently carry entire shots.All in all a beautifully executed mood piece, if timid in its exploration of the underlying themes.",7,2,4,24 February 2005
No Country for Old Men," Intrigued but disappointed
","From the very first frame this movie sets up an atmosphere of quiet anxiety and dignified despair. It is a very good movie, superbly shot and scripted, with great timing and fantastic acting. But it is too self-conscious to be engrossing, and as the movie progresses, the sombre gravitas becomes a bit of a caricature, perhaps even a crutch.Despite being a truly great work of film making, on some level it fails to connect. It lacks the will to persuade that its uncompromising vision serves a need, and lacks the energy to make up for the non-sequiturs in the plot.Initial viewing left me intrigued but disappointed. Will likely watch again.",6,3,7,31 December 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A cross between mud wrestling and figure skating
","It's certainly arousing to see a woman in a skintight motorsuit get smeared in sweat and blood and guts for hours on end and Tarantino certainly revels in the humiliation of his muse.The camera dwells with relish on her bruised and bloodied face as she pleads with Bill to spare her life, before she gets shot in the head. We share an intimate appraisal of Uma's potential as a comatose sex object. We partake in every painful fumble when Uma, her legs paralyzed and her nightgown drenched in blood, drags herself to safety.And it goes on and on and on: she gets buried alive, beats her fists into a bloody pulp trying to escape, then, covered in dirt, staggers across the road: a horrible mess of a woman, a mindless zombie. Funny, to be sure. But also something else.All throughout both films she gets shot, stabbed, slashed and thrown across rooms with such remarkable gusto, and she slams into walls and furniture with such satisfying thuds, that you start to wonder how the hell you're supposed to maintain an attitude of ironic detachment and cool appreciation of Tarantino's kitschy aesthetic.Underneath the stunning visuals, the beautiful choreography, and clever references, is the rousing lure of sadism and brutality. If only Tarantino would be honest about it, instead of coming up with a paper-thin 'strong woman' motif to justify his indulgence.'Kill Bill' is thrilling and pretty, but also dishonest and demeaning.",3,13,22,18 December 2004
There Will Be Blood," Like watching plate tectonics
","Maybe we have exhausted the possibilities of a particular kind of film-making. Maybe there is only so much you can tell when you forgo explanation, when every motive is ambiguous, when events unfold with the unpredictability and unknowability of life itself. Maybe there is a limit to what you can show without telling. Or maybe, 'There Will Be Blood' just failed at showing what it needed to tell.The first part of the film shows a tough, bitter oil man seeking his fortune in an isolated backwater town. It is suggested that he exploits his son and the community in his quest for oil, but we also see him care for his son and the community appears to prosper.Prone to drink and a violent temper, he commits a few atrocious acts and then the movie jumps forward a number of years to show that he has become a monster. Then the film ends.In between there is really no tension or dramatic conflict. While the main character is played evocatively, I couldn't tell you what his significance is, either historically, as a moral example, or for the surrounding cast. He is presented as a force of nature, without comment or context.Which makes this film like watching plate tectonics. For a long time nothing happens, then something erupts, then nothing happens. The causes remain hidden deep underground. It might make for oil, but doesn't make good film.",6,4,8,11 January 2009
WALLÂ·E," Thoroughly enjoyable
","Despite having lead characters made out of metal and shiny plastic, this film has got heart & guts & balls. The visual detail is breathtaking and the animation damn near flawless. Just five minutes into the movie you already feel for WALL-E. No small feat, given that there are no supporting characters, except for a cockroach, and there is no dialogue, no voice-over. Then you realize that not only are you sympathizing with a robot - you are sympathizing with a robot that exists only as bits in a rendering farm. The level of craftsmanship here is amazing.Trigger happy EVE is one of the strongest female characters in film since Ripley in Alien. Note to film makers: strength is about being being independent. It is not about striking awkward martial arts poses in spandex or form-fitting leather outfits.It would have been so easy for the movie to portray humans as dumb and callous. But Pixar pulls it off with warmth and feeling. After 700 years on a never-ending cruise to nowhere, humans have grown fat and complacent, but they haven't lost their humanity.Certainly not for everyone and a bit sappy at times, this is a gorgeous film that shows even robots, nay, render farms can churn out compelling cinema with an emotional core (here's looking at you, George Lucas).",9,2,4,3 August 2008
The Terminal," Might as well peel an onion
","Tom Hanks plays guileless eastern European character who defeats New York airport security through sheer charm.Projects a self-serving image of foreigners as hysterical naifs, whose emotional incontinence adorns them with a human warmth that calculating Americans ostensibly have lost.Spielberg pays a patronizing homage to the Slavic temperament by scoring some vaguely Slavic-themed music and by having Hanks utter a few lines in a charming but unintelligible gibberish dialect that's about as authentic as Taco Bell.Very sentimental in a highly manipulative way. Provides some vaudevillean comic relief.",1,13,24,5 February 2005
Iron Man," Better off giving Robocop another viewing
","Another poster has said it already: this is Robocop in 2008, without the humor or the humanity.I am not the target audience for this kind of movie so there is no point in detailing all the points where it fell down for me. I hope it brings in lots of money for the studio and I'm sure it will do well on that front.I was pleasantly surprised by Robert Downey's performance. He looks great and manages to convey the right mix of arrogance and boyish (self) absorption. Gwyneth Paltrow has never looked so fine.If you're thinking about watching this and haven't seen Robocop yet, please go rent that instead.",3,3,7,31 December 2008
Atonement," A beautifully rendered crocodile tear
","Despite excellent casting and powerful acting by lead actors Knightly and McAvoy, this movie is held back by bad direction and screenplay.Many scenes drag on, seemingly without purpose, at the expense of detail and backstory. We get too little of the dreadful confectionery king Marshall (the perfect villain if ever there was one). We get nothing of Robbie's time in prison. We get almost nothing of Robbie's background and the class struggle.The musical score, with the exception of a few golden moments (like the grandfather clock ticking in the background during the library scene), is overbearing and poorly directed, and after a while becomes frankly annoying.The film's critical flaw however is that Briony is profoundly uninteresting. Her feelings are ersatz and officious, making her gestures meaningless. During Briony's confrontation with Cecile and Bobbie the film almost redeems itself by exposing Briony's childishness and the inadequacy of her remorse. Which could have been followed by an unadventurous but serviceable fade to black and drinks for the weary audience - many, many drinks.Sadly that is not what happens. Instead, in a final outrageous act of betrayal, after what feels like hours and hours of agonizingly smeared out long shots, the viewer is summarily informed that the precious few scenes of dramatic interest were in fact figments of Briony's guilty imagination.Then the movie wraps up with an embarrassing scene showing Robbie and Cecilia at the beach. This is Briony's fanciful way of saying sorry: a beautifully rendered crocodile tear.",4,15,26,20 January 2008
The Godfather," Schmaltzy family epic
","This is a movie for people who want to watch fat guys eat pasta.'The Godfather' confuses sentiment with emotion and nostalgia with authenticity. Like 'Goodfellas', it tries to capture something deep and meaningful about loyalty, family, and honor, but in the end manages only to convey that food plays an important role in Italian culture. Brando's portrayal of Corleone becomes farcical as his brooding look tips over into a vacant stare.In all fairness this is not an altogether bad movie, but it pales in comparison to the novel by Mario Puzo and deserves to be taken down a notch.Watch this for the costumes.",3,7,19,18 December 2004
