Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let's sell some more toys
","I saw this film in Dallas.  My expectations were extremely high and they were not met.  The young Anakin started to grate on my nerves as soon as he opened his mouth.  I cannot see the reason why Lucas made Anakin so young. Maybe he was aiming at a certain demographic to buy some more Star Wars toys.The production in this movie is top notch, everything you would expect from a man who's so rich, he could write a check and the bank would bounce.Out of four stars, I would give this movie a hesitant 2 1/2 stars.Mr. Lucas:  you owe us a great Star Wars movie, just like the first three. Next time, don't do the writing and the directing.  Provide the vision and the bankroll and leave the rest to the professionals.Since Anakin Skywalker is destined to turn towards the Dark Side in the next two/three movies, I had better see some scenes so dark that it would give Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson nightmares for a week.",Null,0,1,19 April 2001
