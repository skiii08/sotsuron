Walk the Line," Witherspoon very good but an Oscar? C'mon!
","I caught the film on DVD recently and thought it was very, very good. Better than Ray (storywise)and the equal of Coal Miner's Daughter. Joaquin Phoenix gets better with each role. I thought he was stellar and should have gotten an Oscar for Gladiator and the same goes for this one although between him and Phillip Hoffman and Heath Ledger's knockout original performance in 'Brokeback' there could have been the first 3-way tie. In any event, I like Reese Witherspoon, that's for sure, but I saw her role as more a supporting one than a starring one and she was more or less 'Reese Witherspoon' if you know what I mean. Not too much different than her 'Legally Blonde' persona albeit in a different setting. I'm not suggesting someone else should have played the part but if Phoenix didn't win best actor then I certainly don't think she should have one either. Still, Phoenix is A-1 as Cash. In the scene in the diner when he tells June that he no longer talks about his brother because other people tired of it, I'll bet he channeled memories of his own brother, River. I also appreciated the way Cash's contemporary stars (Jerry Lee, Elvis, etc.) were used. Good enough to own at home.",9,0,3,18 April 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Perfection
",Few films send a chill down my spine and even fewer I could watch over and over. The Trip to Bountiful with Geraldine Page is one; this is another. I'm more of the Vietnam era but this story from WWII is great in every way. It's very real; there is nothing hollywoodish about it. I am very familiar with the plight of returning GIs from Vietnam and even WWI and Korea but had no idea the vets of WWII faced some of the same apathetic receptions. I am a great fan of Fredric March and in this film he deserves the Oscar - but then so does Dana Andrews whose character breaks my heart every time I see him try to get a job worthy of someone who used to pilot bombers. This is an old film so I'll just say it -- to see him at that soda fountain just tears me up! And what can you say about Homer - the great Harold Russell? I'm getting all choked up just thinking about it. All the girls are super too including Fred's goldiggin wife but even her character can be understood though not necessarily liked. Like many reviewers of this film I think we could go on and on. This is a keeper. I even checked this one out of the library not long ago and when my roommates didn't seem interested I kicked them all out just so I could watch in peace! Great. Just great!,10,0,0,10 July 2006
Capote," Not Bad
","Phillip Hoffman gives a standout performance as Truman Capote. That said, I still have a hard time enjoying Hoffman on the screen. I don't know, maybe it was that Flawless thing or even Twister. He's good no doubt about that. I, however, enjoyed the surrounding characters more than him, eg Chris Cooper as Alvin and Collins as Perry. The atmosphere was very good and rich and the screenplay was also excellent. I was surprised to see that Dan Futterman from Judging Amy and La Cage au Follies wrote it. Good job. As for winning an Oscar as best actor, I guess so, but I enjoyed Joaquin Phoenix or even Heath Ledger's performances in Walk the Line and Brokeback Mountain respectively, more. I also thought including so much of Harper Lee was helpful. I'd recommend the movie definitely.",7,0,0,18 April 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," So-So
","I'm amazed that so many reviewers comment on the amount of smoking in the picture. Big Deal! I can't really say I was crazy about this movie and actually started it (only to stop it) at least three times before I finally got around to finishing it. It just wasn't that captivating. The style of George Clooney is definitely artistic in his own noir way but there just wasn't much about the story to keep me glued to the screen. David Straitharn as usual is great; what Robert Downey, Jr. was doing I don't know - he didn't seem to have much to do. Neither did Jeff Daniels. Frank Langella's Bill Paley was odd to say the least since he (Paley)has ususally been eulogized as such a teddy bear. The whole thing about Downey and Clarkson being married was another weird point to make in the film. Best Picture? Not to me. I could have easily chosen Brokeback Mountain or Walk the Line. I can see this film being shown on HBO for the next century, kind of like they did Quiz Show, another generally boring film.",6,1,3,18 April 2006
