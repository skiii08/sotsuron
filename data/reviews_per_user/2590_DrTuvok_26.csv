Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Dark Side of the Internet Clouds Everything
","The reason this movie gets so much hate is that people go on the Internet, see other people bashing it, and then join in to seem cool. (This is something that movie critics are great at; they see if a movie is popular or not and then submit a new review, a 'reappraisal'. Look up the original critical reception of any Kubrick movie after Spartacus if you don't believe me In fact, this movie was originally praised by critics until they saw how much people hated it. Will the same thing happen to the Last Jedi? Time will tell.).The movie in actuality is not that bad, and in comparison to the Disney Star Wars movies, it is actually quite good. There, I said it. The acting is better-we can't really blame Jake Lloyd, because he's just a kid, and he does pretty well for a kid his age. All the other actors do just as decent a job as any other SW movie. Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but at the time he was actually a pretty advanced special effect, a motion-capture creation predating Gollum by a few years. As a side note, he isn't even as annoying as the Brownies in Willow, so he isn't Lucas' worst creation. Plus, I've met tons of people who actually think he's funny. (And, as proven in the final battle, he's even a better tactician then the Avengers when put in a similar situation in the movie Infinity War. You know that's right). There are more practical effects here than in the other prequels, and fewer green screens. The film certainly has better action scenes than the Last Jedi, and it's also much more creative. Midi-chlorians are weird, but they didn't really affect the story; they are a detail that can be easily overlooked. The final battle is actually quite good, with many interlocking fronts that the heroes need to fight on. The story is what people usually complain about, and it does have its flaws, but it mainly functions as a set up for what is to come, and at least we know that it is actually going somewhere. (As a kid I was never bothered by the trade routes and senate spheres, I thought that those elements made the world more like real life.) John William's soundtrack is iconic and you'd have to have a big chip on your shoulder not to praise it. (William's work on the sequel trilogy, on the other hand, was an utter disappointment. No new iconic themes there, especially for the last two.)Is this movie perfect? No. Would it have been better to get a Clone Wars live-action movie instead? Most likely. Is it the worst movie in the series? No, that's the Rise of Skywalker or the Last Jedi, you pick. Just don't be one of those people who nearly drove the Jar Jar actor to suicide and who drove Jake Lloyd into schizophrenia. That stuff is worse than anything that happened to the sequel trilogy actors.And to all the people who think that giving this a positive review means I don't know anything about film: arguably the most famous movie critic ever, Roger Ebert, gave this 4 out of 4 stars. Does he know nothing about film either? Maybe it's time to reevaluate your opinions.",8,13,17,23 April 2020
Casablanca," Basically the most flawless movie ever made
","There really isn't anything you can say against this movie. The direction and cinematography are pretty good, especially in black and white. The performances are perfect, especially the central trio of Bogie, Bergman, and Rains. The dialogue makes up probably the most iconic, quotable screenplay of all time, even topping the Princess Bride. (Maybe). The plot is smoothly paced and has been riffed on ever since. It has a refreshing lack of pretentiousness, making it all the more watchable even for modern audiences.If there was one movie everyone should see at one point it would probably have to be this one.",10,0,7,21 April 2020
Passengers," The Critics got it wrong. Here's why.
","The movie was a pretty solid, not perfect, sci-fi film. The main reason I'm giving it an 8 (instead of probably a 7 or 6) is because of the whole ridiculous controversy the critics started over how Chris Pratt's character behaved.Here's what he did. Pratt prematurely wakes up from cryosleep in a spaceship bound to a distant planetary colony, all alone. He can't go back, due to a malfunction, and there are still tons of years left on the flight. He can't stand living alone and wants some company, so he researches the other passengers, finds one he likes, and wakes her up, making it look like an accident.The critics pounced, calling it 'creepy', 'toxic', 'not okay', and all those other words they come up with to describe things they can't bear. I'm not saying that Pratt's character acted in a morally acceptable way, but the movie wasn't saying that either. Isn't this kind of the point of science fiction, to show these possible moral dilemmas in fantastic scenarios and depict how humans would react to them? I'd be willing to bet that any of those critics, if they were in Pratt's situation, would have done the exact same thing; the act wouldn't have been so 'toxic' if their own sanity was on the line. It just shows that these critics have a poor understanding of science fiction storytelling. If it's something slinging mud on the patriarchy or on capitalism, they cheer and say how daring and thought-provoking and clever it is, but if it instead brings up moral problems beyond the scope of political correctness, they cry foul and slam it. It shows incredible close-mindedness and lack of intelligent thought in their political-ideology-driven minds.Other than that, the movie was okay, but not great. Jennifer Lawrence is an incredibly overrated actress. The moral dilemma was the most interesting aspect; without it the movie would have been dull. I was a little disappointed at the sterile ending.",7,2,14,17 April 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Disney's last great blockbuster
","Dead Man's Chest arrived at a time when the epic blockbuster era (1999-2008) was beginning to die out, and stands as arguably Disney's last great live-action effort in this genre, unless you're feeling generous towards John Carter. It has a quality that many of today's 'epic' blockbusters are sorely lacking, and has much better special effects than anything produced in the last decade, interestingly enough. And unlike any fantasy/sci fi movie I've seen in what seems forever, it is exciting. The action set-pieces are all extremely well done, and are the most commendable things in the movie. At times it veers into over-the-top bombastic Peter Jacksonian territory (not one, but TWO big kraken attacks), but that's not necessarily a bad thing when tempered with a sense of humor. The cannibal island escape is creative and funny, almost like a Laurel and Hardy comedy. The Kraken is relentlessly built up during the film's first hour and a half so when it finally comes, the attempts of the doomed sailors to fight it seem all the more desperate and dangerous. (Nobody flying around and shooting CGI jazz from their hands like what we get in all these cruddy superhero movies. I cannot overstate how much that helps the suspense and rewatchability.). The mill fight scene is so creatively bonkers; we're given six different motivations for different people all trying to out-cheat each other. The whole sequence is really something, you have to go back to Indiana Jones to get something like this.The worst thing about this movie is that it all functions as a setup to the mediocre third installment. Also, it spends so much time building its influx of characters into the loopy plot that none of them really get any time to change or evolve. With action scenes this good, though, who's complaining?",8,0,0,7 July 2020
Star Trek Into Darkness," Probably JJ's best film, though that doesn't say much
","Visually I think this movie is the best out of all the Star Trek movies. Too bad JJ decided to rip off the entire plot of Wrath of Khan, because the terrorist manhunt theme during the first hour was actually kind of fascinating. What would happen if there was a terrorist in the peaceful Federation? Interesting thing to think about. But instead JJ lapses back in his whole plot-hole logic and creative bankruptcy, and even though the results are not as egregious as his Star Wars movies, it's really too bad. This movie looks like a billion dollars, the cast is actually quite good, and you can feel JJ straining to make a Klingon war. He really shouldn't have jumped ship. It just made everything worse for him.",7,0,4,24 April 2020
Knives Out," Whatever this is, it isn't a whodunnit
","I told myself I wouldn't watch any more Rian Johnson films, but ended up watching this anyway. Go figure.Anyway, for a whodunnit to work there has to be a sense of mystery, or paradox, you have to wonder, 'who did it' when anyone could have, and there is no clear explanation. This movie kind of has that in the first half-hour, only for Rian to abruptly reveal everything that happened, and spoilers, it is a suicide. Once he reveals this, the 'whodunnit' pretense completely falls apart and the movie just becomes the story of a Spanish woman inheriting a fortune and dealing with greedy manipulative family members. Sure, you know there's going to be some future developments, but nothing can change the fact that the death was a suicide and then we know that none of the other family members could have 'done it'. Therefore there really isn't that much mystery. Rian shoots himself in the foot once again with his labored cleverness.Side note: Pretty good cast here. Avengers: Endgame convinced me that Chris Evans couldn't act to save his life, but now this movie showed me otherwise. Maybe he was just playing himself. I'm glad Daniel Craig had that absurd accent because it made the movie more entertaining. Also some of the jokes were funny.",5,3,4,16 June 2020
Aquaman," What a waste. What a waste. Blast these superhero movies
","Finally, we get a movie about Atlantis, something which has not really been done before--but sadly it was Aquaman. What can I even say? I shouldn't have expected more given it was a studio superhero movie but I honestly thought it would at least be visually interesting. If you thought it was I won't hold it against you, and it had at least some ambitions, but the CGI video game fight scenes, the lame, weird humor, and the verbal reference to the monstrosity called Justice League threw me off completely. Maybe when someone with directing skills and an actual story comes along...",2,3,4,23 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," The last good movie of the MCU, the first in a long time...
","The Good: It's a straight-forward comedy which is just one small step away from the giddy highs of the most iconic slapstick movies. There are a lot of action scenes, (usually the worst parts of any Marvel movie), but only a few of them are boring. (Hulk arena fight and a couple other forgettable ones). Led Zeppelin brightens some of the other fight scenes into camp. The plenitude of jokes mostly all land, why are Kiwis so good at doing this...? Jeff Goldblum plays himself on the planet he originally came from and it's hilarious. His no. 1 stooge is played by the same Kiwi actress who played the child welfare lady in Watiti's own Hunt for the Wilderpeople and she's even funnier here. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have their comic-duo routine down by now after rehearsal in Thor the Dark World. Mark Ruffalo exaggerates his own neurotic-ness so much you can only laugh at how ridiculous he is. There are actually several very funny verbal exchanges that left me impressed at the writers. Maybe Watiti should write more scripts. The designs are so refreshingly retro; I wish more modern movies looked as clunky as this. Overall it reminded me of Star Trek the Voyage Home: a Marvel movie for people who don't usually like Marvel movies. And, it's way funnier than the vapid losers who pass for comedians today, Kimmel, Colbert, Fallon, and all those other hacks.The Bad: The storyline is the same superhero dribble we've all seen a million times before and since; if it would have gone full-blown Bob Hope it could have been a 10-star movie, sure. The Asgard plotlines were kind of boring. On top of that, this is the biggest and most expensive insult to Norse mythology I have ever seen. The Norse Ragnarok was an incredibly serious and apocalyptic event and this movie reduces it to a punchline; people will now think of this screwy movie whenever it is mentioned. A lower-stakes comedic plot would have done wonders. Meanwhile, there are some green screens and CGI, but the humor mostly distracts from it. The shoe-horned in Doctor Strange scene should be excised, have a little respect for people watching this fifty years in the future who won't have the luxury of wasting 100+ hours of their lives watching repetitive Marvel films and keeping up with the mythology of them.The Ugly: The Valkyrie character teetered dangerously into the territory of a Jerk Sue, someone who is mean and rude but tolerated by all the characters. If you like lady wrestlers maybe you won't mind this.",8,1,2,9 May 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Jerk Cap: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate Marvel
","This movie was the point that Marvel started going downhill for me. The action scenes are shaky, unexciting, and nauseating. The plot is a rip off of the Manchurian Candidate, a much better movie. The Russo Bros are complete hacks, if you don't believe me look up their filmography before they were drafted into making subpar Marvel films. The reason that elevator scene is so praised is because it's the only action scene in the movie where the camera isn't bouncing all over the place trying to disguise the cheap CGI. The whole movie hasn't aged well at all in six years, I dread to know how it will be viewed in twenty.At least this was the last Marvel movie to remember that Cap was supposed to be from the 40s.",2,2,5,28 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Circle of Suck is now Complete
","I heard this movie was bad but I had no idea it was going to be this bad; it was probably even worse than the Last Jedi and that's says all you need to know. Of course, it isn't all JJ Abram's fault for several reasons:* The sequel trilogy was always doomed to fail no matter who made it because there's no way anyone can come up with a better ending for the saga than Return of the Jedi. That will always be the true ending of Star Wars for me and I'm never watching this Disney garbage again.* Carrie Fisher's untimely death screwed up any chance they had of doing justice to her character.* For the second movie, the Last Jedi, Rian Johnson came and farted and that was it. He didn't bother trying to establish stakes for the third movie even though he knew there was going to be one, he didn't try to solidify or even establish character relationships, and this movie than has to cram in all the stuff that he didn't bother with.All right, on to the inexcusable issues. Nearly the entire plot is one long scavenger hunt with characters jostling around in so many different environments that none of them are anything more than a noisy visual blur. They're in some jungle, than they go to alien Bollywood, then they randomly meet a sand-worm from Dune (Disney is trying to wreak the upcoming Dune movie by getting Frank Herbert's ideas 'first'). Chewie goes off to take a leak, the Empire captures him, so he gets rescued, next up is some kind of oppressed, ratty Dickensian city, than a techno-club where they meet some dwarf named Babu, we have wayfinders and Sith daggers and hex charms and Death Star pieces and space horses and what the heck is the point of all this anyway? It's a manic attempt to disguise the fact that there is no story, no moral, no purpose, only flashy nonsense.Palpatine. Everyone knows why his return is such an issue so I won't dwell on it. But he wants Rey to kill him, than she does, and then he is defeated? I'm so confused. Never mind, that's not even the biggest inconsistency. Why did Kylo Ren die again? Just because he could. It's so convoluted yet so simplistic I couldn't stand it. The new Force Powers. Ugh. Now Star Wars is now no different from superheroes, with main characters that are an emboldened Illuminati who fight power with more power and than whoever has the most 'wins'. Maybe in some far-off future people will realize that characters with superpowers are in fact quite boring, while those without are usually more interesting and engaging.Side Note: Now that this trilogy is done, how does it stack up against the maligned prequels? Answer: It's not even a contest. The prequels are better. Maybe I am biased in their favor, but there are three aspects of the prequels I think anyone should put above the sequels. The first is story, which is probably the most important one to me personally. The prequels had a pretty good underlying story (Anakin's rise and fall) but the sequels are just an unadulterated mess. The second is John William's soundtracks. The prequels have magnificent soundtracks. For nearly the entire sequel trilogy, however, Williams acts on such a mediocre autopilot it's tough to believe he's the same guy who made some of the most iconic movie themes ever. The third is imagination. When we get two more movies with planet-destroying weapons in a franchise which already gave us two, it grates. Meanwhile, the prequels had the experimental creativity of George Lucas guiding it and the sequels have a calculating corporation instead. Everything other contrast between the two trilogies (dialogue, acting, mythology, etc) might boil down to personal preference, but, whatever, I find the prequels, stilted as they may be, infinitely more watchable. The sequel trilogy does have better special effects, though, so if you put that sort of thing above actual story you might prefer these newer ones...Back to this movie, well, it made over a billion dollars. Some people like it. All I have to say to them is, well, you should be happy, because there is going to be a lot more stuff like this. And for the people who didn't like it, you'll just have to grin and bear it. CGI reboots and dumbed-down superheroes are what people pay for, what today's filmmakers are able to make, and what you're going to get.",1,13,14,28 June 2020
Pacific Rim," Watch the movie and have a headache free of charge
","This movie is really no different from Michael Bay's Transformers movies but since critics love to kiss them some Guillermo del Toro butt it somehow qualifies as excellent blockbuster entertainment. Just no. It's over two hours of witless CGI explosions and nonsense that left me feeling like a kid had been throwing bricks at my head and hitting it. I'm all for blockbusters, but they should at least have a story or interesting characters and this has neither. If that's too much for a blockbuster to ask for, it needs to at least have entertaining action scenes. This movie doesn't. It doesn't even have the nutty physicality and entertaining slapstick of the Hobbit trilogy, with the only memorable action moment being a giant monster getting clocked in the head with a cargo ship held as a baseball bat. (It's symbolic of what del Toro is doing to you.)Maybe giant monster movies just aren't my thing. When everything is so upscaled there's little impact when anything happens and I think that's fundamentally the same problem Bay's Transformers movies had.",1,0,0,7 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Jar Jar is a politician! Need I say any more?
","Does nobody appreciate the satiric irony that George Lucas created in making the bumbling Jar Jar Binks into a POLITICIAN??? That's the biggest diss against the buffoons running our countries than in any other movie I've seen, ever.Other than that, Attack of the Clones suffers from the green screen overuse that Lucas is infamous for now, along with the romantic dialogue that is so flatly delivered and cliched that it transcends badness and becomes a new form of communication you won't see anywhere else. Well, I don't see how someone could say that Anakin and Padme's romantic scenes are not entertaining. Also, the opening is also quite choppy with a lot of short scenes going all over the place.BUT, beyond these criticisms, ATOC is not terrible. Anakin and Padme are really the only bad actors here; overall I think that the prequels actually had better actors than the sequels. It's also more imaginative, and when the final battle on Geonosis comes, it's one of the best extended sequences in any Star Wars movie, beginning with a pulpy Flash Gordon-style execution and culminating in a war scene more creative and massively scaled than anything the sequel trilogy can offer. Plus, Jango Fett, of whom the only criticism I have is that he didn't get to drag a coffin around.All right, Orson Welles didn't direct this but that doesn't mean it doesn't have to be enjoyable.",8,1,2,23 April 2020
Oblivion," Just don't get any spoilers!!!! One of the best sci-fi films of the decade.
","The less you know going into this movie the better the experience will be for you. Some people here are calling it predictable and obvious, but I, maybe to my detriment, still had no idea where the plot was going until the end. Is it derivative of other science fiction movies? Maybe, but at least it's daring enough to be an original story instead of a remake or wanna-be franchise starter.Joseph Kosinski is a highly underrated director of science fiction and I hope he continues in this genre. After my ultimate guilty pleasure (TRON Legacy) he directed this gem about Tom Cruise's isolated life on a wreaked Earth. The photography and imagery is completely stunning, more so than many other 'acclaimed' science fiction and independent films, and it is filled with creative and unique designs that you just don't really see in a one-off movie like this. (Bubble-ship, the drones, his air-house, etc). The pacing is a little slow but that's because they need to show off all these designs and scenery that are basically pieces of art, and I wouldn't care if they took hours doing it. The color palette is fantastic. I found more positive aspects in it than in other modern sci fi films such as the okay Arrival. Maybe Tom Cruise just turns too many people off. Too bad for them.",9,1,12,17 April 2020
"I, Robot"," Will Smith's Last Great Movie, his The Dark Knight, his Rebel Without a Cause, his Enter the Dragon
","Okay, that's an exaggeration. Will Smith's most iconic movies are forever doomed to be Men in Black and Independence Day, but this movie deserves to be ranked with those others in terms of sci fi megalomania. He plays probably his best character here, Detective Spooner, a maybe-noirish-spoof detective who is paranoid of all robots to a funny degree. 'What, the robots!' He shouts. Good thing too, and he saves the world from them by blasting rogue robots into oblivion and sticking bombs in the face of an artificial intelligence. Maybe Asminov would have enjoyed this. He probably wouldn't. Well, I did. #Sorrynotsorry",8,0,8,17 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Why is this so popular?????
","Where can I even start with this thing? Why do people act like it's one of the greatest, most visionary works in years? It took me three days to get through the whole slog and the more I thought about it afterwards, the worse it got. If it didn't become the highest grossing movie ever I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it. The fact that it got that much money is truly head-scratching; it was even bad by normal Marvel standards, let alone Scorsese ones. (Infinity War was at least more entertaining.)To all the people calling this a great culmination to so many movies: How could you treat this like any kind of ending? We all know that Disney's going to churn out as many more of these movies as they can, and probably drag RDJ back into it once people finally get sick of them. I've already heard people are clamoring for 'the next Endgame', which shows how much staying power this one has. It'll probably go the same way as Martin and Lewis movies: an extremely popular fad that will eventually become an embarrassment; a punchline.To all the people saying 'something like this has never been done in cinema before': Not exactly. Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? You get a crossover between Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man, plus Abbot and Costello. Yes, it's not on the same level as Endgame, but it is still something *like* it. To say nothing of the first Avengers movie which was still better than this.And by the way, Martin Scorsese was right. This movie-and all other M 'C' U films made in the past 5-10 years-are not cinema because they have become an extended TV show. This doesn't play at all like a cinematic climax at all, it plays like the last episode of a TV series: a mediocre creation spending an inordinate amount of time referencing the previous episodes. So Avengers Endgame is not cinema the same way the Seinfeld finale is not considered cinema.The visuals: -1 star. They are the usual murky CGI and greenscreens, nothing special at all. They thought they could get an Oscar for this? The final battle is an ugly CGI mess that makes the Ready Player One final battle look like a masterclass. There's no beauty or scale or anything in the battle to visually show that this is supposed to be an epic final struggle; instead it plays out like any other Marvel action scene just with tons more characters thrown in, puking worthless energy beams and buzzing around like flies on a corpse.The soundtrack: +0 stars. It's competent, but quite bland and forgettable. Let's just say that no one will be rushing in line to buy the soundtrack.The plot: -4 stars. Tons of McGuffins, and they must all be collected with time travel. The time travel storyline caused innumerable inconsistencies. Try as the Endgame fans might, there is no way to make sense of this garble. Go back in time to get more Pym particles? Go back in time and kill Thanos in the Infinity War final battle? No, they have to do it *exactly* this way. I seem to remember they refused to save Black Widow after she died because 'the guy said she was dead for sure'. Then Gamora came back even though she died the same way in the previous movie. I don't really have a problem with plot holes generally, but the script just kept calling attention to them in a meta, snarky way. Meanwhile, the entire 'snap' resolve was cheap and lazy; exactly what I expected would happen after finishing Infinity War. So, after 4 years suddenly as all these long dead people just *return*. There is NO way you can explain this in a way to make it sound sane. Meanwhile, Tony Stark's sacrifice scene is rotten. Basically what happens is he grabs all of Thanos' power stones and uses them to do the same thing to Thanos that Thanos was trying to do to them: turn him into dust. So, this Machiavellian mess is the culminating message of the 20-something movie series? The guy with the most power wins using whatever means are available? That's literally everything; it's the only message. The reason the Lord of the Rings had such a great story was that the characters had a massive power, but couldn't use it, and that caused a deep psychological tension. Here there's nothing; just grab the most powerful stuff there is and use it to kill your opponents and 'win'. It sucked. The most real kind of courage is when people know they're going to lose and keep fighting anyway. It would have been nice to have that here instead.The script: -3 stars. We don't expect great scripts from these movies, but at least they're usually funny. This is probably the least funny Marvel movie ever, with barely a single joke landing. (Fat Thor could have been funny but they sucked the humor out of him by having him sulk almost all the time). All of War Machine's 'funny' lines are truly cringey, as are the couple of belated, out of place jokes from the many actors who cameo at the end. So, it isn't funny. The screenplay then drains the rest of its energy trying to cover up plot holes it knows the audience will anticipate, but doesn't even succeed and all that dialogue just highlights the inconsistencies. Case in point: the infamous 'baby Thanos' dialogue. Case in point: the entire stupid 'time travel doesn't work that way' saga. Calling other time travel movies garbage is not a way to give your one a free pass. If they would have just owned up to the plot holes instead of attempting to explain them away with meta, lazy dialogue, it would have been more bearable. And don't even get started on the emotional dialogue, but at least they tried to be somewhat serious for once.The acting: -1 star. I never realized how bad an actor Chris Evans was until he tried to be emotional in this movie. RDJ, once so charismatic and funny, is reduced to the stale shtick of pop-culture references and product placement. Lots of the others looked bored as they spent a huge majority of the movie sulking, moping, getting drunk, having therapy, whining, killing for spite, etc. And then all they can obsess about is reversing their loss so they win; it's even worse than the Democrats after the 2016 election. Are they really that sore of losers? It's been FIVE freaking years! Get over it. It's surprising they didn't just kill themselves in their mire of self-pity.The positive: Well, I can't find any. This is the first one star review I've given on this site.",1,2,4,21 May 2020
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Still a fairly unique monster
","Peter Jackson operating on one cylinder still beats any other blockbuster director operating on all. This film is a strange amalgamation of horror, physical comedy, and epic fantasy storytelling that I really can't compare to anything except the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. (In the 80s these types of movies were also known as Indiana Jones films). The action scenes are definitely praiseworthy, especially the orc-elf-dwarf-in-barrel battle scene, where the fighting is complemented by a kind physical humor that still somewhat sticks to physics in between all the CGI. Compare this to the prototypical modern blockbuster-Fast and Furious, Marvel films, Dwayne Johnson flicks-and note the difference. Those movies get all their 'humor' from snarky, meta dialogue straining so hard to be clever and usually not succeeding. (Avengers Endgame was the worst offender here). You could place all the Marvel and Dwayne Johnson action scenes end to end and never get something so ridiculous and entertaining as Bombur impaling an orc with his barrel and then rolling down the riverbank smacking more and more over.Anyway, the film isn't perfect, especially because of the extensive, bad-looking CGI which somehow doesn't apply to the dragon, thank goodness. It also appears more rushed, which it was because Jackson had a studio breathing deadlines down his neck. I don't care though. It's magnificently creative, Jackson's camera work is more stylish than ever, and world doesn't have a lot of good high fantasy movies anyway.A note: the hobbit trilogy is often compared to the Star Wars prequel trilogy which I think is a pretty apt comparison. However, it insults the magnificent acting from everyone in this trilogy. The performances are better than critics would have you believe.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Peter Jackson's over-the-top, bombastic return
","It really isn't as bad as people say-and the worst aspects of it are actually not Peter Jackson's fault, it's Guillermo del Toro's for abruptly leaving after pre-production started, leaving Jackson to desperately pick up the pieces. Another reason to not like del Toro after the headache-inducing Pacific Rim, the perverse Shape of Water, and the gruesome agenda-fueled Pan's Labyrinth.Anyway, as a fair warning it doesn't fit in at all with the Lord of the Rings movies tonally but no one really expected it to. This movie is beyond goofy; it feels almost like 80s slapstick in parts, yet every action scene is so over the top and theatrical you can feel Peter Jackson desperately trying to throw you backwards over your seat. Better yet, the pervasive humor somehow lacks the snarky postmodernism that is plaguing so many blockbusters today. The result is an actually quite unique and unhinged blockbuster that doesn't really feel like anything that came before it. I actually appreciated this go-for-broke zaniness, it saved the film from being really boring like all those other fantasy slogs set in derivative worlds. (Or in anything directed by David Yates. Peter Jackson can out-direct him any minute of the week.)Breakdown:Bilbo's birthday party is long, but then you realize that Jackson is lavishly following the book, and you can't deny that these scenes are entertaining. If you want battles and bloodshed you will just have to wait and sit through this Middle-Earth sitcom.They leave and we get introduced to the CGI Azog in a flashback. Don't worry, he isn't the worst CGI this movie has to offer.They meet some 'toxic trolls' who want to eat them. This scene is an extension of the Middle-Earth sitcom theme and is so ridiculous you'll probably laugh It has a very cult-movie like feel, like Army of Darkness or something. These types of scenes are what make this oddity of a movie so unique.We meet Radagast, a kooky animal-loving wizard who is so stressed out by evil forces that Gandalf gives him some pot to calm down. Or something. (Again, laugh!). Azog's scouts attack and they escape to Rivendell to meet Agent Smith. Watch the extended edition to see the naked dwarves swimming in the fountain. Take that, Warcraft!Then they travel to the mountains, some of which look and act like Transformers, until they get captured by goblins. This is where Jackson unveils his true loony self, with a goblin rock band, the icky blobby Goblin King, more absurd somewhat twisted humor (especially in the extended one), and an eventual chase scene that crams in all the Three Stooges gags he can think of. The goblin city is actually really well-designed and creativity abounds in all these scenes. If this wasn't based off a book it would warrant a much higher rating for imagination.Bilbo meets Gollum and has a riddle contest. Pretty well done, the lighting is fantastic and the set looks pretty real.Anyway, they escape the goblins only to be attacked by Azog and blindingly bad CGI that looks on the same level as Attack of the Clones. This entire fight scene is only saved by the part where Thorin goes out to fight Azog in slow-motion with the most bombastic soundtrack imaginable playing. Try finding a scene like that in any other modern fantasy movie.Then they get saved by 8-bit graphic eagles and the movie ends. Bring on the next ones.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Too much stupidity...Maybe it's about high time they lost
","Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel's latest blockbuster, actually got more right than I expected. The opening scene started with a good amount of tension, people died right away, and you begin to think this might be their best one yet.Then.The first half an hour ends and the film becomes utterly consumed by a horde of swarming side plots and then completely falls apart in one of the most excruciating drops from decently engaging to excruciating I can think of.
With each added character, the emotional stakes lessen and lessen until all you have left is a mental checklist of who you think is going to die. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem but for two things: the Russo bro's utter incompetence in crafting well-made action scenes, and the laughable ridiculousness of the script's attempts to be philosophical.
First off, the action scenes. They retain some trippy visuals and entertain on the basic level, but for the most part are reduced to illogical CGI barf where characters are flung around and punched like rag dolls. Yes, the superheroes get beaten in the end, but you never doubt for a second that they will be able to fix it; the climax would have had more emotional heft if Iron Man wasn't always transforming like a liquid Terminator and if Spider Man could quit sprouting more arms and superpowers. All these little pop-up tricks really undermine whatever stakes there are supposed to be in this movie. It's a problem I have with superhero movies in general, that we're watching powerful people beating other powerful people, and succeeding because they have more powers, etc. It just doesn't make a good story. The action culminates, meanwhile, in a massive, shaky-cam, lamely choreographed battle which was probably meant to evoke the Lord of the Rings but I kept getting flashbacks to the Phantom Menace. (Bubble shield to cover the good guys, check. Miniature bubble shields for good guy troops, check. Giant bad guy troop carriers, check. Hordes of cannon-fodder troops, check. What visionaries the Russos are). Once again, the Avengers' strategy is to charge their enemies-forget it, that doesn't even work as a strategy. The battle then revs up and we are treated to so many acts of maximum destruction that all impact is lost. It's like watching a house of cards being atomic bombed. Then, due to a series of tactical blunders, they lose anyway. Just one way for them to win, Doctor Strange says? You might want to check another couple million possibilities because you probably overlooked something.Okay, on to the script. It attempts to philosophize with its pretty lame villain, Thanos, who is only considered great because he has been teased for so long he must be good, right? He isn't. The movie doesn't even offer any reason why he's wrong other than 'You just can't kill people!'. Well, he's saving the environment, I'm sure Michael Moore would encourage him. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Besides, if he's so concerned about the universe's 'finite resources', why doesn't he just use the all-powerful Infinity McGuffins to create more resources instead of killing a bunch of people? Can he not do this even when he has a 'reality stone' that controls reality or something like that? It's total nonsense. The writers are good at making you laugh, but when it comes to anything serious or thought provoking they're doomed.Well, at least we still have the characters, and seeing them lose was pretty refreshing after their string of 20 some victories. But then you get on to Endgame, and this movie looks like an artistic masterpiece...",3,2,16,17 April 2020
2012," Puts the disaster into disaster movie.
","Okay, spoilers here. The movie starts out okay, with the world ending, everyone's going to die, etc. It starts to feel like the ultimate disaster movie, if a bit corny with all the neutrinos and Mayans. (Also, count the number of sequences where John Cusack is in a vehicle moving really fast with all the ground behind him breaking up as if saying, 'So long, you won't be needing me anymore!').Then.After two hours, in one of the most flagrant displays of Chinese butt-kissing in an industry currently rife with it, we learn that the clever Chinese have built giant arcs to save humanity while the rest of the world was flailing their arms and wailing in panic. The main character (John Cusack, somehow looking less washed-up then he really is) and his family, who have already witnessed everyone they know get killed, weasel their way onto the difficult-to-get-onto Chinese arks and it's here when you start pleading 'No, Roland Emmerich. Please don't do this.'Too late, and he does. The Chinese arks, after a lot of meaningless drama, save everyone who could afford them, and they all has a happy ending. Except for the innumerable people killed before, yeah, they suck. What makes this even worse is that all the people who live at the end, (John Cusack excluded), were specifically depicted as those who were able to buy their survival. This is beyond despicable at worst and fairly annoying at best. Saving a couple of Chinese workers in the process does not fix the fact that this movie makes a spectacle of helpless people getting squashed and swallowed up by earth and then expects you to cheer when a bunch of billionaires survive.Wait a minute, that's not my main complaint. THE WORLD DOESN'T EVEN FREAKING END IN THIS MOVIE!! Even Knowing was better than this! Looks like the Mayans were pretty silly for predicting the end of the world only for Africa to stay undamaged. (Wakanda probably had a little storm, maybe a tornado.) And wait, how exactly are all the billionaires going to cope with survival afterwards?",1,0,0,9 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Overrated, silly pile of smug Rian Putrecence
","Supposedly there exist somewhere in the world people who actually think the Last Jedi is a great movie. I overheard one on the bus once, but other than that the Last Jedi defenders seemed restricted to Internet reviews and comment sections. Maybe they're afraid to make their closet Rian Johnson love public. Maybe they don't care about the other Star Wars movies. (The guy on the bus didn't). Who knows. The truth of the matter is, the Last Jedi is not even a remotely good movie by any standard I can think of, and all the critical praise it garnered is pretty baffling.
A few of the many reasons this is true:1. The whole film: it suffers from the exact same sequel disease that has dogged all kinds of franchises from the Matrix to Pirates of the Caribbean: it's overlong, overstuffed, crammed full of characters we couldn't care less about at the expense of the old ones, and ending in a cliffhanger heralding an even more bloated installment. Only the cliffhanger for this movie is so weak it barely even qualifies.2. The narrative: There isn't one here. Everything that happens seems recursive; looping in on itself, and nihilistic; adding up to nothing. The terrible Force Awakens saw fit to drag Han Solo's character arc right back to where it was in the start, now the Last Jedi decides to do the same thing to Luke, effectively nullifying his entire character. Even the Last Jedi defenders online can't defend the Canto Bight scenes. The 'chase them until they run out of gas' plot element is silly because the Resistance would have had a better chance going into hyperspace to begin with, tracked or not. (With this kind of leadership, no wonder they're losing the war). Are the characters really in a different place at the end than they were at the beginning? Not really.3. The Themes: This is what the critics all went agog over, which I guess shows a lot about their collective psyche. If they really want Star Wars to go in such an 'exciting new direction', why did they lavish so much praise on the regressive Force Awakens? Why did they join together to lambast the prequels, which did more for the Star Wars mythos than all this Disney stuff combined? (It's worth mentioning that Roger Ebert, arguably the most famous critic of all time, gave the Phantom Menace 4 out of 4 stars). The whole 'Rashomon' element was forced and squeezed in for pretentiousness' sake, with Rian Johnson basically dissing the entire concept of good versus evil for no discernible reason. That fundamentally distorts the mythological foundations George Lucas laid down for his fantasy world and feels cynical and out of place, even for a franchise that includes Revenge of the Sith. (Speaking of that movie, Rian's point of view is creepily echoed by Palpatine in the scene where Anakin discovers he's a Sith Lord. 'To gain a true understanding...one must study all aspects of the Force, including the Dark Side...'). I don't have a problem with the 'anyone can be the best Jedi!' idea, but it's too late and this contradicts all the movies that came before it. If Rian wanted to do something like that he should have invented his own fictional universe.4. The Plot Twists: Rian strikes back, only his plot twists don't matter because there is no plot. Who cares that Snoke dies? We don't even know who he is or what he does; after he's dead nothing's really different; I guess the First Order can function well enough without him. So what if Rey is a nobody? She's still the most omnipotent character in the movie. But Rian revels in this supposed cleverness, and on and on it goes....where it end nobody knows. Or cares.5. 'TOXIC TROLLS!!!!': I guess anyone who doesn't like the movie is being automatically relegated to the status of 'toxic, bigoted, white, sexist, male who can't stand seeing girls taking over!'. When that's your main argument in defense of this movie, all I'm going to say is that you'd better find another one if you want to convince anybody.I could go on, but I have better things to do now. The effects were the plus here, but just effects can't make a good movie, or else Avengers Endgame would have won all the Oscars. Adam Driver was the best actor here, and Mark Hamill wasn't bad, but overall the acting was subpar. Not that that isn't normal for a Star Wars movie but it's about time people stopped beating up the prequels for it. If Rey was required to have romantic dialogue written by Rian and JJ Abrams, trust me, it could be just as bad as Attack of the Clones.Star Wars movies need to end now. You want a daring new franchise with strong females, etc? Make up your own. I dare you. Right now you're just piggybacking on one of the most successful white males ever: George Lucas.",2,6,19,13 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Imagine what it's like before watching. That's exactly what it's like
","This movie is oddly overrated even by Marvel movie standards. It garnered all this acclaim, was praised as 'Star Wars for this century' by some, and was even included in the 1001 Movies to Watch before You Die book. (Why not include the Fifth Element if this type of thing is going in too?).
Sorry, but this doesn't come equal with Star Wars or Star Trek. It doesn't have the complex world-building or imagination of Star Trek. (Even Serenity was better than this). Star Wars, at least the first six movies, had a very strong story with archetypical fantasy characters that were written well enough. GOTG has a bunch of assassins and thugs who don't really develop except for learning to work together; a predictable story trope that anyone could write and which was in one too many superhero movies even at the time. The story is lame, another 'get the Macguffin' plot line that would later be recycled in future Avengers movies. (With the same Macguffin, no less, and the same use of the Macguffin to kill the bad guys). Watch them team up to get the Macguffin! Then see them use it to blow up their enemies! There, I summarized what is literally the entire storyline.
There are a couple of good quirks in here though...the incorporation of 70s music was a nice change and Chris Pratt sold the childish potty humor around half the time. There are a couple of good jokes sprinkled in here too, but good luck remembering them once the post-credit scene is over.
The directing is flat and similar to any other Marvel movie you've seen before. You can easily tell that Disney hired a squad of second-unit directors to shoot all the action scenes for the blockbuster-inexperienced director James Gunn, because these parts feel exactly the same as all the other Marvel films. (They probably all have the same second-unit team for actions scenes). There's nothing visionary here. It's a pretty juvenile ordeal which doesn't deserve to be called a space opera.
Why Gunn is hailed as a new visionary director is beyond me, as is why everybody made such a big stink when he got fired for perverted tweets. Any director could do this sort of thing if they wanted to: add in your favorite 70s mix as a soundtrack, fill the script with profanity and bodily functions jokes, and then lay back and let the CGI do all the work. It's interesting that so many people are eager to forgive Gunn, when many of those same people rant on about what a rotten person Mel Gibson is, even though Gibson is a miles better director with a much firmer grasp on storytelling. But no, Gunn's 'old' but still sober tweets were from 2008, Mel Gibson's drunken rant was in 2006, and the latter still somehow deserves to be held accountable. I'm sorry, no. It's hypocrisy to the nth degree. I'm looking forward to Gibson's next films and I couldn't care less about whatever junk Gunn is working on now.",2,1,2,24 April 2020

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Probably the grimmest blockbuster ever made
","No more should the Empire Strikes Back be the go-to for 'dark' blockbusters, because this movie is such a violent, hopeless affair it's impossible not to appreciate the sheer guts George had in making it.
This is Star Wars where the main character turns evil, kills a bunch of innocent people including children, helps destroy the current world order, and then has his limbs lopped off and is burned alive in a lava pit. Let's see somebody try to top that and still keep a family audience. This makes the sequel trilogy's PG-13 ratings a joke.Revenge of the Sith is rightly considered one of the best Star Wars movies-even better than some of the originals, if you ask normal people who aren't afraid of being stigmatized on the Internet. This is most likely due to the mature thematic content and the near-Shakespearean story, the depiction of the fall of Anakin Skywalker. Could it have been better handled? Probably. Would we have been better off with a movie in between Attack of the Clones and this? Yes, and I wish we did have a fourth movie. Are the romance scenes still ridiculous? Yes, but there aren't many and the movie is so relentless you don't really notice them. The acting, once again, is really good except for Padme and sometimes Anakin, with the actor who plays Palpatine giving in probably the best performance in the entire series. Anyone who says the sequel trilogy has better acting is joking. The dialogue is the best in the prequels, with the Darth Plagueis speech standing out as extremely well-written, probably the best thing George has written. The movie also legitimizes the other two prequels. Once Order 66 happens everything falls apart, and George gives us a masterclass in how to build up a fictional universe and then tear it to shreds at the end of the story for maximum impact. Compare this to the Force Awakens when a New Republic we know nothing about gets obliterated and we're supposed to be...sad?Nothing like this has really been done since. It's too bad.",9,1,1,23 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An insult to storytelling... original audiences were blinded by nostalgia and special effects
","Many people act like this is some kind of generation defining masterpiece for reasons I didn't even quite understand when I left the theater going 'meh'. But as each day went on, the rottenness of the Force Awakens stung my mind more and more until I completely despised it. Well, at least it only kept the status of 'movie of a lifetime' until the equally execrable Avengers Endgame came along. (And it also convinced me that the 1001 Movies to Watch Before You Die book is defective and I will have to make my own).There are many problems with the Force Awakens, too many to name, but I will only mention the ones that bothered me the most, in no particular order:A). The New Republic blows up and nothing changes. Gee, JJ Abrams, I know you didn't want to fall into the same trap that the 'boring' prequels did by including intergalactic politics, but then why are you acting like it's such a catastrophe when the New Republic gets exploded? The heroes aren't affected at all by this event! They just continue on and there are no repercussions whatsoever when what should be the dominant force in the galaxy is wiped out. We still never learn what the New Republic is, or what it's for; and since no one mourns it at the end it must be even more useless than Robert Mueller and Adam Schiff combined, and probably an even bigger waste of taxpayer's dollars.B). What did they do to Han Solo? We know JJ was nostalgic for the days when Han Solo was a cheating rogue, but he should have directed the Solo movie if that's what he wanted to show. What he does in this 'sequel' is retcon Han Solo's ENTIRE character arc from the first Star Wars onward, cheapifying the original trilogy and then not even bothering to give Han any kind of redemption at the end. An ugly shadow of what they would do to Luke in the next movie.C). Little did I know when first watching this that Adam Driver would go on to be the only good thing about this trilogy, but I still don't believe that someone looking like that could be the product of Han and Leia. It's too unbelievable. (By the way, Finn was my favorite character in this one, and I still feel bad for John Boyega the way his character was treated in the next episodes.)D). They actually did Death Star 3. I mean, I have heard and made many good jokes about the fact that the Empire (or First Order, whatever, just someone explain the difference between the two, please.) tried a THIRD time to build a Death Star with the SAME weakness that the other two had! This is just beyond ridiculous-yes, I know it's bigger and solar-powered and destroys more but it's still a Death Star. Giving it another name doesn't hide that fact. On top of that it's the easiest one to blow up! Kind of like the Holiday Special, this is comedy gold but not some kind of thrilling stakes or epic battle.E). The *Resistance*. What are they *resisting*? They are supposed to be the dominant force in the galaxy, how did they lose that? What have these idiotic sickle-snoots been doing, playing video games in their basement and allowing the Empire to come back and build another Death Star? What's going on in this galaxy anyway? Oh, yeah, JJ wanted to redo the original trilogy so he had to make them a rebellion. Right. We can't go around imitating those 'boring' prequels, remember that. Besides, I for one am completely sick of a 'resistance' being in every other sci-fi property. The trope got old I don't even know how long ago.F). Han Solo: 'How to we blow it up? There's always a way to blow these things up.' If even the scriptwriters cannot take this looney-bin plot seriously why should we? It's the same problem I have with many of the Marvel movies.G). 'I'm being pulled towards the light' Kylo Ren confides in fear. What is this? It's a direct betrayal of the entire moral fabric of Star Wars done with complete ineptness. Oh, sure, it makes Kylo's character more *interesting* because he's a self-doubting villain, but it makes no sense in the context of the series; this isn't some kind real-world drama. It's mythology. The whole point of the Dark Side was that it was 'easier, more seductive...forever will it dominate your destiny'. That's why Luke's journey in the originals was so impactful, he was tempted with having more power, more Force tricks; and anyone with a weaker will would be scrambling to join the Dark Side...But not here. Now the villains are afraid of turning good again for no other apparent reason than they just have good feelings. This cripples the story severely, even more so because Rey doesn't seem to have motivation for being good or evil; she just does whatever she wants and doesn't counterpoint the conflicted Kylo Ren at all. The rest of the trilogy would expand on these themes and as a whole it never really recovered. It shows that JJ and Rian know absolutely nothing about mythology or what makes stories engaging, unlike George Lucas, who made certain things in Star Wars the way they were because he did his research. All that these uneducated Disney buffoons have are lens flares and pretentious movie references. Well, I guess it's not to surprising since many of them didn't even graduate college, who knows how much they actually know.This and the entire sequel trilogy is nothing more than billion-dollar corporate fan fiction. It has just as much claim to being canon as the Star Wars Holiday Special does. (After all, the Holiday Special had all the original actors also...)",2,9,10,9 May 2020
