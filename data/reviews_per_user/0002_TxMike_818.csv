"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A fun comedy about a man who never can finish anything, in love or life.
","In many ways has most of the typical British comedy elements, but much fresh material and very enjoyable entertainment.Simon Pegg is Brit, Dennis Doyle, who we learn at the very beginning of the movie got very cold feet 5 years earlier at his wedding and just ran away, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend.Thandie Newton is the girlfriend, 'Libby' Odell, and in present time has a cute, 4-year-old son Jake. Dennis and she remain cordial, as he picks up their son for scheduled outings.But on one of those occasions, Dennis is thrown into a mild state of shock as he meets American, Hank Azaria as Whit, Libby's new boyfriend. Things get mush worse eventually as Whit proposes marriage to Libby.But Dennis never gave up on Libby, even though she has apparently given up on him, a perpetual screw-up who never undertakes and finishes anything. He just barely exists, and is even in trouble with his Indian landlord of his small basement flat.It turns out that Whit runs marathons to help raise money for charity, and everyone thinks that is an admirable quality. So Dennis, 'Fatboy', decides he will get in shape and run in the next one just 3 weeks away.SPOILERS: When Libby accept's Whit's proposal Dennis gets discouraged and decides not to run the marathon. But friends, including one who has bet 5,000 pounds on his finishing the race, basically force him to run, reminding him that he has to start finishing things. He gets injured, but decides to keep on anyway, even on a bad ankle, finishing late at night. His grit captures the fancy of a whole TV news audience, plus his son and Libby, who show up and wait at the finish line. As the movie ends some time later, Libby has ditched Whit, and agrees to go on a date with Dennis. Maybe they will make it work this time.",Null,0,1,9 October 2008
The Devil's Advocate," Is this just a clich√©' about powerful lawyers selling their souls to the dEVIL?
","Keanu Reeves is Kevin Lomax, uncannily successful 30-ish lawyer in Florida. It seems that one of his gifts is being able to select juries that will sympathize with his clients and return a verdict of 'not guilty.' When asked how he does it, how he knows which ones to excuse because they will be trouble, he says he doesn't know, he just does. And he is being totally honest. But we know! Kevin gets an invitation to go to New York, guest of high-profile law firm, and the key partner appears to be Al Pacino as John Milton. Kevin helps pick a jury, it works out well, he gets the job and a very expensive luxury apartment for him and Charlize Theron as his wife Mary Ann Lomax. (She was about 21 during filming, and lovely.) But not all goes well, Mary Ann begins to experience some problems, even see some unusual visions. She wants to go back to Florida. Other key characters are Jeffrey Jones (of Ferris Buehler fame) as partner Eddie Barzoon, Judith Ivey as Kevin's ultra religious mother Alice Lomax, Connie Nielsen as the seductive lawyer in the same firm, Christabella Andreoli, and Craig T. Nelson as their newest high-profile client, Alexander Cullen, to be tried for murdering his own family members.This is a dark thriller, somewhat scary at times, with satanic undertones. Not for everyone, I enjoyed it for the story telling.SPOILERS: John Milton is in fact the dEVIL. He has picked Kevin to come to the firm because he wants Kevin to take over the practice. You see, Kevin is actually Milton's son, born of a strange visit his mother made years ago to NYC. That is why he also has the power to know how to pick jurors. Caught in a very tight spot, in Milton's lair, Kevin chooses to shoot himself in the head, his dying caused Milton and his half-sister Christabella to die, then Kevin was able to 'wake up' to his prior existence, now rid of the dEVIL and all that came with it.",Null,0,1,29 March 2011
Ford v Ferrari," In the 1960s Ford was able to defeat Ferrari, with the help of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.
","My wife and i watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Excellent picture and realistic racing sounds, but no extras on the disc.While it is based on a historically accurate story many of the scenes and dialog had to be invented but the filmmakers did a superb job to make it interesting. While the movie is long at about 2.5 hours it is never dull. Much credit goes to the two actors in key roles, Damon and Bale who are at the top of their acting games.By the 1960s Ford was established as an automotive giant but Henry Ford II wanted to defeat Ferrari on the tracks. Willing to spend almost unlimited funds he turned to Carroll Shelby, racer and designer who in 1959 became the only second American to win the 24-hour race at Le Mans.Aside from fighting the excessive layers of Ford corporate management, much of the movie regards the relationship between Carroll Shelby (Damon, sounding like a young Tommy Lee Jones) and driver Ken Miles (Bale). Together they accomplished the tasks and propelled Ford racing cars to international fame.A really good movie, an excellent chapter in auto racing and an interestingly told story. For those who want to learn more about the controversial finish in 1966 do a web search for 'Foul play in Ford 1966 Le Mans 24 Hour photo finish?' to find interesting articles.Also the 2016 documentary called '24 Hour War' covers the same subject but with a different focus, including the history of each company and direct input from many who were involved in Ford's project 50 years earlier. Worth a watch if you can find it.As an aside, this movie includes the introduction of the Ford Mustang in the 1960s. That brought back nice memories as my college graduation gift was a gently used 1965 Mustang, red with three black racing stripes down the middle, and with the 289 CI motor with 4-barrel carbs and a 4-on-the-floor shifter. Man that was a nice running car.",Null,0,2,3 March 2020
The Blair Witch Project," Watching this movie is a waste of 90 minutes!
","When the 'Blair Witch Project' was in theaters I resisted the hype and did not see it. Last night, 'free' on TV, I spent the 90 minutes watching, hoping for something thrilling. Nothing ever came.Heather, Mike and Josh, actors, play 'Heather', 'Mike', and 'Josh', characters. They are students doing a project and get lost in the woods, camping there several nights. There is absolutely *zero* character development, *zero* inventiveness in dialog, and *zero* believability in their plight. The first 85 minutes you follow them through the woods, listening to their teenage dialog with the 'F-word' used 2 or 3 times each sentence. When they meet their fate, you don't care one bit about them. At least I didn't.Still, I give it a generous '3' of '10' for the novelty of the idea. However, as movies go, this one is simply a good 'school project' quality. It in no way deserves to be in the same category as any of the above-average films made these days.All the favorable comments come from teenagers. Perhaps one of ten mature adults would find this film at all worth watching. I certainly did not. But I'm glad I satisfied my curiosity. How can we recognize truly meaningless films unless we see some occasionally??",Null,1,8,17 July 2000
The King's Speech," Yeah, this is a superb movie, deserving of all its Oscars. Especially Firth.
","What does 'speech' refer to in the title? By definition it can be 'something spoken', as the speech to the nation near the end of the movie. Or it can be 'the ability to express thoughts through sound'.I suppose the title refers to the going-to-war speech that King George delivers by radio, but I enjoyed it more for the other definition, the process by which the King's speech (manner of speaking) was improved by the rogue Logue. Rogue because he had no degree, no formal certification as a doctor of speech therapy, but a keen mind and experience that enabled him to turn the king from a hopeless stammerer to a king that gave inspirational speeches.Colin Firth won the best actor Oscar for his role as King George VI. It is difficult now to imagine any other actor doing it as well. Superb performance. Geoffrey Rush was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as Australian Lionel Logue. The movie and its script were derived from diaries that Logue had kept and that were discovered by Logue's grandson in 2001.Helena Bonham Carter is effective as Queen Elizabeth. As is Guy Pearce as the older brother King Edward VIII, who quickly abdicated because he was in love with a twice divorced woman from Baltimore and could not gain the support of the British subjects.Something I rarely do, I read the Logue book of the same title several weeks before I saw the movie, on DVD. The book focuses more on Logue himself, his early life in Australia, and what caused him to stay in London. The book also dwells more on Logue's importance, and the sticky fact that through all of this Logue never became wealthy, as if he had been the main reason the monarchy succeeded but received only a pittance in return. Good movie, everyone ought to see it, not only for the subject and the performances, but for the historical significance of the period leading into World War 2.",Null,0,1,27 April 2011
Despicable Me 2," Very nice sequel, a winner, I enjoyed it even more than 'Despicable Me.'
","Steve Carell is back as the voice of Gru. In the earlier movie, 'Despicable Me', he prides himself in being the most despicable person. His grand crime is to steal a shrinking machine, rocket to the moon, shrink it and steal the moon. However in his quest (in the earlier movie) he has trouble getting into one place, but notices that 3 orphan girls get in easily. Through that story he ends up adopting the three orphans, and in the process changes from despicable to a genuine nice guy.This movie is a continuation. The three girls take more important roles. The evil guy here is El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) who is using a serum that changes living things into purple monsters. He has plans to capture all of Gru's Minions and convert them. Gru must get the antidote and reverse the transformation. Gru gets a partner to fight crime, she is Kristen Wiig as the voice of Lucy. When you put Wiig's excellent voice acting with the superb animation that goes with it, the character makes the film come alive. As well as the Minions, who have taken on a more prominent role. My wife and I saw it at home on DVD, a loaner from our public library. The sight gags are inventive and very funny, we were entertained the whole way. Plus the several very interesting extras, including several short (ca. 5-minute) movies featuring the Minions.",Null,0,0,11 February 2014
The Mask," The movie that put Carrey and Diaz on everyone's radar.
","Who but Jim Carrey could play meek bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who one fateful day comes across an ancient mask. On a whim he puts it to his face, and the mask becomes part of him, altering both his physical appearance and his personality. He becomes a super dynamo, in strength and quickness, but also with a destructive streak. His challenge is to channel his energy into fighting the criminals.Way down the list of credits is Cameron Diaz as Tina Carlyle. Essentially an unknown before this movie, she plays what eventually becomes Ipkiss' love interest, and her performance here is largely responsible for the even better roles she soon was to have.The movie is not to be taken seriously, it is most fun to watch for the eye-popping special effects associated with turning Ipkiss, and at times others, even his dog, into something completely different when the mask goes on. Always a fun watch.",Null,0,0,21 January 2008
The Lobster," Absurdist comedy in a fictional universe. Not for all viewers, I expect.
","I saw this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife quit after about 20 minutes, too absurd for her.I added this movie to my watch list because of the actors, I like Farrell, Reilly, and Weisz. But I really knew nothing about the themes. I suppose if you look at the stories as indicators of real interpersonal relationships you might glean something about human nature. But it is scripted in such an unusual style, sort of like how it would sound if all the characters had Asperger's, everything direct and without humor or subtlety. It is set in a universe that looks much like ours, or more specifically Ireland, but with very unusual customs. One is that if a person become single for some reason they are sent to a particular hotel, given a room, and they get 45 days to pair up with another person. If they don't then they get converted into an animal. Upon entry they get to choose which animal.Colin Farrell is David, his wife left him and now he is here. He chooses to become a Lobster if he can't find a partner. Why? Because a lobster lives hundreds of years and remains sexually potent until very old age. Neglecting of course the possibility that he will be caught and eaten at a relatively young age.John C. Reilly is part of the cast as Lisping Man. And Rachel Weisz is only known as Short Sighted Woman (short sighted is British for near- sighted vision). So all this plays out in an absurdist manner, everything is strange. It is not possible to write a simple synopsis but David and the Short Sighted Woman find they are compatible, both as runaways from the hotel, now living in the woods.Several times I considered abandoning the movie but the absurdity of it all kept me watching. It definitely isn't a movie I'd watch again, or recommend to my friends, but I am glad I stuck with it. What an unusual movie!SPOILERS: The end may be the whole point of the story. David and his new partner are in town in a restaurant, fugitives of sorts. She has been blinded by the authorities but he still has his sight. He says he loves her and wants to be like her. He asks the waiter for a fork and sharp knife, he goes into the men's room to put out his eyes, to become blind like she is. He looks in the mirror, he puts the point of the knife to his eyes, but the movie ends with her sitting at the table, waiting, waiting. It is ambiguous of course by my take is that he just couldn't go through with it, he couldn't blind himself, so he just went on his way and left her.",Null,0,2,24 September 2016
Moneyball," A remarkably interesting movie, and especially if you love MLB.
","I was a great fan of MLB (major league baseball) as a kid growing up. In the deep south we had no MLB in the 1950s but my dad cheered for the St Louis Cardinals, and listened to their games on the radio at night, as they were the only 'southern' team. For no reason that I can recall, I cheered for the Brooklyn Dodgers. One year around 1959 or 1960 we drove to St Louis and spent several days there, going to the St Louis and Brooklyn 3-game series. With that as a background I had no idea what to expect when I popped the 'Moneyball' DVD into the player. I knew it was about the Oakland As, and I like Brad Pitt, so I figured it would be a worthwhile two hours. I got a lot more than I was expecting, a fascinating true story of how they changed the way baseball is run as a business.Brad Pitt is Billy Beane, former MLB player who had been highly prized coming out of high school, was signed, but never really cut it. So he became a scout, and eventually worked up to General Manager of the Oakland team. After going to the world series, and losing to the Yankees, their three best players left, bought off by bigger salaries that Oakland couldn't afford. So Billy had to do something different to win, but what? The fateful day came when, on a recruiting trip, he happened upon Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, recent graduate of Yale, who looked closely at years and years of MLB statistics. He had developed formulas based on the concepts foreign to MLB scouting up to then. He had a system to attach a value to a player based on such things as percentage 'on base'. That is, a walk counted as much as a line-drive single to center field. So Billy hired Peter away, and soon made him assistant GM. The system worked because of the synergy, Billy couldn't do it without Peter, and Peter couldn't get his ideas implemented with someone like Billy, whose only goal was to win. In fact his outlook was (and I assume still is) 'If you don't win the last game of the season then no one cares.'Always superb Philip Seymour Hoffman in a role I would not have predicted for him, in crew-cut hair style, is Manager Art Howe. Really good movie, one of the better ones I have seen recently.",Null,0,1,2 February 2012
Whip It," Coming-of-age story facilitated by Roller Derby.
","First off, this movie set in Bodeen, Texas was filmed entirely in Michigan. Second, as far as I can figure, there is no town in Texas called Bodeen.On the surface this would seem to be a movie with Roller Derby as its theme. I always figured Roller Derby was entertainment in the same way that professional wrestling is entertainment, and the movie pretty much depicts it that way. While the women may look mean on skates, off the rink they are just a bunch or ordinary, friendly ladies.Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar finds herself drawn to the sport, when she makes an unrelated trip to Austin and sees a poster. She goes back, not telling her parents the truth, and inexplicably gets urged by one of the players to come back for try-outs.Bliss has two big problems. First, she can barely skate. Second, her mother, Marcia Gay Harden as Brooke Cavendar, grew up in the beauty pageant circuit and expects Bliss to follow in her footsteps. Bliss has done that, so far at 17, but her heart really isn't in it. She wants to get out from under her mother's stifling influence. She ends up claiming she is 22 to get a try-out.So Bliss learns to skate well and, even though she is very small, turns out to also be very fast, so small and fast is perfect to break through and circle the track to score points for her team. When her mother and father finally find out about her Roller Derby passion, the 'comng-of-age' discussions begin.The ladies on the team, mainly in their 30s, turn out to be good friends to Bliss and help her see a part of life that she had not been exposed to in her small town. They are played by such actresses as Kristen Wiig (Maggie Mayhem), Drew Barrymore (Smashley Simpson), Juliette Lewis (Iron Maven) and others with such monikers as 'Rosa Sparks', 'Bloody Holly', and 'Eva Destruction'. It was good to see Andrew Wilson, older brother of Owen and Luke Wilson, as the coach, 'Razor'. So, while there is a strong Roller Derby theme, it is just there as a vehicle. The movie is about Bliss, her friends, and her family coming to terms with what is really important in their lives, and what they really want to do. Good movie.",Null,0,2,3 June 2010
The Avengers," 'Humans are unruly, and for that reason they cannot be ruled.'
","Yes, Stan Lee does have a short 'cameo' role in The Avengers. I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie, doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. The USA, NASA, and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time, it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab, the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy, and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside, pointed to the sky, his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star, in a movie filled with stars, is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Loki's brother, Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out, after Tony Stark figures it out, that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others, divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action, much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan, with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead, steering it through the upper opening of the portal, destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsg√•rd as the scientist Selvig, Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury, and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday, Pepper Potts .Overall a fine action comic book movie.",Null,2,6,16 October 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A decent , entertaining 'discovery' caper, kept my interest all the way through.
","I enjoyed this movie better than the first one, I thought the story was better in every way. Nicolas Cage is back as Ben Gates. As the title suggests, there is a 'book of secrets', particularly a book that has never been verified to exist, but supposedly is passed down from president to president and containing certain 'secrets.' Jon Voight is back as his father, Patrick Gates. The movie is loaded with other stars, including Diane Kruger, Helen Mirren as his mother, Ed Harris, Harvey Keitel, and Bruce Greenwood as The President.Ed Harris plays a particularly unsavory character who wants to get to the supposed treasure before Ben does. The treasure is said to be a hidden city of gold belonging to the Native Americans. Ben and his dad pick up on clues, which take them to a desk in Buckingham Palace, and then to a companion desk in the White House. Part of the fun in the movie is seeing how Ben gains access to these highly secure places.Part of his mission cannot be accomplished without his 'kidnapping' the President, and it is clever the way they have Ben accomplish that. If the President is to admit that there is a book of secrets, he would have to do that with everyone else, including Secret Service personnel, absent.This is the movie which has the scene made famous in trailers, where Ben, behind the Mount Rushmore sculptures, places his hand into a hole in the rock and starts yelling, but then laughs as he lets on it was a joke on the others.SPOILERS: They eventually find the book of secrets in a safe hiding place in the library of congress, only accessible with a code the president gave Ben. All this leads them to Mt Rushmore, and behind the sculptures they find a passage among the rocks that lets them into the city of gold. But being old it starts to crumble and they almost all get killed, but only Harris's character dies, but the underground city is destroyed. However Ben manages to clear the name of his ancestor who had been accused of masterminding the assassination of Lincoln.",Null,0,0,17 December 2008
Blade Runner 2049," Thirty years later Blade Runners still have work to do
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, it is not the type of movie my wife enjoys. The filming, effects, and surround sound are all first-rate, immersing the viewer in 2 hours and 35 minutes of sheer entertainment.One nice feature of the DVD is a set of 'extras' called Blade Runner 101, basically a tutorial on what Blader Runners and other key characters and devices are. Watching that first helps understand the story immediately instead of trying to figure those things out.I like this movie much better than I enjoyed the original. It is not so darkly lit, has a range of more interesting colors, and a range of more interesting characters. Ryan Gosling is LAPD officer 'K', he is a Blade Runner. But in his rounds he comes across a dead tree and his device detects a long-buried box that upon retrieval was found to contain the skeleton of a woman. Examination also showed she had given birth, but where was this replicant baby?Most of the rest of the story has K tracking all this down, which takes him to old Blade Runner Deckard (Harrison Ford) who had disappeared for 30 years.Good movie, very entertaining, but I sure hope all that doesn't come to pass over the next 30-odd years.",Null,0,4,23 March 2018
Million Dollar Arm," Two young men are picked in India to become American baseball pitchers.
","This is a nice movie, more about interpersonal relationships than baseball, although baseball is the catalyst.The central character is Jon Hamm as JB, an agent who decided to strike it out on his own. He desperately wants a famous NFL linebacker as his client, as that would give him the cash flow that he needed for himself and his two employees. But that doesn't really work out.So he is given the bright idea, India is a country of roughly one billion and they love cricket. So surely they can find a couple of cricket players who have good enough throwing arms to be trained as MLB pitchers. The winners of the contest would receive a big cash prize, travel to California for training by a famous pitching coach, and when they actually get to play for a team the exposure in India would be great for business.The irony is that not every guy who tried out was a cricket player, and in fact the two who won the trip to the States were javelin throwers who didn't play cricket. Those two were Suraj Sharma as Rinku, who became the more successful of the two, playing with a minor league team in the Pittsburgh system, with a decent record but some injuries. He is still in his mid-20s and may get to the big league yet.The other was Madhur Mittal as Dinesh who had less success and returned to India to finish his education and teach baseball to kids.So, while the theme is thoroughly 'baseball', the real meat of the story is how JB came to realize what a dysfunctional person he was, and a better way to live his life and relate to others. Plus the two young men (19 or 20) who had to adjust to a new sport in a strange country. Good movie, based on real people and a true story but many details were no doubt changed for dramatic effect.",Null,0,0,12 November 2014
Angels & Demons," Not a great movie, but entertaining and better than many critics claim.
","We all know the controversy surrounding this series of movies involving the Vatican and Roman Catholicism. I am Roman Catholic but I see no reason for those who are upset. This is not billed as anything more than a fictional story based on the supposed 'Illuminatti' from the time of Galileo. Supposedly they were formed to combat, from within, the Church's stance against science which may go against old, established religious beliefs.As this story begins the Pope has died and the Cardinals are gathering to discern and name a new Pope. But someone with the Illuminatti have kidnapped the 4 main candidates for Pope and are promising to kill them one at a time.Tom Hanks is back as Papal historian Robert Langdon and he is asked to be flown to Rome to help figure out what is going on and how the Cardinals can be saved.Ewan McGregor is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a priest who was a confidant to the deceased Pope and, we find out, had been adopted by the Cardinal as a small orphan. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is head of the Swiss Guard, Commander Richter. Armin Mueller-Stahl is Cardinal Strauss.The beginning and the end of the movie work very well. Some of it involves capturing a small quantity of 'antimatter' as the CERN Large Hadron Collider starts up. Much of the middle where they always seem to make the correct guesses, and always turn up 1 or 2 minutes before something will happen, come across as a bit tedious. Good places to get up and grab a fresh beer without pausing the DVD. But overall entertaining.",Null,0,2,13 December 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pure 'style', ties up unusual story started in KB: V 1.
","I saw the first half, Kill Bill: Volume 1, about a month ago, so it is still relatively fresh in my mind. Where the first half focuses mostly on Thurman's character ( The Bride aka Beatrix Kiddo aka Black Mamba aka Mommy ) going down her list to exterminate those who tried to see that she was dead, this second half focuses more on her relationship with Bill (David Carradine) and others from her past, including Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen), all highly trained fighters as was she. While the movie, as a second installment, is mildly entertaining, it is ALL style over substance, and is a definite '10' for Tarantino's biggest fans, who enjoy his 'style.' However, I found much of it very slow-moving and bordering on 'boring' to the point that I began to not care very much how it ended. It seems to me a self-indulgent film made by a writer/director who loves to hear the dialog he has written. I gave the first half a '4', I give this half a '4' too. I suppose one can add up the two scores and say I gave it an '8' of 10, and I probably would if he were to make one, two-hour movie out of it.MAJOR SPOILERS. There is a scene mid-picture flashing back to the training The Bride received with the old Chinese master, and him insisting on her learning how to break through a wood plank with only 3 inches of room to accelerate her fist. Over and over she practices, knuckles bloody. It becomes her technique later for escape when, buried alive, she has to punch through the wooden casket. Good thing they didn't use a cheap steel casket! And, in an earlier conversation with Bill, who we find out is her husband, she is told of a finger punch exploding heart technique the old master used to defeat enemies, and in the final scenes while fighting Bill, she uses it on him, to his surprise, because the old Chinese had never taught it to anyone else. With Bill gone, mom and daughter seek to rebuild their lives.",Null,3,7,22 April 2005
First Man," Biopic about the man, Armstrong, who became the first to walk on the Moon.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Of course the picture and sound are first-rate, but it also included a number of interesting 'extras' on the making of, including how they recreated a realistic Moonscape instead of using CG.I remember all this well, I was a college student in the 1960s when JFK announced at Rice University that we were going to put a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s, and we did in 1969. That man was Neil Armstrong, played here by Ryan Gosling.So this movie, 'First Man', is primarily about the man, Armstrong, what in his life influenced him and what drove him to succeed. It doesn't cover any of his growing up in Ohio, or his Aeronautical Engineering education at Purdue University, or his stint in the Navy. Instead it starts in 1961 when he was a test pilot then was chosen for astronaut training, and ends with his return to Earth after the first Moon landing.Armstrong was a special kind of astronaut, most focused when things became tense, without him at the controls the safe Moon may not have ever happened that day in 1969.Good movie!",Null,0,0,17 March 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Continuation of the last one, after Katniss destroyed the domed battle ground.
","By now just about everyone in the world knows the general premise of 'Hunger Games' so that novelty is gone. In the last movie, the second of the series, the surviving victors are double-crossed by President Snow, instead of honoring the pledge to keep them free forever he made them fight, hoping to kill Katniss. But she not only survives, she shoots an arrow that along with lightning destroys the domed battle ground.As this one opens, the first installment of two movies, with Jennifer Lawrence back as Katniss Everdeen, she is pegged to be the 'Mockingjay' symbolic of the fight for freedom. All of the districts to overthrow President Snow and his regime.So most of the movie involves conflicts and battles of various sorts, to set up the two-hour second movie. It is interesting, but not great.Josh Hutcherson is also back as Peeta Mellark, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Donald Sutherland as President Snow, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, Julianne Moore as the rebels' President Alma Coin. (Where do they get these names??) We will watch the part two movie, when our public library gets the DVD. The series are fun movies but my wife and I are not big fans.",Null,0,6,15 March 2015
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Marvelous film, but maybe because I'm a golfer and understand the sports metaphor for life.
","CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --To grasp this film one must first understand that it is a legend - ' commonly, a non-historical or unverifiable story handed down by tradition from earlier times.' Thus, this legend, of Bagger Vance, the 'caddy' may represent a real person, or it may be a mythical person. That isn't terribly important, but what is important is the message that one must find and keep your innate 'swing', your soul, to be happy. Bagger comes into Junah's life at a critical time simply to help him realize this. The golf match between him and two real golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, is simply the vehicle for Junah's finding himself.Junah plays badly, hasn't found 'his swing' yet, is 12 strokes behind after 18 holes! Bagger gets to him between rounds and gets back 4 strokes in the second 18 that afternoon. The second day was the other 36 holes.At a critical point, on the last hole of the 72-hole match, as Junah prepares to hit his approach, and is clearing a small twig from near his ball, the ball moves a little. An almost imperceptibility distance. Even his two competitors try to convince him it probably was just an illusion. How Junah handles this situation actually is the climax of the whole story, because as we golfers know, it is the only game where you are expected to call a penalty on yourself. Junah calls the penalty, hits a great approach at dusk in the headlights of surrounding cars. His competitors both 2-putt, and he has to sink his to tie the match which no one expected him to even do well in. He now is 'in the zone', all the onlookers disappear, he 'sees' a green path to the hole, and calmly sinks the putt. He has found his swing, his soul.As we see in the movies first few scenes, Junah had been a teen golf phenom, fought in WW-I, came back jaded and bitter. Spurned his girl (Charlize Theron), began gambling and drinking, went out by lamplight to hit balls after being asked to be in the big match, which was set up to try and save the golf course resort property after Theron's father killed himself because of the depression and the prospect of being financially devastated. As Junah is hitting balls badly, Bagger appears in the mist and begins his mission to help Junah.Redford has made this story into a very nice film. No doubt, it helps to be a golfer, and it also helps to have already reached that point in life where you've figured out that there is more to sports that 'who wins.'",Null,1,3,3 April 2001
Vertigo," 'I know, I know. I have acrophobia, which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.' (Scottie to Midge)
","Although it was only modestly successful in theaters, time has been kind to VERTIGO and now many believe this is Hitchcock's masterpiece. Time was NOT kind to the original prints of the film, and in the mid-1990s Universal Studios put up one million dollars for a two-year restoration of the film. This is covered completely in a fairly fascinating 29-minute extra on the DVD, originally broadcast as an A&E special. The entire original film-making process is covered, the movie was first called 'From Among The Dead', and includes current interviews with many principals, including Novak and Bel Geddes, plus the techniques used for the restoration. This special edition DVD should be a must-own for any fan of the film VERTIGO. The sound and picture are just fabulous for a film made in 1957.My review, following, contains certain SPOILERS which are necessary for my summary. Please read no further if you have not seen the film. Watch the film first, you will not be disappointed.The film starts with cops chasing a crook on SF rooftops, Scottie (James Stewart, 49) misses one roof, is hanging high from a gutter, cop returns to offer assistance, but instead falls to his death. This traumatic experience triggers the vertigo in Scottie, makes him unsuited for police work, he quits, and Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) tells him only another emotional shock will bring him out of it. Midge, an artist, not so secretly wants Scottie, but while they are good friends, he just doesn't love her.Old college friend, wealthy shipbuilding magnate, hires Scottie to follow his wife who had been acting strangely. He meets Madaleine (Kim Novak, 24) and follows her to find that she visits the grave of Carlotta, who died at 25 in 1857, also visits the portrait of Carlotta at the art museum, has 'visions' of being in a Spanish mission, all indications are that the dead Carlotta is taking over Madaleine's mind. While following her, saving her from a jump into SF Bay, and keeping her from jumping into the Pacific, Scottie is falling in love with her, the first time he has had such feelings.Scottie feels he needs to take Madeleine to the old mission 100 miles south of SF to free her of this possession, but instead she climbs up the mission bell tower, Scottie is unable to follow quickly enough, his vertigo holding him back, he hears a scream, sees what looks like Madeleine's body falling to the red tile roof below, dead. A quick inquest ruled it a suicide, the friend gets out of shipbuilding, travels, while Scottie tries to get over his great loss, his first ever love, includes a stay in a mental hospital.Not too long after, Scottie sees a woman remarkably similar to Madeleine walking to her residence, a hotel, he follows her, knocks on the door, she is dressed differently, has different color hair, a different personality, speaks differently, and says she is Judy, from Kansas, has lived there 3 years, even shows Scottie her ID to prove it. But Scottie has not gotten over Madeleine, is obsessed with recreating her, asks Judy to dress like her, get her hair colored, all the while Judy just wishes Scottie would like her for who she is, not because she looks like someone else. But she gets completely back to the Madeleine look, same clothes, same hair color.By now we have seen through Judy's flashback what is really going on. The wealthy husband had hired Judy to impersonate his wife, Madeleine, and had set up the incident at the mission so that he could shove the already dead wife off, Scottie would be the manipulated witness that she had climbed the stairs and jumped off, and after being paid off, Judy could resume her life. To her detriment, he also gave her the heirloom, Carlotta's necklace, and her wearing that is what got Scottie suspicious of the whole scheme. He catches on, brings Judy back to the mission, they climb to the bell, a nun approaches to see what is going on, Judy panics and falls to her death on the roof. Scottie no longer was in love with her, feeling lied to and manipulated, he has no emotion, but goes to the edge of the ledge and looks down, his vertigo gone. The emotional shock that Midge spoke of has cured him.The story is a tragedy of two lives that only through misfortune become intertwined, Scottie's and Judy's. He is not young, now retired, and had never found true love. In Madeliene he thinks he found it, only to be shocked then disillusioned when the full truth came out. When Judy died, he was back where the film started. Maybe Midge was the one after all. Judy was very flawed, enough to participate in a murder plot and feel no apparent guilt over it. All she wanted was to be loved by Scottie, but a relationship built on fraud has no chance, especially since Scottie was an honest man.James Stewart is known for his ability to play an 'everyman' character, and is superb as Scottie. Kim Novak is a bigger mystery. She was not the first choice for the role, received it virtually by default, but after watching the movie it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the dual roles of Madeleine and Judy, she pulls it off so well. A big bonus is her commentary on the making-of extra, seeing her after all these years. She was only 24 when Vertigo was filmed, but she looked 40, a glamorous and beautiful 40. Actresses today who are 24 often still play teenagers. How things have changed in the movies!",Null,78,125,5 July 2003
Black Swan," Story of a paranoid schizophrenic perfectionist who gives it her all.
","This movie is somewhat controversial in that for every viewer who sees it as a superb movie, you can probably find another who says they only wanted to walk out half-way through. I am in the camp that it is a very good movie. Not a joyous one, but a good study of a dancer who suffers from paranoia, schizophrenia, and is an obsessive perfectionist.Natalie Portman is Nina Sayers, and she channels her sickness into her ballet dancing. It helps that she has a mother, Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers, a former dancer herself who still treats her daughter with the control that you might for a 10-year-old.Nina is in the ballet company that will kick off the season with a performance of Swan lake, and the director is looking for the dancer who can pull off both roles, that of the white swan and that of her nemesis, the black swan. (I am not a ballet fan, this is my simple understanding from viewing the movie.) Nina wants this role badly, but the director keeps telling her that she is too 'controlled', trying too hard to be too precise instead of being more 'real.' Nina rarely smiles, it never seems like she is enjoying herself, at anything, at any time.A new dancer from San Francisco shows up, Mila Kunis as Lily. It begins to look like Lily is competition for the role and Nina begins to become paranoid about her. Frenchman Vincent Cassel is good as Thomas Leroy, the director. Winona Ryder has a rather small role, as Beth Macintyre the former star now on her way out.The DVD has interesting extras. Even though Portman has studied dance for most of her life, a professional ballerina was used for many of the performance scenes, and 'face replacement' was used to make it look like Portman was dancing.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As we view the movie we see some strange things, and in the end most of them turn out to be products of Nina's imagination, generated by her illness. She imagines an evening where Lily comes home with her, spends the night, and they have lesbian sex. She imagines another where Leroy tries to seduce her. And another where she kills Lily and drags her body into the shower of her dressing room. We see her looking into a mirror, black feather stubs are growing on her back, she pulls one out. (She is becoming, emotionally, the black swan.) In the very end, Nina turns loose, gives a good performance, but when she falls into the mattress behind the prop, as the dead white swan, we see she really is bleeding, she has stabbed herself and will die. But she smiled and said the performance 'was perfect', she gave her life in her misguided search for perfection in the routine.",Null,2,3,4 April 2011
Changeling," Good movie of a true story in the 1920s Los Angeles.
","Angelina Jolie is Christine Collins, single mom who was a lead operator at the phone company, back when a bunch of ladies put calls through at a switchboard. She is so competent that her boss says she will be considered for a supervisory job, even though it was still thought back in the 1920s that most women couldn't handle such a job. But one evening when she had plans to go to a movie with her son, 9, she was called in to work. She told her son not to leave the house.Gattlin Griffith is her son Walter Collins. When mom came home Walter was not to be found in the house, nor the neighborhood, and no one had seen him. She did the only thing she knew, called the police and reported her son missing. They investigated for months without turning up anything, until one day Christine gets a call that they had found her son ... in Illinois.Her elation turned sour when she met the boy at the train station, he was not her son. Even though the police told her kids can change in 5 months, this one was 3 inches shorter and was circumcised. Later both her son's teacher and her son's dentist verified that the boy could not be Walter.But the Los Angeles police, known for corruption, were attempting to cover their incompetence by finding a son for Christine and closing the case.Another key character is John Malkovich as Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb who made it his mission in life to work to expose the corruption in the police department. He took an active part in Christine's fight and through his efforts, including his radio broadcasts, enlisted the public to help fight the cause.The whole story is historically accurate, and Angelina Jolie is superb as Christine. The movie is really her story more than anything else.SPOILERS: Even though most already know the details, Walter was one of perhaps 20 boys that were stolen off the streets of Los Angeles and taken to a ranch to be molested and killed. Although they never verified Walter's death, he was never found either. His mother never gave up hope of seeing him again. The impersonator had used Walter's name to get to Hollywood to meet Tom Mix. The case was brought against the chief and certain other members of the police department and led to positive reforms.",Null,2,3,25 March 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," At 'Pirates #4' the series is getting a bit long in the tooth.
","Almost two years ago when I wrote my comments for 'Pirates #3' I said, 'Is this really the final installment.' It seems that it wasn't, but I hope now that it is. I know, I don't HAVE to watch them, but I feel an obligation. Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow, the pirate always looking for a ship. His strange slurring speech was novel the first time but frankly is getting a bit tiresome. His love interest is a new character, Pen√©lope Cruz as Angelica Teach, who we eventually find out is the long lost daughter of Blackbeard. It seems that Jack and Angelica had some sort of relationship some years back, and are reuniting, not sure if there are feelings.Geoffrey Rush is Barbossa and veteran Ian McShane at almost 70 makes a fine Blackbeard.The story is essentially three teams going for the same 'treasure', the mythical 'fountain of youth', one from Britain, one from Spain, and the pirates. As legend goes they must retrieve two silver chalices and with the help of one teardrop from a mermaid as the catalyst one person can gain the years from another.This of course requires a mermaid and that is filled by the exotic looking Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey as Syrena, carried through the jungle in a container half filled with water for much of the second half of the movie. Since most of this is no longer novel, some of the scenes moved a bit slowly, and I some times became tired of just another sword fight between pirates. Not to say I wasn't entertained, because I was, but it was a bit long at just over two hours. The critic Ebert has what I consider a very fair and accurate review. It was fun to see rocker Keith Richards in the movie, in the role of Captain Teague.",Null,0,0,7 December 2011
Men in Black 3," Marvelous, inventive, wickedly fun writing.
","All of the MIB movies are fun, that is what they set out to do, and that is what Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make sure they do. The writing and acting are so inventive and fun it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it.Will Smith is back as Agent J and in this installment a notorious alien, the last of his kind, is imprisoned in Lunar Max, the maximum security prison on the moon, where he has been for 40 years. But the alien, with the help of his girlfriend, manages to escape and make his way to Earth. The Men in Black must come up with a way to stop him or Earth will be lost.Tommy Lee Jones is back as J's sidekick Agent K. And since this story involves time-travel back to 1969, Josh Brolin does a super job channeling Jones as the younger version of Agent K. I had never heard of Jemaine Clement but he is super as the alien, Boris The Animal. Also good is Emma Thompson as Agent O, and my favorite scene is when she paraphrases with wild screams what an alien had said. Michael Stuhlbarg is another actor I had not heard of, he plays Griffin, a good alien who has the ability to see any number of alternate universes.When Nicole Scherzinger came on screen early as Boris's Girlfriend , bringing him what he needed to escape Lunar Max, I knew I had seen her somewhere but couldn't place her until the closing credits. Then I recognize her as the singer, and also who had a reality TV show stint as a judge of a capella singing groups a couple of years ago. Good, entertaining movie.",Null,1,3,7 January 2013
The New World," Very good, for those who like a good story, beautifully filmed and bare in its simplicity.
","Most of us who grew up in the USA know at least a bit about the historical legend of the 'Indian princess' Pocahontas. We know that she and Englishman John Smith had some kind of relationship, and that she helped the new settlers survive in the early 1600s in what today is Virginia. But this film, 'The New World', takes an honest look at what it might have been like, unromanticized for the most part, when people from these two cultures met, curious about each other. The native Americans it seemed expected the visitors to be there temporarily, but we now know that it did not work out that way.First. let me say what I didn't like about the film. The music is very strange, especially at the beginning and at the end. My best comparison is a set of musical chords that might be played by an orchestra warming up before a performance. I'm not sure why, but it was very distracting for me. Second, there isn't a lot of dialog, and what there is usually cannot be understood. So I watched the movie with English subtitles turned ON and it helped greatly. Also, the editing at times seemed a bit abrupt.However, overall it is a very fine movie. She is never named 'Pocahontas' in the movie, but we know who she is. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, 14, is remarkably good as the native Princess, a role that fits her perfectly. The DVD 'extra' takes a good look at how she was discovered and her training for the role. Bad Boy Colin Farrell seems a good choice for Captain John Smith, always seeming to be in trouble.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Daughter of the chief, she is called Princess by the English. She takes a liking to John Smith, saves him from being put to death, she also helped the settlers, and eventually is cast out, disowned, by her father, rather than having her killed. She lives in the fort, gets false report that John Smith had died (he set it up). She later met John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who was a very honorable man, who asked her to marry him, which she did, they had a son, a few years later on the trip to London she encountered Smith, learned the truth, but turned and walked away, now understanding what she had in Rolfe.",Null,0,2,10 June 2006
Love and Death," A silly but fairly entertaining early Woody Allen film.
","'Love and Death' is a silly comedy of a movie filled with sight and sound gags. It stars Woody Allen as the weak Russian brother who is a coward and does not want to go to war. He does anyway, through a series of incompetencies during training, and while trying to hide in a cannon barrel gets launched into the general's tent, killing him and becoming a most unlikely war hero.Diane Keaton, who was his real life lover in 1975, plays his cousin 'twice removed'. They are great friends, but nothing else, except that Allen's character secretly is in love with her.The movie moves on to an attempted assasination of Napoleon.The grim reaper, draped in white robes, plays a role also in this film.If you are a great fan of Woody and slapstick humor, much like Monty Python, then you'll love this film and rate it 10. I give it 6 of 10. I generally get tired of Woody Allen's style before the movie ends, and that happened here for me. My favorite Allen movie is 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' with Jeff Daniels and Mia Farrow. Woody Allens does not act it in, maybe that's why.",Null,3,5,19 August 2000
Frost_Nixon," Re-lives the 1970s Frost/Nixon interviews.
","The subject of this movie is one that is already very well-known, and one which every viewer should know the outcome, before they see it. So, it has be be done in a fresh manner, telling us what we didn't already know. Otherwise, why not just view the tapes of the original presentation? Before I watched this movie, on DVD, I commented to my wife 'How did they make this into a two hour movie?' The way they did it was to tell the back-story, of how the idea of the Frost/Nixon interviews came up in the first place, the negotiations, showing Nixon as always somewhat greedy to get a bit more pay, the efforts of Frost's team to get financial backing, the research they did, the preparation Nixon's team did to help him be general and avoid getting into a negative light.Frank Langella is just plain masterful as Richard Nixon. He was nominated for Best Actor in this role and could have won it, but as luck would have it there were several award-caliber performances that year. Still, even though Langella doesn't look that much like Nixon we soon forgot that we were watching an actor. His performance really embodied the Nixon that I knew back in the 1960s and 1970s.Michael Sheen, who was so good as PM Tony Blair in 'The Queen' has the role her of David Frost. I was not so familiar with Frost, but Sheen does a fine job also.Much of what we see is a fictionalized account of what lead up to the interviews, and what went on behind the scenes during the interviews, but with proper research I feel that what we see is plausible, and certainly worth a viewing.Good movie.",Null,0,1,27 April 2009
Walk the Line," Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are superb as Johnny and June.
","'Walk the Line' is really the Johnny and June story, told with events of their real lives as the backdrop. Although they grew up in different parts, as a young boy of about 10 little JR would listen to little June sing on the radio with the Carter Family, to the objections of JR's father who valued music and singing as zero. So you can say that for Johnny it was love at first listen. Later when he finally met her, they were both married with families, so all they could do was sing together, and they made quite a good team. But Johnny seemed to live his life to be with June, if he couldn't then nothing else seemed to matter.I am old enough to remember Johnny Cash, and remember his popularity and seeing him on TV. I never was much of a fan of his music, or his singing style, but I respected what he did. This movie to me is a great, almost overwhelming, achievement. He may not win the Oscar, but Phoenix delivered an Oscar-caliber performance as Johnny Cash from the time he went off to Germany in the Air Force in 1952, to his getting sober and off drugs in the late 1960s. That he also did all his own singing is even more amazing. While no one can sound just like Cash's unique singing style, Phoenix captured it so well it was almost like seeing Johnny Cash again, not only the voice, but the facial and body mannerisms while singing. I own the DVD, I will watch it multiple times.Joaquin Phoenix was John R. Cash, Reese Witherspoon was June Carter, Ginnifer Goodwin (of recent 'ED' fame) was Johnny's wife Vivian, Robert Patrick (of Terminator 1 and 2 fame) was Johnny's father Ray Cash, the fine country singer Shelby Lynne was Johnny's mother Carrie Cash, and various actors played Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon Jennings, and Roy Orbison.",Null,3,5,4 March 2006
Alien 3," The third in the 'Alien' series, part of a 30th anniversary BD set.
","In 2010 was a re-release of all the first 4 'Alien' movies in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and am watching all 4 movies in a week. Picture and DTS sound are excellent as we have come to expect for BluRay.As the 2nd movie, 'Aliens' ends with Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and young Newt escape in the spaceship and go into their hibernation pods. We think, 'All is well' and they will somehow end up back on Earth. However as this one opens we see that an alien had in fact stowed away and was with them. Automatic emergency procedures began as the pods opened and Ripley wakes up to find the ship is being crashed into the water on a planet of sorts. She is rescued and finds that she is on a prison planet outfitted for industrial manufacture of Pb (lead). But the alien was also rescued but Newt died, and the new emergency among the prison and staff involves the rapidly growing alien. Ripley has a close encounter with one that does not harm her, she quickly figures out she too is infected, she is carrying a 'queen' inside her and the alien knows that. Much of the last 30 minutes is very hectic, impossible to figure out what all they are doing and where they are running to try to trap the alien. Not as interesting and entertaining as the first two but still a worthwhile viewing to have a complete picture of all 4 of the movies.SPOILER: For my recollection. They manage to destroy the one adult alien but Ripley realizes she has to kill herself to destroy the 'queen' inside her and save mankind. So she does, throwing herself into the Pb furnace. There was no intent to continue the series with a 4th movie. But they did and found a way, cloning Ripley to bring her back from the dead.",Null,1,2,18 August 2017
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Make no mistake, this is a Robert Downey Jr. movie, with all his flippancy and wit.
","As the critic Ebert states, this Sherlock Holmes bears little resemblance to the Holmes of the books or earlier movies. I suppose today's movies, to be well-received by audiences, must have almost non-stop action, gunfights, and explosions, and this one does.I found the story to be a bit obscure, but narrows down to Holmes needing to solve the mystery where an old adversary is intent on getting war started in Europe because he would stand to get wealthy on it. I suppose the old adage 'follow the money' is alive and well.Robert Downey Jr. of course plays Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law is back as his sidekick Dr. John Watson. A wrinkle is that Watson is getting married and his new wife plays a prominent role in the eventual code-breaking that is required to solve the mystery.Jared Harris is the adversary, Professor James Moriarty. It was nice to see Noomi Rapace in a different role as Madam Simza Heron. I can't easily explain what her character's function was. She of course became instantly famous as Lisbeth Solander in the 'Dragon Tattoo' trilogy.I enjoyed this movie, good entertainment.",Null,1,2,18 August 2012
The Monuments Men," Good and entertaining account of the recovery of 'monuments', works of art, stolen by Nazi Germany.
","After seeing 'The Monuments Men' I read a few reviews and a few general comments and am a bit taken aback by some of them. Especially the ones terming this movie 'boring.' It is anything but. One might take issue with the way it was written and filmed, after all it is a George Clooney product. But I like Clooney, I like his injecting appropriate comedic moments into an otherwise serious film. I never found it boring, to me it is paced just about right and the situations are never dull.This is based on a primarily true story, of the US POTUS commissioning a small band of men in the 1940s, nearing the eventual end of WW 2 and the defeat of the Nazi Germans. The Nazis had systematically stolen great works of art, millions of different items, and had carted them away to be hidden for their own selfish purposes. The men commissioned all had an appreciation for art and looked it as a worthwhile mission, albeit very dangerous. In fact not all of them survived.The big mystery was to figure out where in fact the 'monuments' were being hidden, because captured Nazis were not cooperating. But one of them finally cracked the 'code' on a map, all the locations had nearby mines, copper mines, salt mines, etc. They rightly figured the works of art were hidden in the mines.George Clooney co-wrote and directed, and stars as the leader of the commission, Frank Stokes. His cronies included Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, and Bob Balaban playing key characters. Also Cate Blanchett playing a French woman who provided key assistance.",Null,1,2,19 June 2014
Miracle," It was winter of 1980, and I remember it well.
","'Miracles do happen', the announcer's original broadcast is heard during the scenes recreated for this movie, 'Miracle.' Anyone who remembers what happened during those Winter Olympics in 1980 will know what this movie is about, and how it ends. However, there can be no spoilers, because this is not a movie about a hockey game, or even the sport of hockey. Nor is it about the players. It is solely about the coach, Herb Brooks, who, with his unconventional style and wisdom about the game, took these young hockey players to a level no one thought possible. In the end it didn't really matter whether they won or lost the game against the Russian. What mattered was that each of the 20 players found out what was possible inside himself.The movie begins with a montage of scenes from the period, the years, leading up to the selection of the Olympic hockey team in the summer of 1979. The cold war. The oil shortage and long gasoline lines. The disgraced President Nixon. The embattled President Carter. The Russians invading Afganistan. Then we see coach Brooks doing it his own way. A year and a half of scouting, one day of try-outs, to pick the 26 players which would eventually be cut to 20 for the competition. The DVD extras show us how much went into making the movie faithful, including a session with Brooks himself, who died in an accident right after filming was wrapped up. A very fine movie of a very inspirational journey.",Null,43,48,1 November 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Another thrilling impossible mission movie.
","I am old enough that I was a fan of the old 'Mission Impossible' TV series. And, while the movies are decidedly different in tone and style, the same 'impossible' missions challenge the team. Someone once said that it wasn't believable, that the team could undertake all those seemingly impossible missions and still survive. My response was, and still is, 'They only film the ones where the team succeeds. The ones where they get killed are not told.' That's because it is all fiction anyway.This installment -- MI:3 -- has several impossible missions. The movie actually starts near the end, with Ethan (Cruise) tied up and the bad guys, led by Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), are threatening to shoot his also tied up fianc√©e Julia (Michelle Monaghan) unless he tells them where the mysterious 'rabbit's foot' is. We pick that scene up again at the end, but most of the movie is told in flashback form.The movie has a somewhat low rating, maybe because of the bad publicity its star has had over his romance with Katie Holmes, jumping on Oprah's couch and things like that. But it in fact is an exciting, well-crafted movie which held my interest for its 2 hours running time.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Cute Kerri Russell as an IMF operative gets killed off early. Ethan leads a rescue, in Germany, which is successful, but she dies seconds before they can electrically disarm a small explosive device implanted into her head via her nasal passage by the bad guys. At the end of the movie, right after Ethan rescues his fianc√©e, he has a similar device in his head, he uses an electrical shock to neutralize it, his fianc√©e, a nurse, manages to bring him back from death using CPR.One mission is the capture the bad guy, Davian, when they find from a secret email that he will be in Vatican City for an event. Ethan puts on a molded Davian mask and they kidnap him, only to be ambushed later on a bridge back in the US. Part of the drama is trying to figure out which IMF insider is working with Davian.There is another mission in China where the mysterious 'rabbit's foot' is retrieved.

Lucky Number Slevin," Overall I enjoyed it, but you have to tolerate lots of violence.
","Josh Hartnett is actually pretty good as Slevin Kelevra. We see him show up at his friend's apartment and right away gets in trouble, kidnapped by two thugs who bring him to 'the Boss' (Morgan Freeman), and make him a deal he can't refuse. In return his debt will be can-celled. But Slevin wonders, 'What debt?' Then, a short time after being returned to his friend's apartment two different goons take him to their boss, 'the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who happens to live right across the street from 'the Boss' and they, bitter rivals, often stare at each other across the abyss.This movie has lots of unsavory language and violence, but it is done in a style that begs the viewer not to take it too seriously. The critic Ebert gave it a very mediocre review, but what he disliked are some of the things I like about it. One being the unusual and witty dialog, almost like a parody of a David Mamet script.Other main characters are Bruce Willis as Goodkat, a professional assassin, and Lucy Liu as Lindsey, who lives in the same building as Slevin's friend, and who works for the coroner's office. As the movie unfolds we learn that little is what it seems to be at first.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The story, not revealed chronologically, is rather simple. The first scene takes place 25 years earlier, and a young boy sees his father killed for gambling losses, the last one on a horse called 'Lucky Number Slevin', and that's where the title of the movie is taken. Goodkat looks at the boy in the eyes and spares him. The boy grows up to be the Josh Hartnett character and he with Goodkat plan the revenge killing of 'the Boss', 'the Rabbi', and several others who had been involved in his parents' deaths. He wasn't really friends with the guy in the apartment, that was just a setup to get him into position to take his revenge, as were everything else in the movie.",Null,0,6,24 September 2006
Requiem for a Dream," In the tradition of films like 'American History X', and 'Boys Don't Cry', a film that needs to be seen.
","'Requiem for a Dream' is not a pretty movie, most of us cannot identify with the main characters, it does not allow you to feel good at any point, except maybe to think, 'I'm glad I never got mixed up with drugs.' 
I require the title of every movie to make sense, so examining this one I come up with, 'A musical service for the repose of the dead (requiem)' for 'something of beauty or charm associated with dreams rather than reality.' And that perfectly describes the film.SPOILERS... There are lots of people in this film, but it is the story of only four of them - Sara (Ellen Burstyn), who gets scammed into sending an application (with money, no doubt) for a TV appearance, then needing to lose weight, getting in with a shady diet doctor, eventually getting hooked on pills and turning into this monster of a person who no longer can relate to the world.Harry (Jared Leto), her son, along with Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his girlfriend, and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), his friend, all get caught up in the drug culture.  He repeatedly steals Sara's TV set, wheels it down to pawn for drug cash, she goes behind him and pays to get it out of pawn. 'But he's my only son', she pines when asked why she doesn't call the police.They get wise, buy some good stuff, cut it, make a good profit, repeat the cycle, eventually hoping to get rich. But their 'habit' clouds their judgement, they get screwed, they drive towards Florida to get more stuff, are arrested at a hospital stop 600 miles south of NYC, Harry has his arm surgically removed because of use-induced infection, Tyrone ends up in prison, Marion has to prostitute herself to get drug money, Sara has shock treatment and is never herself again. Each tragedy, each shattered 'dream', a result of drug use. And the whole film is the 'requiem' for those dreams.I'm sure some of all these things happen some time, but in all I found this to be just a bit of a caricature of how the drug culture ends the functional lives, sooner or later, of all who get mixed up in it. Thus the title of the film.Jennifer Connelly has always been beautiful, but as she matures is also turning into one of our finest female actors. Although Burstyn received the Oscar nomination, I think Connelly's performance was the best in this film. Like most of the 'mature' voters, I rate it '8' of 10, unlike all those 'under-30' voters who rated it '9' and '10' because of the 'gee-whiz' factor, or maybe they could identify with the characters more than I can. I didn't always care for the strange way the movie was filmed, although much of it was necessary for telling this story. The first time I saw Tyrone running in the alley with the camera somehow attached to him, I thought that was neat and unique. However, as they used it for several other scenes, I began to focus on the camera technique rather than the story.I saw the DVD. It has one of the most irritating menu presentations possible, using a test pattern raster with interference. Cute, but I soon found myself avoiding use of the menu.  However, the picture and sound of the movie itself, in Digital Dolby 5.1, are really first rate.",Null,14,21,29 June 2001
Captain Phillips," Dramatization of real Somali pirates hijacking the first American ship in 200 years.
","This is based on real events just a few years ago. Tom Hanks is Captain Richard Phillips, who travels to the middle east to take a fully-loaded cargo ship to an African port. They must pass through international waters off the Somali coast, they are aware of the inherent danger, they are prepared, they have drills, they feel they can ward off any pirate hijacking attempt.But as they get going radar picks up a couple of boats headed in their direction. They can't be sure, but they suspect a hijacking attempt, they secure the ship, they contact international authorities.The main pirate is played by Barkhad Abdi as Muse. He has three others, and they are determined to get this ship. Their goal is to capture it and the crew and then hold it for ransom. They allude to the insurance man coming with bags of money, millions of dollars. The movie is extremely well made, the actors are very authentic in their roles. Hanks of course turns in his usual award-worthy performance, it remains to be seen if he in fact will win any. Quite a good, exciting, gripping movie. SPOILERS: As we know from the news Muse was captured as the four pirates tried using the rather slow cargo ship's escape pod to get to Somalia, with Cpt Phillips as a hostage. American military ships, helicopters, and Navy Seals showed up, Muse ended up in captivity, the other 3 pirates were killed by sharpshooters, through the escape pod's windows, and Cpt Phillips was rescued relatively unharmed, just bruised and in shock from his near brush with death. Muse was brought to the USA, tried, convicted, and now is in prison. After about a year Cpt Phillips returned to the sea.",Null,3,4,2 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Decent movie in the Star Wars series, but somewhat anti-climactic.
","The well-Hyped 'prequel', whatever that means, is a pretty good film, I give it '7' of 10, but to me no where near the first three in overall IMPACT. This one came out 22 years after the first 'Star Wars' movie. It attempts to show the development of the characters we saw in the others.  AFAIAC, they should have just skipped this one. What we originally knew as the 'Star Wars Trilogy' will forever be the real Star Wars movies.Liam Neeson and the others do credible jobs, but they have no where the interest and excitement that Harrison Ford and his cronies had.  I didn't fully appreciate back then what a prototypical 'action hero' Ford was. Without Darth Vader, without the Wookie, without Han Solo, without Princess Leia, without Chewbacca, without the grown up Luke Skywalker, and without the wise old Ben Kenobi, this is just an ordinary action movie.  Like they say, 'you can never go back!'",Null,0,4,26 November 2001
Sucker Punch," Love conquers all.
","Many will write off this movie as too strange with form over substance, a great visual display that means nothing. It isn't as simple as that. I enjoyed it, for the something different that it is.As the movie begins we see a will, where a now dead mother gave her two daughters to her husband, their stepfather. A mean stepfather. While the older daughter is trying to protect them, she accidentally shoots her younger sister. This puts her into a hospital for the insane. But she isn't insane. The hospital is not your usual hospital, instead it is run to train the attractive girls to dance and entertain clients, to give them pleasure.Emily Browning is the stepdaughter, and in the hospital she is called Baby Doll. When she is asked to dance, the only way she can do it is to retreat into a fantasy world, one where she can fight and slay any assortment of robots, monsters, or fire-breathing dragons. Although we never see what is actually going on during these escapes into fantasy, it apparently results in her dancing performances unlike any they have seen before. She soon is a big hit. But Baby Doll wants to escape the hospital, and during her fantasy Scott Glenn as the Wise Man tells her what she needs to get ... a map, fire, a knife, and a key. Plus one other that she will discover for herself.Her cohorts, both in the fantasy scenes and for the escape attempt are Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea, Jena Malone as Rocket, Vanessa Hudgens as Blondie, and Jamie Chung as Amber .The lady who takes these showgirls under her wing is Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski. While Oscar Isaac is Blue Jones, the ruthless operator of the whole thing. SPOILERS: Both Rocket and Blondie die at the hands of Blue Jones, but Baby Doll and Sweet Pea make it outside the building. Still, they must get by a group of men. Baby Doll discovers what the last item was, it was for her to sacrifice herself to allow Sweet Pea to make it out, and eventually travel to a better life. Outside, she gets on a bus, the driver is The Wise Man. Reality and fantasy fusing into one.",Null,1,2,29 July 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A lot more serious than I expected, a good study of teen angst.
","Just from the title I expected this to be a somewhat usual teen high school movie, and hoped for some interesting story line. I was surprised to find it to be a quite hard-hitting teen drama. The kids are mostly basically good kids, but many of them have some serious developmental issues.The titular character is 20-ish Logan Lerman as Pittsburgh area high school freshman Charlie. He is a bright but quiet person, seemingly going to significant lengths to not stand out. He sought the 'wallflower' status. He has never had a real girlfriend, and he has never kissed a girl on the lips. One of the upperclassmen befriends Charlie, in a good performance by Ezra Miller as Patrick . But Patrick has a secret of sorts, although his inner circle know and accept him, he is a homosexual. But more significant is Patrick's step-sister, played well by Emma Watson (of 'Harry Potter' fame) as Sam, who has had her own set of issues growing up, and has come to be a 'loose' girl. But Sam is graduating at the end of the school year and hopes to attend Penn State. She worries because her SAT scores aren't very good.Charlie takes a liking to Sam right away, even with the difference (Freshman vs Senior) in their ages. (In real life both are the same age.) He offers to help her study for her SATs, and she gladly accepts. She likes Charlie a lot, even though she has a boyfriend in college. The teacher that influences Charlie is Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson who teaches English. Charlie reads a lot, and Mr Anderson gives him books. The other key character, with a small but important role, is Melanie Lynskey as Charlie's Aunt Helen .SPOILERS: Charlie's aunt Helen had died in a car accident when Charlie was young, he seems to have blamed himself because she went to buy a present for him. After that he has occasionally had spells where he blacked out, and has had some professional treatment. When he and Sam finally were having a romantic encounter, and she began to rub his leg in an erotic manner , a flashback showed that his Aunt Helen also did that, she had abused him sexually and told him not to tell. He had repressed that memory but now it was coming out. In the end it seemed that perhaps he and Sam were going to remain a couple, even though she was off to college.",Null,3,7,22 May 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Claustrophobic. John Goodman is superb.
","I watched this at home on BD from my public library. It is not the kind of movie my wife watches. It is set somewhere in Louisiana '40 miles outside Lake Charles', which is pretty near where I grew up. But it is filmed in New Orleans and surrounding areas up river.As the movie starts Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle is packing her stuff to leave her apartment, including the bottle of Scotch which will come in handy later. She feels and we hear a loud explosion. We have no idea what is going on. On the road she gets hit by a truck and knocked down an incline. A day or two later she wakes up, with an IV in her arm and shackled to her bed.She quickly finds out that she is with John Goodman as Howard, in the emergency shelter he built beneath his house, equipped with an air purifier, emergency power, and a stock of food supplies. He says something bad has happened, either an attack from a hostile nation or possible an alien invasion. He says the air outside is not safe to breathe.She also soon finds out there is another person there, John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett, who had helped Howard build the shelter and who voluntarily entered the shelter for safety. He is a former athlete, not the brightest bulb in the pack.So as an audience member we have no idea what is really going on. Much of the middle of the movie plays out as three people forming a routine together. But Michelle never accepts that everyone outside is dead, she keeps trying to find ways to escape.It is a very well done story and Goodman is superb, alternately serious, or funny, or menacing. SPOILERS: Howard indeed was a bit messed up, at one point he shoots and kills Emmet. Some old photos provide evidence that he probably had kidnapped some young ladies. When Michelle does manage to escape, with a hand-made protective suit, the building goes up in flames, Howard dies. But she sees migrating birds in the air, so it must be safe. Then she sees an alien ship that hunts her down and is in the process of capturing her when she takes some paper and the Scotch and makes a Molotov Cocktail, throws it into the alien's mouth, which crashes the alien ship. In the car she gets a radio transmission from Baton Rouge, citizens are beginning to win, they need people in Houston with military or medical skills, so she turns left in the road, the sign pointing to Houston",Null,2,2,4 February 2017
The Finest Hours," Disney movie, dramatization of a real Coast Guard rescue in 1952.
","My wife and I saw this at home on DVD from our public library. The two 'extras' are short but interesting.It was the winter of 1951/1952 in Massachusetts. A storm was brewing and the Coast Guard station gets a radio transmission that a repaired, welded oil tanker in high seas has broken apart in the rough seas. It is now nighttime, and two Coast Guard rescue crews are dispatched. One of them had to turn back, but one of them continued. This is the story of the ones who continued and against great odds, without compass, found the half of ship with 32 aboard. As the captain later said 'It was probably just luck that we found you.'Chris Pine is excellent as the captain of the rescue boat, Bernie Webber. As well as Casey Affleck who was playing Ray Sybert, the key leader who managed to figure out a way to get the remaining half ship to a shallow area to ground it, preventing it from sinking until after the rescue.Being at night much of the picture is often indistinct but I suppose that couldn't be helped. Overall a fine movie, and the sound is filled with deep bass at appropriate times, lending to the realism.The character I most enjoyed however is British actress Holliday Grainger as Miriam. I had seen her as Bonnie in a 'Bonnie and Clyde' miniseries a couple of years ago, she is very pretty and also a good actress. Here she is the telephone operator who becomes Webber's fianc√© and she is among the ones monitoring the events of the evening from the Coast Guard station.The characters here are real people, the ending credits has some photos from the 1952 incident and its aftermath.",Null,0,1,18 July 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Fifty years after the original, this is a fine western.
","Set in the years just after the Civil War, it was still every man for himself in the west.The two opening scenes establish the two main characters. First we see Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and his family at night, on the homestead, and they hear a noise. It soon is clear that it is not an animal, someone had just set fire to his barn. He and his 14 year old son William (Logan Lerman) get saddles and whatever they can as the barn begins to crumble. Dan knew right away, the fire was set by one of the men working for a rich and powerful business man that he owed money to.Next we see an armored wagon carrying loot and being pursued by Ben Wade's (Russell Crowe) gang. Their reputation has spread over the old west as dangerous men who will take mercy on no one. Wade even shoots one of his own men who did not perform up to expectations.Eventually Wade gets captured, but his gang is still free. The task is to get Wade to prison where he can be tried and hung. As the plan breaks, they will get him to a town where he can be put on the 3:10 to Yuma prison. But getting him there will not be easy, his gang will make sure of that.Dan Evans, cripple from an accident during the war, volunteers to help get Wade to the train, after he bargains for $200 for his efforts. He doesn't really want to do this, but he needs some way to get out of debt and save his family and their homestead.Ben Wade is dangerous, and he is the kind of guy who always has a smile, even in captivity, and is always talking and asking innocent-seeming questions, always trying to get an edge, and usually is successful.Both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are superb in their roles. Even though they are on opposite sides of the law, through their ordeal they gain a measure of respect for each other.Peter Fonda is Byron McElroy, craggy old hired gun who helps protect the wagons as they carry loot across the west. Gretchen Mol is fine in a small role as Dan's wife Alice Evans.SPOILERS: There is a showdown and big gunfight right before the train comes to town. Dan's 14-year-old son had followed them and provided some key assistance. In the end Dan's bravery got Ben to the train, but Dan lost his life to one of Ben's men. Yet, after that all of Ben's men were killed, and Ben was put on the train. Before he died, Dan had made a deal that would secure the farm for his family.",Null,2,4,10 February 2008
The Equalizer," Leon, the Professional, doesn't have anything over this guy!
","A very entertaining revenge movie. Not too far removed from Liam Neeson in 'Taken' or Jean Reno in 'Leon.' And it has a nicely aggressive surround sound track. We watched it at home and several times we had helicopters flying through our viewing room, and the several explosions shook the pictures on the wall.Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, he is a gentle man who works at a Home Depot type of store in Boston, and spends many of his evenings at a small table in a dive of a corner caf√©, reading one book or another. But we find that he has a mysterious past as a highly trained killer.He strikes up an unlikely friendship with Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Teri, and he soon finds she is being held hostage and mistreated in the oldest profession, a prostitution ring run by the Russian mob. Bob is sort of able to ignore it until Teri ends up in the hospital, in intensive care. After his offer to buy out her contract is rebuffed and laughed at, he goes to work to exterminate the mob.The main enforcer from Russia is sent to find out who was doing all this and to exterminate him, New Zealand actor Marton Csokas as Teddy. Both he and Washington are good in their roles and the last 30 minutes are the most exciting, including a big battle of wits in the big hardware store.Edit: July 2019 - Just watched it again, really entertaining movie, Denzel is great.SPOILERS: In the big store the Russian guys are killed one by one, using different and unique ways. Barbed wire to hang one of them, a cordless drilling into the back of the skull of another, hedge trimmers through the neck of another, a microwave-induced explosion for another. But in the climax Teddy was done in by a powerful nail gun. Then three days later Bob was in Moscow visiting the big boss, and set things up so he electrocuted himself after his shower.",Null,1,3,22 January 2015
Ali," Fairly good portrait of the complex man who became Ali.
","I believe the film 'Ali' was doomed from the start to be 'average' by choice of Will Smith in the lead role. Not that I have anything against Smith as an actor. To the contrary, he was perfect for the roles he played in 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'Men in Black', and 'The Legend of Bagger Vance.' But Smith will always be the Fresh Prince, or something close to it. He could not 'become' Ali the way Denzel became Rueben Hurricane Carter, or the way Robert DeNiro became Jake LaMotta. When I watched 'Ali' I saw the Fresh Prince, because Smith's range as an actor simply is not broad enough for him to be a credible Ali.  I am just a few years younger than Ali, I was being drafted at the same time he was, I remember him well, and during this film I never felt like I was watching anything even close to the real Ali.The second problem is one of film editing. This film goes on for a full 2.5 hours. It would have been an absorbing 90 minutes, but the editors just kept in too much slow-moving and partly relevant film, with recreated boxing matches that go on way too long, such that I found the last hour very hard to stay interested in.With my gripes out of the way let me say that the film does a good job of showing Clay's and Ali's origins, the places and people that contributed to his formation, his surprising rise to World Champ, the way he taunted his opponents, often with poetry, his battle with the courts to avoid being drafted and sent to Viet Nam. There is no doubt that in his prime Ali was arguably the best heavyweight prize fighter ever. He inspired a lot of people but he was also a very flawed person. This film, 'Ali', the first hour and the last fifteen minutes, presents a fairly interesting view of who we was.Of particular note was the unlikely friendship that Ali developed with the late Howard Cosell. And for the film, the great job Jon Voight did in playing Cosell. Unlike Smith as Ali, Voight really 'became' Cosell. Also Ron Silver playing Ali's ringside manager. The DVD is acceptably sharp, with Dolby 5.1 sound that never stands out. There are no 'extras' to speak of on the DVD. I bought it used at Blockbuster, in like-new condition, for all of $5.",Null,0,1,18 January 2003
War Dogs," 'When does telling the truth ever help somebody?'
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife had no interest.It is based on a true story of two young men in Miami in about 2008 taking advantage of rules which allowed almost anyone to surf the government's website for the thousands of needed acquisitions for military supplies to outfit wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, then submit a bid. Everything from helmets to automatic rifles to tanks. Miles Teller is David Packouz, a basically honest young man working in Miami as a message therapist, then trying in vain to sell bed sheets to the multitude of old-folks homes in Florida. When, at a Jewish funeral, he meets up with old boyhood friend Jonah Hill as Efraim Diveroli. Both of these guys were the real people, they did not change the character names.Diveroli in most respects is the polar opposite of Packhouz. He has no morals, consumes drugs, soft and hard, services of prostitutes, and will cheat anyone at any opportunity to make money. He finds ways to illegally meet contracts, but his downfall was when he attempted to cheat a re-packaging company working for him in Albania. Once the FBI became aware of his illegal operations, repackaging 42-yr-old banned Chinese ammunition for a multi-million contract, the fantasy ended.The story is good because it shows how the scheming and dishonest can take advantage of cracks in a system like military weapons procurement. One of the producers is Bradley Cooper who also has a small but important role as an arms intermediary. And the real Packhouz has a small role as a very mediocre singer at an old-folks home.",Null,0,0,15 February 2017
The Longest Yard," OK for what it is, a comedy farce.
","I am not burdened with having seen the original 31 years ago, so was able to enjoy the DVD with my two 16 year olds. There is absolutely nothing ground breaking here. Everything has been covered before in prison movies and various sports movies. The ending is fairly predictable. Those of us who enjoy seeing it are fans of Adam Sandler, fans of Burt Reynolds, and fans of old-fashioned slapstick humor. My only complaint was the rather heavy amount of off-color language and sexual references for a PG-13 movie.Adam Sandler is Paul Crewe, former pro football QB accused of throwing a game. He ends up in prison after taking his girlfriend's car for a ride, getting stopped by cops acting on her stolen car report, then running from the cops, thinking as a celebrity of sorts he would not get into trouble. While in prison, he agrees to put together a team to play an inmate football game against the guards.Much of the middle of the movie is about recruiting various large and tough prisoners for the team. Many were reluctant at first, but various insults from the guards motivated them. Chris Rock became the assistant and they called him Caretaker. Burt Reynolds, former Heisman winner, helped out as Coach Nate Scarborough.SPOILERS FOLLOW. When the big game came, the guards scored two quick touchdowns because the inmates were channeling all their anger at getting back at the mean guards. However, after Crewe organizes them a bit, they come back to tie at halftime. During halftime, the warden had a private conversation with Crewe. Not wanting the guards to lose, he gave Crewe an ultimatum -- throw the game or face blame for the prison death of the Caretaker and spend the rest of his life in prison. At first he cooperates, then sees the disappointment of his prisoner teammates, confesses to them that he had thrown the pro game, vowed not to do another and, in the last seconds personally scores the 2-point conversion to win the game by 1 point.",Null,0,3,27 October 2005
Source Code," Novel concept, sci-fi story trying to prevent terrorist attacks.
","A movie like starts with a novel concept, then builds a story around it. The concept here is that when someone dies the last 8 minutes of their consciousness can be accessed. The second part of the concept is that a machine can transport the consciousness of someone else into that last 8 minutes to be able to examine closely what was going on.Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, military helicopter pilot, whose last memory is flying a mission 'in country.' But now he finds himself on a train, speaking to a woman he doesn't know. There are some strange interactions with a few passengers, he being confused about the situation, until a great explosion takes out the train plus the one traveling next to it. Colter is unharmed, because he wasn't actually on the train but into the consciousness of a man who had been on that train. He has been sent there with one mission, to figure out who the bomber is because they are expecting him to strike again shortly, with a bomb into Chicago that will take out part of the city and a lot of lives. While the first few minutes is pretty confusing, until you realize what is going on, ultimately the story makes sense and has a resolution that was not anticipated by the scientists controlling the experiment. Michelle Monaghan is of course good as Christina Warren, the young woman Colter finds himself on the train with. As is Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin, the lady in the lab communication with Colter. And Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Rutledge, the brains behind the novel technology.Good movie, takes you places you don't expect. We saw it on DVD in Dallas with Natalie. SPOILERS: Colter has to be sent multiple times into that last 8 minutes of the consciousness of the man killed in the explosion. Competing for his attention are his own questions about what happened to him, finally finding out he himself was reported dead in action. But, badly injured with only a part of his body left, he still had brain activity and was in the experiment. He formed the theory that the technology could also save the passengers, but alive in an alternate existence. He wanted to save and be with the girl. After he found the bomber, Michael Arden as Derek Frost, his alternate consciousness was able to send a text message to Goodwin, so she knew that the now saved train passengers were alive in the alternate existence, now that he prevented the train explosions.",Null,0,2,29 August 2011
Skyfall," Only a 'so-so' James Bond movie, but Javier Bardem makes it worthwhile.
","First I want to get the title out of the way, when I think of the term skyfall I think of things falling out of the sky. Or maybe of the old 'sky is falling' overreaction to an incident. But it isn't any of that, 'Skyfall' happens to be the Scottish estate where James Bond grew up, and it is where the big finale of this movie happens.Daniel Craig is OK as James Bond , but I grew up seeing all the old James Bond movies and Craig looks more like a beaten-up prizefighter than he does an M6 special agent. He is an acceptable actor, but this film succeeds, if it does, on the story. And for me (and my wife) the story just didn't resonate much. It wasn't very exciting, for a Bond movie. A secret list of agents and their cover names, on a jump drive, encrypted, and a rogue agent with a grudge threatening to expose them all.Judi Dench is back, and effective, as M (or is it 'Em', short for Emily?). But to me the real star here is Javier Bardem as Silva, the rogue agent. We know Bardem is good, from his prior roles. But here he is the only actor that is superb, chillingly so. He is such a good actor he makes all the others seem very ordinary in comparison.The movie has its requisite chases and fight scenes, and a few gadgets, but nothing that approaches what we have come to expect from Bond movies. The franchise needs to be energized, they need a new star, new writer, and new director.",Null,1,6,18 May 2013
50 First Dates," Not great, but above average rom-com with Sandler and Barrymore.
","Sandler plays a marine biologist who lovingly cares for his assortment of animals in a SeaWorld type of environment. The opening sequence shows how he meets pretty Hawaiian tourists, romances them, and they leave, with no commitment, no follow up. Barrymore plays a very sweet instructor who has a loving father and brother, but a short-term memory problem that creates the interest in the movie's story. I mostly like both Sandler and Barrymore, and they are good together here. The story is a fantasy, and best appreciated as such. It doesn't come up to the standard set by my favorite rom-coms, but it is a very nice movie in its own way. The first half is not as enjoyable at times, because of the often silly humor, especially with Rob Schneider, but the second half makes the movie.July 2017 update: I watched it again after all these years and most of it was fresh and entertaining. Schneider is still annoying.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, please read no further.When Sandler meets Barrymore in the local restaurant over breakfast, they hit it off immediately when he helps make a toothpick hinge for the house she is building with her waffles. She is different from all the others, and he looks forward to seeing her again the next morning. Which he does. But she has no memory of him and rebuffs what she senses is a pushy guy. Turns out she was in a car wreck a year or so earlier and developed a short-term memory problem, a specific kind (fantasy) which erases each day's new memories as she sleeps overnight. Akin to 'Groundhog Day', but exactly the opposite, where days continue but her memory does not. But Sandler persists, as he develops a particular affection for this sweet girl, gains the trust of her dad and brother, uses videotape to show her their relationship. Movie ends with her waking up on a boat, looking out a port hole, going on deck, there are Sandler and their daughter, videotape remaining her connection with previous days.",Null,2,4,17 August 2004
The Young Victoria," Very nice and interesting dramatization of Queen Victoria's early years.
","As the title suggests, this movie is not about Queen Victoria's entire life, but only those years as a teenager, leading up to becoming Queen of England, then the very first years as queen, including her marriage to her cousin Albert, who then became Prince Albert.Emily Blunt is Queen Victoria, and depicted as a teenager with a mind of her own. Her own mother and mother's secretary tried hard to get, really to force, Victoria to sign away her right to the throne, but she refused and this pressure just made her more determined to do things her own way.After becoming queen, being both lonely and somewhat overwhelmed at her job, she sought companionship in the equally young Rupert Friend as Albert, her cousin. They married (the Queen had to ask) and he became Prince Albert. His attempts at helping her rule England were initially rebuffed, but as history tells (not covered in this movie) Albert went on to play a very meaningful role and they ruled together for 20 years before he died at the rather young age of 42. But they had 9 children plus Victoria became the longest ruling monarch until her death at 81.In her early years as queen a main influence was Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne who was Prime Minister on at least two, possibly three, different occasions as favor swung from one political party to the other. Eventually Victoria realized that she would be better off trusting Albert for help and advice and Melbourne was dispatched.Miranda Richardson was Duchess of Kent, and Victoria's mother. She and her daughter, the Queen, had a very rocky relationship until Sir John Conroy was dispatched, then mom eventually became a valued grandmother.Always good Jim Broadbent was King William, Victoria's uncle. It was his death that gave the monarchy to Victoria as an 18-year-old.I generally like movies based on real events, and I have come to really like the movies based on British history, and this one is no exception.

Catch Me If You Can," Pretty good, but not as good as all the 'hype' made it out to be.
","We all know by now that CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on a real person, and his exploits as a doctor, lawyer, airpline copilot, and a few other things. For the most part the film is factual, as described in the DVD extras, including the real Frank Abagnale describing his experiences himself. DiCaprio and Hanks are both excellent in their respective roles. Hanks, especially, who usually seems to simply be playing various versions on himself, becomes a great character as the FBI agent chasing Frank Jr.
some SPOILERS follow - two main deviations in his story were used in the film. First, Frank Jr and his dad had several encounters during the film, but in real life Frank Jr never saw his father again after he ran away, and Frank Sr. died while Frank Jr. was in prison. That deviation worked well. The other deviation did not. In reality he was captured in France when locals reported seeing him in their community. In the film, there is a very implausible scene where the agents are looking at some of the counterfeit checks, quickly decide they had to come from Europe, and also quickly decide that he must be printing them in his mother's home town. They go there, they find him, he ends up in French jail.  When I saw that scene, it bothered me, I didn't think it seemed plausible with regard to the rest of the film. And, when the DVD extras made it clear that this scene was fictional, it further reinforced my opinion that this was not a good deviation.Still, it is a good, entertaining film, and the DVD is top quality, with a very interesting set of extras. After his release from prison time, Frank Jr. has gone straight, has contributed to techniques world-wide to reduce check and currancy fraud, and has made his real fortune as a consultant.

The Hangover," 'Rated R for pervasive language,' Funny movie, but just a bit too 'dirty' just to be dirty.
","Premise: Three guys are taking their friend, all from Los Angeles, to Las Vegas for a final fling two days before his wedding. All goes pretty smoothly until they check into the hotel and decide that they would get a $4000 per night suite instead of the room with two beds they had booked. OK, maybe they can afford the extra cost, but it seemed like a dumb move.The main story gets rolling the next morning when the three guys wake up in various states of hangover, don't know where Doug, the groom is, and can't remember anything from the night before. Add to the confusion there is a chicken running around,a full-grown, live Tiger in the bathroom, and a baby in the closet. Eventually the Tiger and the baby are explained, but I don't remember the chicken being explained.So most of the middle of the movie has the three friends trying to track down the groom and the mother of the baby. When they have the hotel valet get their car, he comes back with a police car, and hands it to them, 'Here you go, officers.' They have no idea why. They also track down that they had been to a wedding, one of them got married to a stripper, and they also had made a stop at the hospital.Overall it is a cute premise and a funny movie, I just wish it had not been so dirty in places, that isn't necessary for a well-written comedy.SPOILERS: As various thugs come after them they figure out that they ended up with $80,0000 worth a chips someone else had won, they had stolen the Tiger from Mike Tyson, and a few other irregularities. Assisting in a taser 'demonstration' to young kids they avoided arrest for the cop car. One of the guys turned out to be an idiot savant and won $82,000 for them at blackjack. They eventually found Doug on the roof of the hotel, with a bad hangover. They got to the wedding just in time, assisted by tuxes delivered on the freeway. And the one guy who married the stripper decided she might be worth further consideration so they made a date for the following weekend in LV.",Null,0,0,17 December 2009
Iron Man 3," Goes overboard in 'destruction' but kept my attention the whole way.
","Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors that I just like to see in movies. No matter what the role I find him entertaining with his mix of serious and funny. To me he is what makes this a good movie. Here he is back as Tony Stark, the wealthy inventor who made the first Iron Man suit while imprisoned in Afghanistan. (The movie does a very brief review of that.) He lives in a futuristic looking house that almost resembles a space ship, on a high bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This is an important fact, since one scene features the very graphic destruction of his house after he challenges the bad guys and gives out his address. But that gets a bit ahead of the story.There is a new terrorist and he is bent on destroying the USA and its President. We see him in videos patched into regular TV programming feeds. He says he can't be stopped, he will always be ahead of his pursuers. Of course Iron Man Stark vows to find him and kill him. And that is what sparked his perhaps rash decision to give his exact address, although I don't think it would have been hard to find anyway. But it makes for a story element.Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his love interest Pepper Potts, and Don Cheadle is back as Colonel James Rhodes who also uses one of the iron suits to fight crime.The bad guy, no pun intended, turns out to be Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, someone who knew Stark back in 1999, and in the years since, along with his partner in crime, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, had developed a technology that was imperfect, sometimes it caused the person to explode, and that is why they could not find bomb or explosive fragments at the terrorist bombing sites.So the story comes down to a contest between Stark and Killian, both capable fighters, to see if Iron Man can save the world yet again.SPOILERS: The man they saw on TV as the terrorist was Ben Kingsley, who played an actor named Trevor Slattery, hired by Killian and dressed in beard and Eastern garb, to disguise the fact that the real terrorists were scientists. With even more battles and destruction Stark finally gets rid of Killian, it seems, although maybe they were setting the stage for a sequel. Just entertaining fluff, lots of action. I never expected to see William Sadler as a President, but there he was as President Ellis.",Null,0,2,20 October 2013
Marie Antoinette," We were disappointed. NOT a very good movie.
","On the positive side, I enjoyed Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. I think her acting brought out a view of Antoinette that we don't think of when reading history. As well as Jason Schwartzman as young Louis XVI, completely unready to become king. And unready to have children with his new, arranged wife from Austria.I watched the movie with my wife, and three female high school seniors, one of them with a professed interest in Antoinette. We all were eager to see it. As it unfolded we kept waiting for it to get interesting but it never did. I cannot fault the source material, it is a fascinating story. I just think that Coppola did a very poor job in writing the script and then in directing the movie. Everything I liked about her 'Lost In Translation', one of my favorite recent movies, I found totally dull in 'Marie Antoinette.' That feeling was shared by all 5 of us seeing it.My personal favorite was old Temple, Texas boy Rip Torn as Louis XV in failing health. His death would give his grandson the throne of King of France.",Null,0,4,26 February 2007
Child 44," Good movie about a dark time in Russia.
","I found this movie on DVD from my public library. The theme is not pleasant, it is the rule of Stalin and in their attempts to make their country a 'perfect state' they denied that anything such as murder could exist.Tom Hardy is grown up Leo Demidov, he had been an orphan and now was an officer in the military. There is a strange death, a young boy is found dead and the 'official' reason for death was being hit and killed by a train.But the audience knows better, we see a glimpse of a man confronting the boy then luring him away. Eventually a number of other boys were found dead.The story is about Leo taking an interest and investigating these deaths, even if it gets him on the wrong side of his superiors. One of the dead children turns out to be his brothers.Hardy is very good in this role, characters speaking English with a Russian accent.",Null,4,7,19 October 2015
The Ring," Fairly suspenseful thriller with supernatural undertones.
","I really had no intention of seeing 'The Ring', but my public library is sending me 'The Ring 2' next week, so I figured I'd better find out what the first movie was about. I wasn't expecting a lot, and got more than I was expecting. Even though it was late, and I was tired, I just couldn't quit watching. I believe everyone knows the basic premise -- people who watch a certain video die at 10PM exactly 7 days later.Naomi Watts is the main protagonist, Rachel, a reporter who's niece dies without explanation. She gets very interested when a teacher shows her drawings made by her small son, days before the death of his cousin, showing her buried. (Watts, a Brit raised in Australia, is one of the few who can do a very credible American accent.)SPOILERS: Amber Tamblyn, a year before her TV role as Joan of Arcadia, plays cousin Katie here, who tells her fiend that she and her boyfriend at a remote motel had watched a video, and it is she who dies of fright as she opens a door at home with a noisy TV screen where she experiences something deathly frightening. Rachel figures out quickly that Katie and her boyfriend both died at exactly 10PM. She discovers another young couple who had died mysteriously at 10PM. Close examination of the video tape, which she finds at the remote motel, reveals the image of a light house, which she traces to a San Juan island off the Seattle coast. Long story short, years earlier a little girl had been thrown into a well and covered, and now that well was immediately below the room Katie had seen the video in. The only way, apparently, to avoid death in 7 days was to somehow free the dead girl, which Rachel does. But that isn't the end of the story, setting up the sequel. Near the end, the dead girl crawls out of the TV in Rachel's divorced husband's place, and he, having also seen the video, dies in his chair.",Null,0,1,1 September 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," No question in my mind, the best adventure movie of all time.
","It has been several years since I've seen 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', but I've seen it a number of times during the past 19 years. The story, the acting, the directing, the pacing are all close to perfect. It is one of the very few movies I rate '10'.I now await the release of the movie on DVD, which industry sources say will be this year, 2000. It definitely will be one to own.October 2005 update: Last night I watched it on DVD for the first time. Even though I had see 'Raiders' several times on VHS, it still is as exciting as it was the first time. In some ways even more so, because knowing the basic story helps me appreciate how well the movie is put together. Each scene is interesting on its own, and leads nicely into the next scene. Harrison Ford is just so perfect as Indiana Jones. I have not changed my opinion that it is the best action adventure movie that I have even seen, and I've seen lots of them in my 55 years of movie-watching.",Null,4,10,1 June 2000
Deepwater Horizon," Dramatization of the April 2010 disaster. Failure to properly audit.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from a Redbox rental. No extras, just the movie. The Deepwater Horizon was a semi-submersible rig for drilling oil and gas wells in very deep water, as deep as 8,000 feet, and designed to drill as deep as 30,000 feet, more than 5 miles deep. Its above-water platform was roughly the size to two football fields placed side-by- side.I live near the Gulf Coast, my career was in the oil industry, so this event almost 7 years ago is still somewhat fresh in my mind. In April 2010 in final operations to seal off a new well and begin production, some shortcuts were taken. The sealing cement was not properly tested and when the incident happened high-pressure natural gas, methane, flooded the platform and resulted in a fireball, eventually destroying and sinking the platform. The largest oil spill in history resulted. Today it rests on the bottom of the Gulf about 5000 feet down. There had been 126 aboard and 11 died, the rest escaped via lifeboats.I found the first half of this movie most interesting as it deals with the characters, their lives, how they traveled back and forth, how they interacted on the job, the depiction of the disagreements on well readiness. Most of the second half is the disaster and as such it becomes the somewhat typical disaster movie, showing the explosions, the falling rigs, the injuries, the escapes. All well made but nothing that we haven't seen before except we know this was a real event.Mark Wahlberg is the co-main character, Mike Williams, chief instrument guy, and Kurt Russell as Jimmy Harrell, almost always called 'Mr Jimmy', who it seemed was the chief supervisor on the rig. Both of them are excellent, I particularly liked Russell.",Null,0,1,16 January 2017
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Good movie, in that it does exactly what it sets out to do.
","In the words of the Beatles, 'Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about' in the lyrics from 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' And that is an appropriate description of this movie, a continuation of the others, inspired by the video game. Nothing is real, it is all fiction, it doesn't matter if any of it can happen or not. We watch it and appreciate it for the two female action heroes.As the last one ends we see the hero heading for Alaska, where it is believed that the area is safe, virus-free. They receive periodic radio transmissions from Arcadia. Milla Jovovich (now married to the writer/director Anderson) returns as Alice, super fighter and able to survive any situation. She gets a plane and flies to the coordinates in Alaska, only to find many other abandoned planes but no settlement, no 'Arcadia.' So she flies south along the coast, past Vancouver, past San Francisco, but she comes upon something in Los Angeles, a 'HELP' sign painted on the roof of a tall building. With a bit of ingenuity she lands the small plane on the roof, barely avoiding going over the edge, down to the masses of undead zombies. Congratulated on her landing she replies, 'That was a crash.'Her female sidekick Ali Larter returns as Claire Redfield. She really looks like an action hero, with her nice shoulders and athletic build. Also in it are two of my favorites, Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield and Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine.They eventually find that the 'Arcadia' is a ship, and it is moored offshore in Southern California, so the climax of the action happens there, after a very narrow escape from the zombies.There is no end in sight to the series, Jovovich and Anderson can retire making 'Resident Evil' movies and live very comfortably from residuals.",Null,4,7,16 January 2011
Stop-Loss," What happens when you don't get discharged when you expect?
","In the military, STOP LOSS, means extending a military person in the Guard or Reserves, or on active duty, beyond what their normal separation date would be.Those who join the military agree to this provision under paragraph 9c of the enlistment contract states: 'In the event of war, my enlistment in the Armed Forces continues until six (6) months after the war ends, unless my enlistment is ended sooner by the President of the United States.' The Department of Defense maintains that the term 'war' means anytime America's Armed Forces are engaged in hostile conflict, and not just 'war declared by Congress.' And that is the theme of this movie. We see a drive-by shooting in Iraq that turns out to be an ambush when the car stops in an alley. Most survive but not all do, under the leadership of SSgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe). When he and his men return home to Texas, they know it is also time for their discharge from the Army. But instead King is 'stop lossed' and he has much difficulty dealing with it.The 20-minute DVD extra with the writer/director (of 'Girls Don't Cry' fame) is very interesting, as she interviewed quite a number of men and women who were in Iraq, some affected by the 'stop loss' clause. She sought to make this fictional story as real as possible, not to make a political statement on the 'right' or 'wrong' of the situations, but to describe it from the soldier's point of view, and some difficult choices they have to make.Abbie Cornish is good as King family friend Michelle, engaged to one of the men, Channing Tatum as Sgt. Steve Shriver. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Tommy Burgess, Rob Brown is Isaac 'Eyeball' Butler.Timothy Olyphant is effective as Lt. Col. Boot Miller, whom King must answer to.SPOILERS: King is determined to avoid extending his enlistment. He first tries to go to Washington with a naive belief his congressman can help, then he decides to see a NY lawyer who can get him a new identity and situate him in Canada. Eventually however King and his family end up near the Mexican border and, when he considers what his life would be away from all that the knew and loved, he relented, and reported for duty and deployment back to Iraq.",Null,1,2,5 August 2008
Deja Vu," Good movie, much of it filmed in and around New Orleans.
","As a former resident of the famous Crescent City, I must admit that much of my enjoyment watching this movie came from the recognition of familiar scenes. Even some of the areas devastated by storm Katrina in 2005 were featured within the context of the story.Denzel Washington stars as agent Doug Carlin who comes in to help investigate what appears to be a terrorist attack, an explosion which sinks a Mississippi River ferry full of military on Mardi Gras leave. The story relies on a technology that doesn't exist and in fact probably should be considered impossible, warping time and space to be able to interact with the recent past.I enjoyed the movie, it held my attention and the production values are first-rate.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Jim Caviezel is antagonist Carroll Oerstadt, the disgruntled man who is responsible for the explosion. One of his victims is Paula Patton as Claire Kuchever, but her body washes onshore a few minutes before the explosion occurred. Carlin (pronounced 'car-LEEN') quickly figures out, from clues under a bridge and from security video, that the same person murdered Kuchever also sank the ferry. Fortunately a secret government project allowed them to see 4 days into the past, in real time, and are able to observe the victim's last hours and identify the killer. The big leap of faith happens when Carlin puts himself into the machine and goes back 4 days to prevent her death and the explosion. Mandatory action on the ferry near the end, shootings etc.",Null,3,5,22 May 2007

It," Remake of King's 1990 2-part miniseries on TV.
","I watched this at home on BluRay, my wife skipped. This is an example of a movie that needs to be seen in a theater, or in a home system equipped with surround sound and a powered subwoofer that goes down below 20Hz. The sound track is a big part of the suspense and fright, in certain scenes the whole room shook.Set in Derry, Maine, we eventually find out, from the research by the young teens, that the shape-shifting clown appears and is active every 27 years. When he appears people disappear. This story takes place in 1988 and 1989.All the kids are good but I will only mention two of them. Jaeden Lieberher , who was so good in 'Book of Henry' is Bill Denbrough. As the movie starts he makes a paper boat for his little brother who subsequently disappears while floating the boat down the street during a heavy rain. There is a clown in the street drain, the boy is convinced to approach him.Bill doesn't accept that his brother is dead, he and several other 13-ish boys, plus one 13-ish girl, start an organized search for the missing persons and 'IT'.The girl is Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh, I had not seen her before but came away impressed with her screen presence. Her character interacted in an interesting manner with others, including her emotionally abusive father.This is not my favorite genre but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. It is a well-made movie and I am glad I took the 2 hours to view it.",Null,2,4,12 March 2018
Hereditary," Genuine horror movie, see it at your own risk.
","I watched this movie at home on BluRay from my public library. My wife skipped. I don't usually seek out horror movies, I don't enjoy them that much, but I have to watch one ever so often to remind myself why.The title is a reference to supernatural issues being passed down within a family. In this particular case strange grandma just died and now her daughter, Toni Collette as Annie, is gradually descending into madness. I must particularly comment on what an authentic job Collette did, she really was terrifying in key scenes.The other worth mentioning is young actress Milly Shapiro as very strange Charlie who meets an early gruesome death and stays around to haunt everyone else. Young Milly, it is fair to say, has quite unusual looks, perfect for this role. But I looked her up and found a u-tube video of her and her sister singing onstage in a musical, she is quite an accomplished singer. So it just shows, yet again, 'looks' can be deceiving.For viewers who like this kind of supernatural horror movie, it is actually pretty well made. I am glad I watched it but for me it is not a very good movie.",Null,1,4,17 October 2018
Casablanca," Simply, one of the classic movies and still superb after all these years.
","'Who thinks 'Casablanca' is the number one movie of all time?' That is a game many play, but I refuse to play it, because I don't think it matters. I have seen many movies over the past five decades, and 'Casablanca' is one of my all time favorites. It is set in a mysterious place at a very mysterious time, and has many mysterious figures running through the story. It has war, it has friendship, it has love, it has sacrifice. All the elements combine to form an entertaining but gripping film that always seems as fresh as the first time you viewed it.This is perhaps my favorite Humphrey Bogart role, as Rick Blaine the exiled American who owns and operates his own gin joint. We know he isn't totally a good man, but we also sense that inside he is not a bad man at all. Mostly he just wants to do his job and be left alone. But danger lurks at the turn of every page of script.Most SPOILERS follow. The crux of the story involves Rick, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor (Paul Henreid). Rick and Ilsa have a history, they parted under suspicious circumstances when she failed to meet him at the train leaving town. Now she shows up with a husband that Rick never knew she had. Victor and Ilsa want safe passage to America, and Rick holds the papers that can get them there. Still in love with Ilsa, he realizes that true love will give her what she needs, and he does. Safe passage for her and her husband.Casablanca has quite a good ensemble cast, with stars in their own rights Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Maj. Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, and Peter Lorre as the shady Guillermo Ugarte.The DVD is superb!!",Null,4,6,17 September 2003
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A better vampire story, blends real American history with vampire myth.
","I really like this movie. I went into watching it thinking it might be cheesy but it is very well made and has a bit of good American History in it to boot! Plus, being a Tim Burton film, even if you don't like it you know it will be exciting.The basic story is the real one of Abraham Lincoln, starting out in 1818 when he was a young boy of 9, and ending after he, as President of the United States, gives his now famous Gettysburg in 1863. It includes his meeting and eventually marrying Mary Todd.Now layer on top of that the 'untold story' which involves Vampires. That part begins when young Abe awakens one night and sees his own mother being attacked by a Vampire. From that moment he made a vow to himself to devote his life to hunting and killing Vampires.Of course it wasn't easy, he needed help from a trustworthy Vampire who helped train him. His great revelation was to use an axe with a silver cutting edge, allowing him to decapitate and kill Vampires.The story also uses the Vampire factor in the Civil War. When the South finds itself outmanned, a Vampire leader vows support, all the Vampires that they need. But Abe has another revelation one evening, while holding a silver fork. If they were to melt down all the silver they could get, and make bullets and other weapons, they could even defeat the Vampire soldiers.The conclusion of the story focuses on the Battle of Gettysburg. Even though the war lasted until 1865, the defeat of General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg in 1863 was a milestone, and the address President Lincoln gave is one of the most meaningful in American History.Good movie, for anyone who enjoys a good Vampire story.Benjamin Walker with appropriate makeup looks very much like the Abraham Lincoln we recognize from historical images, and he does a fine job in the title role. Dominic Cooper is Henry Sturges, the friendly Vampire who helps Honest Abe. Anthony Mackie is his life-long friend, former slave Will Johnson. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good as Mary Todd Lincoln. And always good, especially as a villain, is Rufus Sewell as Adam the mighty Vampire leader.",Null,0,0,8 November 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Never gets old.
","I had seen 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' some years ago, around the time it came out. I watched it again yesterday with two teens who had not even been born in 1988. We all enjoyed it, and I had forgotten much of the story line. While it isn't the first movie to mix animated characters with live characters, it is arguably the first to do it in a realistic, 3-dimensional way. I remember seeing some 'making of' footage many years ago, pretty fascinating stuff.Edit 2019: I watched it again on BluRay from my public library, 15 years after watching it with the teens who now are 30, married and out of town. Brought back fond memories.SPOILERS follow, for my recollection, please read no further, OK!?There is an alternate reality called Toon Town, and the residents are referred to as 'Toons.' They actually come into our world to act in cartoons, and do all the dangerous things we see in cartoons without getting injured. Roger Rabbit is married to shapely Jessica (Kathleen Turner voiced) and is set up, 'framed', by Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd of BTTF 'Doc Brown' fame) who in the end turns out to be a 'Toon' also.

Minority Report," Good movie, not great. Relies strongly on 'pre-determination.'
","The film gets its name from a mention, half-way into the film, that when one of the three 'predictions' differs from the other two it is suppressed as a 'minority report' so as to not cause a furor. The main protagonist, John (Tom Cruise), pursues this to see if there is a flaw in the pre-crime arrests and perhaps innocent people are incarcerated. If you take away the futuristic setting of this film, and all the special effects, it is quite an ordinary film noire 'whodunnit.' Crime fighters are at work, someone double-crosses, an innocent person is framed, he goes on the run, has to figure out the bad guy. Same story has been done many times. To his great credit, Spielberg didn't just try to invent what technology will be prevalent in 50 years, he held a retreat with experts in various fields and used their input for the film's design. Perhaps the most likely to be implemented are the various retinal scanners to identify people, and even target public advertisements as individuals walk past.The whole story of 'Minority Report' would fall apart without (1) the belief in God who creates a pre-determined universe and (2) God will choose to communicate the pre-determined path. In the two depicted 'future' murders the film uses, at least 3 or 4 people are involved in the images that are transmitted as 'future' events. In a random universe, it is quite unlikely that the events, even only 20 or 30 minutes in the future, would happen exactly as predicted, and it would be impossible for any one participant to 'see' all the others. Therefore, it would have to be a supreme being, causing a pre-determination, and communicating it. For me, and probably for most others, that idea is so foreign that we can never take the concept as even a 'what if' premise. Interesting science fiction, but may work better as a comedy (like Back To The Future or Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) rather than a dark drama.SPOILERS follow -- Turns out John's mentor, the old and wise Lamar (Max von Sydow) needed to murder Agatha's (Samantha Morton) mother to keep Agatha as one, and the most effective, of the three predictors. So as not to get caught he hired a drifter to murder someone else at the very same spot, edge of a lake, dressed in the same clothes. When he duplicated it with Agatha's mother they thought it was an deja vu echo, and ignored it, because he had set up the system to work that way. The pre-crime division was dissolved, the three predictors, who had been the only survivors of a genetic experiment, lived out their lives in seclusion near the ocean.Sept 2017 update: Just watched it again after 14 1/2 years, still an interesting story.",Null,1,2,7 January 2003
Finding Neverland," The story of how author JM Barrie 'found' his inspiration for Neverland.
","This is a good movie. Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, and the others are very good, as they always are. However, paying scant attention to the advertisements for 'Finding Neverland', I got the impression that it was a fantasy story, but it is rooted entirely in reality. Some details are changed, but it is mostly the story of how Barrie (Depp) met and became an active part of the Llewelyn Davies family of boys, and through that involvement was inspired to write his famous story of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and Neverland. The parts of the trailers (from scenes in the movie) where young boys appear to magically fly out the bedroom window are simply depictions of Barrie's imagination.The boys' mother (Winslet) suffered from a respiratory problem (TB??) and died early, her will requested that Barrie, who had no children of his own, be co-guardian of her boys along with their grandmother (Julie Christie). History tells us that Peter (played wonderfully here by Freddie Hightower) grew up despondent that he was attached to Peter Pan and as an adult threw himself under a London Tube train after failing to inherit Barrie's fortune.However, the movie, taken as a rather brief snapshot in time, the period where Barrie meets the family and gains his inspiration for his stories, is a very good one. The DVD is a nice one with an excellent picture and sound presentation, with interesting making-of extras.",Null,4,5,9 April 2005
If I Stay," Cello prodigy in Portland Oregon wants to attend Julliard.
","I really like this movie. I am a life-long musician and the theme of this movie captured me totally. Plus the young actress carries this movie and shows why she is one of the best teenagers acting currently.Chlo√´ Grace Moretz (of 'hugo' fame) is Mia Hall, part of a wonderful family and with a younger brother she loves. At a very young age she took and interest in the cello and at 16 had developed into a prodigy of sorts. She didn't even realize fully her capabilities.But tragedy strikes and everything changes. She has choices but the movie is about how she will make her choice and what that will lead to.The rest of my comments contain story SPOILERS and should not be read by anyone who doesn't know the story here. It snows and the family takes advantage of school being canceled for a snow day, perhaps unwisely take a road trip. In the icy conditions a truck skids into their car, everyone is badly injured, and Mia finds herself in the snow, apparently unharmed. But as she walks towards the wreckage sees herself, badly injured and unconscious. Her spirit is observing this, she gets into the ambulance with her injured self, and much of the remaining movie is in the hospital as she and others are treated.But it isn't that simple, as she is required to 'decide' whether she will let herself actually die, or be brought out of the coma, we see her life the past year and a half leading up to that, how she meets a boy at school who is a rocker, how she finds love through that relationship, her audition for Julliard, and a number of other things.She finds out her mom and dad both die, then her brother does too, she doesn't want to awaken to live as an orphan. But the pivotal scene is when she (her spirit), unseen and unheard by others, hears her cello music over the hospital's paging system. But as she rushes to the room where her unconscious self is, finds that her boyfriend is playing the music into her ears using headphones. She has him, she has Julliard, she has a life ahead and wakes up. The boyfriend is played by Brit Jamie Blackley as Adam who does all his own singing with his fictitious rock band. Moretz took cello lessons to appear realistic, but face replacement technology in post-production was used to make it appear she was really playing.",Null,0,0,7 December 2014
G.I. Jane," 'And the best thing about pain, it lets you know that you're not dead yet.'
","Seems to me this film, G.I. JANE, has a rating that is quite lower than it should be. Demi Moore doesn't always choose the best roles, but she is a fine actress, and here she is just right for the role of a strong-willed junior Naval officer who is chosen to be the test case for women having all the same opportunities as men, to fight, and perhaps, get killed. Everyone expects her to wash out, but she expects to complete the 3-month Navy Seal training.G.I. JANE is now available on 'budget' DVD for under $10US, so I bought my own copy, mainly because the film also features Daniel Von Bargen as the politician undergoing Naval Secretary confirmation hearings. However, watching it again after perhaps 5 years, I found myself marveling at what a good movie it is.some SPOILERS follow, don't read any further if you want to be totally surprised with the movie.At the beginning it appears that her biggest supporter is the lady senator (Anne Bancroft) from Texas, but it turns out that in reality the senator chose her with the expectation that she would wash out in a week or two, then she could say 'we tried, but women just aren't tough enough.' In return, bases in her home state would not be closed and she could get re-elected. When O'Neal appeared to be headed for success, the senator orchestrated trumped-up charges of behavior unbecoming an officer, lesbian fraternization, so she would be on office duty pending the investigation. O'Neal got back in to finish her training when her boyfriend realized the truth, and O'Neal threatened to expose the senator.And, as a final punctuation mark to the story, in a final training exercise they were pressed into service to recover a stray satellite that fell in Iran, a gun battle ensured, O'Neal got to save the Master Chief who had tried so hard to get her to drop out.Not a great film, but a very, very good one, regarding the lesson to accept others, and also to be dedicated to a cause.  I am glad I own the DVD, which is unspectacular but has nice Dolby 5.1 surround sound. No meaningful extras at all, and the picture is just average for a DVD.",Null,0,3,9 May 2003
Training Day," Fine acting, but a disappointing movie overall.
","I was anxious to see 'Training Day' because Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his performance. It indeed was an Oscar-caliber performance, but that alone doesn't make it a great film. In fact, to me it is seriously flawed.As Denzel said in an interview this week, when he found out his character met such a finality, he took license to make him a really bad guy. With perhaps noble intentions, this cop deals out his own form of justice to the drug traffickers, in one scene shooting Scott Glenn's character with a shotgun in his apartment, then telling the other officers present how they should relate the incident to authorities. Denzel was also a cheating husband, with a primary family of wife and 4 sons, and a young son on the side with a Hispanic woman in the 'hood.'Ethan Hawke plays an honest, by-the-book type of guy who is also street smart and capable of handling himself, a good cop. He eventually gets the upper hand on Denzel, after being abandoned for dead among Latino gambler thugs, and prevents him from getting the stolen money to the payoff point.The following comments contain information which may be considered SPOILERS for those who have not yet seen Training Day.The story covers one day, from early morning to midnight, it is Ethan Hawke's first day 'training' with corrupt cop Denzel to become a narcotics officer. It ends when Denzel, unable to get the $Millions to the Russians by midnight, is gunned down at a stoplight by a half-dozen or so Russians. But I get ahead of myself.Although difficult to watch at many points, most of the first 3/4 of the film has a realistic, ingenuous feel to it. Then the last parts become disingenuous. After a brutal fight, Hawke drops from the roof onto the hood of Denzel's car? Denzel, instead of getting out and disposing of him does a multiple car-ram routine in the parking lot? Denzel flaunts disobedience of all the rules, even pointing a gun at another driver in mid-day, but at midnight, on a deserted street stops and waits for a light to change to green?? That was obviously done only to stage the finality where the Russians box him in and then start shooting. A rather promising story, once again, ruined by a poor and unimaginative end game. Staged fights, near-executions, saved-by-a-phone-call scene, car crashes, slow-motion execution do not a good movie make.I saw it on DVD. While the picture and sound are fine, and there are a couple of interesting extras, overall the presentation by modern standards is average at best. Overall a disappointment, with much foul language and crude sexual references, and I will not recommend 'Training Day' to friends.",Null,15,27,11 June 2007
In Bruges," A very well crafted dark comedy, with violence and pervasive off-color language.
","For viewers who don't mind pervasive use of the F-word and occasionally the C-word, and also don't mind gory violence here and there, this is a very well-crafted and entertaining dark comedy.As we learn in the extras on the DVD, Bruges, Belgium is an attractive medieval city that hasn't been featured in a movie, so this story was sort of 'let's figure out how to get Bruges in the story' and it works.Colin Farrell is Ray and Brendan Gleeson is Ken, two professional hit men who are sent to Bruges for a while to see how things cool down in London after a hit. Ken is the veteran, Ray is the new guy. Things didn't exactly go right in his first hit.Ralph Fiennes is Harry Waters, their boss. He plays this role as a ruthless 'business man' who has very strict rules about their profession.French actress Cl√©mence Po√©sy is Chlo√´ , a local Bruges actress that Ray meets while a movie shoot was going on at night. One of the actors is an American dwarf and while his appearance seems cosmetic at first, becomes a key element in the overall resolution of the story.SPOILERS: Ray messed up his first job, a hit on a priest, when he accidentally shot and killed an innocent young boy. Harry's motive for sending them to Bruges was to order Ken to execute Ray, because Harry, a family man with sons and daughters, has a strict rule against killing children. Meanwhile Ray is despondent over all this and is about to take his own life in a Bruges park when Ken comes upon him, ready to shoot him. Instead of simply observing, he stopped Ray from suicide then put him on a train out of the country. But Ray was brought back to Bruges to face assault charges from a few days earlier,while Harry is traveling to Bruges to deal with Ken for not snuffing Ray. The whole thing comes to a climax in a town square at night, when Harry chases down Ray and shoots him he also accidentally kills the dwarf and, thinking he killed a child, put his gun in his own mouth and killed himself. As the movie ends, Ray is being transported to a hospital with grave wounds and we hear his thoughts 'hoping that he survives', but we don't find out if he does.",Null,0,2,24 September 2008
Friday Night Lights," Superb film profiling football in West Texas.
","A fine ensemble cast brings West Texas high school football to life in this film. Billy Bob Thornton is one of my favorite actors and he is Coach Gary Gaines at Odessa Permian, where all the locals, many of them members of one of the 4 former state champion football teams, expect him to bring home another class 5A state championship in 1988. The fine young actor Lucas Black is Mike Winchell, the quarterback. Derek Luke, who was so good as Antwone Fisher, is Boobie Miles, the gifted runner who is destined for a great college and pro football career, until he is injured. Tim McGraw is the demanding father, Charles Billingsley, who rides his son who has trouble holding onto the football.SPOILERS follow. The film follows the 1988 season, where the team ended up in a 3-team tie for the district championship, and one team was eliminated by a coin toss. As Permian was one that went forward, we See that they won each game that led to the state championship game in the Houston Astrodome. That may have been a fictitious location, as one of the extras on the DVD appears to show the final game being marred by rain. Anyway, Permian lost to a larger Dallas team, but won the state championship the next year.The film shows how these young boys had to grow up young, to handle the demands placed upon them to win. It deals with the relationships they developed. A fine 22-minute DVD extra shows many of the real members of that 1988 team, and what they have done with their lives. One went on to Harvard and is a successful lawyer. The interview with Boobie Miles is touching, as his knee injury cut his career short, and he really wasn't prepared for anything but football. he makes a point that young boys really need to get an education, have a 'plan B' in case 'plan A' doesn't quite work out.",Null,0,4,21 January 2005
John Wick," Far too much cheap, point-blank killing for this to be a really good movie.
","OK, I know it is a movie, a complete work of fiction, I know actors didn't really die. But this kind of movie glorifies point-blank execution killing justified because the guys being killed work for a Russian mafia in New York. But it still cheapens life and we simply have too much of that in our movies.In general I like Keanu Reeves and I like his character here, John Wick, who formerly worked as a hit man for the same Russian gang that he has to turn against. He had successfully gotten out, 'retired', and had a life with his loving wife. But she had a terminal illness and she died. Still in grief, he gets a delivery at home, it is a cute puppy that his wife had arranged to be delivered right after her death, so he would have a companion and he could remember her.Stopped for gasoline in his beautiful 1969 Mustang, puppy in the front seat, a guy walks up and asks 'How much?' Shocked Wick simply says it is not for sale. The man says something rude in Russian then is shocked when Wick answers him, in Russian. That night the dog alerts and Wick gets up to find three men in his house, they must have looked up his address from the Mustang's license plate. They beat him mercilessly, killed his dog, and stole his Mustang. (Sounds like an old western movie, doesn't it?) Well this 'guy' is the frivolous son of the Russian gang leader, and when the dad, Michael Nyqvist as Viggo Tarasov, finds out his son stole John Wick's car, and killed his dog, he knew Wick would hunt all of them down. Which is what he does, and that is mostly what the movie is about.The other good role is Willem Dafoe as fellow hit-man Marcus, who appears to accept a $4 Million job to kill John Wick, but instead he ends up helping him.This is just a plain shoot and kill revenge movie, and it could have been so much better but I suppose this is what appeals to movie- goers nowadays.",Null,0,9,28 February 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Animated fable of finding the Dragon Warrior.
","The biggest thing I took away from this movie is how much further digital animation has comes in just a few years since 'Toy Story' and 'A Bug's Life.' Not that those are any worse for the wear, but what we see in 'Kung Fu Panda' is a big step beyond the animated movies of just a few years ago. It is a marvel to view in high definition and with surround sound.Jack Black stars as the Panda Po who admires kung fu and even has dreams where he is a master. But when he awakes he still works in his dad's noodle shop. (His dad is a goose, it is never explained how that happened). One day when a big ceremony is taking place to name the next Dragon Warrior, which is at the top of the kung fu domain, Po quite accidentally ends up falling from the sky and into the ceremony.My favorite voice actor in this movie is Dustin Hoffman as the kung fu master, Shifu. He is identifying the new Dragon Warrior, and as Po falls from the sky Shifu picks him. Po is more shocked than anyone else.So the movie is about Po making efforts to actually learn kung fu and against all odds actually become the master of masters, the Dragon Warrior.Other key kung fu characters are Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Ian McShane, exceptional as the evil Tai Lung, Jackie Chan, funny as Monkey, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Lucy Liu as Viper, and David Cross as Crane.Michael Clarke Duncan's deep voice is perfect as Commander Vachir of the high security prison where Tai Lung is being held.Naturally the evil kug fu master gets away, and travels to claim the Dragon Warrior position for himself, and Po has to be the one who defeats him. But can he??Good movie, lots of exciting animated action.",Null,0,0,18 November 2008
Chinatown," I don't embrace all the high praise for 'Chinatown.'
","'Chinatown' is currently #42 in the IMDb rank list, and based on that I had expected it to be a great movie. While I found it good and interesting, to me it was nothing more than that. My rating is '7' of 10. I can think of a number of 'detective/whodunnit' films that are much better.  Reading many user reviews, it seems that many give it bonus points for having an unexpected, and dark, ending. So, maybe if in 'Crossroads' the Britney Spears character had fallen off the stage and died right before her first concert, then it too might have been one of the best of all time!?  I watch films to be entertained and for me a good, uplifting conclusion usually works. 'Chinatown' does not have that, so for me it just becomes another uninteresting story, although a fictional one, about bad people getting their way.I have always thought Jack Nicholson to be one of the better modern actors, and his performance here is one of his better ones. I don't normally like Dunnaway but I found her performance also to be very good. But Polanski never has been a favorite of mine and perhaps that's why I think 'Chinatown' is closer to ordinary than great.SPOILERS - don't read any furtherThe apparent affair with the young girl is just a red herring. She is in fact the daughter/sister of Dunnaway's character, a product of incest. Jake (Nicholson) is an innocent pawn, his investigation is there to divert attention and make it look like the husband is murdered for cause. In the end, the evil father (Huston) who also has the police in his hip pocket gets away with murder, and has his police pawn kill his own daughter.

Rocketman," Hits all the right notes, Elton John in his early career years.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our local library. Not only are the picture and sound great, the disc also has a series of very interesting 'extras.'I didn't pay too much attention to Reginald Dwight, aka Elton John, during his early years but have eventually become a fan of his. Some of the music I listen to is his live concert in Australia. But frankly I knew little of the man beyond a few glimpses on TV. This Biopic is done as a musical, which is appropriate, considering the subject, but also contains some whimsical, fantastic elements.Taron Egerton is just so good as Elton John, doing all his own singing. Elton John is a producer and had an active role in making sure the story was true to how his life before about 1990 unfolded. However he avoided attending any recording sessions, he didn't want to be a distraction or have Egerton feel any pressure to sound like Elton. So what we get is what really happened during Elton John's approximate first 40 years.The first half of the movie is mostly light and entertaining, the second half more dark and tragic, as we see Elton John spiral into a drug and alcohol use that could have killed him. In a relatively recent interview he said, 'This is how bleak it was: I'd stay up, I'd smoke joints, I'd drink a bottle of Johnnie Walker and then I'd stay up for three days and then I'd go to sleep for a day and half, get up, and because I was so hungry, because I hadn't eaten anything, I'd binge and have like three bacon sandwiches, a pot of ice cream and then I'd throw it up, because I became bulimic and then go and do the whole thing all over again.' But in 1990 he admitted to his addictions and a note at the end of the film states that he has been sober 28 years. I believe that now, in 2019, it is 29 years.While a few scenes are hard to watch overall this is a highly interesting and entertaining account of Elton John's life, and Egerton is superb, what I will call a 'Best Actor' quality of performance.",Null,0,0,17 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Yet another take on the long-established story, and a very fine one at that.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. It is a 2-disc set, the second disc has several interesting extras, including a 30-minute glimpse into what all went into making the movie. Cooper studied voice, guitar, and piano for 6 months in preparation for his role.The long-established story is of a worn out performer, existing on booze and drugs, coming upon a young singer and sending her on a trajectory to stardom. Gaga (real name Stefani) is perfect for the role of Ally because in many respects it mirrors her own early life as she fought for recognition. This is her first role in a movie and she does just fine.Bradley Cooper has had an itch to direct and this is his first movie. He also is the second featured role as Jack, the grizzled and famous singer and guitarist. His training paid off, his songs, both solo and with Gaga, come off very professionally. In addition some scenes were actually filmed before live audiences at festivals, the film acts were sandwiched between the regular acts.It is a story with both heartbreak and triumph, they pull it off very well. I was totally entertained, I will watch it again before I return the DVD to my library. As we would expect, grizzled veteran Sam Elliott is good as Bobby, Jack's much older brother who mostly raised him after their dad died when Jack was still young.",Null,0,2,8 March 2019
Gravity," Three astronauts on a repair mission get into an unplanned jam.
","This movie, 'Gravity', has received much hype starting quite a long time before its release. As with most highly hyped movies, when viewer expectations are heightened, the actual viewing doesn't quite match the high expectations. We saw it on DVD, a Redbox rental. However it is a very good and entertaining movie with a good share of drama. Will they or will they not survive the surprise rain of new space debris?Sandra Bullock is a PhD scientist Ryan Stone, sent on a repair mission for the Hubble telescope. This is realistic, as that equipment has had similar repair missions. While she has trained for months for the mission, she is not a pilot and will encounter particular difficulties in this unplanned event.Her main partner is very experienced astronaut and pilot, George Clooney as Matt Kowalski, a carefree type of guy who always seems to have a 'story' for mission control.All hell breaks loose during their EVA (extra-vehicular activity) when a Russian planned destruction of obsolete orbiting equipment starts a type of chain reaction and a great debris field orbiting at normal orbit speed, in a trajectory that crosses that of the US astronauts every 90 minutes. Their hope of competing the mission, or even preserving the space station, are gone and the movie is simply about their trying to survive and get back to Earth, back to gravity! Pretty fascinating effects to simulate weightlessness and working in space, the movie is well-made and entertaining.SPOILERS: Kowalski hooks up Stone to himself via a tether and he uses the power of his jet pack to maneuver them towards another space station. However running out of fuel and oxygen, Kowalski unhooks himself and leaves Stone to try to survive as he drifts away, doomed. In a complicated series of events she manages to get into an escape pod and makes it safely to Earth, almost drowning as she lands in a lake, but the movie ends as she pulls herself up and turns to walk away.",Null,6,9,5 April 2014
Lone Survivor," Gripping true story, the horrors of the fight in Afghanistan.
","I live in Houston Texas, and around here an institution of sorts is furniture store magnate 'Mattress Mac', known for his philanthropy and his very annoying 'save you money' TV commercials. In recent TV commercials we sometimes also see a burly young man standing with him, that young man is Marcus Luttrell. I only mention this to make a connection, because this movie 'Lone Survivor' is about Marcus Luttrell and his experience in Afghanistan as a member of a Navy Seal team sent into a hostile area to eliminate a top Taliban commander. That he survived to write his book and now see this movie come to reality is a testament to his toughness.Unfortunately the others did not survive. This is not an easy movie to watch, the fighting is very realistic and the deaths often very gruesome. I never liked Peter Berg as an actor, and I do not like all his directorial efforts, but I have to give credit here, he went all out to make it realistic. That can be either good or bad depending on one's tolerance for violence and gore.The mission was jeopardized when a group of two men and a boy, herding goats, came upon the Seal Team on a mountain slope overlooking the village where the target was. The men were faced with a critical decision, kill the innocent three to avoid spoiling the mission, or let them go and surely spoil the mission. It wasn't easy and it wasn't unanimous, but they did let them go, they did abort the mission, they tried to get rescue but had radio problems. In the end Marcus Luttrell was saved only because he came upon men in another village that had an honor code of sorts, to protect someone in need of medical attention.

Wind River," The title refers to a particular Native reservation in Wyoming.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is not an entertaining movie, the subject is too serious for that, but it is a well-made and worthwhile movie.At the beginning we see a young woman running barefoot in the snow, we can tell from her actions that she isn't out for a nighttime run. She is fleeing a dangerous situation and in fact she later is found dead, frozen in the cold weather.Jeremy Renner is Cory Lambert, he works for a wildlife department, he helps keep predators from killing livestock. We witness that he has a very capable long-range rifle. He discovers the dead girl of 17 or 18. It hits him hard, he had lost a daughter not many years earlier.Elizabeth Olsen is FBI agent Jane Banner. She was dispatched to the location only because she was available and reasonably near by, but totally unprepared for the weather and the situation. But she, along with Cory, becomes the key to getting to the bottom of the murder.The movie was made to dramatize a situation with young Native American females who regularly go missing, some are discovered murdered as is depicted here, some just vanish and are never accounted for.",Null,1,2,25 December 2017
Erin Brockovich," An interesting true story about a down-and-out lady who cracks a big case, good Julia Roberts vehicle.
","Erin Brockovitch is a real person, who quite by 'accident' (car) ends up retaining a lawyer who apparently does her no good. When she can't find a job to pay her bills, and care for her 3 children by two different former husbands, she goes back to the lawyer and refuses to leave until he gives her a job. Simply because she is very smart, and very inquisitive, she and her firm end up representing 600+ families in a hexavalent chromium pollution case.(A detail that seemed sloppy editing or filming - we see early in the film that her 'accident' is caused by the other car running a red light and broadsiding her. When she is testifying in court she says she was pulling out and he rounded a corner out of nowhere. The description did not fit what we saw.)Anyway, Julia Roberts does her usual superior job as Erin, and Albert Finney as the lawyer. The real Erin even has a small part, playing the waitress in an early scene. It is a good story, and a well-done film, but ultimately all I can rate it is a very strong 7 of 10. No where near the impact of recent films like 'Music of the Heart' or 'The Insider', both based on true stories. Maybe because Erin was treated all the way through as a very 'over the top' character with a dirty vocabulary, and that got tiresome.
I saw the DVD version of this movie. To me, the most interesting extra was the interview which included the real Erin and the real lawyer. Also some interesting facts on the location and shooting. Most of the extras were deleted scenes, which trimmed the running time from 3 hours 15 minutes to about one hour shorter. The DVD image is sharp and colors fine, the sound track is fine too, but nothing outstanding.",Null,1,3,15 August 2000
Meet the Parents," Good comedy, some ribald humor, I rate it a solid '7' of 10.
","CAUTION -- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --I put this film in the general category that 'What About Mary' and 'Analyze This' fall into. Ben Stiller is in one, Robert De Niro in the other.  These two stars, plus Terri Polo, make the film, 'Meet the Parents.'  Make no mistake, this is 'over-the-top' humor.  It starts with the name, Focker, of Stiller's character. At one point the parents say, 'If they get married and have children, she'll be known as 'mother Focker.' In another, since his real name is 'Gaylord', the characters observe, he is a 'Gay Focker'.
 In one scene, trying to retrieve the family cat on the roof, Focker sets the leaves on fire in the gutter, dislodges an electrical line, and ends up burning up the backyard perparations for the wedding. Later he finds a different cat, paints its tail black, and the cat later tears up the inside of the house.They all take turns making fun of the fact that he is a nurse instead of a doctor.  They refer to him as the 'male nurse.' The father, De Niro, is a former CIA and has hidden cameras all over, and late in the film proves that Focker flushed the toilet that flooded the back yard.  A truck gets stuck and throws feces all over the bystanders. The father doesn't believe any man is good enough for his favorite daughter (Polo) and that is really the root of the story anyway. The boyfriend (Stiller) is dead set on proving himself, and only gets accepted after he totally screws everything up, then finally becomes comfortable being truthful after he has lost, he thinks, everything (Polo). 
In the hands of lesser actors and director this could have easily been a '3' film.  But I rate it '7' because it is well done and isn't intended to be taken too seriously. Like 'Mary' and 'Analyze This.'  Terri Polo became one of my favorites in her role in Northern Exposure. There are few women more attractive, and she is also a decent actor.",Null,0,0,9 March 2001
Mulan," Good Disney animation, funny in spots, rating seems a bit too high.
","I like good animated films. Disney's 'Tarzan' is one of my favorites. I also like 'Shrek', 'A Bug's Life', and 'Monsters Inc.'  To me 'Mulan' doesn't quite make that grade. Everyone knows the story by now - young girl Mulan disguises herself as a young man and reports to fight the Huns instead of her ailing father, and becomes a hero. I felt some of the silly characters, and the 'spirits', were making fun of the Chinese.  And, while Eddie Murphy's character, the midget dragon, was funny, it was too much like the talking donkey in 'Shrek.' The high points -- the film was only about 75 minutes long, the animation was really good, the picture on DVD is very sharp and colorful, the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is used to good effect.  But the 'extras' are spartan, there wasn't even an 'outtake' section.  :-)",Null,2,7,24 November 2002
Se7en," Modern film noir, Freeman and Pitt are good as detectives.
","Don't worry, there are no spoilers until after the clear warning near the end of my comments. Brad Pitt is a new Detective in town, David Mills, sure of himself and fiery. A crime scene is found and he is paired with a veteran about to retire, Morgan Freeman as Detective William Somerset. The crime is a very overweight man sitting at a table, feet and hands tied, apparently forced to eat until he burst. Gluttony. One of the 7 deadly sins that seem to motivate the mysterious killer. As soon as they figure that out, the hunt takes on a new dimension.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tracy Mills, young wife of David, and not sure she wants to be in the big city. Things begin unpleasantly for them after they move into their new apartment and find that several passing trains a day rattle everything in the place, and causes their old-fashioned vinyl records to skip.Much of the interest of the movie are the two characters played by Freeman and Pitt, the seasoned man of reason and the young volatile and impatient one. There are gruesome scenes and not a movie for the faint of heart. Or the squeamish.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. The so-called John Doe (excellent Kevin Spacey role) is smart and drops hints, enough that they eventually track him down and almost capture him at his apartment building. Things inside confirm they have the right man. But before they catch him, and with 5 sin crimes committed, he surprises everyone by turning himself in. But he will show them the last bodies only if Mills and Somerset take him to a certain location. Once there, at a very isolated place, a delivery truck drives up, a box for Mills, it is his wife's head, and the John Doe killer expects to be the 7th victim himself, as Mills gets so enraged that he shoots him.

I'm Not There," Great movie for Bob Dylan fans.
","I am only a few years younger than Bob Dylan. I was a person of the 60s and immersed in the 1960s music scene. But I was not a fad listener, I liked what I liked, and made no apologies. I liked some of the Beatles, but not everything they did. I liked a little of what Dylan did, but overall I was not a fan of Bob Dylan's recordings. I don't even consider him a singer, but more of a musical poet. Until I read his biography this morning, I didn't even know if he was still alive.This movie borrows its title from one of Dylan's compositions, the last stanza being:'Of course I'll not deceive her I'm not there, I'm gone It's all about confusion and I cry for her'The ambiguity of these lyrics mirror the ambiguity of Bob Dylan's life. He was born and raised as a Jew, but later proclaimed to be a born-again Christian. He wrote politically-charged songs but until currently refused to endorse any politician. The Dylan of the 60s was different from the Dylan of the 70s, and so on through the years.For these reasons this movie was done with several different actors playing fictional characters with different names as the Dylan surrogates, reasoning that since the real Dylan is continually changing, one actor could not play him over his career. The movie works, and my favorite was Cate Blanchette as one of the Dylans. I am still not a Dylan fan, so I enjoyed the movie at only one level, the movie-making technique. But for Dylan fans I would term this a 'must see'.",Null,0,2,10 June 2008
Unbreakable," For any fans of superhero comics, 'Unbreakable' is a fine, absorbing film, I rate it among the best I've seen.
","'Unbreakable' is one of those films you really need to see twice, and not miss even one line of dialog. It is a fairly simple premise, but appeals to me because of my own view of the world being one big statistical distribution of skills. And that is the key point of this story.Elijah (Sam Jackson) was born with a rare genetic affliction which causes his bones to break very easily, and he is 'sick' all the time. Being a lifelong fan of action hero comic books, and thinking they all have exaggerated shreds of truth, passing down fantastic stories much like cave men did with drawings on cave walls, he figures there must be someone else around who is at the other end of the 'distribution.' Someone who is 'unbreakable', who has extraordinary powers.David (Bruce Willis), a university stadium security guard, on the way back to Philadelphia from a job interview in NYC, is in such a terrible train crash that he is the only survivor, without even a bruise or broken bone. Elijah reads this and wonders if he has found who he is looking for. They meet, David is very skeptical, but begins to examine his life. He has never been sick, accidents do not harm him. His only weakness, his 'Kryptonite', is his fear of water.David begins to test his abilities, as bad people brush past him he can 'see' their crimes. He follows a particularly bad one, a janitor, who has killed the parents and tied up the children. David trusts his power and fights the bad guy. David realizes who he is, doesn't wake up with the 'sadness' anymore, and his wife and son and he get a new start.As the director explains in the DVD extras, the movie is intended to be a standard comic book episode where the superhero first discovers the extent of his powers, and accepts the role of 'superhero.' But instead of it being done in an exaggerated comic book style, it is filmed in a 'neighbor down the street' style, with an ordinary looking man, with an ordinary job, family, son, and marital problems. I think he pulled it off very well, and makes us wonder if such 'superheros' could actually be among us!July 2010 update: After not having seen it for several years, I saw it again presently. It is a very well-told, nuanced story and a superb film. I believe Shammy's best film, and judging from his recent mediocre movies, maybe destined to be the best he will ever make.I believe some of the poor 'user' reviews are because they expected a certain type of movie, but got a different one. If one accepts that this is a comic book story, and judges it on that, then to me it rates a high '8' or maybe '9' of 10. MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: The 'twist' in this film comes at the end, like in his 'Sixth Sense', when we find out, after they shake hands, David 'sees' that the train wreck and many other catastrophes were caused by Elijah, in his misguided quest for the person who turned out to be David, killing hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent people. David exposes Elijah who ends up committed. Elijah, the flawed prophet. David, good king.",Null,2,2,27 June 2001
Star Trek," Fine movie based on the 1960s TV series.
","I am of the vintage that watched the Star Trek TV series during its original run. To its credit this movie follows much of the workings of the show quite closely, but adds layers that make it more interesting in a modern take.As I was watching it I was reminded of the fairly recent movie 'Batman Begins.' In a similar sense, this movie could quite easily have been called 'Star Trek: Captain Kirk Begins.' Because that is the movie in its essence, how the character James T. Kirk came about, a bit of his antics as a child, his unorthodox experiences in starship training programs, and what events led to his becoming, at a relatively young age, the Captain of the Enterprise.Chris Pine, mostly of TV acting background, is ideal as James T. Kirk. Likewise Zachary Quinto, also a very experienced TV actor, is ideal as Spock. From the original series we also have Leonard Nimoy, pushing 80, as Spock Prime, which involves some 'time travel' where Spock Prime ends up interacting with the younger crew members.As an aside of sorts, it was fun seeing finny Brit Simon Pegg in a different role for him, mostly a dramatic role but with a very funny take, as Montgomery Scott who is credited with developing the approach necessary to transport people to a space ship traveling at 'warp speed.' There is no need to get into the details here, suffice to say there are fierce battles with enemies. But in the end we see how Kirk became Captain, and how he and Spock forged what would have appeared as an unlikely partnership. Good movie.Jan 2010 edit: Saw it again, I enjoyed it even more the second time. Really good movie.",Null,4,12,27 November 2009
Fury," It was 1945 in Nazi Germany and their tank named 'FURY' was all they had.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. While there have been many movies set in World War 2 this one is unique in that it features the crew of one Sherman Tank, which they called 'FURY' and it was painted in white letters on the barrel of the 75 mm main gun.The movie has a number of excellent big-name actors, featuring Brad Pitt as Don 'Wardaddy' Collier. His character is not too far removed from his Lt. Aldo Raine character in 'Inglorious Basterds'. Here he is Commander of FURY and he has to balance order and discipline with letting the crew cut loose when the situation allows.It is set beginning in April 1945, near the end of the war. Troops are pushing into Nazi Germany for what we know is the eventual outcome and tanks are playing a key role in that advance. After taking yet another village and killing all the Nazi soldiers the men find a few young ladies and enjoy newfound female relationships before the crew is called for another key mission. To protect a crossroads. The final scenes are the battle at those crossroads. It is very intense and realistic. Not all survive but the effort of the Allies is successful.War is not fun or easy and should never be glamorized. In an effort to make this movie realistic the filmmakers and actors spent some time with actual tank crew veterans of WW2, most of them in their 90s, telling things they probably never even told their families. Not a fun movie to watch but a good movie to remind us how hard we should work to avoid another world war.",Null,1,6,25 May 2015
Fight Club," 'Fight Club' requires a lot of viewer trust and patience, but the reward is a very fine movie.
","'Fight Club' runs a bit over 2 hours. For the first 1 hour and 51 minutes I found this movie very difficult to watch or enjoy. I kept wondering why Ed Norton's character continued to put up with Brad Pitt's out-of-control character. To me the movie seemed to be one big mess. However, my patience, and trust in the director, paid off and I had to watch much of the movie twice to really appreciate how good it is. I rate it 9 of 10 and predict it will be one of those ground-breaking films that viewers and critics refer to for years, much like 'The Matrix' and 'The Sixth Sense.' It is definitely for someone with a mature mind, who can understand subtleties, and who enjoys 'studying' a film. This film is definitely meant to be a funny and absurd take on life, but with a very dark tone to it. It isn't really about 'fight clubs', although the fighting is presented as an avenue for characters to deal with their inner conflicts. It is not intended to represent reality, nor to suggest that fighting is good. It's closest prior film is perhaps 'Doctor Strangelove.'I saw this film on DVD. The sound is perhaps the best I've heard so far. There are several crashes and explosions throughout the movie and the realism is just so good it made me cringe. But you have to have a good subwoofer to enjoy it all.Now - CAUTION - SPOILERS FOLLOW - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.However, I think most people will enjoy the movie more, on first viewing, if they understand the total concept. So here it is.Norton plays the 'narrator', and in the introductory scenes we find out he has a conventional existence, a traveling job as a 'recall coordinator' for a major automobile manufacturer. By his own admission he is 'a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct', travels with his 'CK shirts and DKNY shoes', and says of his total existence 'close to being complete.' 'Fighting' is completely foreign to him. But, deep in his subconscious he hates what he is becoming, and if he were to die now his life will have been meaningless.Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, is Norton's alter-ego. They are one and the same person. In opening scenes you see various single-frame flashes (stop-action on DVD helps see this clearly) of Pitt's 'Tyler', we assume still in Norton's subconscious as he first begins to realize he hates his existence.Then, on a buisness flight, while talking to the lady seated next to him, Norton thinks 'I pray for a crash or midair collision', which is quickly followed by a highly realistic 'dream collision', then Pitt's Tyler Durden the rest of the trip is actually sitting next to Norton, conversing with him. This 'prayer for a crash' is the consciousness that first makes Pitt's Tyler totally real to Norton.The rest of the movie has many scenes with both Norton and Tyler but, we see later, no one else ever sees Brad Pitt's 'Tyler', they only see Norton as 'Tyler.' Brad Pitt's Tyler is explained this way, 'You were looking for a way to change your life. You could not do this on your own. All the ways you wish you could be - that's me. I look like you want to look... am free in all the ways you are not. Little by little you're letting yourself become - Tyler Durden.'The movie's title is unfortunately misleading, because only a small part of the movie is really about the fighting, which is used as a way for disillusioned men to get out their frustrations. One line by Norton, 'This kid from work, Ricky, couldn't remember if you ordered pens with blue ink or black. But Ricky was a 'god' for 10 minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of the local food court', explains the gist of why they fight. It symbolizes the one area where they are in complete control of their pleasure and pain.That last comment, 'maitre d' of the local food court' illustrates the comedic approach to much of the movie. Who ever heard of a food court having a maitre d'? How much lower in the food chain could you get? Or Ricky supplying ink pens at work? One of the fight club 'assignments', to pick a fight with a stranger, then lose', has a number of very funny sequences in it.The movie turns very dark when the fight club kicks itself 'up a notch' and begins to plot the destruction of all major buildings housing credit card companies. The rationale - destroy them and all their records of debt, and everyone can start again at ground zero. When Norton's Tyler finally at 1 hour 52 minutes into the film finally figures out what he had done, he tries unsuccessfully to twarth the plan. The final scene shows him and his girlfriend standing before a window in a high-rise, and sequentially all bombs go off and the buildings crash into various piles of rubble. Reminiscent of the final scene of 'Doctor Strangelove', where all the nuclear bombs are going off, destroying the world.The closing line, Norton says, 'Everything will be alright. You met me at a really strange time in my life.' Again, dark humor.The genius of this film, if there is any, resides in the premise that the two main characters represent the two extremes of the same person, and in the end the 'real' Tyler Durden meets them in the middle. Once you know this premise, and can watch the whole movie in this context, I found it much more enjoyable, made much more sense, and every scene with both Tylers is done completely in character with the premise.The DVD also has a second DVD which is devoted to extras which are in themselves very interesting if you like to study the art of film-making. However, plan to spend a minimum of 5 hours total in viewing and studying this film to get its full impact.",Null,10,19,11 August 2000
As Good as It Gets," 'You make me want to be a better man,' ","My comments will contain some SPOILERS, so anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie should not read past this paragraph. Jack Nicholson in 'As Good As It Gets' is just about as good as Nicholson gets, and this is a superb movie overall, smartly written and filmed. It is the kind of movie that is very good on first viewing, and is even better on subsequent viewings, after you know the basic story line.Udall (Nicholson) is a successful author, but in his 'normal' life is not very normal at all -- an obsessive/compulsive personality, fastidious washing of hands with fresh bars of soap, bringing his own plastic ware to dine, avoiding touching others, and never stepping on a crack -- and nearly always managing to say exactly the wrong thing. His neighbor is a gay artist (Kinnear) with a little dog. After a beating and hospitalization, going broke, and an unsuccessful road trip to ask his parents for money, Udall gives him a spare bedroom. His waitress is played by Hunt, who has a sickly boy, and Udall provides them with a good doctor, just so she can return to work and be his waitress. His grander motive is her companionship. Near the end, after her saying it would be best if she never saw him again, he went to see her anyway, they took a 4AM walk to the corner bakery, as the movie ends we see him stepping on the brick pavement -- 'cracks' -- and not minding. He was letting her help him become a better man.",Null,1,3,27 March 2004
Citizen Kane," It's gotta be a tough life when your best work is behind you at 25!
","There's no denying that 'Citizen Kane' is Orson Welles's greatest achievement as a filmmaker. Made when he was only 25 (it was released the same month he turned 26), he wrote, directed, and starred in it as newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, seemingly a man with everything one could ask for. Maybe everything but true happiness? Very early we see that Kane dies, and his last words were only a whisper, 'Rosebud.' But who, or what, was Rosebud? No one close to Kane had any idea. And, as the movie ends, only the viewing audience has a clue.It always amazes me when a person, or a group, puts any effort into the argument of 'which film is the greatest of all time.' The way I see it, there's nothing riding on it. There are no generally-accepted criteria. The 'experts' will never agree. It is a battle which has no conclusion. So I don't worry if 'Citizen Kane' is the number one. Most significantly, it was a pioneer of a number of different movie-making approaches, and has influenced countless films which came after it. It is perhaps ironic that Welles was 25 when he made 'Citizen Kane' and, while he had roles in over 100 movies, directed 38, and wrote or produced a large number, he will forever be remembered for this one.I didn't have the opportunity to see 'Citizen Kane' in the theater, but I have seen it recently on DVD. While I appreciate the movie for what it is, I don't care too much for the political issues surrounding it in 1941. It is not the type of movie I will re-watch every year.",Null,0,9,12 December 2004
Darkest Hour," Companion film to 'Dunkirk', explores the role of Churchill.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library system. I was a decent student back in high school but I learned more WW2 history this year than ever before with this movie and its inadvertent companion, 'Dunkirk.'Where 'Dunkirk' started with British and French troops hemmed in at Dunkirk by German troops, and depicts the miracle evacuation of most of those 400,000 men, this movie 'Darkest Hour' depicts what was going on in England during those days, focusing on the 'war room' and newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Gary Oldman received many awards for his performance, in elaborate makeup, as Winston Churchill. His awards are well-earned as I was almost able to forget that I was watching an actor. Churchill in total is a controversial person but in this one specific case, with the future of Great Britain as stake, his being adamant about fighting until the end rather than negotiate with Germany was a turning point in WW2.It is a long movie at just over two hours but never boring, always interesting, even though certainly some details were changed or fabricated for dramatic effect. Still it is a remarkably good movie and a great companion to the other movie, 'Dunkirk.'",Null,0,4,13 April 2018
Monster," Amazing Oscar-winning performance by Charlize Theron.
","It is easy to see that Charlize Theron has a pretty face, and it was also pretty easy to see that she was an accomplished actress. I first saw her in the newest version of 'Mighty Joe Young', and afterwards several other roles. I have become a fan of hers. But her performance here as the Florida prostitute Aileen Wuornos, is nothing short of amazing. She put on a few pounds, she wore appropriate makeup, and she is so good that one easily forgets that it is Theron we are watching. The way she 'channels' the real Wournos is eerie.The story itself is not pleasant. We have a lady who had a very difficult childhood and, while she appears to have been intelligent, had a very shaky concept of reality. She had remembered hearing someone say, years earlier, that you can be anything you want to be. So, when she decides to go straight and make an honest living, she figured all she had to do was dress nicely, interview, and get a nice job. It just doesn't work that way.SPOILERS. Abused from a very young age, 'Lee' learned early that she could get money and favors via sex. She really hoped someone would 'discover' her and she would become another Marilyn Monroe. (Actual photos of her show she wan't really that attractive.) As an adult, prostitution was the only trade she knew. At a gay bar one night she meets up with Selby (Christina Ricci), a closet lesbian still living at home in a garage apartment. Initially repulsed, Lee takes to Selby and they start living together in cheap motels. One 'john' gets rough with Lee, ties her up, she gets loose, grabs a gun, and shoots and kills him. Having a tough time keeping Selby happy, she decides killing and robbing more would not be any worse, and becomes a serial killer of sorts. Finally ID'd then jailed, Selby is persuaded to testify against Lee, who was executed in Florida in the early 1990s.",Null,0,2,29 April 2005
The Rookie," Actually two one-hour movies, great inspirational stories.
","My favorite films are those which are based on an interesting true story, and are well made. 'The Rookie' fits that bill, and I rate it very highly. At first glance it appears to be about getting to play baseball. In fact, it is about making your dreams come true, and the power of friendship. Baseball just happens to be the subject matter. The first one-hour movie is about a 10-member high school team in West Texas that barely manages to win one game each year. It is about their coach inspiring them to become the district champs and go to the state tournament in 1999. The second one-hour movie comes about from a 'deal' the kids made with the coach.  'If we win district, then you have to go to a tryout with a professional baseball team.'  They do, so he does. And to his and everyone else's surprise, his 85-mph fastball as a 20-year-old has become a 98-mph one as a 35-year-old.  The films hints that it might have been divine intervention, a prayer to St Rita, the patron of the impossible. Might have been!!Dennis Quaid is a bit older than 35, but he does a good job and is believable as science teacher, coach, and finally a surprised big-league pitcher in Arlington, Tx stadium, where he strikes out his very first big-league batter. The real Jim played two seasons, not particularly distinguished, but that point is way secondary. The journey, and the way he made it, with support from family and his baseball kids is what this film is all about.The DVD is very nice, with a great picture and decent use of the 5.1 Dolby surround sound. Extras include footage of the real Jim, some original footage of his playing days, and his narration and re-enactment of his first trip to a big-league mound. Great stuff!  Plus a few, moderately interesting deleted scenes explained by the director.",Null,34,36,28 August 2002
The Maze Runner," Exciting visuals and a real kick-arse bass-filled sound track.
","We saw this on DVD from our public library.Honestly, the best thing about this movie for me was the sound track, especially the low bass. Even some sob-sonic bass. The kind that you actually feel! The boys are in the central green area of a very large maze with tall concrete walls. Every morning the giant doors on one of the four faces of the interior wall cranks open, and it shakes the viewing room. But every evening the doors crank shut and no one has ever survived being trapped inside overnight. There are large insect-like creatures called Grievers that get them.The band of boys number maybe 30 to 35, and the first one arrived 3 years earlier. A mysterious elevator carrying an additional boy, plus supplies, arrives every 30 days. They also have to make use of the green area for food and shelter.But they believe that there is a path out of the maze and, if they can discover it, everyone can get to freedom. So the very select few boys who go in are called 'maze runners.' When what turns out to be the last boy comes in, then the first ever girl, things heat up.The movie is entertaining, but it also ends without much resolution, setting the story up for one or several sequels. As of this date the second one is in filming.The overall story has to do with widespread destruction of Earth plus a brain-eating virus. Somehow the researchers who set up this grand experiment of sorts were looking for a cure for the ills of the world but it isn't clear at all what they were actually trying to do and why. So, if a viewer wants a story that is tied up neatly at the end, this one will not give that.",Null,4,6,13 January 2015
Memento," 'Must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.' (Leonard)
","SPOILERS - The most amazing thing about 'Memento' is how it tricked almost 50% of IMDB users to rate it '10', and currently include it in the top 10 of movies all-time!  What a crock. I guess many are easily impressed by a novel film-editing technique. Reminds me of the early hoopla over 'The Blair Witch Project.' Having said that, the film certainly is engrossing and entertaining, and I applaud the writer/director/editor for trying something so new.  I rate 'Memento' 8 of 10, but you have to see it on DVD with the extras to understand it. Leonard (Guy Pearce) is what the director terms an 'unreliable narrator', because he cannot form new memories after his injury during his wife's attack. So, what we see during the film is what Leonard believes is reality. In truth, Leonard has escaped from the mental hospital to find and kill 'Jimmy G.' We learn that he has killed one man he thought was his wife's murderer, wears his clothes, drives his car, all the while reasoning that these were his all along. At one point he is asked, 'Where do you think you got that car? And those clothes? Is that what you used to wear to work?' Leonard answered, 'Sure, we get paid a good salary, I must have bought those.'So, with new clothes, car, and residence in a motel (so the movie doesn't end prematurely with his capture at home), and polaroid pictures of each so he can remember the next hour, he forgets about the dead man and resumes his hunt for the killer, which he does and is depicted in the opening scene. The rest of the movie is the backwards unfolding of what happened between the two killings. Who knows how many could have come before, and how many after. 'Memento' just is a snapshot in the life of this crazy man, and we are never given a time reference, whether the story covered days, weeks, or months.It is important to realize the story is told 'unreliably' from Leonard's point of view. Thus, it doesn't matter what the Joe P. and Carrie-Ann Moss characters really were. It doesn't even matter whether there was one or two attackers of his wife, or even if she really was killed by attackers, or by Leonard giving her too many insulin shots. The movie was simply a study of a person's thought process and decision-making with the handicap he had at that point in his life.Ultimately the writer/director does not want his audience to take all this too seriously. He calls it a 'film noir'. It is an exercise in interesting film-making. He even sprinkles in humor throughout.  Like the scene where he and another guy were engaged in a chase and Leonard says, 'I wonder why I'm chasing him.  OH! He's chasing me!'Good flick.  Rated absurdly high...and you can take that to the bank!",Null,3,11,14 September 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Definitely a Quentin Tarantino film, brilliant writing, but you gotta have a high tolerance for blood and gore.
","I have sort of a love/hate relationship with Quentin Tarantino's films. I've seen the highly-regarded Pulp Fiction twice, but it does nothing for me. I don't consider it a good movie at all. But I always am amazed by Tarantino's writing, his characters always have the most interesting dialog.The premise here is WW2, and a small band of Nazi hunters are called 'Inglourous Basterds' by the Nazis. This small band are lead by Brad Pitt as LT. Aldo Raine, from the south, and he inspires his men to not only kill as many Nazis as they can, but also 'bring me their scalps.' (The scalping scenes are very realistic.) What I enjoyed most about this movie are the scenes. Unlike many modern movies where the editing switches away to something else frequently, here Tarantino spends ample time developing each extended scene. As the movie begins each one in sequence takes up about 20 minutes running time. First we see the Nazi character nicknamed 'the Jew Hunter', visiting a farmer suspected of hiding a Jewish family. Some directors might have filmed this in 5 or 6 minutes through its conclusion, but here we get 20 minutes, and every second of it is tense and interesting. Master film-making. And the rest of the movie uses a similar technique. M√©lanie Laurent is Shosanna, a Jew, who escapes to Paris and now runs a small movie house. She has taken a different, non-Jewish name, but eventually the Jew Hunter, superbly played by Christoph Waltz as COL. Hans Landa, gets on her trail. The other key character is Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark. A meeting is set up where she will help the Nazi hunters, but we are never sure which side she is on. This movie is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy good film-making and superb dialog, this one is a real treat.SPOILERS: The conclusion comes at the small Paris movie theater, as all the Nazi brass, including Hitler, attend the premier showing of a film which glorifies a young sniper who killed about 300 Allies over three days in a village. Unknown to each other, 3 different groups independently plan to exterminate all the theatergoers. With guns, or explosives, or by burning down the theater. In this fictional story Hitler dies and the war ends early.Feb 2012 edit: I watched it again after two years, still a very absorbing film.May 2015 edit: Watched it again, every time I come away with an even better appreciation.",Null,3,8,29 January 2010
Underworld," In the Underworld, the ongoing war between the Vampires and the Lycans!
","I found this to be a very entertaining movie, with a very aggressive sound track. Fantasy, of course ... unless you really are a Vampire or a Lycan (Werewolf). There is even a decent story involved.Kate Beckinsale, so good as the pretty nurse in 'Pearl Harbor', plays Selene here, a highly trained fighting Vampire, using her native London accent. In this strange underworld, the Vampires are the good guys, and they seek to snuff out all the Lycans for the betterment of their world. Bill Nighy who is so good in comedic roles (like the singer in 'Love Actually') is good here as the grand Vampire of them all, forced to come out of his sleeping state a century too soon.The thread of a story has to do with the Lycans tracking down all living 'human' relatives of a long ago Lycan, and the one they look for is Michael Corvin, played by Scott Speedman (of TV 'Felicity' fame). And also finding that not all of the Vampires are pulling together on this. Selene takes it upon herself to protect Corvin, partly because she likes him, but also to keep the Lycans from their mission.The Lycans are vulnerable to silver, but they have an amazing ability to squeeze out silver bullets. So, the Vampires invent something deadlier, bullets with silver nitrate solution in them.Sophia Myles who plays Isolde in the more recent 'Tristan + Isolde ' movie, is one of the Vampires here.",Null,0,0,12 June 2006
Amistad," A historically-significant film that every American should see - at least twice.
","I'm not a student of history so I have no idea how accurate the screenplay is for the movie, 'Amistad', however since it is a Spielberg film I suspect that it is mainly fact with a little fiction filling some of the question marks. It does represent a real incident in 1839.I rate this film a very stong 9 of 10. Directed by Spielberg, with music by John Williams, and spot-on acting by everyone, it tells the story of the Amistad ship of west Africans taken illegally to the USA. During the journey they manage to sieze the ship, killing several of the crew in the process. Even though they try to go directly back to Africa, they end up in Massachusetts and are imprisoned for murder and other crimes.Problem is, no one locally can understand their language, and they cannot understand English. Learning to communicate is one of the challenges. However, the biggest challenge facing the Africans is a biased America which fears that a decision to free them would result in a civil war over the slavery issue.As we now know, the civil war did break out, but it is not entirely clear how much the Amistad incident influenced it. No matter, that's not the value of the movie.What you see in colonial America are people with some of the same attitudes their ancestors fled to originally settle America. A satisfying conclusion to the Amistad incident depends upon a realization by the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, that a man's freedom is his inalienable right, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, and that this applies to black Africans as well as it does to white settlers.To me there is no doubt that Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as former president John Quincy Adams is the most remarkable of all. He has a lenghty monologue, near the end of the film, delivered to the Supreme Court justices, and not one second of that scene is dull or boring. Every time I hear it, and bear in mind its meaning to all of us, it chokes me up. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good young actor Matthew McConaughey was as the young lawyer who represented the catives.Perhaps the most touching scene was between two of the captives, in their prison quarters. One of them had been given a bible by townsfolk, and of course he could not read it. However, he had been looking at the pictures, probably for weeks, and in their own language he basically explained, through the pictures, what he had figured out of the New Testament. In his explanation, he showed his imprisoned friend how thier plight, being imprisoned for false reasons, and now facing death, so closely paralled what had happened to Christ. To me that was a key scene to show that these Africans even surpassed most of the 'Americans' in reasoning and depth of feeling, while they were being mistreated because they were thought to be an inferior species. That may have just been good script-writing, but to me it was a powerful revelation in the film.I always prefer a well-made film based on real life, and Amistad will go down as one of my favorites, and that 2-hour film can teach most of us more about American history than any amount of reading can do.",Null,1,3,13 August 2000
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," With a strong resemblance to prior Star Wars movies it is good entertainment.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.'Star Wars' and I go way back, all the way to the ancient time of 1977 when the first one came out, later re-named 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' after three prequels were made. But that 1977 classic, the one that made Harrison Ford famous as Han Solo, will forever be the definitive 'Star Wars' movie.So, how does this one compare? Very well. They pretty much stuck to the original Star Wars sensibilities and even have short cameos with Darth Vader and an aging Princess Leia. The story is rather simple, the resistance is trying to get plans for the Empire's planet-destroying death star, and that requires travel to a number of different planets in the galaxy. The movie relies on frequent conflicts to generate action and cool sound effects.Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, we first see her as a young girl hiding out as the Empire kidnaps her scientist father, he is needed to make the death star workable. When she grows up she leads the resistance effort to preserve the galaxy, far far away.Good 'popcorn' entertainment and Jones is very good in her role, as well as a number of other good, experienced actors. But none of them are Harrison Ford.As a final comment, our knowledge of science and space have come so far in 40 years. We now know that a galaxy typically has hundreds of billions of stars, likely billions of planets, and just to cross a medium sized galaxy takes light over 100,000 years. In reality human travel across much of a galaxy is impossible, the fictional Empire could not destroy the galaxy even if they had the most powerful weapon. Imagination and fantasy in movie-making are nowhere near reality, but that's OK, as long as we can reflect on that and smile about it.",Null,1,4,30 April 2017
Captain Marvel," Highly entertaining superhero origin story with lots of humor included.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It runs right at 2 hours, there is a 30-second homage to Stan Lee at the very beginning, with the words 'Thank You Stan', and even a 30-second scene after all the credits are finished, the orange cat in Nick Fury's office shows us what happened to the sought-after blue energy cube.Brie Larson is Carol Danvers who, in the late 1980s, becomes a jet fighter pilot. But we first see her with the Kree, they call her 'Vers' because the only part of her dog tag that survived an incident contained the last 4 letters of her Danvers name. She is confused, she has dreams and visions but doesn't understand what they mean. When she accidentally travels back to Earth in 1995 things gradually become clear.The IMdb main page for this movie has a good synopsis in the 'Storyline' section. What I also like about the style here is ample use of humor. They don't take themselves too seriously. It is the origin story for Captain Marvel and some drastic event is responsible for her gaining her super powers. Now she can go about helping to guard the galaxy.I am aware there are many very bad user reviews, many of them one-liners saying nothing about the movie, and often rating it '1' or '2'. Those are all clearly bogus, all of us IMDb users who have written hundreds or thousands of prior reviews agree that it is a worthwhile, entertaining movie that fits well in the Marvel universe.We watched it a second time, two days later, when we had a group over for dinner.

I watched the first 15 minutes or so in 3D with the glasses, but didn't find it satisfying viewing, and watched the rest of it in 2D without glasses.Here we have an animated movie using small puppets primarily, with facial movements that reminds me of the claymation of the 'Wallace and Gromit' movies.Dakota Fanning voices Coraline Jones, an intelligent and active girl of about 10. Her mother and father always seem too busy to pay attention to her. When she notices a small baseboard-level locked door in the new house they are renting, she finds the key to open it. Behind the door she finds an interesting, shimmering, moving circular tunnel seemingly made of fabric. Undaunted she goes right in, only to emerge right back in her house. Or so it seems.In this 'alternate' world she finds her mom and dad, her 'other' parents, who treat her very well. She gets the attention she doesn't seem to be able to get at home. Plus everything else she craves. But these 'other' parents have buttons where their eyes should be. Coraline is certainly curious about this, but it does not scare her off.Teri Hatcher is good as the voice of both her mother and her 'other' mother.The reason I can't pull myself to call this a 'good' movie is because it becomes more than a bit unclear what was going on in this alternate reality, why some kids were already trapped there, and why the 'other' mother wanted Coraline to stay with her permanently. Maybe it was just because the 'other' mother wanted a child to love her, but still it never hit home with me. Not like 'Monsters, Inc', for example, which I consider one of the better animated movies.",Null,1,1,12 August 2009
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Quite better than I expected, a fine film with historical significance.
","I saw it on DVD. The cinematography is perfect! The vistas shown on the beautiful Greek island are almost film-like on widescreen HDTV. The extras are sparse, the music video by British tenor Russell Watson is pleasant, the director's commentary is 'minimalist' but still valuable and interesting. Some of my comments, below, contain information from the director's commentary. I cannot imagine watching this beautiful film on old-technology VHS tape.SPOILERS - Set in wartime 1940 through postwar 1947, the Italians with the help of the Nazi Germans have 'captured' this peaceful Greek island. Nic Cage is Capt Corelli, who marches into the village with a mandolin strapped to his back. Later we learn from him, 'Everyone in our battery is a member of the opera society.' None have ever fired at an enemy. While WWII rages on elsewhere, they spend their free time on the beach, with half-naked Italian prostitutes brought over for them, frolicing, drinking wine, and singing. They hope to hang out until the war is over, and go back to Italy to resume their unencumbered lives.The wake-up call comes when the Nazis shoot and kill several of his battery mates a day before they were to symbolically surrender to the Gremans. Finding that they can't trust the Germans, they decide to claim all the weapons they can and fight a last stand, Italians and Greeks against the Germans, with results similar to General Custer's. But Corelli survives, is doctored (John Hurt), and smuggled back to Italy. Meanwhile the doctor's daughter (Penny Cruz) and he have fallen in love, she doesn't know if she will ever see him again, as she studies to become a doctor herself. After the war ends a big earthquake destroys almost everything on the island, then Corelli appears again. He says to her, 'I tried to make myself believe I could live without you.'Much of the story encompasses real events, although the mandatory love story is fictional. 'Titanic' did this, 'Pearl Harbor' did this. I suppose it is the only way to make a historical film interesting. I guess the writer of the fabulous 'Longitude' didn't realize that!  :-)An earthquake really did destroy most of the buildings on the island, but it happened in 1953. The community was not re-built, but virtually everything we see in the film were sets constructed then torn down during the re-enactment of the earthquake. The crew gathered and carted off all the debris afterward, leaving the island as they had found it. Many scenes were shot among the real ruins, as they have been since 1953.I like this movie very much. The historical story was well-done, and the love story did not detract. The cimematography is superb. Cage as Corelli, Cristian Bale (of 'Newsies') as his love competition, Hurt as the doctor were all especially good in their roles. Cage even showed a bit of his singing voice, which was recorded live and not overdubbed in the studio.",Null,1,3,4 August 2002
Shakespeare in Love," The story of 'Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter.' Well, almost ...,
","'Shakespeare in Love' is a good movie for those of us who don't particularly like Shakespeare. Not the man, but his works. I find the stilted old English he uses, and the delivery of lines, difficult to stay with, but I love this movie. Some feel it did not deserve 'Best Picture', but I don't really care about that argument, I just like the movie.In a similar vein as 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor', where a fictional love story is woven through historical events, so is 'Shakespeare in Love'. The period, late 1500s, is correct, as are all the main characters, the ways of doing business, locations, and theaters. What is fictional is the love story that develops between Will Shakespeare(Joseph Fiennes) and lady Viola (Gwenneth Paltrow). While I seldom see Ms Paltrow as a sex symbol in her various films, in this one her bedroom scenes with Fiennes are quite lovely.In this film, Will is 'stuck', he is looking for a muse, and is intending on writing a new play 'Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter.' Through many brief interactions with his contemporaries and Viola, the story gradually develops, bit by bit, scene by scene, into the now famous romantic tragedy. To recruit a popular actor (Ben Affleck), who will play Mercutio, Will tells him, 'It will be called Mercutio.' Nearer the end, Affleck tells him, 'I think it should be called 'Romeo and Juliet'. That's just a suggestion, consider it.' What makes this such an entertaining film for me is the inspired writing and directing, which combines a factual period piece with smart and funny dialog. We see characters speaking in a modern language, and while the story line is plausible, the entire film is brimming with humor. Not the kind of 'over-the-top' schtick that so many recent movies employ with limited success, but the best kind of subtle humor that is the calling card of a fine scriptwriter. It is the kind of film you can appreciate more upon each viewing, and see things you never saw before.The DVD is also superb, although there is not much surround in the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. A very interesting 'extra' are facts about the real people who were represented as characters in this film. One of my favorites of all.

Dawn of the Dead," Was it a virus, or did Hell really fill up??
","I didn't see the original 'Dawn of the Dead', so I cannot compare the two. Taken for what it is, a horror movie that defies belief, it is pretty enjoyable. Not really a good movie by most standards, it was fun to see, knowing full well that something like this couldn't really happen. The DVD has a few nice extras, including a video made by the man trapped in his gun store without food for the month that elapses during the movie.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Milwaukee, normal neighborhood, Ana (Sarah Polley) and her husband wake to find the little girl in the hallway. As she charges towards them, we see a disfigured and bloody mouth, she jumps and bites Ana's husband, severing an artery in his neck, and although she, a nurse, tries to save him, he dies. But then he gets up, and attacks her. She manages to get out a bathroom window, bloody, and drives away. In the overhead camera shot we can see much turmoil, buildings burning, cars wrecking. And a televangelist explaining this is what happens with too much decadence on Earth, Hell fills up and now the dead invade us. In another telecast a government official says they have no idea what is happening or how it is being spread. It appears to be a virus, as people who are bitten by an 'undead' then die shortly and become one of them.A small band of good guys including Ana, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant wife make it over to an almost vacant mall and barricade themselves inside. Security force already there don't want to share their space, but eventually are overcome and 'jailed.' The crowd finds sleeping quarters in the department stores, and plenty of food. They see the 'undead' crowd getting larger each day, and spot a man on the roof of his gun shop a block away. By binoculars and signs they communicate, they play chess, they play a game where they describe a famous person (e.g. Burt Reynolds) and the gun store owner, an expert shot, shoots that undead person through the head. That they figure out, only by putting a bullet or other object through the head of these 'undead' could they be stopped. They eventually hatch a plan to make a run for it, try to get to the lake and take a boat to an island where they hope to be safe, not knowing what would happen or how long this 'phenomenon' would go on. They fortified two mall buses, they made propane cylinder bombs, they fought their way through, some of them died, but in the end a small few of them were motoring towards the island. A DVD extra showed a telecast which showed the problem spreading all over the USA, starting in the largest cities first, so it was not confined to Milwaukee.",Null,1,3,1 February 2005
Iron Man 2," Interesting follow-up to the Ironman movie, Downey is good in his role.
","In the first movie we learn that Tony Stark's company designs and manufactures weapons. But when Tony gets taken prisoner in a foreign land he learns that the enemies are also using his weapons, and that realization gets him to get out of the weapons business. The Ironman suit was developed from the crude version he built while a prisoner to make his escape. He is a very bright and industrious fellow.Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, and as this movie begins we see him called to a federal committee, chaired by Garry Shandling as Senator Stern. They are trying to make the case that the various Ironman suits are in fact weapons, and should be controlled by the US government for homeland security purposes. But Stark insists they are for preventing crime. Don Cheadle is now the good friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his assistant Pepper Potts, who clearly longs for more. Sam Rockwell becomes the first nemesis, as Justin Hammer who competes with Stark, but not very well. His designs just don't work well. But the really bad nemesis is Mickey Rourke as Russian scientist Ivan Vanko, who makes a new kind of suit that threatens Stark. For me the most pleasant surprise was Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman but really Natasha Romanoff. I've seen her in quite a variety of movies, starting with 'The Horse Whisperer' when she was a teenager but never in an action role. Here she cuts quite a nice figure in her skin-tight suit and proves to be quite effective as a martial-arts fighter. Who would have thought??So what happens in a movie based on a Stan Lee comic? The hero always finds a way to get the best of the bad guys. There is a lot of action, and some tense moments, but in the end Ironman sets things straight.",Null,1,3,2 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," The fourth in the 'Alien' series, part of a 30th anniversary BD set.
","The year was 2010 and a re-release of all the first 4 'Alien' movies in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and I now have watched all 4 of them within a few days. Picture and DTS sound are excellent as we have come to expect for BluRay. And seeing them in sequence over a short period of time enhances the enjoyment of all of them.As the commentary track states, there never was an intent to make more than 3 movies, that is why the 3rd one ended the way it did. But they set this 4th one 200 years into the future and a deep space ship has scientists and technology to allow cloning. The former space ship of Ripley's had traces of her DNA and early in the movie we see them fabricating a new one, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.Each of the 4 movies has a different script writer and different director so each has its own mood and look. This one is a bit cleaner and brighter. In fact the first half of the movie is superb as the stage is set for cloning and studying the aliens. The second half degrades quite a bit with more craziness among the characters and more fights and chases involving aliens. A big reveal is that the 'new' Ripley has some alien characteristics of strength and quickness. But in the end Ripley once again has to be destroyed. The movie ends with several surviving in an escape pod to Earth while the larger spaceship with aliens crashes at a terrific velocity in an uninhabited part of Earth to destroy all remaining aliens and eggs. We see it is the outskirts of what used to be the thriving city of Paris, complete with a half-toppled Eiffel Tower.",Null,0,1,18 August 2017
World War Z," A good-looking movie that entertains, but mostly just yet another Zombie movie.
","Movies about Zombies is not my favorite genre. In fact I would normally not see them because to me they are just overly silly. The whole concept of 'the undead', people getting bitten and literally in 10 seconds or so changing into a Zombie. Stuff for cartoons but not for a serious dramatic movie.The one exception is 'Warm Bodies' which I saw during this past summer, a story about Zombies wanting to become normal people again, I really like that one. Anyway, to this one, 'World War Z'. It seems some type of mysterious virus has broken out somewhere, they believe Korea, and via our connected world has spread quickly through air travel. And these Zombies that result are not the clumsy, plodding Zombie usually portrayed. No, these seem to move a bit faster than usual, act as if they were a rabid animal, and snap their jaws as if they were trying to eat someone as quickly as they could. It is not a good situation, and the whole world is threatened. Brad Pitt is Gerry Lane, retired UN specialist who only wants to be with him family, his wife and two daughters. But when their own city, Philadelphia, becomes overrun they have to escape towards New York and end up taking refuge on a military ship. But against his wishes Gerry is virtually forced to help them track down and try to eradicate the Zombie disease, otherwise they could not give his family refuge.So that's really what the story is about, Gerry traveling first to Korea, then to Israel, then to a W.H.O. installation in Wales, barely surviving a plane crash. He has to save the world, otherwise no one will.I like Brad Pitt, and he is good here in what to me, is a pretty silly movie. I found myself laughing occasionally, not because killing people is funny, but just the absurdity of the Zombies and their zeal to overrun everything. Just light entertainment and nothing more. It tries to strike a meaningful note at the end, but it just didn't work for me.SPOILERS: Gerry does save the world, at least it is moving in that direction as the movie ends. At one point he had noticed that mysteriously the pursuing Zombies simply avoided certain humans, just bypassed them. He theorized that those were sick humans, and Zombies somehow could detect that, and only wanted healthy human bodies to spread their Zombieism. So he further theorized, if he were to inject himself with a disease-causing virus, the Zombies would avoid him. It worked, and the solution for the world would be mass inoculations with disease, that could then be treated to save the person, but also allow them to gradually eradicate the Zombies. Interesting concept!",Null,11,16,19 October 2013
Passengers," About 500 years from now a colony ship takes a 120-year trip to a new land.
","My wife and I watched this movie on DVD from our public library.OK, this is science fiction, a very large space ship designed by movie-makers, and not all the time and speed references add up. Because it is fiction. If that overly bothers anyone they just shouldn't watch the movie. But it is more a human interest 'what would you do?' theme, and after we see what they did what do we think of it? In the grand scheme of humanity, human relations, and right vs wrong in a poorly defined situation.According to the filmmakers this takes place about 500 years in the future, the Earth is overcrowded, a company has started colonizing new worlds. In this story a ship of 258 crew members and 5000 passengers are placed in a hibernation mode for the totally automatic 120-year trip at about half the speed of light. To a world about 60 light years away. That makes back-and-forth communication impractical.An unexpected incident occurs, one passenger, a man, is awakened after only 30 years. He quickly realizes that he is still 90 years away from the destination, he won't live that long. Should he wake up someone else so that he will have company? Of course doing so would short-circuit all her plans and in essence deliver a death sentence. What is the moral thing to do?Jennifer Lawrence is the female as Aurora Lane and the male is Chris Pratt as Jim Preston. The third main character is Michael Sheen as the andriod Arthur who also happens to be the bartender. He doesn't judge, he just serves the drinks and dispenses friendly bartender advice.We enjoyed it, one of the more entertaining movies we have seen recently. The set designs and special effects, as well as the soundtrack, are really great too.",Null,1,1,14 October 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Off-beat romantic comedy, with graphic male frontal nudity.
","We watch everything the public library gets, and during the first 15 minutes of this movie, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', we were almost certain that it was a very bad movie. I am glad we continued watching it and I am doubly glad that we were wrong.However it has several scenes of nudity, a small amount of female topless nudity, but mostly frontal, non-erect male nudity that was not sexual at all. In fact he will probably lose a lot of potential dates from that. Still, I consider this a movie for adults, not teenagers, because of the pervasive off-color language and sexual references.Jason Segel is musician Peter Bretter who is dating the pretty Sarah Marshall, star of a TV series. He happens to provide the keyboard background music for the shows. But early in the story Peter gets dumped, and he takes it very hard. At the urging of his best friend Peter goes off to Hawaii for a break.Kristen Bell is petite, blond Sarah Marshall who clearly is a bit stuck on herself. As luck would have it, she and her new boyfriend, a famous singer of weird songs, are there also, and staying at the same hotel. This situation provides many opportunities for funny moments as Peter tries to cope, but can't avoid continually meeting up with Sarah.My favorite in this movie is pretty, dark Russian native Mila Kunis as Rachel Jansen. She works at the front desk of the hotel, arranges for Peter to have a special room, and keenly observes what is going on with Peter and Sarah. Although all these actors are primarily TV series actors, she has the most natural and believable acting style. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.Overall a very funny and entertaining movie about this man's attempts to get over his former girlfriend.SPOILERS: As the story develops Peter and Rachel get to be friends and go places together after hours. Their friendship develops to more until they sleep together. But meanwhile Sarah figures out her new boyfriend is really a cad, and tries to make up with Peter, but he decides against it. This does have the effect of breaking off Rachel, but back in the states as Peter sees the initial stage performance of his puppet 'Dracula' rock opera, Rachel is there and she and Peter seem destined to develop a lasting relationship.N.B. - On the DVD extra, it is told that the actor Segel (Peter) in real life was already working on the Dracula stage piece and this movie allowed him to develop it further and integrate it into the story.",Null,0,2,25 October 2008
The Hunger Games," A future dystopian society where kids must kill kids.
","A dystopia is the idea of a society, generally of a speculative future, characterized by negative, anti-utopian elements, varying from environmental to political and social issues,usually hypothesized by writers of fiction.Yes, 'Hunger Games' is about a future dystopian society, decades after a rebellion. As a type of penance and reminder that the Capitol has the power, each year each of the 12 outlying districts must choose two youngsters, one boy and one girl, to travel to the Capitol and participate in the Hunger Games. This is the 74th Games. There will be one victor, one survivor, all the rest will die. Children killing other children.This story focuses on district 12, a mining district where people struggle to feed themselves and have established a barter system. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is the older daughter of the family, she hunts and fishes, is good with a bow and arrow and survival in general. Against the odds her younger sister, more the girly type, is chosen in the lottery, but Katniss speaks up and volunteers to go in her place. Along with the boy, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) that she only knew casually.The story becomes one of survival. Neither Katniss nor Peeta want to kill any of the other kids, but they also are determined to defend themselves. The days, perhaps most of a week, of the actual competition takes place mostly in a forested area, monitored by technicians in a center with virtual reality displays. The citizens of the Capitol look at the Hunger games as a big entertainment event, perhaps like the ancient Romans did for their arena battles to the death.A saving grace for the movie is that, although we know kids are killing kids, it is done with a certain grace. We don't see a lot of blood and gore, or graphic killings, which makes the movie more palatable for such a distasteful topic.Fortunately the main story of survival turns into a love story as Katniss and Peeta form a sort of bond, particularly after he reveals in a pre-games televised interview that he has always had a secret admiration of Katniss.Stanley Tucci is one of the flamboyant citizens of the Capitol, he moderates the 'show' before the games begin, interviewing each participant before a live audience in a large theater setting. He comes across most as a host of a TV show like 'America's Got Talent', ignoring the fact that almost all of these young kids will die shortly.I didn't read the book so I can't compare the two, but I suspect they had to leave some things out to keep the running time around 2:15. I found the movie enjoyable, it makes one think about the freedoms we mostly take for granted.SPOILERS: The people monitoring the Games also have a viewing audience they need to keep entertained. So to generate interest they announce, and the participants hear this, that for one time only they will allow two survivors for the same district, if it turns out that way, to play up the budding relationship of Katniss and Peeta. They in fact do 'win' the Games, but then it is announced that they changed their minds, one must kill the other. Peeta encourages Katniss to kill him so that she can survive, but instead she gets a handful of poisonous purple berries, and indicates they will both eat them at the same time, both die rather than have to kill one. Peeta starts to object but Katniss says, 'Trust me. Trust me.' And what she guessed, happened, instead of seeing both of them die they call it off, let both live and travel back to district 12.",Null,3,8,23 August 2012
Zootopia," Interesting and entertaining story set in Zootopia, a city of animals.
","My wife and I enjoyed this movie, we viewed it at home on DVD from our local library.The premise is that this animal society has been able to overcome the natural evolutionary tendency of Predators hunting and killing Prey. As a result animals of all types live in harmony.A young rabbit grows up to believe anyone can strive to become anything if they are willing to work hard enough for it. Voiced excellently by Ginnifer Goodwin, Judy Hopps is the young rabbit that grows up and enters training to become a police officer. She is small but eventually makes up for her shortcomings with cunning and determination.She graduates first in her class but is disappointed to be assigned parking meter duty on her first day. All the others are assigned in groups to look for 14 mysteriously missing animals.Still the investigative instincts kick in and she gets a lead that eventually solves the mystery, the dastardly assistant mayor was running a Walter White type of processing to produce a blue substance extracted from flowers that would cause Predators to revert to their instinctive behavior.It is all very well done, and very interesting movie in spite of being animation. The other most interesting role was Jason Bateman voicing Nick Wilde, a Fox who against his will ends up being Judy's sidekick in tracking down the mystery of the missing animals.",Null,2,5,5 July 2016
12 Monkeys," An intelligent comedy/thriller that rewards careful watching.
","I remember when 12 Monkeys first came out on video, and I just never did get around to watching it. Well, I'm glad I waited so long, because the DVD version is so good. As good as the movie is, this DVD has the very best 'making of' feature I've seen yet. It was done independently and in parallel with making the movie, and gives you a clear idea how this movie was made from concept through test screenings and finally release.The premise of the movie is complex, but involves a future, underground civilization about A.D. 2035, sending people back in time to try and figure out how to prevent, or to find an antidote for, a deadly virus that had exterminated 99% of the world population. It moves back and forth, from 'present' to past, and drops good clues about how everything fits in. Ultimately all is resolved, but you have to be observant. A great movie for real 'movie watchers'.The 3 main actors all do a fine job, but Brad Pitt as the semi-crazy character is so well done, and funny, that it is hard to imagine the movie with anyone else. Overall a really fine movie.(Sept 2012: I just re-watched it after 12 years, I enjoyed it again!)SPOILERS: The time-traveler was told to find the 'Army of the 12 Monkeys' as the likely responsible group, but in the end that turned out to be a red herring. The culprit was actually a mad scientist working for a wealthy businessman, and they managed to figure this out at the airport as he was starting his deadly journey in 1996 to spread the virus across the world. One of the future leaders, a woman, has come back in time to sit next to him. She says, 'My Name is Jones. I am in insurance.'

The Impossible," Story of survival after the tsunami in Thailand.
","The facts, on December 26th, 2004, a powerful undersea earthquake in the Indian ocean caused a devastating tsunami. Not the worst, but one of the places it was deadly was Thailand. This movie is a dramatization, based on a true story of a real family caught up in the tsunami on the beaches of Thailand.Naomi Watts is Maria and Ewan McGregor is Henry. They live in Japan where he works, but are British. They travel, with their three young sons, to spend the Christmas Holidays in Thailand. She is a physician but on hiatus to raise the boys. They get a very nice, ground-floor villa overlooking the ocean about 200 yards away.Enjoying the weather, the beach, and the pool, suddenly and with no warning the trees begin to shake and soon they see this giant wall of water coming towards them, with absolutely no idea what to do. They get bashed more then once, as the water comes in then surges out. The family members get separated, virtually everything is destroyed.The movie, basically a true story, is about the family members hanging on, dealing with injury and infection in a makeshift medical center, hoping to survive and reunite.The movie is very well done. The scenes are very realistic, I cringed loudly on several occasions. The DVD has a couple of good extras, one showing how they built a 1/3 scale resort village and simulated the tsunami wall of water intruding and destroying everything. They also included some interviews with the real Maria, an Italian woman.SPOILERS: Marie is badly injured, on her chest and on her leg. She finds one son, the oldest, and they stay together. Henry manages to find the other two boys, but they end up in a different location. Maria needs surgery, she almost loses her leg, but ultimately they all meet up and as the movie ends they are being flown out of the area, all on their way to recovery.",Null,4,6,4 May 2013
42," Jackie Robinson wore number 42 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
","I really like this movie. I was born in 1945, and became a baseball fan right about the time Jackie Robinson was retiring from baseball in 1957. I happened to be a Brooklyn Dodger fan, and I can't honestly remember why, maybe it was because my dad was a NY Yankees fan. Regardless I never had any consciousness of 'race' in baseball. I knew the Dodgers had black players and as far as I was concerned it was always that way.But of course it wasn't. Even 80 years after the Civil War ended and slaves had been freed, there was still deep racial bigotry in sports. The major leagues were essentially all white. The blacks played in 'negro leagues'. This movie tells the true story of the man, Jackie Robinson, who broke the 'color barrier', it was never easy but Jackie was a superior athlete and a superior human being and made it work. His influence is so highly regarded that every year on 'Jackie Robinson Day' every major league player wears the number 42 in tribute.In an excellent role Chadwick Boseman is Jackie Robinson, and the story is squarely about him. But in a real sense it is also about Branch Rickey, President and General Manager for the Dodgers from 1942 to 1950. This role is played by Harrison Ford in what has to be one of his best performances. He doesn't just play Rickey, he virtually becomes Rickey. When there is a time and need for great change most often there needs to be an energetic driver of that change, and that was Branch Rickey. Yes, in his job he was in the business of winning and making money for the franchise. But deep down he knew the bigotry against blacks in baseball was wrong, and he knew to make the change work he needed to find a first-rate player who would become a team leader. Robinson turned out to be that guy.Excellent movie, one of the very best sports movies I have seen. And I am still a Dodgers fan after all these years!",Null,0,0,9 September 2013

Pretty Kate Ashfield is Liz, Shaun's girlfriend. But she is getting tired of Shaun's ways, he accommodates her gripes by promising to do things, but he never does them. So Liz is dumping him. Shaun is energetic compared to his life-long friend, Nick Frost as Ed, who lives with Shaun and the other roommate but contributes nothing and just likes to play video games.One fateful day all the newspapers have headlines about some mysterious virus that is causing people to become dangerous zombies. When Shaun and his friends become threatened he leads them towards the pub as a place of shelter.

Argo," Mostly true, with some fictional elements, ' based on a true story.'
","The movie has an excellent opening scene, basically summarizing the history of Iran, formerly Persia, over the past 2500 or so years. In modern times, starting around 1950, gradual 'western' elements in Iran were objectionable, until in the 1970s real hatred of the USA came on full-force when the Shah was given refuge.This story starts in 1979 when angry Iranians stormed the US Embassy and took prisoners. Six of the Americans managed to sneak out into the streets and sought refuge with the British and Canadians. The story told here focuses on their being given refuge by the Canadians.Back home members of the government, including the CIA, brainstorm on how to get the six out of Iran to safety. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez (real person) who calls himself an Exfil. We looked it up and it is short for 'exfiltration', the opposite of 'infiltration.' One evening while talking to his son by phone, and watching one of the 'Planet of the Apes' movies, Tony has a brainstorm, maybe he can go into Iran posing as a filmmaker scouting locations, then represent the six captives as members of his scouting team, then get them out of the country with fake passports and a fake movie script, complete with storyboards.Since it is 'based' on the real events and not a 'documentary', invariably some things are presented to increase the excitement. Like the last-second approval for tickets to get home, or the dramatic chase of the 747 on the runway during takeoff. But the overall story is faithful, and the whole movie illustrates the vast divide between western values and those of culture with ancient roots, like the Iranians.The actors are all first-rate, and it was fun to see Bryan Cranston as one of the Washington operatives, after getting to know him so well in his role as Walter White in 'Breaking Bad.' Overall a very entertaining movie, we all enjoyed it. We didn't worry at all that some of it is fiction, it's movie-making after all!",Null,0,2,21 March 2013
Last Flag Flying," Road trip movie, three veterans going to bury a young soldier.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. In the extras commentary it is mentioned as a 'sequel' to the 1973 'The last Detail' but the focus of the story was changed.The setting is 2003, the Iraq war was raging and Saddam Hussein is being captured in his fox hole. Steve Carell is Larry 'Doc' Shepherd who as a teenager served in Vietnam 30 years earlier as a Navy medic. He just got news that his son, a Marine, was killed in Iraq and the body was being transported back to the States for burial at Arlington Cemetery.Using an internet search, which was still in its relative infancy in 2003, he looks up his two best buddies from all those years ago. Bryan Cranston is 
Sal Nealon, owner of Sal's bar. Laurence Fishburne is Reverend Richard Mueller. Neither one is thrilled at first but eventually they agree to accompany Doc.So the story really is more of a road trip with three old buddies often commenting on the current state of affairs, and various life lessons. Sal is the 'agitator in chief' of the group but in the end lessons are learned and life put into a proper perspective.The three were accompanied by J. Quinton Johnson as active soldier 
Washington, his TDY assignment. I don't know anything about the young actor but in a supporting role he is very good and seems authentic.Good movie although a bit long. I found myself wishing it were about 20 to 30 minutes shorter.",Null,1,3,21 March 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A fun movie, and I own the DVD, but I don't find it quite as good as so many do.
","Johnny Depp is a fine actor. I enjoy him in all his roles, and in fact just finished seeing him (again!) as Don Juan Demarco, an underrated movie where he and Brando interact so well. He also did a fine job here as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate without a ship. Keira Knightly is fine as the beautiful maiden in distress. Geoffrey Rush, one of the great and versatile actors of our time, is superb as the evil and wiley nemesis Captain Barbossa. The special effects are very well done, and the cinematography is beautiful. However, both times I have seen it, I was never able to get into the story, the curse, and the pirates who appeared as skeletons under moonlight. It is a good and fun movie, but maybe more for the younger crowd, as my 15-year-old neighbors and my two young grandchildren enjoyed it very much. I don't believe it belongs in the top 250, nor does it warrant the (so far) 34% of '10' votes on the IMDb.",Null,2,4,1 May 2004
Star Trek Into Darkness," Very good 'popcorn' entertainment, just don't get too critical of the story.
","My wife and I enjoyed watching this for an evening of inoffensive entertainment. It is the second Star Trek movie for this new gang, after the 2009 'Star Trek.' Pine's Kirk and Quinto's Spock play well off each other.Set far in the future, the story here is that a rogue Starfleet member creates some havoc, then waits for a conference of leaders to kill more, before fleeing off to an unoccupied planet. When his identity is revealed he really is Kahn (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is several hundred years old, a product of experimentation to create a type of super-human, and had been held in a cryogenic state. Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock, along with their ship and crew, are given the task of finding Kahn, and killing him. But Spock reminds Kirk that morally, they need to capture him and bring him back for a trial.After a battle with Klingons on patrol, aided by Kahn, he seems to be too easily 'captured' and held on the starship Enterprise. So most of the rest of the story becomes a battle of cunning, is Kahn really trying to help them, as he claims, or is he just manipulating them to achieve his sinister goals?The cast includes a number of fine actors, including Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, and Anton Yelchin. But to me the real star here is Cumberbatch, who plays an excellent villain.",Null,2,4,1 October 2013
Stripes," Just one in a string of Murray/Ramis classic comedies.
","Harold Ramis absolutely cannot strike a pose without a glint in his eye and a rye smile on his face. He is just filled with 'funny'. We owe him Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, and this movie, 'Stripes.' Take ordinary human conditions, and turn them into something interesting and funny.Bill Murray is John Winger and Harold Ramis is Russell Ziskey, a couple of slackers trying to keep gainful employment and make ends meet. In the one day that begins this movie, Winger quits his cabbie job, abandoning a stuffy lady on the bridge, gets his car repossessed, and has his girlfriend leave him. At the shoe shine shop, watching an 'Uncle Sam Wants You' TV spot, he convinces his buddy Ziskey that they would do better by enlisting in the Army. After all, free food and free clothes! Warren Oates is in fine form as drill Sgt. Hulka. P.J. Soles as Stella Hansen and Sean Young as Louise Cooper, both MPs on base, serve as the love interests of the two men. John Candy is one of the raw recruits, 'Ox' Oxberger, while John Larroquette is good as the neurotic and useless Capt. Stillman.I watched it with Emily, a recent high school graduate who is enrolling at West Point this summer, as her introduction to basic training in the Army! SPOILERS: Hulka gets injured by a wayward projectile, and the guys have to train themselves the final night before the graduation review. They are unpolished, but disciplined, and so impress the general that they are sent to Italy on special assignment. Winger and Ziskey, as usual, get everyone in a bind, in an unauthorized venture into Communist Czek territory, but Winger and Ziskey also come to the rescue.",Null,0,0,4 June 2007
12 Angry Men," Character study in a small jury room.
","This movie, currently ranked as #21 all time on the IMDb list, is a simple story of the deliberations of 12 men on a jury of a murder trial. We see nothing of the actual trial or the closing arguments. The story begins as the judge instructs the jury, in weighing the evidence presented, they must return a verdict of 'guilty' unless there is reasonable doubt. Although not made clear in the movie, a verdict of 'not guilty' is not the same as 'innocent.' Not guilty simply means that the prosecution did not present a case strong enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The case that we do not see or hear of first hand involves a son accused of murdering his father. One witness was an elderly man who claimed to have seen the boy running down the stairs from the apartment a few seconds after hearing voices and a body hitting the floor. Was this old man who shuffled along really able to get there in time? Could he really hear clearly over the noise of the passing train? Another was a woman who identified the boy as the one plunging the knife into the victim. But did she wear glasses, and did she have them on when she claimed she saw the murder 60 feet away through the windows of a passing train on elevated tracks (the 'el')? First seated the jurors take a vote, and it is 11 to one in favor of conviction. There is a ball game that evening and many of the men are anxious to delivered a verdict and get home. One man (Henry Fonda) says he is not sure, the boy may in fact be guilty, but suppose he isn't. He just wants to talk about it. A boy's life is at stake. Don't they owe it to him to examine all possibilities? But the other 11 at first look upon their task as one to convince the lone juror that he is wrong.As the 90 minutes move along, various jurors bring up points that they noticed, possibilities that neither the prosecution nor the defense attorneys had brought up. Others gradually join the 'not guilty' side, until it is only one for 'guilty.' Then there were none. Much of the dialog brought out prejudices certain men held, that were clouding their reasoning, and preventing them from seeing both sides of the argument. This is a story less about jury verdicts, and more about human nature.The movie sets out to show that with reasonable doubt at hand, a verdict of 'not guilty' must be returned. Thus it is mostly an examination of how our personal prejudice can cloud our judgment. I suspect that this story was much more significant 50 years ago than it is today. There have been a number of very public trials (e.g. OJ Simpson) where most of the evidence appeared to point to guilt, but a jury returned a 'not guilty' verdict because of reasonable doubt. However it remains part of the foundation of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proved guilty, even if it means some guilty persons will go free.Although only Lee J. Cobb stands out, as the angry juror who was the last hold out, this contained a fine ensemble cast. Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Ed Begley are others who are prominent in my mind.",Null,5,6,16 January 2005
Beauty and the Beast," Fine animation, but story doesn't strike a particularly good chord with me.
","Disney's animated BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has received much praise and high ratings, but I don't know why it is placed above so many of the other fine animated films. For example, for me Disney's animated TARZAN is a much more entertaining film. Maybe because TARZAN's serious message (family, and accepting outsiders) is delivered in a more entertaining manner. In 'beast' Belle is a beautiful young woman whose father becomes imprisoned in the castle of the Beast and she volunteers to be imprisoned instead, to free her father. The Beast had gotten that way from a spell, and could only become the handsome prince again if he could get someone to love him. A bitter person, that appears virtually impossible.some SPOILERS follow ...During her stay in the Beast's castle, Belle is rarely treated kindly, but still in the end she falls in love with him. The transition from the two being at odds, to the romance, seems to abrupt, without a plausible buildup to that point. It is well-done, but for me the presentation of the story was not altogther satisfying.",Null,5,6,14 June 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Entertaining fantasy. What's in your wardrobe??
","A lot has been made of CS Lewis and the Christian message that is contained in this story. I can see where one can make that connection, with the Lion, but it isn't by any means a necessary connection. While I enjoyed this movie, I don't find it great. For many of us there is a secret fascination with the idea of a fantasy passage into another world. We saw it years ago in 'Wizard of Oz', we saw it more recently in 'Zathura.' There have been many fantasy stories with this theme. Here the youngest of the 4 Pevensie children, sent to a rural estate to be safe from WW II bombing of London, goes into a piece of furniture, a regular wardrobe, during a game of hide and seek with her siblings. As she goes past the various fur coats hanging up, suddenly and magically she is in an outdoor snow setting, nothing like the grounds outside the house. She quickly meets a faun, a strange looking creature that looks almost human above the waist, but had animal-like legs with hooves. She finds out she is in a land called 'Narnia.'Eventually all the children end up in Narnia, where it has been cold for 100 years under the rule of wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton). Plus, the children find out they have the duty to help bring springtime to Narnia, and make things right again. Jim Broadbent has the small role of Professor Kirke, who lives at the country retreat. There are a couple of scenes where it appears that he knew about the passage to Narnia, perhaps even went there himself when he was small, but it is not treated in a definitive manner. At the end I didn't know what his role was in the whole story, if any. Perhaps fans of the CS Lewis books understand the whole story better. For me it was just 'OK' entertainment.",Null,2,3,9 May 2006
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Quirky, entertaining 'love' movie with many different entanglements.
","It used to be the screwball comedies of the 1950s and 1960s, where you would get so many complicated relationships. At first we had no idea where this one was headed but eventually it turned into a very entertaining diversion.The mainstream story here involves a married couple who have been together for 25 years, and it seems that 'love' has become stale. They are out for dinner, looking at the menu, when he asks if she knows what she wants she looks up and says 'I want a divorce.' This is a great surprise to him, a devoted husband and father.The husband is Steve Carell as Cal Weaver in what amounts to a mostly serious role for the funny man. His wife is Julianne Moore as Emily Weaver. This quickly results in his moving to an apartment, and their 10 and 13 year old kids struggle with the new developments.Despondent and confused Cal goes to a nightspot and meets Ryan Gosling as Jacob Palmer whose sole purpose in life appears to be picking up pretty ladies for one-night stands. Jacob observes Cal's sloppy appearance and awkward manner and decides to take him under his wing, to give him a new image and teach him the finer points of charming and picking up women.All this transpires as Cal and Emily are wrestling with their personal feelings, realizing that they just want to be back together but not knowing how to handle it. The movie is filled with established actors, many in small roles, including the likes of Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and Josh Groban in a non-singling role. As the movie nears its end the entanglements get more and more complicated, and funnier and funnier. Entertaining movie! SPOILERS: The Emma Stone character, a newly minted lawyer, is actually the daughter of Cal and Emily, they were only 17 when she was born. She meets the dastardly Jacob and brings him home as her new love, which startles Cal, who it turns out had a one-night stand with his own 13-yr-old son's teacher who didn't know he was married. And on and on it goes. All seems to end well though as Cal and Emily realize they are soul mates and will get back together, forgiving each for unwise transgressions.",Null,0,1,28 December 2011
Happy Gilmore," What happens when you mix hockey and golf? You get a happy Gilmore!
","I am disappointed in all those 'over 45 male' voters who rate this movie under '5'. I give it a strong '8', and a '9.5' for pure entertainment. I've been playing golf for about 40 years, and I just love the spoof this film perpetrates.Story; Happy Gilmore is a hockey player who wants to earn money to get his grandmother's house back. As movers are doing their thing, the golf clubs and balls spill on the lawn, Happy hits one a mile and they comment that he could earn money! That gets his attention.He has an unusual style, hits it like a hockey player with a running start, occasionally misses it completely. Gets into a local tourney and qualifies for the tour!His protagonist is the best pro golfer, 'Shooter' expertly played by Christopher McDonald. Happy (Adam Sandler) destroys all golf traditions. In his first tourney he gets a caddy who he tackles because he thinks the caddy wants to steal his clubs. In a later pro-am tourney he is paired with Bob Barker, they get into a great fight on the course, Barker ends up putting his lights out.Happy's love interest is Virginia (Julie Bowen, who plays on the TV show 'ed')who is publicist for the tour. She helps to calm Happy down. The climax comes in the season ending championship, Shooter has bought grandma's house out of spite, agrees to give it to her if Happy wins the championship. Happy agrees to pull out of golf if he loses. Happy goes to his new friend, old golf pro Chubbs (Carl Weathers) to actually teach him how to play well, instead of just relying on driving the green of par-4s to score well. Chubbs had lost his right hand to a gator, which re-surfaces later and leads to Chubbs' fall from the second story window. Happy gets grandma's house back, he and Virginia end up together, Shooter fails to win the championship one more time. This is not high art, doesn't even have a good moral to it. What I like is the inventive ways they debunk some of the myths of golf and have fun with that. Will remain one of my favorite movies just for a fun time.Cameo appearances are also made by Lee Trevino and Ben Stiller, who plays an unscrupulous male nurse in grandma's nursing home.",Null,1,2,6 May 2001
The Notebook," Heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.
","We have this older man, Duke (James Garner at his best) who comes to a nursing home daily with a notebook. He seeks out this pretty older woman (Gena Rowlands) and reads to her from the notebook. She likes the story, she looks forward to hearing what happens next in the lives of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams). The main of the movie is set in the 1940s, as we see Noah and Allie meeting one summer in South Carolina, then the triumphs and disappointments of their relationship over the next 7 years. Fine movie-making, fine acting, a good story. The DVD picture and sound are first-rate, the making-of extras interesting. MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. We figure out mid-way through the running time that Duke is really Noah in old age, and the lady he reads to is Allie, suffering dementia. Most of the time she doesn't know who he is, and doesn't recognize their children when they visit. They plead with dad to 'come back home', but he says 'She is my home', so much was his love for her. He was reading from the notebook she wrote of their romance back in the 1940s, with the inscription, 'Read this to me and I will come back.' He never knew when, but after reading to her for a while she would 'come back', she would recognize him, they would share a few minutes, before she reverted. The doctors thought it impossible.In 1940 Noah, from a poor upbringing, worked at the local saw mill. Allie was vacationing for the summer with her wealthy family, who expected her to go to college in New York and marry a wealthy young man. When the summer fling did not end promptly, Allie was taken home, Noah knew of the disapproval of the parents. They parted, he wrote every day for one year, but received no answers. Allie's mom had hidden all the letters. Noah moved to Atlanta, war broke out, he served and fought, made it home safely. Meanwhile Allie in college volunteered in a VA hospital, caring for the wounded, where she met her eventual fianc√©e.Noah's dad sold the family home, gave Noah the money so he could buy and renovate the old mansion by the water that he and Allie had dreamed 7 years earlier of living and growing old in. Going to Charleston to get permits, he sees Allie on the street, finds her in a restaurant, but leaves unseen when she meets and kisses her fianc√©e. Noah goes back to work on the old home while Allie and her mom prepare for the wedding. With Noah still in her mind, she makes a last-minute trip back and finds him, the house was complete, even the room for painting that she had requested. He told her he did it all because he had promised it to her. Mom shows up, she shows him a laborer who, 25 years earlier, she had been in love with, suggesting that maybe she regretted marrying for security. Allie decides to go with her heart, she and Noah get married, and all that brings us back to the nursing home almost 60 years later. While heartbreaking, the ending is also uplifting. After suffering his third 'minor' heart attack in a few months, Duke returns to Allie's bed, she recognizes him, wonders if they can 'go together.' He lies down next to her, they hold hands, and are found that way the next morning, having been taken to their reward during the night. Many may find that overly sappy, but to me it is the perfect ending to a lifetime love affair.",Null,8,13,11 February 2005
Public Enemies," Interestingly told story of Melvin Purvis' hunt for criminal John Dillinger.
","The first think you notice are the fine cast members, some of the best actors of our time --- Johhny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Giovanni Ribisi. We even have Diana Krall in a cameo, singing on stage. The movie is a bit long, with long periods of little action, which allows for more complete development of the details of the hunt for Dillinger. Some will not like this, others will find it adds greatly to the movie experience.Johnny Depp is in fine form as John Dillinger, who wanted it all. In spite of his vicious nature, he had a soft spot for a lady he meets. It eventually helps lead to his downfall. Christian Bale is also in fine form as Melvin Purvis, the agent in charge of the team to track down and capture or kill Dillinger. The DVD extra even has some comments by Purvis' grandson. Also good is Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover. Good movie.SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end a lady friend of Dillinger's was given a choice, give him up or be deported within 48 hours. She told them of a movie date and they were waiting for them as they came out of the theater. Dillinger was shot and killed as he walked on the sidewalk, only a few yards outside the exit of the theater.",Null,0,0,21 December 2009
The Babadook," Pretty well made but it never engaged me in the terror.
","I saw this on Netflix streaming movies. I went into it with more than a bit of trepidation, it has very mixed reviews but I figured I'd give it a try. All I had to lose was 90 minutes of my 'valuable' time. It is an Australian movie. Mostly about the mom and her young son, about to turn 7. His dad is gone, he died getting his wife to the hospital the day the son was born.The title refers to a mythical monster, the Babadook that knocks three times ... 'dook - dook - dook'. The boy is very often misbehaved and has a fear of monsters. Yet his mom reads him a monster book.This story is not just a fear of a monster but the monster also manifests itself.

Madagascar," Just good, clear, silly animated entertainment.
","State-of-the-art animation, mostly witty dialog, with a sub-theme of friends being there for each other. But mostly just a mindlessly entertaining 80-minute cartoon.The voice of the main character is Ben Stiller as the lion, Alex. Other stars who lend their vocal talents include Chris Rock as Marty, the zebra. David Schwimmer as Melman, the giraffe. Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria, the dainty hippo. And once they get to Madagascar, Sacha Baron Cohen (of 'Borat' fame) as Julien, the leader of the little creatures.The story begins in the New York Central Park Zoo, with the animals conversing about how boring their lives are, and how it would be nice to get out 'in the wild.' It turns out the Penguins are also longing for the colder weather and have begun to dig a tunnel to Antarctica, which of course goes nowhere.However the zebra escapes and decides to take a train to Connecticut, and his friends go after him. When all of them get cornered at Grand Central Station, then crated, they end up on an ocean liner, along with the penguins, who commandeer the ship and head to Antarctica. But the 4 zoo animals argue, and end up knocking their crates into the ocean, and they all wash up on a shore.Since the animals can't really tell where they are, we learn that they are in Madagascar because we see an abandoned plane, crashed into the top of a large tree, identified as 'Madagascar Tours.' The main of the story involves the 4 zoo animals in this new environment, and the small Lemurs defending themselves from their predators. The lion, zebra, hippo, and giraffe end up helping them.We also see the 4 penguins in Antarctica, standing in the dark and cold, uttering 'This sucks.'

The Other Boleyn Girl," Helps fill in some historical aspects of British succession.
","We have had the movies about Queen Elizabeth I, and 'The Other Boleyn Girl' might be considered the prequel.Much more is known about Anne Boleyn, less about her sister Mary. Some historians have Mary as the younger of the two, as she is portrayed here. But others believe Mary was the older.Natalie Portman is Anne Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson is Mary Boleyn. By my ears they have adequate British accents, and both are superb actresses. The movie starts with them, plus their brother, playing in the fields as small children, and we hear the parents talk of already promising Anne in marriage, an arrangement that will be favorable for the Boleyn family.The film soon switches to their young adult lives, with Australian Eric Bana as Henry Tudor, King Henry VIII. Set in the 1500s, this was the period where England broke with the Roman Catholic church because the Pope would not allow Henry to divorce his wife who could not give him a son.As history witnessed, Anne Boleyn eventually married Henry, but that was not satisfactory and for suspicion of incest, Anne was beheaded in a public execution. But their daughter, Elizabeth, was to become the great Queen Elizabeth I of the latter 16th century.Good movie.",Null,0,1,5 August 2008
Us," Curious movie, filmed in Santa Cruz.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. Not my wife's type of movie.This movie had generated a reasonable amount of hype, plus it has Lupita Nyong'o in it, so I was anxious to see it. I found it very well made with many interesting visuals, but with one difficulty.When a writer/director makes a movie with lots of symbolism he or she sees very clearly what they want to convey. However each viewer comes away with different degrees of comprehension of what his/her intent was. I read a number of 'professional' reviews and most of them have praise for 'Us' but each with different takeaways.I'm not sure what points the movie was trying to make, something about our shadows always getting the short end of the stick. Something about thousands of miles of tunnels in the USA. Then the twist at the end, when we find out what really happened to the young girl in the hall of mirrors in 1986.So, while I mostly found it an entertaining viewing I don't come away with some new revelation about people and their lives. I mostly enjoyed seeing scenes of Santa Cruz where we vacationed just a few years ago, walking the same streets where the car fire scene was shot near the end of the movie, plus the beach and the pier.I think many viewers, who are not professional movie critics, will not enjoy seeing this movie because the themes and messages are mostly obscure.Edit: First I want to say no movie should require 'extras' on a disc to explain the movie. But I DID watch some of the extras on the BD afterward and in particular the filmmaker talking about what motivated him to come up with this particular story, and that is interesting. Part of it is we think as if we somehow earned being in an affluent position, as the featured family was, when in fact it was just luck of being born where we were. And the idea that meeting your doppelganger can be scary. But he also admits that it is just a popcorn flick, not to be taken too seriously.",Null,3,4,4 July 2019
The Danish Girl," Mostly true story of an early transgender case in Denmark.
","Watched it on DVD loan from my local public library. Looking up a few details it seems to be a mostly true depiction of what actually occurred. However the 40-something couple in the 1920s are played by much younger actors here.In short husband and wife are happily married painters. He (Einar) seems to be somewhat more successful (accepted) than she (Gerda) is. In an instance where her normal female model is unavailable she has her husband put on stockings, makeup, and a wig so he can model for her. Doing so seems to trigger a long latent desire for him to actually be a woman. He starts to call himself Lili when dressed as a woman and dresses that way more and more.This was the 1920s and not so much was known about such transgender feelings and also little about surgery to facilitate a gender reassignment. At one point Einar has to leave town to avoid arrest and forced treatment for his 'crime.' Perhaps this movie would have had a greater impact a few decades ago, because the recent transgender process for Bruce Jenner, Olympics Decathlon Champion, to become Caitlyn Jenner has been so publicized that a viewer could take a 'ho-hum' view of this sort of thing. However it is a good movie of an important time of transition and Vikander won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Although Redmane does a remarkable job in his role and might have won Best Actor in a different year.In spite of the actual topic to me the better story here is of love and commitment, his wife truly loved him, even after he began his transition, she never gets angry or plays the victim, she understands him and supports him. That part of the story can get lost among the rest.Alicia Vikander is Gerda Wegener and Eddie Redmayne is Einar Wegener who becomes Lili Elbe. Unfortunately, as history tells us, Lili did not survive her last surgery, probably a result of organ rejection.",Null,1,2,29 April 2016
Little Boy," Examines the father-son bond during WW2. Can faith move a mountain?
","When I told my wife we had the DVD of 'Little Boy' from the public library she asked, 'Wasn't that the name of one of the bombs dropped on Japan?' I said yes but this movie is not about that. Well, maybe it is.Set in the 1940s California, in a fictional coastal village called O'Hare, Michael Rapaport is the dad, James Busbee, and he has a very close relationship with his young son, Jakob Salvati as Pepper Flynt Busbee. He is small for his age and the local kids are mean, they usually call him 'Midget' but after the local physician suggests it, he takes on the name 'Little Boy'. After Pearl Harbor there is a rush for young men to sign up and fight for the USA. The older son, maybe 18 or 19, has flat feet so is rejected and dad signs up in his place. Staying at home is the good mom, Emily Watson as Emma Busbee.There is also a side story of acceptance, as a local Japanese man, an American citizen who had been there over 40 years, is hassled by the local men because he is Japanese. This is a 'faith' story, the young actor is actually the son of a Minister. Some viewers who adamantly detest faith-based movies will object to this one. But it is a very nice story of a young buy having faith that he can get God to help him get his dad back alive and well from the war.My wife and I enjoyed the movie, very worthwhile.SPOILER: The boy talks to the Parish Priest who gives him an old card that lists the works of mercy, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, etc. and tells him many believe doing these works will answer his prayers. Little Boy goes about finding ways to do those things. He gets picked at a magic show and told to make a bottle move. He glares and grunts, hands extended, and the bottle moves. Of course it is a trick but Little Boy has faith. He learns the story of the mustard seed, and on a dare he tries to move a mountain just outside town. The ground begins to shake, is it a coincidence, an earthquake that would have happened anyway? Or did his faith move the mountain? Then the Japanese man shows him on a map where Japan is, tells him at sunset (5:15PM) it is across the water where the sun sets. So Little Boy extends his hands and hopes to free his dad. Newspaper headlines the next day show that Little Boy (the bomb) was dropped on Japan, the war was about over. Was it faith or coincidence? His dad, first thought to have been killed, does come home and seems will recover.",Null,0,0,4 September 2015
The Girl Next Door," Cuthbert and Hirsh are fine, but overall a disappointing movie.
","This movie uses a very familiar formula. A somewhat older, daring, and attractive person moves in next door to a high school 'innocent', and they each help pull the other a bit more towards the middle. Here the innocent is a boy, Matty played by Emile Hirsch, who is smaller than the tough high school boys, who apparently has no girl friends, and is a math whiz who plans to attend Georgetown the next year. Elisha Cuthbert plays Danielle who moves in next door. When Matty finds out that she has no 'boyfriend' he gets interested. However, as we know from the movie trailers, Danielle is a young porn star, a fact that doesn't escape Matty's friend Eli (Chris Marquette, 'Adam' of Joan of Arcadia) for long, because Eli's past time is watching porn.My favorite character was Kelly, played by Timothy Olyphant. Kelly shows up one day, Matty thinks he might be an old boyfriend, but he really is Danielle's 'producer'. He talks her into going with him to LV for a porn industry show, she goes figuring she can't realistically escape her past. But Matty follows her, fights for her, she eventually leaves the industry for good. Most SPOILERS are in the following comments. There is a side story of a $25,000 fund Matty was amassing for a young 'genius' to be allowed to come to America for studies, in a questionable twist Kelly steals the money so Matty has to come up with a quick fund raising scheme. During the school prom he recruits the help of a couple of porn stars and his friends, we the audience thinks he is making a porn movie. In reality he is making a sex-education film, and he sells it for enough to replace the stolen $25,000, a loss he mentally writes off as the price to get Danielle out of her industry.While the overall story has a positive ring to it, the style of the movie was often in poor taste. For example, the character Eli was obsessed with sex, and his dialog was often inappropriate in public, even in this sort of movie. It just seems that they were too often going for the shock value instead of trusting the inherent goodness of the story.On an aside, I enjoyed Timothy Bottoms as Matty's dad, Mr. Kidman. He played it very low key, in contrast to the character he played, as the President, in the short-lived TV series, 'That's My Bush.'",Null,2,5,21 January 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," 'You're possum enough for me!'
","This is a very delightful and funny animated movie. It was almost 4 years ago when I saw the first Ice Age cartoon movie, where Diego, the Sabre Toothed Tiger (Denis Leary) bonded with the other animals, forming a big family of sorts. Now, in this movie, they are faced with the ice age ending, and a wall of water building up behind a weakening ice dam threatens their survival. So in much of the movie they are migrating to higher ground.Once again Ray Romano voices Manny, who his friends think is the only surviving mammoth. So part of the story is to see if Manny can find other mammoths. John Leguizamo is again good as Sid the Sloth and Denis Leary is again Diego.Queen Latifah is a new entry to the cast, voicing Ellie who believes she is a Possum. Because as a small child was raised with what she thought were her two brothers, Possums. But she is actually a Mammoth that hangs from a tree limb at night to sleep. Will Manny and Ellie get together to insure survival of the species? (The movie actually begins with Chris Wedge voicing Scrat, the Saber Toothed Squirrel, desperately trying to reclaim his acorn, in a very funny, laugh out loud, sequence.) SPOILERS. At the end, after everyone survives, a whole herd of Mammoths approach them. Ellie's instinct is to follow the herd, but Manny wins her heart. He even tries hanging upside down from a limb, which soon breaks. Lying in a heap, Ellie looks at him and says, 'You're possum enough for me.'",Null,0,1,19 December 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," 'You can't organize an Ostrich race with just one Ostrich!'
","I understand that this movie is based on (or inspired by) the video game of the same name. I am not familiar with the video game so I take the movie on its own merits.The story is set in the 4th or 5th century, according to the producers, when Persia stretched from the Mediterranian Sea to the Steppe of China. Today relatively small Iran is a remnant of Persia. However the movie was filmed in French Morroco and on very large sets inside the sound stages of Pinewood studios, with features faithfully reproduced to match the exterior scenes in Morocco.The King of Persia is a wise king, with two young sons. But one day in a crowded marketplace witnesses a small boy, an orphan of about 10, come to the aid of another young boy by throwing an apple at the aggressive soldier, and running to safety. Impressed, the King adopts the young boy, Dastan, who grows up as one of his sons, a Prince of Persia.Cut to 15 years later and Jake Gyllenhaal is Dastan. When they raid a walled city, suspected of making knives for the enemies of Persia, Dastan is the hero, and he is attracted to the Princess, Gemma Arterton as Tamina. Ben Kingsley is Nizam, the brother of the King, and the one who reported the weapons suspicion.The 'Sands of Time' part of the title refers to a special dagger, with a special 'sand of time' in its handle, and when the ruby on the butt of the knife is pressed, it can reverse time for a short period. With unlimited sand, it could reverse time for an unlimited period, and this become the central theme of the entire story.Dastan finds himself in trouble, and must flee. One place he goes he meets Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, who among other things is a promoter of Ostrich races. (Real jockeys were hired to ride the Ostriches, and the DVD extras has funny scenes of them falling off.) When Dastan has to release all the Ostriches as diversion, when he later encounters Amar, with only one Ostrich left, he is told, 'You can't organize an Ostrich race with just one Ostrich!'Overall I enjoyed this movie very much. There are a number of interesting situations that are handled well and Gyllenhaal turns out to be quite good as an action hero. SPOILERS: It turns out that Nizam, who appears to be loyal, has actually been envious of his brother. His report of weapons was false, a ruse to allow him to steal the dagger, to turn back time so that his brother would die, none of the sons would be born, and Nizam would have been the King. But Dastan finally figures it all out and makes things right in the inventive and exciting last scenes. Then he turns back time to when they raided the walled city and instead of defeating the inhabitants, he made everyone aware of Nizam's lie and prevented the battle. His brother, killed in a fight, no longer was dead. And Dastan gets the Princess.",Null,0,1,12 October 2010
Ted," Target audience (juveniles) seem to love it, but frankly a pretty poor movie.
","In many ways this movie is a reunion of the creator of and actors in the TV series, 'Family Guy.' Which isn't bad, because there is a lot of talent there. As a boy John Bennett had trouble finding friends, for no particular reason, because he seemed to be the normal boy of 8 living in a Boston suburb. But for Christmas he made a wish, that his Teddy bear would come alive, and the next morning his wish had come true. Mark Wahlberg is the adult John Bennett, 27 years later at age 35. He is stuck in a low paying job at a car rental business, but has been in a 4-year relationship.And his bear, Ted, has grown up too, not physically, but his voice changed and he developed this really dirty mind and dirty vocabulary. For no particular reason, it seems. And unlike some similar stories, Ted's secret is widely publicized from the start, and there is an inventive scene where he is a guest on the Johnny Carson show, when Carson says 'I thought you would be taller', Ted replies 'And I thought you'd be funnier.' The pretty girl in John's life is Mila Kunis as Lori Collins. She realizes he doesn't have a great career path, but she loves him and knows he has a good heart. But most of the story involves John giving in to Ted's suggestions, screwing up over and over. Ted, who saved John as a boy, now is messing up John's relationship. Seth MacFarlane, creator and director, voices Ted, and post-production did a great job to make Ted look very real, although a static teddy bear was used in filming.This story has some real potential but to me, and also to my wife, it wasn't handled very well. There are some funny scenes, but there is also a strong reliance on potty humor and sexual references that only serve to make the move 'dirty-sounding.' I know, to many that also makes it funny, but to us it did not. Pretty marginal movie overall, we would not recommend it to any of our friends.",Null,1,4,29 December 2012
Knives Out," Mostly entertaining 'whodunnit' in the vein of Agatha Christie.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered.",Null,0,3,10 March 2020
Spider-Man 2," An almost perfect 'popcorn' movie, highly entertaining.
","I watched this at home, I own it on DVD.As the sequel to his first Spiderman role, Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker. He has been fighting crime and trying to figure out how to balance his life as Spiderman and his desire for a relationship with Mary Jane Watson, capably played again by Kirsten Dunst. Then mid-movie he has an identity crisis of sorts, discards his costume in the trash in an alley, and vows to give up his crime-fighting role.But the call is too great, on the loose is Alfred Molina as Doc Ock , with four metal bionic arms attached to his back, powered by Tritium fuel. The risk to the city and the citizens is too great, he has to put his costume back on and save the city.The romantic side story is MJ getting tired of what she sees as Peter's lack of commitment to their 'friendship', e.g. repeatedly failing to show up to see her stage play. She in fact gets engaged to be married to another man. Somehow through all the turmoil MJ has to realize who Peter really is and that he is the only one for her.Good, entertaining movie.",Null,0,5,14 June 2019
Billy Elliot," Very fine British comedy/drama about a boy and his dancing during the 1984 coal miners' strike.
","The film 'Billy Elliot' gets its name from the main character who was 12 years old. He is played marvelously by 14-yr-old Jamie Bell who was discovered for this film by auditioning 2000+ boys who 1)could dance, 2)could act, 3)was the right age, and 4)who had the correct NE English accent.  Bell is so good, with the great and sincere smile or the brooding, angry face, depending on the demands of the scene. He may become a 'one-hit' wonder, but in this film he is nothing short of award quality. No question, even though the movie is filled with fine, experienced British actors, Jamie Bell carries this film, and that is remarkable for a first-timer!CAUTION -- FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --The story is set in 1984, in the coal-mining (the pits) area of northeast England. Workers are on strike and Margaret Thatcher is bound to 'break' them, which she eventually does. Billy's mother has recently died, and he now shares a flat with his caring but overtly tough father, his older brother, and his half-demented grandmother. Times are tough, no one is working in this coal-mining community, angry picketers curse and throw things at the buses of 'scabs' crossing the line.Billy is in boxing training, but in the ring, wearing his grandfather's old gloves, begins to dance around, seems that dancing is just in his blood. Much later in the movie he explains, at the end of an audition, 'I just feel like electricity when I am dancing. I become someone else.' One punch decks him in this bout.Billy quite accidently becomes aware of the ballet class at the other end of the floor (British pronounce ballet as if it were spelled 'bally'), gets interested, and is encouraged by the older lady instructor. She quickly recognizes Billy's talent and encourages him to continue.Two problems -- there is no extra money around for 'bally' lessons and 2) his dad is horrified at the thought that his son might become a 'bally dancer', also afraid that he might become a homosexual. Their men box, play football, etc, but dance?? No way. So Billy has to practice his dance positions secretly, and sneak out to dance practice, his dad thinking he is still boxing. Until the boxing guy says he hasn't seen Billy in weeks!So dad shows up at 'bally' practice and spots Billy among the girls, and you can see him fuming, his face turning red, and pulls Billy out. But Billy keeps on, on his own.  On another occasion dad catches him in the dance studio again. This time Billy stands 6 inches (15 cm) from his dad, almost nose-to-nose, defiant face, and begins to dance. All over the room, all kinds of moves, tap, modern, 'bally' -- and stops in front of dad, who then realizes both how much his son loves 'bally' and how much talent he has.Eventually Billy gets an audition in London, where dad had never even been, gets accepted, strike ends, dad is determined to see that his son gets the schooling he deserves.  Before Billy leaves, he and dad are talking, warmly, and Billy asks, 'If I change my mind I can come home, can't I?' Dad answers, 'But I've already 'let out' your room.' They both laugh.The movie ends 13 years later, Billy is 25, and his dad goes to London to see him dance as the featured performer. All we get is a quick shot of him being told his dad is there, then leaping on stage. If I were a 'bally' fan I could tell from the costume which 'bally' it was, but I am not.Fine story, important time historically, families in crisis and Billy Elliot determined to pursue his dream. There is a fair amount of 'salty' language, from all characters, but it always seems to be in context with the film and how NE Englanders really spoke in 1984. I was not offended by it, but I suspect some viewers might be.I hope to see this one again some day. I rate it a strong 8 of 10 and think most everyone would enjoy it. The DVD has a few extras, the most interesting being the 'making of' with interviews of the various actors and director. The sound is DD 5.1 and mostly good.  However, the quiet dialog and British accent forced me to 'rewind' and re-listen to some to understand them. I also had to increase the volume 6dB which is quite a lot (4X sound level) compared to most other DVDs. So I give the sound only a C- overall.  Still, this can be overcome and not a fatal flaw in an otherwise superb presentation.",Null,0,0,19 April 2001
Point Break," Very different remake of the 1991 movie of the same name.
","My wife and I saw this on Blu-ray from our public library. It is a remake of sorts of the 1991 movie with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze but it gets to its conclusion in a quite different sequence of events.The first thing I want to say about this version, especially on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are great. They used real experts in the various stunts and went to exotic, picturesque locations to film the stunts. The sound surrounds you as it should and the deep bass in certain scenes literally shakes you if your sound system has a really good powered subwoofer. So, even if a viewer doesn't particularly care for the story the visuals and sound are bound to please most viewers.So, what is the story here? Australian actor Luke Bracey plays Utah, so named because he is part Ute Indian. He is a thrill seeker and as the movie opens we see him and his buddy doing some extreme motocross riding across hills in a badlands area. But his buddy loses it, Utah reevaluates his life, and seven years later we see him training to be an FBI agent, after finishing high school and also getting a college degree.A series of seemingly unrelated crimes get Utah's attention and as a trainee approaches his superior, he thinks he knows what is going on and that they are connected. It involves some extreme sportsmen attempting to achieve 8 tasks that are thought to be impossible, as a way to achieve a higher plane of existence. But their quest is misguided in that they break laws and if innocent people die that is just part of their quest.We find that the leader of this effort, which involves 3 others, is Edgar Ram√≠rez as Bodhi. Utah's approach is to infiltrate the group, gain their respect and trust, then arrest them to stop the crimes.Eye-candy is added by South African actress Teresa Palmer as Samsara, one of the group, who looks so good in a skimpy bikini that the screen of my TV almost melted. Her role isn't really necessary but it does provide a spice of sorts.Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing.SPOILERS: In the original at his last encounter with Utah, Bodhi does his last stunt and disappears, presumed to have died. In this version, surfing a giant wave at sea, Bodhi disappears, presumed to have died. Utah is fast-tracked to get his official FBI designation.",Null,0,2,28 May 2016
The Fifth Element," Set in year 2214, over-the-top Sci-Fi fun, I found it totally enjoyable.
","My wife and I fall in the 'over-45' category and we both really enjoyed this film. REALLY ENJOYED!!! I give it a strong 8 of 10. Bruce Willis is perfect for the laid-back air-Taxi driver and Milla Jovovich gave a perfect performance as the alien. CAUTION - MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS BELOW.The movie starts in the year 1914, in Egypt, and we learn about the existence of a 'Fifth element' to go along with the other four - wind, fire, earth, and water. The grotesque but friendly aliens take the elements and vow to return with them in 300 years when there will be danger.Cut to NYC in 2214. Vehicular traffic now travels in all 3 dimensions. Apartments resemble large railway sleeper compartments with a stove and fridge. The aliens with the 5th element are returning to Earth when they are shot down by bad guys. Only a 'hand' survives. The DNA shows that it is a complex but 'perfect' creature. So they put it into their 'people reconstructor' and 'voila', a perfect and nude Milla appears as the 'supreme being.'  She can't talk or read yet, but learns at lightning speed and eventually tells them where the 5 elements are.Intergalactic, light-speed travel and a performance by the 'diva' finally leads to the elements. Of course the ugly, bad-guy aliens are after them too so there is lots of shooting and a number of exlosions. but the good guys prevail.The climax of the movie is back in Egypt, with a giant fireball heading directly to destroy the Earth. Milla is almost dead and they need her to save humanity. The way the film portrayed the 'activation' of the 5 elements was really fine and touching special effects. And, all along, the 5th element represented 'love', and when it was expressed the world was saved.Explained this way it sounds trite. But the movie was filled with so many fine special effects with really great 5.1 Digital Dolby soundtrack on DVD that as a whole it is very entertaining. 'Over-the-top' for sure, but that was its intent. We are not to take it seriously as we might have some of the other 'destruction' movies. This one is more in the vein of 'Men in Black', but even a bit more over-the-top.  One of the best tracks available to demo surround sound with powered subwoofer. A really, really powerful and gripping soundtrack.  But, watched on an ordinary sound system, or TV speakers, you lose at least half of the film's impact. Definitely made for 'home theater.'",Null,1,2,9 October 2000
Black Book," Set in 1940s Holland during German occupation.
","The movie actually begins in 1956 when a bus of tourists pull up to a community in Israel. One of the tourists, a lady, wanders over to the school and takes a flash photo. The teacher begins to admonish her for disturbing her lesson, then they recognize each other, having been in Holland together during the 1940s when Nazi Germany was carrying on operations to round up and dispose of Jews.Carice van Houten is the lead character Rachel, who takes on the name of Ellis and lightens her hair to avoid being recognized as a Jew. She is the teacher in Israel in 1956. The movie is mostly her story and how she gets to that point in her life. There is a 'black book' but in the movie we don't come across it until the very end.This is a very well told story, hard to watch at points because of the depiction of the German mistreatment of the Jews. A key character is Sebastian Koch as German officer Ludwig M√ºntze who, through a relationship he develops with Ellis turns his focus towards sympathy towards the Jews. We watched it with old friends who have a reputation for falling asleep during the second half of movies. neither of them even came close to falling asleep, and that is about the highest compliment I can give this movie. It holds your attention all the way.SPOILERS: The targets were the wealthy Jews in Holland, a trusted lawyer would arrange for their passage to Belgium, but they really were being set up for a massacre, and after killing all of them, stole all their money, gold bars, and other valuables. Rachel/Ellis managed to escape by diving into the water and went undetected. At the end, after her lover M√ºntze was executed for being a sympathizer and traitor, she found the black book that the lawyer kept, revealing all the conspirators, and she took all the recovered loot to build the center in Israel where she is teaching in 1956.",Null,2,5,5 February 2008
127 Hours," The true story of the hiker who got trapped by a boulder for 127 hours in Canyonlands N.P.
","Back around 16 or 17 years ago we took a driving trip into Utah, the area around Moab, and that included a brief visit to Canyonlands National Park, where this event happened, and where the movie was filmed. Canyonlands has a rich history, and has been used for such movies as 'Thelma and Louise' and 'Mission Impossible 2'. So from that aspect it was good to re-visit Canyonlands, if only through film.James Franco is Aron Ralston, who on weekends loves to take off in the middle of the night, drive to a location, and at daybreak head out on his off-road bicycle and his wits. On this fateful day he doesn't tell anyone where he is going, as a result no one knows to look for him when he gets trapped.How do you make a 90-minute movie of a guy trapped in a crevice? Basically by showing him trying to chip away the boulder, trying to rig up a pulley system, trying to get water to survive, and making short videos which also contained his 'goodbye' to the world, for he figured he would die there. He didn't.The movie also uses a number of flashbacks, many back to his youth.The movie was nominated for Oscars in a number of categories, including best actor, but didn't win any. It is a well-made movie, Franco is better than he has been in prior roles. As I watched it I kept thinking back to Hanks' 'Cast Away'. There is always something fascinating about watching survival, when you know it really happened.SPOILERS: When he tumbles into a narrow crevice with a small boulder, it becomes wedged in a way to pin his right arm. No amount of effort could budge it. Finally, after about 5 days his only choice was die there or cut off his arm between the wrist and the elbow. Thanks to a 15-second skip feature on my BD player I didn't have to watch as he cut. As history tells us, he made it to safety with the help of some hikers, and today with a prosthetic continues to hike, climb, explore.",Null,0,2,7 May 2011
Pirate Radio," It was it 1960s, and pirate radio stations on boats captured the interest of rock and roll fans.
","'Pirate' radio stations has a long and interesting history. It seems that as long as there has been regulation there have been broadcasts operating outside the law and these are generally referred to as pirate radio broadcasts. Sometimes they are operating legally where they broadcast, but reception can be illegal in the country they are heard.This very funny and entertaining movie is about a particular pirate radio boat in the North Sea in the mid-1960s. Seems England has limited normal radio stations to a very small time of broadcasting rock and roll music, relatively new to them. So the pirate radio station gets a crew of 6 or 8 DJs, plus a few other staff, and via 3-hour shifts broadcast 24 hours a day. This pits them against the English politicians who are desperately seeking a way to shut them down, trying to find a loophole since the broadcasts are not illegal.Philip Seymour Hoffman is arguably the star of the movie as The Count, one of the DJs. But Bill Nighy is also very good as Quentin who seems to be the station manager and tries to keep some semblance of order on the ship. The thread of a story alone would make a rather brief movie, so much of the running time is loaded with pretty much stand-alone episodes of the silly things the group would do to pass time on the ship.MAJOR SPOILERS: In the end they were victims of their own ship. There was an explosion at night in the engine compartment and the ship began to sink. As it began to look grim for all of them, and morning broke, they looked out and saw dozens of small and medium sized boats, filled with fans, coming to their rescue after hearing coordinates broadcast when they first got into trouble.

"I Love You, Man"," Definitely 'better than it should be' type of movie.
","The premise of this movie is pretty silly. A young man is getting married and those around him think it is strange that he has no men friends. So most of the plot involves his sometimes-dicey attempts at making male friends, and getting a 'best friend' to serve as his beat man.Paul Rudd makes this a good movie. He is great as Peter Klaven, a real estate guy who also happens to be listing Lou Farrigno's 4-$Million house for sale.Also good is Rashida Jones as Zooey, the girl Peter is going to marry. Throughout the movie her looks and mannerisms reminded me of a very young Shirley McLaine, and that is a compliment.Most of the comic tension is provided by Jason Segel as Sydney Fife, someone Peter happens to meet, and soon they appear to becoming best buds. But not everything Syndey does, or says, is helpful. Adding eye candy is Jaime Pressly as Denise, who is married to Jon Favreau as Barry, and their relationship is good for a number of laughs.

","This is a comment on the home DVD version of Blade.  For its type of action/shooting/blood and gore movie, I give it 9 of 10.  But those who don't like this type of movie, skip it quick!!First let me state that the DVD's picture and soundtrack are very close to the best there is.  Surround sound is used just as it should be, and the explosions sound about as real as any I've heard on DVD.  It really gives your subwoofer a workout.  The DVD is worth a watch just for the sound!Blade is a comic book story put to life.  Wesley Snipes is just perfect in his role as Blade, the half-vampire fighting evil and trying to eradicate all vampires. The effects are creative and the whole 110 minutes of the movie will grip you.  Very exciting!However, there is a lot of blood and gore, and I found myself turning away a few times.

Creed," Thirty years after Apollo Creed died in the ring his son Adonis Creek makes his mark.
","Watched this movie at home on DVD from my local public library. Basic rental DVD, movie only, no extras. My wife only watched the first 1/3 of it, she isn't much into boxing movies.It was 30 years earlier, in 1985's Rocky IV, that Apollo Creed died in the ring at the fists of a Russian fighter. Now in 2015 that is a distant memory for Rocky Balboa (Stallone) as he is enjoying retirement in Philadelphia.The movie actually starts some 20 years earlier, we see a boy named Adonis frequently getting in trouble at school, almost always fighting and getting the best of larger boys. It seems he was born to fight. We soon figure out Adonis, often called Don, is the out-of-wedlock child of Apollo Creed, born right after his dad died so he never got to meet him. But Creed's wife, Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, takes in the boy and raises him. When the story cuts again to present time we see Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Johnson (Creed will come later) fighting in Mexico most weekends, winning all his fights and earning some extra money. But weekdays he has a white collar office job in San Diego, and in fact is being promoted. But he quits instead, he wants to give his fighting career full attention.He travels to Philadelphia and looks up Rocky. He talks Rocky into not only training him but also let him live with him. Naturally a love interest must enter, it is pretty Tessa Thompson as budding singer Bianca.The movie could have become very trite and syrupy but it doesn't. It presents a plausible fictional story and we see Rocky training a young man who becomes almost family to him, and caring about him like his own son.Training is rushed to take advantage of a quick title fight before the fighter has to go off to jail for assault. That part is played by real British champion fighter Tony Bellew as 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan.Overall a very good movie.SPOILERS for my own recollection - The title fight is held, no one gave Adonis much of a chance to even go beyond 2 or 3 rounds, but he fights bravely and even knocks the champ down, almost for a ten-count. But in the end Adonis loses the fight by a split decision and the champ whispers in his ear that he is the future of their division.",Null,0,1,10 May 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Good movie, with very dark themes, explaining the origin of Wolverine.
","With the success of the X-Men movies this one is a sort of prequel. It focuses on how Wolverine came about, since he is perhaps the most popular of the mutants in the X-Men series.It starts in the 1800s, when Logan was a young boy a traumatic circumstance triggered his mutant abilities. It was manifest as bone-like protrusions that came out of his knuckles.Then in a rather brief sequence we see Logan and his brother Victor as young adults fighting in various wars, getting wounded but always healing. It is curious, I must note, that they aged until they were adults, but then quit aging. So with this movie set in modern times they look about 40 but are in fact closer to 200 years old.Hugh Jackman is of course Logan / Wolverine. Liev Schreiber is his brother Victor Creed. The other key character is Danny Huston as William Stryker, a role played by much older Brian Cox in X-2.The story goes on to show how Logan was given an experimental treatment whereby an exotic metal went into his body to make him indestructible, and his bony protrusions were replaced by the metal blades.The themes in the movie are very dark, both Logan and Victor go on killing sprees. But the movie ends in a way to set the stage for what became the X-Men movies already out.",Null,3,5,29 September 2009
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," 'Five days is too short, and we go to press in eleven!' Andie's assignment
","I was sure this would NOT be a movie I enjoyed, but rented the DVD for my wife.  In the end, even though it leaves no lasting impression, like a caffiene-free diet soda, watching Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey play their respective roles was thoroughly enjoyable. She is cute as a button, and he is one of the best and natural young men acting today. The 112 minutes never became boring and was a pleasure to watch on this rainy afternoon.some SPOILERS follow, read further only at your risk of future disappointment.Andie (Hudson) is a writer for one of those women's magazines that specialize in such things as plastic surgery, jewelry, weight loss, and how to NOT lose a man. She comes up with the idea that she will get some guy to fall for her, and making all the classic mistakes drive him away in 10 days or less, then write about it as an aid to single women. The problem starts when the guy (Matthew) is on an opposite mission -- meet a girl and make her fall in love with him in 10 days so that he can get the plum diamond advertising assignment.So they begin. Some of the things she does -- make him get her a soda near the end of a Knicks championship playoff game so he misses the final winning shot. Take him to a 'Chick Flick Marathon', then when he actually is enjoying himself picks a fight for him with the big guy behind them. For dinner at his place she brings a box of stuffed animals and other things to decorate his place for her, then at dinner says, regarding the lambchops, 'I wish I ate meat.' During a seduction she decides to name his 'member' Princess Sophia, which turns him off. Brought him a dog to his office, and called him 'Bennie Winnie'. Left most of 17 phone messages one day, each a few minutes apart. Made a 'family album' showing how their kids might look.The breakthrough came when at a fake therapy session, Andie's friend posing as the therapist suggests they spend a weekend at his family's home. They do, she loves his family, mom hugs her and says 'please don't hurt my boy.' But at the big diamond extravaganza she finds out about the 'bet', he finds out about the 'article', and in a great funny scene with Marvin Hamlish they do an impropmtu duet 'You're So Vain', then spilt up outside.Later, when he reads her article, he comes to realize how she really feels, and goes to find her. She has quit her job and is headed to D.C., and, in a great little chase scene he rides his Triumph through NYC, splitting lanes, to find her in her cab.  They pull off, they make up, and all's well that ends well.Cute story, cute actors, no lasting impressions, but a good diversion for someone wanting to see a fun movie.",Null,0,1,9 July 2003
That Thing You Do!," Nostalgic look back at the 1960s, when I was a beginning college student.
","I had seen this movie a number of years ago but didn't remember much about it, so I saw it again today on DVD from my public library. I was a college Freshman in 1963/64, when the Beatles were first gaining popularity on this side of the pond, and this movie fairly accurately recreates that period, the way people dressed, and how teenagers reacted when seeing their pop idols live in concert.The story grabs hold of a theme I am very fond of pondering, both in real life and in fiction stories. That theme is the relative randomness of our lives, the things that happen, and then how we react to those random events. If we look at random events in our own lives, we can see how certain unexpected things shaped who we are today.In this movie a group of high school friends like to make music, one of them writes songs and is the featured singer. He has written 'That Thing You Do' and they are about to perform it in a local small-potatoes contest. But the drummer, horsing around by showing the bass player how to jump over parking meters, falls and breaks his arm right before the contest.Now that is the 'random event', and it leads them to ask another guy in town, who is a good drummer, to sit in for that one gig, so that they will still have a chance to win the competition. Then comes the rest of the influence of that 'random event', the drummer own his own (this is important) decides to beat out a much faster tempo. It is this faster tempo that makes 'That Thing You Do' a hit with the audience, attracts the attention of an agent, gets them a record, gets them a contract, puts them on tour, and has their hit rise towards the top of the charts.If their original drummer had not broken his arm, they would have just remained an ordinary band. Well as the story progresses they experience all the growing pains of sudden fame, and conflicting priorities among the members of the group. Tom Hanks directed, has a part as a record label agent, and he even wrote many of the songs. Tom Everett Scott who was in his mid-20s is very good as the replacement drummer, Guy Patterson. Liv Tyler, still a teenager was Faye Dolan who ended up traveling with the band. Her boyfriend was Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy who wrote the song and sang lead vocals. Steve Zahn was the crazy member Lenny, and Ethan Embry, also a teenager, was T. B. Player the unreliable bass player. Another teenager just starting her career was Charlize Theron as Tina in a fairly small part, as a flaky girlfriend who dumps Guy after an appointment with a handsome dentist. Plus young Giovanni Ribisi as Chad , the original drummer who breaks his arm.All in all a fairly pleasant movie.",Null,4,6,17 December 2012
Alexander," Epic story of Alexander that comes across as mostly muddled.
","On the one hand, I admire the effort to make one movie of the life of Alexander the Great. On the other hand, it is seemingly one conquest after another, featuring very bloody battles, and at almost 3 hours takes great effort to remain interested. I am not a student of history, more of an observer of history, and from what I can gather from a bit of 'net surfing, the story depicted here is pretty accurate. However, I believe I would have been more interested in a movie based on one very interesting part of his life, rather than all of it.The technique used for telling the story requires various flashbacks, some 10 years earlier, some 9 years earlier, etc, which makes good viewing if you pay very close attention. However it doesn't always work.Anthony Hopkins was my favorite as Old Ptolemy, who we see at various times telling the story. In that sense the whole movie was a flashback of his story. One of my favorite Hopkins roles was as John Quincy Adams, former president, in the movie 'Amistad' (1997), where he delivers a fine, long monologue near the end on 'freedom.' Here in 'Alexander' he delivers several good monologues.I thought the acting was uniformly good. Colon Farrell as Alexander was young and fresh when he needed to be, and bordering on insane when he needed to be. Angelina Jolie was good as his scheming mother Olympias. Val Kilmer as his father, King Philip. Christopher Plummer as Aristotle, young Alexander's teacher.In a time when leaders fought and captured other countries because they could, bringing wealth home to share with others, Alexander is depicted as a leader who genuinely thought it would benefit the peoples of those other lands, to be ruled by him. He also was depicted as homosexual, perhaps encouraged by his father who told him as a young boy that women cannot be trusted, only fellow men. But he married to have an heir, a son who was born only after his death. He was 33.",Null,0,0,5 September 2005
Hot Fuzz," Very different, very entertaining British dark comedy.
","Simon Pegg is perfect as Nicholas Angel, highly trained and perhaps over-achieving London Police Officer. He has wanted to be an officer ever since he can remember, and his only fault seems to be making his fellow officers look bad. So he gets promoted and transferred to the sleepy country town, Sandford. He doesn't want to leave London, but has no choice.In Sandford he finds a town that annually gets 'best town' awards, and a police chief that never gets too excited by a little law-breaking, like underage drinking or his son, a fellow officer, driving while drunk. But as Angel arrives, townspeople suddenly begin to die, in apparent accidents. Everyone but he thinks they are just unfortunate accidents.The most of the movie is Angel trying to track down the reasons for the deaths, all of which seem connected in some way. When he thinks he has finally figured it out, he finds that he is dead wrong.A good, entertaining, different British dark comedy.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: It turns out that Angel was correct, the deaths were indeed murders, but not for the reason he suspected -- real estate deals and greed. It turns out that all the town's officials, chief, vicar, etc were in a secret clique, and wear black hooded cloaks, and simply got rid of people they deemed not good for Sandford's image by killing them and making it look like an accident. Or simply dumping them to die in the church catacombs. Eventually London wants him back, but he stays in Sandford, a hero.",Null,1,2,24 August 2007
The Mummy," A visually great but totally stupid movie, a solid '5' of '10' rating.
","'The Mummy' has a fine cast and excellent photography.  But it is too silly to be a true adventure movie, like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and not witty enough to be a good comedy.  It was fun to watch for the first half-hour but then I got so bored I started answering email during the movie. 
Synopsis - just one big yawn!!",Null,0,3,20 May 2000
Constantine," Reeves in a decent comic book turned movie.
","I must admit that I am totally unfamiliar with the comic book that inspired this movie. However, I found it enjoyable in a Sci-Fi, supernatural way. Reeves plays Constantine with the same demeanor that he played Neo in 'Matrix' after he figured out that his power was only limited by his imagination. Here, as John Constantine, he is the best fighter of evil spirits. When a priest is not successful exorcising an evil spirit, they call in John Constantine. He has no fear, he understands the evil spirits, because he was once among them.John Constantine had died briefly in a state of mortal sin which, according to Catholic theology, sends him straight to Hell. But he didn't stay dead, it was one of those near death experiences, but he still knew that he was eventually going to end up there, and he devoted the rest of his years to keeping the evil spirits away.Rachel Weisz plays Angela Dodson/Isabel Dodson, Djimon Hounsou plays Midnite, Pruitt Taylor Vince is good as Father Hennessy, and versatile Peter Stormare is Satan . I can't say that, when the movie was over, I understood everything. But the visuals are so good, it made the movie a worthwhile watch for me.My wife just thought it was a bit strange.",Null,3,5,8 August 2005
The Natural," Allegory about life, a good '8' of 10 film on a baseball theme.
","SPOILERS - One of the more puzzling aspects of 'The Natural' is the absence of Darren McGavin from the credits, since his character is the second most important in the whole story. Right before it came on AMC last night, the introduction said that it is an allegory, so I suppose my review would not be complete without my interpretation of that.We first see that Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a 'natural' in baseball, grows up at age 20 to be a pitching phenom, and on a train stop as he was going forward with his dream of 'I want to walk down the street and have people say 'he was the best ever'', in a dare and a bet he strikes out the 'Whammer' (Babe Ruth?) in 3 pitches. A lady (Barbara Hershey) seems attracted to him, but when he restates that he only wants to 'be recognized as the best ever', she shoots him, in the side, and we learn later that she threw herself off a high place onto the street below, dead. We find out much later that McGavin's character had lost $100,000 on that wager, 'and I took care of him.'  Meaning, he was the one who hired the Hershey character to shoot Hobbs. Hobbs only realizes that at the finale, when he has to choose whether to try and win the game, or give in to McGavin's attempt to fix the game.Meanwhile, back at the beginning, Hobbs was out of baseball 16 years, recovering from his gunshot, and dealing with his infatuation with the temptress known as 'fame.' He is recruited as a 35-yr-old rookie, almost never gets into a game, and finally using his bat carved from the old lightning-struck tree, becomes a batting phenom, the best hitter they ever saw. When he starts fooling around with temptress Kim Basinger, he suddenly cannot hit anymore. When he sees Glen Close again, he suddenly becomes a hitting machine again. He ultimately wins the big playoff game, sending the bad guys reeling.At one point, Close's character tells Hobbs, 'I believe we have two lives, the one we learn with, and the one we live with.' Hobbs was a victim of the want of 'fame', so much so it de-railed his career. Only after he learned to play baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it did he achieve the success he wanted, but 'fame' was no longer a need. It is almost the same theme in 'Big', where Hanks' character is a success because he remains a kid, enjoying what he is doing, while all the others just want to run a business and make a buck. Good movie, Redford is always good. The baseball sequences are fairly well done, and the moral is positive. I think many who enjoyed Costner's 'For Love of the Game' would also enjoy 'The Natural.'",Null,7,11,31 December 2001
The Others," Kidman is good, but overall I was mostly disappointed in this film.
","Upon release this film, 'The Others', received quite a bit of favorable press. Plus, the IMDb ratings today are pretty darned high. I rented the DVD upon release yesterday, watched it, and came away fairly disappointed. Kidman is good, but often the acting and dialog made me laugh, it often seemed to be more a borderline comedy than a horror or suspense movie. Nowhere near as good or suspenseful as recent films like 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Unbreakable.'SPOILERS - DO NOT READ IF YOU'VE YET TO SEE THE FILM -- As the movie unfolds, and fairly deliberately at that, we come to see that Kidman is a fairly normal, if overly cautious, mother in 1945 England. Her children suffer a strange illness and must not be exposed to any strong light, especially not direct sunlight. She needs domestic workers and three show up, formerly worked there. Mom starts to hear noises that can't be explained. Or someone playing the piano. Then, all the curtains disappear. Turns out she and the kids are dead, as well as the three workers. The sounds they occasionally hear are the real people coming to view the property which is for sale. She loves her children, but had suffocated them with pillows. Her death was not explained. A very 'atmospheric' film, but to me not very suspenseful or frightening. And in the end, the story was not a particularly interesting one. I am at a loss for all the 8s, 9s, and 10s this film has been given.  A rating of 6 or 7 seems about right to me.",Null,0,1,15 May 2002
Rise of the Guardians," The story of how Jack became Jack Frost and the newest guardian.
","I just got around to seeing this movie, as my public library just added it to their BluRay collection. The video and sound are great, and has selected very deep bass tones where appropriate, putting a powered subwoofer to good display. Also the animation comes very close to seeming real, all in all a very well done animated movie. One of the better ones in recent years.The guardians are the ones who watch over the good of the children, like Santa, Tooth Fairy, Sandman (who gives children pleasant dreams), and Easter Bunny. In this movie their names are simply North, Tooth, Sandy, and Bunny. But as the movie opens we see a boy floating to the surface of a frozen pond, his name is Jack and he soon finds that he is in fact Jack Frost. He is the one who makes 'snow days' possible for the school children.But there is an evil force in this story, it is Pitch Black who wants to take control of the children, and instead of nice dreams make them have nightmares. Defeating him and also getting Jack Frost legitimate, where children believe in him like they do the others, is part of the story arc.My wife abandoned it after 30 minutes, it isn't her kind of entertainment. But I found the whole movie very entertaining with a good story and a good resolution.Main voice actors are Chris Pine as Jack Frost, Alec Baldwin as North, Jude Law as Pitch, Isla Fisher as Tooth, Hugh Jackman as Bunny. Sandy could not make any sounds so he didn't have a voice!",Null,1,1,19 October 2014
Troy," 'Honor the Gods, love your woman, and defend your country (Troy).' Hector
","Not too many months ago I watched 'Helen of Troy' which shares the mythical story with this movie, 'Troy.' Both are long, at almost 3 hours, and both are done in a grand style. This one appears to have spent more money, and has a greater number of 'name' actors. I liked both about equally.Whether one likes a movie of this sort depends on why you take time to watch it. If you want a lesson in Greek Mythology, it is better to read some books. If you want to be entertained with good acting, and realistically bloody battle scenes that are quite drawn out, then watching 'Troy' will do it for you. There's nothing new here, the story remains basically unchanged, the presentation is unique.Brian Cox is really good as Agamemnon of Sparta, who hungers for more power and agrees to attack Troy not so much to get his brother's stolen wife Helen back, but to expand his power base. The biggest name of this movie of course is Brad Pitt as the fierce warrior Achilles. I like Pitt as an actor, but I didn't really think much of his role here. He played Achilles with some sympathy, as the scene where he cared for the Trojan girl after the soldiers had been inappropriately man handling her.Helen was played by a relatively new face, Diane Kruger who reportedly put on a few pounds for this role to look more in character for a beauty of that era. I thought she was a very good Helen. Eric Bana was good as Hector the prince of Troy, who fought bravely before being defeated by Achilles. Orlando Bloom played Paris, the cowardly younger brother of Hector who stole Helen and brought on the war. However, near the end when Achilles was fighting a couple of Trojans inside the city walls, while Troy burned, it was Paris' arrow that pierced the heel of Achilles.This movie did not have to be so long. The battles were shown in all the gory detail possible, and there were fairly long scenes where not much was happening. Still, for fans of the genre, a worthwhile movie.",Null,2,10,11 January 2005
Dead Poets Society," Enlightenment encounters discipline and tradition.
","I saw this movie a couple of times over the years, it made an indelible memory. Especially the last scene where each boy, in turn, stood on his desk, defying orders from the old headmaster. Now I was able to watch it again on Netflix streaming movies.This certainly is one of our landmark movies. Set in 1959 former student at the elite private boys high school, Robin Williams as John Keating, returns to teach. Classroom scenes focus on his poetry class. We find out from his photo in the old yearbook that he was a rebel of sorts, willing 'to try anything', and perhaps it is a mystery why the staid old school, valuing discipline and tradition, hired him. Keating's main focus is to get the young boys (all the actors were in fact teenagers during filming) to learn to think for themselves. Carpe diem. Seize the day. But that invariably runs up against school administration and some of the parents. When Keating was a student he was a member of an unofficial club 'Dead Poets Society.' Upon learning about this a group of his students on their own reestablish this club.The tragic figure is Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry with a strict father who was determined his son would become a doctor. But his son really want to act and couldn't deal with what he was being forced to do.A very young looking Ethan Hawke is shy Todd Anderson. And a very young Josh Charles who is still acting in TV, he was Will in 'The Good Wife.'Fine movie with no easy answers but we are each encouraged to seize the day in our own lives. Sadly Robin Williams took his own life in 2014 at age 63.",Null,0,0,28 September 2017
Just Go with It," Pleasantly surprised that it is as entertaining as it is.
","Pretty bad approach for educated professionals, Adam Sandler is well-off L.A. plastic surgeon Danny Maccabee who almost got married when he was young, and didn't, but kept wearing the wedding band. He found that it helped him have a series of short-term relationships and one-night stands, well into his 40s. But then he meets someone that really rings his bell, it is love at first sight, and for the first time in his adult life wants this relationship to work long-term. It is Andy Roddick's real-life wife, 20-something Brooklyn Decker as Palmer. But when Palmer sees his ring, instead of telling the truth, and this is where the 'bad approach' comes in, he tells her he is married but about to divorce. He has his assistant, Jennifer Aniston as Katherine, pretend to be his wife, and pretend her name is Devlin. Who also happens to have 2 kids.All this sets up a series of bargains and bribes to Katherine and the kids, Danny seems willing to spend any amount of money on the ruse, to keep Palmer in his good graces. And this has them end up in Hawaii where the real Devlin from Kathernie's past, Nicole Kidman as Devlin Adams, creates a series of additional ruses. The whole escapade in Hawaii walks the fine line between being a totally stupid slapstick, and a fairly entertaining story. Fortunately it is closer to the latter, and we found ourselves laughing quite often.SPOILERS: This kind of comedy usually has antagonists ending up together and that is what happens. Danny and Katherine finally realize that they love each other and just when Danny has successfully snared Palmer, he abandons the wedding and goes to Katherine, they kiss, and are destined to end up happily ever after.",Null,2,4,15 June 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A profile of Ennis Del Mar, born in the wrong era to openly express his feelings for another man.
","I first saw this movie about 6 years ago, since then it has come under very much scrutiny from critics and fans alike. There are any number of interpretations of everything that happens in the story, and there are over 2300 user reviews right here on the IMDb. So I will not pretend to add anything new, however I am choosing to look at the story almost exclusively from the character that Heath Ledger plays so well, Ennis Del Mar. The following comments reflect my own points of view and I make no claims that anyone else should embrace them.The story starts in 1963 when Ennis is around 19 or 20. He is just a poor young cowboy looking for some summer work and he becomes one of a two-person team to look after and protect a large herd of sheep grazing on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. Ennis is shy and hardly ever says more than the minimum, but he is engaged to a nice young lady and they plan to marry in the fall.The other young cowboy is Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. Jack was occupying the tent and cooking, and Ennis would pitch a small tent and sleep among the sheep, riding back to the camp every afternoon to eat. One fateful afternoon it was beginning to get dark before Ennis left, so he decided to sleep near the camp fire under a blanket. But even in the summer it gets very cold at elevation, and on this night Jack eventually talked a shivering Ennis into the tent. Jack made a move, pulling Ennis' arm over him where Ennis discovered Jack in an aroused state. Initially recoiling in great surprise, soon Ennis and Jack consummated their new friendship.It is important to keep in mind this is a work of fiction, so as a viewer we are required to quickly evaluate plausibility. From my vantage point, it is ONLY plausible if Ennis is homosexual deep to his core, otherwise he would have pulled away and rejected Jack's advances. He could not have 'become homosexual' that night in the tent. (We know from later scenes that Jack was indeed homosexual and regularly sought other men, and even male prostitutes when that was his only option.)So this created a great conundrum for Ennis, he knew from some childhood experiences and guidance from his father, being known to be homosexual will probably get you killed in short order. So when the summer was over and Jack went away, even though Ennis was in deep sorrow he went ahead with his marriage. Over the years he had two daughters to whom he showed much fatherly affection. But he never really loved his wife, he performed his 'husbandly duty' but his thoughts were always with Jack, and looking forward to their next meeting, which might have been weeks or might have been years.The story ends around 1983, and we see a scene of his oldest daughter, Alma Jr. talking to Ennis about her upcoming marriage. But Ennis is a broken man. He is long divorced, his wife knowing fully that he and Jack weren't really going fishing on all those trips over the years. Jack has died, perhaps from injury when a tire exploded as Jack's wife Lureen told him over the phone, or perhaps at the hands of several men who beat him to death, as we see in what appears to be a dream scene. Ennis is not like Jack, looking for another man, and he has no interest in looking for another wife. He was born in a time when he could not be who he really was, and he wasn't successful at pretending to be someone else.Ennis's last words in the film are 'Jack, I swear' as he is holding the old bloody shirt that had been hanging in Jack's closet for some years. It was the only thing he had left that he could touch and smell. There has been considerable discussion of what that phrase meant, but to me it is very clear. That phrase was used regularly where I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. It was always used in a sense of exasperation, an all-encompassing phrase with a sigh which sums up everything and yet nothing of what might have just happened. For Ennis it was the unfortunate or fortunate, depending on how one wants to look at it, meeting of Jack which made his life everything it is, yet with nothing at all now to hold onto.Randy Quaid is good as the sheep herding boss, Joe Aguirre. He observed the two men through high-powered binoculars, he knew what was going on. Michelle Williams is good as Ennis' wife Alma. Anne Hathaway is good as Lureen Newsome .",Null,3,4,29 May 2012
Chicken Run," A marvelous and entertaining 'clay-mation' film for young and old alike.
","For the theme of 'Chicken Run' think 'Nazi prison camp' and films like 'Great Escape' and 'Stalag 17.' The chickens are prisoners in the chicken farm, and all but one of them gives no thought to the fact that as soon as a hen quits laying eggs, she will become dinner for the owners.But 'Ginger' is different. She sees what is going on, and is constantly trying to devise escape plans. Each time she gets caught, she gets thrown into the coal bin, solitary confinement, then back to the other chickens.Some mild SPOILERS follow. The film takes a dramatic new direction when a young rooster, voiced by Mel Gibson, 'flies' into the chicken yard. believing he really can teach all of them how to fly, they all go into a training program. Meanwhile, the owners get tired of their meager profits from eggs, and buy a humongous machine to make 'chicken pies.'Aside from Mel Gibson, all the voices are by accomplished British actors, and are all just perfect. The British accents, and the fine British humor in the script, make this a totally enjoyable film. The 'chase' scene inside the pie-making machine, and the high level of action in the 'airplane' scene are just great.I have the DVD. Aside from the expected great picture and surround sound, the 'extras' are quite entertaining. Especially the 'making of' which shows exactly how the clay-mation is done. Example - during character dialog, a different head is substituted for each successive frame to accomplish the correct mouth shapes. Also, an animator normally turns out 60 frames, or 2 1/2 seconds, of animation daily.I rate this '8' of 10, which is about the highest I give for an animated film which is also how I rate 'A Bug's Life' and 'Toy Story 2'.",Null,1,1,26 November 2000
Orphan," Pretty interesting movie, a cut above your usual horror flick. I like it!
","The story involves a 30-something couple who have a normal son and a young daughter who is deaf. As the story unfolds we find out by bits and pieces that the wife has had a drinking problem, and that was probably responsible for their third child being stillborn. She also apparently lost a college level music teaching job because of her drinking problem, but she appears to be dry for good.They decide they want another child and after much consideration and counseling decide to visit the orphanage to find another daughter via adoption. While the husband is aimlessly wandering around the building he comes upon a 9-year-old girl who is very personable and is a fine artist. She is from Russia, the husband and wife both like her, and after a few weeks to process the adoption the girl goes home with them, the newest member of their family.But things are anything but smooth, both at home and at school. The parents begin to wander if they made a big mistake with this girl.Vera Farmiga, sort of an 'everywomen' actress, is the mother, Kate Coleman. Peter Sarsgaard, who seems to be showing up everywhere, is the father, John Coleman. Although they never discuss his occupation he appears to be a successful architect and they live in a nice community in Connecticut.The adopted girl is played expertly by American actress Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther. She turned 11 during the filming. She adopts a slight Russian accent that seems believable for a young girl who has been in the States for a few years.Other key characters are veteran CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail. Jimmy Bennett is the son, Daniel. And cute little Aryana Engineer is the deaf daughter, Max (Maxine).The developments in the story are for the most part not predictable, and kept us guessing most of the time. There were a few parts that weren't very credible, but overall a worthwhile movie.MAJOR SPOILERS: As things happen, and as the parents begin looking into Esther's past, they see a pattern. While she is never actually caught doing anything wrong, she always seems to be present when certain bad things happen. A fire, a broken leg, a death. So when they finally get to her origin they find out she is not a 9-year-old girl, but in fact a 30-something with a type of dwarfism that makes her look young. She also escaped from an institution and is (as we already knew) dangerous. In her adopted family she was out to destroy all the others and have the dad for herself. In an eerie scene near the end, she puts on makeup and dresses like an adult, and tries to seduce him. The final scene is outside, in the snow, between Esther and the mom, they break through the ice into the pond, Esther with a knife, but mom manages a kick to the head that sends Esther, dead or unconscious, down to the bottom. But dad was already dead. Note: In an alternate ending on the DVD, Esther didn't die but walked out of the house dressed again as a young girl, as the police went in to hunt for a criminal.",Null,2,4,5 January 2010
About Time," Charming time-travel story, with elements of 'Groundhog Day.'
","I wasn't sure what to expect, I got the DVD from my public library and purposely avoided seeing the trailer, they usually reveal too much. So when Tim turned 21 and his dad pulled him aside, and told him the men of their family all are born with the ability to time-travel, it was a complete surprise to me.The time-travel has constraints, you can only travel to a prior time, one that you have lived and can now imagine. You simply go into a darkened closet or room, clinch your fists, close your eyes, and imagine the exact time you want to go back to. Later, clench your fists again and go back to the present.It has some elements of 'Groundhog Day' where Phil learns a bit more each day about how to snare the girl of his dreams. Here, when Tim makes an awkward and unsuccessful approach, all he has to do is go back a few minutes and try it over.Domhnall Gleeson is really good as Tim who, after he turns 21, goes to London to live and work as a lawyer. At one point his lawyer friend comments that Tim is really good, when it looks like he is sure to lose a case he somehow comes up with something to win. Time-travel, obviously, although they don't dwell on it.When in London he meets up with Rachel McAdams (one of my favorites) as American Mary, living and working in London as a 'reader' for a book publishing firm. His meeting her gets a bit complicated, as when he travels back to fix a different problem for a friend, thus missing the actual meeting time for Mary, has to devise a different way to gain her friendship, and eventual love.If simply described in writing the premise can sound a bit 'hokey' but in fact is very good and presents many meaningful and humorous situations. One is being able to visit dad, played well by Bill Nighy , to recreate some moments from when Tim was a child. Or to have some last moments with dad after he gets sick. The whole story spans perhaps 8 to 10 years, judging by the ages of the eventual children. The overarching message in the movie is to enjoy every day, and enjoy the people around you. The rest is fantasy, for entertainment, and it works very well.It was also nice seeing Lindsay Duncan again, playing Tim's mother. She was Ann Mayle in the 1990s mini-series 'A Year in Provence' which I enjoyed so much I have the DVD set.",Null,3,4,29 April 2014
Spotlight," Dramatization of journalists in Boston exposing the clerical sex abuse scandal.
","We saw this movie on DVD from our local public library. 'Spotlight' was the most recent Oscar winner for 'Best Picture.'It is important to keep in mind that the title 'Spotlight' refers to a group of 4 or 5 journalists in the Boston Globe newspaper office who go by that designation, they find and research difficult stories then report on them. Unlike a typical news report which may take a day or two to investigate, theirs may take months.The cast is super, no weak spots, but I will only mention one. It is early 2001 and the new top editor is Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron, coming to Boston from Miami. He was a true outsider for several reasons, not only had he never been to Boston, where there is a strong Catholic presence, he was Jewish. But he was a true newspaperman, he felt strongly that their job was to uncover and report the truth.So this hint of a story came up, a priest in the Boston Archdiocese being a pedophile, and having abused children. To Baron it seemed there was a deeper story there and he encouraged 'Spotlight' to dig into it. As it turns out this was not a new piece of information but partly because it seemed that the Archdiocese was all-powerful in Boston no one ever wanted to dig further.Along the investigative route the team came upon a former priest who had studied the issue on his own and estimated across the board, not just Boston, roughly 6% of priests are practicing some sort of sexual misbehavior. That would be about 90 among the 1500 Boston area priests.All of this was happening right before and right after our '9/11' attacks, and culminates in early 2002. When it was shown, using old unsealed documents, that Archbishop Law was a party to the covering up abuse, which included moving guilty priests to different Parishes, he resigned later that year.The movie has received generally very positive reception by the Catholic Church in general. One priest wrote: ' Every seminarian should see this movie. The USCCB should spend an evening watching it together and discussing it. The only disinfectant that will really lead to cleansing is the bright light of truth. The Archdiocese of Boston would never have reformed without the Globe stories. 'One Bishop wrote, 'All bishops and cardinals must see this film, because they must understand that it is reporting abuse that will save the Church. 'As a viewer and also a Catholic I must wonder, if the Jewish newspaperman had not gone into Boston when he did, would this have ever been exposed?",Null,1,2,29 May 2016
Terminator Salvation," I enjoyed the action as light entertainment, but I don't really know what was going on.
","The day after my wife and I saw this movie, on DVD, we were discussing it. We tried to make sense of the story but we couldn't. For example, why was John Connor's dad a teenager in the future when John was a 30-something adult? Maybe in a different movie he was sent to the future, but I suppose you need to have fairly intimate knowledge of all the Terminator stories to sort all that out.But ultimately we didn't worry about it. The movie is of course just light, action entertainment. Nothing is to be taken seriously. There is lots of action, and lots of special effects, mostly done very nicely. In general I like the roles Christian Bale creates, and here he is John Connor. Helena Bonham Carter is Dr. Serena Kogan. Anton Yelchin is Kyle Reese, who in fact is John Connor's biological father. John has to protect Kyle from the terminators otherwise John will never have existed, and the world will not be saved from the machines. Tense stuff!! BTW, Bryce Dallas Howard plays Kate Connor. I hadn't seen her in a while, and I found myself wondering if she had a nose job. Her nose seems narrower and more perfect than I remember it. Well, doesn't matter. (PS - I re-watched parts of her earlier movies, 'Lady in the Water' and 'The Village' and I believe I was wrong, her nose appears to be the same in all of those. My apologies, Bryce.)",Null,1,2,29 January 2010
Insomnia," One of the better movies to be released on DVD this year.
","In 'Insomnia' LAPD detective Will Dormer (from French, meaning 'to sleep') played by Al Pacino and his younger partner are sent to Sleepmute, Alaska during the summer to help solve the gruesome killing on a local teenager. For Dormer ('will sleep??') the perpetual daylight is a problem, he goes days without sleeping (thus the title, 'Insomnia') and besides just being tired, he starts to have visions, probably extremely short periods of blacking out.  In Dormer's back story we find out that an I.A. investigation back home looms as a threat to his career.  The story, acting, directing, cinematography, and the editing are all superb and this adds up to one of the more gripping movies I've seen recently. The critic Ebert has a very complete and accurate review.some SPOILERS follow, read further at your own risk of disappointment.Hillary Swank plays the young local Alaska detective, Ellie Burr (as in 'burrrr, it's cold', or 'burrrr, I don't like guys') who happens to be a big fan of Dormer's and has studied his most famous cases. Dormer shows the locals how to hone in on clues, to trap the killer. They find the dead girl's backpack, empty all the contents, re-hide it in the secluded cabin, and tell all the newsmedia that they are looking for her missing backpack, hoping the killer will go and retrieve it. The trap works, but an ill-times squeal on a megaphone startles him, he runs into the cabin, escapes through the floor into the fog by the lake shore.While in the fog Dormer sees a shadowy figure, shoots, it is his partner who was a threat to expose him back in L.A., for years earlier having planted blood of a dead 8-year-old in the apartment of the suspected killer.  Did he shoot his partner on purpose? Probably not, but as the man dies, he tells others it was the escaping suspect, to avoid suspicion, and hides his 'backup' gun. (Later, Burr remembers that Dormer carries a backup, and figures out it is missing, a key to piecing everything together.) But a call out of the blue is the 'suspect, the deceased's favorite author, Walter Finch, brilliantly played by Robin Williams, who saw what happened. And, he claims that his killing of the girl was an accident. He had a crush on her, she was laughing at him, he was trying to shut her up and it went too far. So he tries to negotiate an agreement that both of them can remain undiscovered for the killings each did by accident.The drama plays out very tautly, it kept me guessing to the very end. However, for closure both Dormer and Finch had to die in the chase and shoot out at the end. As Dormer is dying, Burr tells him she found the empty shell case from his shooting of his partner, and if she throws it away no one will know the difference. But he tells her, 'Don't lose your way', as he had done. The DVD picture is among the best I've seen, and surround sound is used very nicely.",Null,0,2,7 August 2003
Aquaman," Another Arthur seeks to become King, this time it is a Trident he must obtain.
","This is a good popcorn movie, but I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library. It has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplace.The star is Jason Momoa as Arthur, the product of a union between a lighthouse operator and a mysterious injured woman from the sea. He is destined to become Aquaman. Momoa has the looks and at 6'-4' has the stature to be legitimate in that role.His nemesis becomes Patrick Wilson as the underwater King Orm, the half-brother of Arthur. Their mother is Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. Each very effective in their roles. The general thrust of the story is Orm is unhappy with how humanity has been treating the world, both above and below the waves, and wants to conquer all to make things right. Arthur, being of both ancestries, seeks to instead promote cooperation. So naturally a mighty battle settles that issue.The computer graphics and special effects are really great, but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion. I most enjoyed the first 1/3rd of the movie plus the last couple of scenes.",Null,3,4,19 May 2019
500 Days of Summer," Not your usual love story, it is very well told and interesting. And truthful.
","The opening narration states 'this is not a love story' but that is just to throw us off. It is a story of love, but told in an unusual, and interesting way.The 'Summer' of the title is a girl, Summer Finn. It is this young man's tale of his 500 days of knowing her, and yet not really knowing her at all.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is good as the somewhat nerdy, unambitious Tom Hansen who works for a card company, writing clever sayings. He is pretty good at it, but really wanted to be an architect. However his ambitions seem pretty low.One day Zooey Deschanel as pretty, interesting, and quirky Summer Finn comes into the office. Tom pretty much views her as unapproachable, but she makes the first 'chit-chat' and soon they are friends. And maybe more, but she cautions him early that she isn't interested in something deeper. She seems to like to float along in life, enjoy what it gives, without worrying too much about where it may lead.But Tom is confused by this, because 'friends' don't just jump in the bed and make out, or decide on the spur of the moment to have sex in the shower.A cute addition to the story is 11 year old Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen, Tom's little sister, who often sits him down and gives him advice, some of it coming as she waits for her soccer coach to put her into the game. She is wise beyond her years, as Tom seems naive below his years.The story is told back and forth in time, and they use a nice mechanism to keep us aware of time, they superimpose a small display that tells us what day during the 500 it is every time a scene changes.The story depicts a real truth about love and relationships. No matter how ideal this new person is for YOU, it will not work out unless you are equally ideal for her. Tom spends much of his relationship energy ignoring all the reasons why Summer will NOT likely be his mate for life and instead hoping she will change. It just doesn't happen.SPOILERS: After the on-again, off-again affair, Tom is invited to Summer's but not only finds that she does not intend to be his forever, she is getting engaged that very occasion. He rushes out, devastated, holes up in his place for days, becomes bitter, even finally goes to work, makes trouble, and quits. But something gets him to drawing again, and he renews his interest in architecture. He gets organized, sets up interviews, polishes his resume'. As the movie is about to end he is waiting for his interview and meets a nice young lady. She is also interviewing for the job. They each hope the other DOESN'T get it, and smile about that. But they do talk about getting coffee afterward, perhaps this next one will be the one for Tom. After all her name is Autumn, and everyone knows when Summer ends Autumn takes her place.",Null,0,1,29 December 2009
Juno," It's appeal is the interesting dialog and good acting by Page.
","It is easy to see why Canadian Ellen Page received a best actor nomination for her role as Juno MacGuff. She plays a very self-assured teenager who finds herself pregnant. What she does with that situation is the interesting part of the movie. The writing is what makes this such a charming movie. Although, I hope that some teenage girls don't get the idea that having a pregnancy then finding a home for your baby is something simple and easy, to the point that they don't need to worry.The movie was shot in Canada, and the boyfriend is played by another Canadian, expertly, by Michael Cera as the studious and nerdy Paulie Bleeker. Allison Janney is good as the mom, Bren MacGuff, and J.K. Simmons is good as the dad, Mac MacGuff.As the story unfolds, and Juno rejects her first thought, to have an abortion, she finds seemingly ideal parents in Jennifer Garner as Vanessa Loring and her husband Jason Bateman as Mark Loring. But all does not go smoothly.SPOILERS: After the interview and signing a contract, it becomes apparent that Vanessa really, really wants the baby, but Mark has very cold feet. Part of that is caused by his becoming distant from Vanessa, developing into their intent to divorce. This shatters Juno's ideal, wondering 'why can't people stay together?' Still, in the end Vanessa as a single parent adopts the baby and all will end well. And, Juno finds out that she really cares for Paulie.Sept 2012 edit: Just saw it again, still an excellent movie, good to re-watch every 2 to 4 years.",Null,3,7,11 May 2008
Concussion," Really fine dramatization of the genesis of football's 'concussion protocol.'
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library.It has become common when watching a major college or pro football game to see a dazed player taken off the field after a very hard hit, and the announcers mentioning the player was being put into the 'concussion protocol.' It is to evaluate them and assure they don't return to play to risk brain damage. This didn't always exist, in fact it is relatively new, only a few years. For years football glossed over head injuries, basically denying that any long-term damage occurred. But then doctors started noticing that retired football players often began experiencing strange symptoms that pointed towards brain damage.Then in 2002 all-star Steelers center Mike Webster died of a heart attack at age 50. As luck would have it the doctor performing the autopsy was Dr. Bennet Omalu, who avidly studied life, death, and the brain. The only thing abnormal in the autopsy was that Webster looked much older than 50, maybe in his 70s or 80s. On a hunch Omalu removed the brain and had it sectioned and 'fixed' for study under a microscope.What he found was truly Earth-shaking in football, he found abnormalities that could only be attributed to repeated harmful collisions over a long time. As other former football players experienced erratic behavior and died young further study found the trend, and they named it 'CTE'. The NFL pushed back hard, if acknowledged the findings would jeopardize their whole very profitable business. But persistence and help from others in the medical profession finally resulted in football collisions being the cause of CTE, and one of the remedies has been establishing the Concussion Protocol, designed to minimize further injury.This is a very fine movie of a very important discovery. Will Smith really shines as Dr. Bennet Omalu, there were times I actually forgot he was an actor. One of his supporters was Alec Baldwin as LSU alumnus Dr. Julian Bailes who had been an NFL doctor. And David Morse as Mike Webster.",Null,2,4,13 January 2017
The Day After Tomorrow," Far-fetched Sci-Fi movie that entertains with good special effects and sound track.
","Good movie to watch for the entertainment if one doesn't take it too seriously. I didn't like Dennis Quaid's 'sad-sack' character here, but the others were all good. And for some, it may make you think about what damage we Earthlings really are doing to our environment. LEVEL ONE: The movie is beautifully filmed. The special effects are as realistic as they can be for such a fictional premise. The snow, the cracking of the ice shelf in Antarctica, the tidal waves crashing into NYC. The surround sound track, reproduced realistically in a good home theater system, adds greatly to the mood of the movie.LEVEL TWO: This is Sci-Fi fantasy, what would happen if global warming disrupted the Atlantic flow which keeps the northern hemisphere warm? Could this result in hurricane-like storms over land which would suck down very cold air, with resultant unusually heavy snow and freeze-killing of anything left outside?LEVEL THREE: Some may read into this movie a political message about how we are dooming our future generations by failing to control pollution, especially that which leads to global warming. However, I don't, not to any greater extent than any Sci-Fi movie does. To me, it was chosen simply as a premise for a good story.SPOILERS FOLLOW, QUIT READING. The human element story was the father, weather scientist, not spending enough time with his high school son. Son goes with other students from DC to NYC for a knowledge contest, get trapped there in the NYC library as the frosty storm moves over NYC. Manages to get dad on the phone who tells him to stay there, do not go outside, do anything to keep warm. Dad, experienced in Antarctica, vows to get his son, even if it means hiking to NYC. Which he has to do after they find the road blocked. One of his three-man team dies after falling into the snow-covered glass dome of an indoor mall. Students end up burning books in the library to keep from freezing. Girl with a cut leg gets infected, they have to brace the cold and three wolves to get penicillin for her aboard a ship that had run aground in the street outside after the tidal wave. President dies in plane crash, Vice takes over, orders evacuation of lower USA to Mexico, gives up on northern states. Much of the human story gets very 'hokey', and to me takes away from the drama of the Sci-Fi part, but overall an enjoyable movie for the Sci-Fi entertainment value.",Null,1,4,21 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Is this really the final installment??
","I found the movie a bit long, at well over 2 hours, but upon reflection I don't know how it could have been shortened much. It tells several stories in sequence so, if you aren't tired and sleepy, goes by rather briskly.Johnny Depp is of course back as Captain Jack Sparrow, and he and his crew, once he gets a ship, must sail to the edge of the world. Who knew? We had been convinced that the world is a sphere! Geoffrey Rush in my mind steals the whole movie as the entertaining Captain Barbossa. Orlando Bloom is back as Will Turner, and Keira Knightley gets her chance to be a ship captain as Elizabeth Swann.The best makeup job is on Bill Nighy, excellent as Davy Jones. Being dead, and in charge of Davy Jones' Locker, his face has taken on the appearance of a small Octopus, with tentacles of various sizes sticking out here and there.The last 30 to 40 minutes is spectacular, with ships chasing each other about a giant whirlpool in the sea, and firing off canons.SPOILERS. In a funny scene, Will decides to propose to Elizabeth, during a big sword fight aboard the ships. They manage to get the captain to marry then as they are fighting. But Will is destined to die and spend his 10 years in the deep, his heart locked in the trunk, and Elizabeth will have to wait for him.",Null,0,0,21 January 2008
Don Jon," 'Don't call me anymore!'
","This is a hard movie to get into because the first few scenes are filled with foul language and young men talking dirty with each other and about sex, as their only focus seems to be getting the next one-night stand. They objectivise the young ladies at the night spot, usually arguing if she is a 'dime' (a '10') or not.Writer/director/star is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jon. Set in New Jersey, his friends have named him 'Don Jon' because of his almost 100% success getting the woman of his choice into a cab then into his bed. He is totally stuck on himself and satisfying his own needs for bodybuilding and sex. But casual sex doesn't do it for him, he can only get totally consumed by watching porn. Even right after his most recent one-night stand.But then he meets Scarlett Johansson as Barbara, in her tight red dress, but she spurns his advances. She leaves without giving him anything, no phone, no name, no sex. He is crushed. He considers her the most beautiful woman he has ever met. At the advice of a friend he finds a name, finds a Facebook profile, sends her a message, they meet for lunch. But as his almost silent sister observes one day over an after-Mass family Sunday lunch, Barbara just wanted to control Jon, wanted him as her own project. He is a bartender so she gets him to take a class. She wants him to strive for more. And she tells him, 'Never lie to me.' As the movie trailer plainly shows, she catches watching porn one night, he swears it was just a thing that a friend sent, he would never do it again. But that was a lie, he was addicted, it was part of his superficial view of life and pleasure.At his class he meets Julianne Moore as Esther, a woman with her own issues, and after a very 'cold' start they eventually form a type of unlikely friendship. She may be the key to helping Jon understand that the only way to fully immerse yourself into life is to immerse yourself into someone else, to really care for them and about them instead of just what you can get.This of course is a basic message of happiness, but one that some people never learn. It was good to see Tony Danza, so good in the old TV series 'Taxi', in the perfect role as Jon's dad, Jon Sr. And Glenne Headly, who was so good in 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels', as his mother Angela. Brie Larson was his sister Monica, always there for Sunday Mass and lunch, but rarely speaking, usually texting. It was also good to see Rob Brown, so good in 'Finding Forrester', as one of Jon's friends Bobby.SPOILERS: In one last meeting with Barbara, where Jon tries to make amends, but does't, as she leaves she tells him 'Don't call me anymore.' But Jon and Esther have a quickie after class, he finds out she had recently lost her husband and son in a car wreck, and as the movie ends it appears that Jon may be finding some meaning in life through his relationship with her.",Null,1,2,13 February 2014
Deadpool 2," Second in the series, dark comedy with an irreverent anti-hero.
","I watched the first Deadpool two years ago, my wife watched it with me but decided to skip this one. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library.For me the only really annoying thing is the constant filthy language, it may be faithful to the comics, I don't know, but it gets distracting very early. It just isn't necessary at the frequency they choose to use it. Almost as if they are saying 'Hey look, I can use all the vulgar language I want in this R-rated movie.'For those who can get past that the movie itself is frequently very entertaining, especially when the humor is injected. One example, there is a character that is invisible, until he lights up after parachuting into high power lines. Whose face do we see? Brad Pitt. So Ryan Reynolds is back as Wade Wilson who is mostly in costume as Deadpool. He also provides the voice for the very large convict, Juggernaut. His chief nemesis in this movie becomes Josh Brolin as Cable, a cyborg from the future out to get a mutant to prevent future problems. But Deadpool, searching for a 'family' is intent on saving the boy.I watched the extended 2 hour 13 minute version, in many respects the whole movie represents a sensory overload.",Null,1,2,19 September 2018
X-Men," More than just a 'comic book' movie, a very entertaining Sci-Fi film.
","The premise of the X-Men is this - natural, slow mutation is what causes evolution and is responsible for the human race being here. However, every few hundred thousand years accelerated mutation happens and humans with certain 'superhuman' abilities come to be. It manifests itself during puberty, and is triggered by an emotionally-charged event.The film opens in 1944 Poland, a concentration camp, where the protagonist who will become 'Magneto' is an adolescent and his power is first manifest as his mother and father are being dragged away from him. Next, the 'not too distant future' in Mississippi, where the girl known as 'Rogue' (Anna Paquin)kisses her boyfriend and almost kills him.There is activity in congress to legally require 'mutants' to be registered. This concerns Magneto who hatches a plan to convert large numbers into mutants, to thwart that effort.The good mutants become known as the 'X-Men'. Under their guru, Xavier (Patrick Stewart), they become the group that tries to prevent Magneto and his guys from achieving their havoc.The final scenes, at Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are very inventive and action-filled.  In fact, the whole film is an action movie, with great costumes and special effects. I rate the 'X-Men' movie a strong '8' of 10, and is one that I will watch a number of times.I have the DVD. Picture and surround sound are fine as would be expected with a THX release. There are not a lot of 'extras', but one of them, a pseudo-documentary on 'mutants', includes comments by the various main actors, and some behind the scenes shots that shows how some of the filming was done.I have never read the X-Men comics, but as a 54-year old am still able to appreciate and enjoy this film.

What I like most about this movie is the entertainment value. As viewers we know this is all fantasy, a movie like this should not take itself too seriously. This one is funny and absurd at times within its fictional universe. Even Stan Lee, with his usual 'cameo', actually plays a character that gives Thor an unwanted haircut. There is even an uncredited 'cameo' by Matt Damon, playing the part of Loki in a stage play being presented to Odin.A movie like this must use lots of CG and most of it looks really good.

Match Point," I like this one better than most Woody Allen movies.
","So, it isn't in New York. It isn't even in the USA. There isn't even a role for Woody Allen himself. There are no characters that seem like Woddy Allen. I really enjoyed it, kept me wondering all the way through, more like a Hitchcock movie or a Shakespeare play. It has very interesting and witty dialog that Allen is famous for, but not in the usual Woodyesque manner.Set in modern day London, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Chris Wilton, excellent pro tennis player, but not good enough to be a big winner. So he decides he has enough of the touring life, and looking for some stability takes a job as a teaching pro at an exclusive London club. A series of 'lucky' events take Chris on a journey he could never have predicted. In fact, this is the whole theme of the movie, illustrated at the beginning, with a tennis ball that hits the tape, bounces up, and introducing the concept, whether it is lucky enough to bounce over can influence who wins and who loses the match. Life really happens that way, and it is good to see a movie that treats the subject well.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Chris' first student is a former college tennis player, son of a very wealthy business man. Whether it was set up by Chris we are not sure, but mentioning that he enjoys opera, his student Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) invites him to a performance, where Chris meets Tom's single sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chloe is moving past the marrying age and falls hard for Chris, who in turn falls hard for Tom's fianc√©e, American actress wannabe Nola (Scarlett Johansson). In fact, we never believe he loves Chloe, but marries her as a way to stay near Nola, and to get a nice job in dad's company.The story takes a big twist as Tom and Nola break up, Nola goes back to the USA, and Chris is stuck with a wife he is not sure he wants. But, when Nola shows up again, Chris cannot control his lust for her, sees her every chance he gets, they develop a torrid affair, always barely avoiding getting found out.Then Nola gets pregnant, Chris is caught between a wife and security and a passionate woman, who wants a father for her child. Chris, always lying to everyone, decides the only way out is to kill Nola and make it look like she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He takes a shotgun into the landlady's apartment right before Nola is expected home, shoots the lady, messes up the apartment, steals some drugs and jewelery, then goes into the hallway and shoots Nola. Police question him, looks like he will get caught, aided by Nola's diary, but a copy murder happens, the thief has the ring stolen from the landlady and cops assume the same thief had killed Nola, they keep the affair secret. When Chris had tried to toss the ring into the river, it hit the top rail as he turned his back, bounced up and back onto the sidewalk, where the eventual thief found it.

Yes Man," Pretty entertaining movie that also has a good message.
","Jim Carrey to me is always better when he has a serious part and minimizes his goofy physical comedy. That is the kind of role he has here as Carl Allen, single banker who might be best described as a 'no' man. He turns down marginal loan applications and generally avoids doing things he thinks will be a bother. His best friend calls but he makes up excuses why he can't do things, and instead just wants to hide out at his place and watch a movie on DVD.But this story is about him becoming a 'yes' man. He meets old friend John Michael Higgins as Nick who claims to be enjoying life more than ever since he has become a 'yes' man, saying 'yes' to life and taking chances. So by Nick's invitation Carl attends the seminar conducted by Terence Stamp as Terrence Bundley, and in an atmosphere similar to a charismatic revival, Carl commits to becoming a 'yes' man.His first challenge is a homeless man who asks for a ride to a park (where we soon find he lives in the bushes). When Carl runs out of gas and has to walk down to a service station, he happens to meet pretty and quirky Zooey Deschanel as Allison, who offers him a ride back up the hill on the back of her scooter. In the grand scheme of things Carl would never have met Allison if he had not said 'yes' to that homeless man looking for a ride.As the story continues to unfold Carl gets himself in some awkward situations by saying 'yes' all the time, and some friends take advantage of him because of it, knowing he will never say 'no' to anything. But the story also makes the point that 'yes' always comes with conditions, that you use your common sense to filter things, and sometimes the best options really is to say 'no.' There is an overriding truth to the whole message, that in life we need to be open to new experiences because we never know what good will come of them.In spite of their 18 year age difference, Carl and Allison connect and by the end of the movie it seems that they may have a budding love relationship.Good, entertaining movie.

A research group recognizes this and they have been cloning her in a deep underground research center, hoping to use the blood to develop an antidote that not only will prevent their getting the disease, but will also turn the undead into docile animals that they can train. With all this they could rule the world, and rebuild it to what they want.Ali Larter is good as Claire Redfield, leading a caravan of others, looking for a safe place to relax and live. One challenge is getting supplies, especially fuel.

Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen turns his fantasy towards Paris.
","I almost always see what is on DVD 'extras' after I see a movie, and in a departure from most Allen films this one has an interesting and useful session with Allen, Wilson, and McAdams before a foreign audience. Allen explains that he wanted to do a Paris movie, and he first settled in on the title 'Midnight in Paris' without having any idea what the story would be. Eventually of course 'midnight' became a key exposition element of his story. One of my favorite Allen movies is fantasy 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' and here he brings another novel, interesting fantasy to tell a very good story about life.The key character is Owen Wilson as Gil. He is a Hollywood hack, a screen writer, but wants to do more with his talent. He is working on his first novel and finds himself visiting Paris with his fianc√©e (McAdams) and her parents. He is enchanted with the idea of Paris, and also dreams about living in 1920s Paris, in the rain, which he believes would be the nirvana of his existence.If you don't already know this story involves 'time-travel' then I won't say anything else until after the 'spoilers' warning below. I don't usually like Owen Wilson, but in truth he is a very good actor and I believe this is my favorite role of his. And the story has a good moral about accepting the present rather than living your life wishing it were in a different, 'more romantic' era.SPOILERS: One evening while walking back to his Paris hotel Gil gets a bit lost and finds himself alone on some steps as the clocks sound midnight. Just then a 1920s-era taxi pulls up and summons him. He goes with them and soon figures out he really had been transported to 1920s Paris. He meets a number of historical figures, like Cole Porter, Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and others. He makes this 'trip' several times, always triggered by midnight at the same location. While in the 1920s he meets a girl who longs for the 1890s Paris, a period she thinks would be better. Soon the two of them are summoned by a horse-n-buggy cab and find themselves in 1890s Paris.

The Last Song," Better than its low IMDb rating would indicate, we found it rather enjoyable.
","One thing is apparent, Miley Curus is growing up to be a bit better actress than the usual teen singer-turned-actress. In fact, now I believe she is a better actress than she is a singer.Here she is Ronnie (Veronica) Miller sent by mom to spend the summer with her dad (Greg Kinnear) Steve on the Atlantic coast of Georgia. Like most of these themed stories she really wants to be back in the city and is determined to NOT have an enjoyable time. Part of that is not being able to forgive dad for leaving her and mom, even though he explains that love is complicated.She is also accompanied by her younger brother, Bobby Coleman as Jonah Miller, who in fact gets along quite well with dad.At a beach volleyball game she happens to meet teen Liam Hemsworth as Will Blakelee, as he runs into her and causes her to spill her shake all over her shirt. We, the audience, correctly predict that the two of them will meet again and develop a love interest. Kelly Preston is her mother Kim.Stories like this are very common in the movies, unhappy daughter and caring dad try to patch up relationships. But this one is done rather well, mostly due to the convincing acting by Kinnear and Cyrus. A catalyst is the nest of sea turtle eggs she finds being disturbed by a raccoon, and she sets out to protect them, with the help of Will.SPOILERS: Ronnie, like her dad, is an accomplished pianist, and in fact she has been offered a scholarship to Juliard, but she has not played since dad left her and the family, and has no plans to ever play again. But in the end, after she finds out dad is dying and he wrote his last song for her, she plays it at his funeral, decides to go to Juliard, and Will will be transferring from family school Vanderbilt to attend Columbia, also in New York.",Null,2,8,16 September 2010
Zodiac," Good movie about the Zodiac killer, but requires patience to watch.
","It is a fact that a serial killer, who became known as the Zodiac killer, was active on and off in California in the 1960s and the 1970s. He seemed to just take pleasure in killing people, and communicated actively in code and via phone calls to the media and the police. When the various police departments seemed to give up on ever solving the mystery of the killer's identity, a San Francisco newspaper cartoonist who liked to solve puzzles just couldn't give up. It became his obsession, causing problems with his relationships and his job.Jake Gyllenhaal is fine as the cartoonist Robert Graysmith. Other fine actors include Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi, Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, and Robert Downey Jr. as newspaper reporter Paul Avery. Brian Cox has a small but important part as famous attorney Melvin Belli. Chlo√´ Sevigny is Melanie who becomes Robert's love interest and eventually his wife.The movie is very well done, but at almost 2 1/2 hours, and little action, it takes a bit of patience to watch. However it is a good movie.SPOILERS. The Zodiac killer was never identified positively. Through the movie we see the prime suspect, Lee or Leigh, several times. The evidence was plenty and strong but circumstantial, until a lone survivor from 1969 identified him in a photo lineup, years after the attack. But Lee died of a heart attack shortly after and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains officially unresolved.",Null,1,1,12 August 2007
Milk," Hello, my name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you!
","Whatever else Sean Penn might be, he has shown over and over that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. Here he is Harvey Milk and the best compliment is that we soon forget we are watching Penn.While my comments may have spoilers, the whole story is factual, the characters are real people, so everyone should already know the basic story and how it turns out.This story starts in New York where Milk is still trying to stay in the closet, hiding his gay lifestyle from co-workers, but he sees an attractive young man, James Franco as Scott Smith, and they hook up. Eventually they move to San Francisco as a couple and start a business, a small camera shop.This is the 1970s, before gay rights began to have widespread acceptance, so Milk's life story there involves working to change that. He decides to do so by running for political office. His first few attempts are not successful, but he is persistent, gradually adding young activists to his team. Together he finally gets elected to the office of City Supervisor for his area (there were several elected City Supervisors, sort of like councilmen).Josh Brolin is another City Supervisor, from a different area, Dan White, married and with a family. White and Milk form an unlikely alliance, to try to get things passed that they both had interests in. The way it is presented makes the audience wonder if White had suppressed homosexual tendencies.The other key character is Victor Garber as Mayor George Moscone.The story is significant for its place in US history, the gay rights activist Harvey Milk setting the stage for reforms which continue to lead to establishing gay rights. But the whole story is less interesting than Sean Penn's performance as Milk, a performance that won him Best Actor.MAJOR SPOILER: As history witnessed, Dan White went to city offices that fateful day, with a gun, and killed both Milk and Moscone. The movie depicts this as a result of White having resigned his job, then wanting that resignation rescinded, but Milk convinced Moscone to appoint someone else. White felt betrayed.",Null,0,1,4 April 2009
The Prestige," In 'magic' it's all about the third act! The Prestige.
","'The third stage is sometimes called the effect, or the prestige, and this is the product of magic.' (Christopher Priest) That is the derivation of the movie's title. The whole plot involves two magicians who are competing ever since they were magician helpers together. Their jealousy and desire to learn of each others' best magic tricks provide the tension in the story.Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, eventually the lesser of the two, and who spends much of the movie time trying to avenge a death. Christian Bale as Alfred (Freddy) Borden is the better of the two, always seeming to one-up Angier. Michael Caine is Cutter who designs the illusions and equipment, and is ready backstage with an ax in case the escape from the water tank is not made on time.Scarlett Johansson (with British accent) as Olivia Wenscombe becomes the 4th member of the circle. She at first assists Angier, but he sends her to get a job with Borden, to learn the secret to his 'transported man' trick.An interesting casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a real historical scientist who experimented with electricity. Many recognize his name for the 'Tesla coil.' I didn't recognize Bowie during the movie.We found it a very interesting 2 hours. All the cast members are good and the twists and turns held our attention.SPOILERS. Early when Angier and Borden are working together, and Angier's young wife is part of the act, she drowns after being dropped into the water tank because she cannot get out of the wrist knot that Borden tied, and thus could not reach around and unlock the trick lock. Angier never forgives Borden, and much later a trial found Borden guilty of killing someone else and sentenced to a hanging. Eventually Angier develops a transported man illusion, using a very close double they find, on one side of the stage Angier opens a door to conceal his dropping below the stage, while behind the door on the other side of the stage the double surfaces from beneath. Trouble with the double (doubt planted by Borden in a pub) cut that act short. Meanwhile Borden was doing his amazing trick and only at the end, while Angier is dying, do we learn that there were 2 Bordens, identical twins. One was loyal to his wife, the other was in love with Olivia. There was no cheating.Within that story, was a highly fictional one where Angier paid Tesla to develop an electrical device which 'transported' him by actually creating an exact double of himself, which of course he had to drown each performance to hide the fact. He framed Borden with one of those drownings.",Null,0,5,15 March 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A worthy Hellboy sequel, great action.
","Even though I am an 'old guy' I still enjoy an occasional fantasy, like these newer movies inspired by comic books. I had seen the earlier Hellboy movie, enjoyed it, and I enjoyed this one. Never to be taken seriously, it is just comic book entertainment brought to the big screen.Ron Perlman of course is back as Hellboy, and now it would be hard to imagine any other actor playing this role. He is, in short, superb. The beginning of the movie gives a very brief re-telling of the origins of Hellboy and his adopted father, so it isn't necessary to have seen the first one.As a young boy his father would read him a story of mythical beings in a mythical land, and now in the present time the myths become reality. The title refers to a 'Golden Army' of robotic fighting machines that an evil Prince Nuada seeks to find, and control, so that he can conquer the world. It falls to Hellboy and his alien friends in the covert government organization to defeat the bad guys and preserve the world.Again Hellboy is ably aided by Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. A totally fun movie, with lots of action. You gotta love Hellboy.",Null,1,2,28 November 2008
Cloverfield," Japan has Godzilla, now New York has its own monster!
","I had heard about this movie but had failed to see it until now, on DVD from my public library. For anyone who likes this movie the extras are interesting from the design of the monster to JJ Abrams talking about how Japan has Godzilla and it seems to be in their popular culture, so maybe the USA needs its monster. It seems Abrams was hoping that this one would become that. Pretty lofty expectations, eh?In a nutshell, the story focuses on a small group of shallow 20- somethings in Manhattan. They are throwing a goodbye party for one of the gang, Rob, who is going to Japan as a V.P. with some company. The party is in progress, petty gossip fills the air, when about 11PM and exactly 18:18 into the DVD we hear and feel (for those of us with a powered subwoofer) something that might be an earthquake. But we soon find out it is a 300-foot-tall monster that is as menacing as Godzilla (but looks more the MUTOs of the most recent Godzilla movie).So all the characters switch from party mode to survival mode, trying to escape from Manhattan to Brooklyn via the bridge. The effects are very authentic, borrowing a lot from actual footage of the 9/11 attack with buildings imploding and dust clouds being pushed down the streets. The storytelling mode is shaky camera and found footage. For those who like this sort of move it is very well made. I am not a big fan, the footage shown contains a lot of them walking, running, climbing, fighting off smaller monsters released by the large one. There is no real resolution, footage cannot be 'found' unless the filmer perished. Maybe the monster is still out there?",Null,0,0,25 September 2015
Sleepy Hollow," Worthwhile entertainment, a fun black comedy.
","After watching Sleepy Hollow I wasn't exactly sure what this movie was supposed to convey. After watching the DVD 'extra' - the making-of - I understood it a lot more. In fact, we found the DVD extras more entertaining than the movie.  Heads roll literally virtually every other scene, Johnny Depp does a fine job in the lead role.

Hotel Rwanda," Not a pretty picture, but a struggle for survival.
","Fairly accurately, I suspect, 1994 Rwanda is depicted as a nation where intimidation and bribes control everyday commerce. Don Cheadle in a superb performance is Paul Rusesabagina, the assistant manager at a Belgian hotel in Rwanda. Paul becomes manager after the president of Rwanda is killed by insurgents, and the white manager flees. Instead of trying to cover the whole conflict, with millions killed by rival tribes, this movie focuses on this person, Paul, and his efforts to save over 1200 by welcoming them into the hotel, while doing what he could to stall the insurgents who wanted to kill all the 'cockroaches', their name for those being killed. They especially wanted to kill all the children, to prevent that generation from growing up.I suspect the movie is mostly accurate, as the real Paul Rusesabagina was a consultant for making the movie, and he is also featured on an interesting DVD extra, where he takes us back 10 years to the places and events depicted in the movie. Nick Nolte has a key role as Colonel Oliver of the UN peace keeping force. As was described, they could not do much to stop the genocide.Not a pleasant movie to watch, but an important one as it shows a dark side of the world we live in. But also a bright spot, how one person can make a difference. And, Don Cheadle gives a superb performance as Paul.",Null,2,3,28 May 2005
Once," A small movie about a guy and a girl who love to make music.
","In the DVD extras we learn that this movie was made on a very small budget, with a small crew and much hand-held filming. We also learn that the two main characters are musicians, not actors, and there was quite a bit of improvisation. That makes it all the more fun to watch.Glen Hansard, 30-something, on his own a famous and successful Irish musician, is the Guy. By day he works with his dad in their shop repairing vacuum cleaners. By night, and part of the day, Guy stands on the street playing his beat-up guitar and singing songs he writes, hoping passersby will drop some loose change into his case. In the opening scene we see him chase a rogue who steals his soft case with money in it, but after he catches him has a soft heart and gives him the money anyway.The Guy is heartbroken because his girl is off to London, and he believes she has cheated on him and says she is forgotten. But we know by the songs he writes that he still loves her.Mark√©ta Irglov√°, a teenager, is the Girl, recently from the Czech Republic, who happens by as she sells roses on the streets for a little cash. She listens to him, and they strike up a friendship, as she knows music and she has a vacuum cleaner that doesn't suck anymore. She has a mother and her small child at their apartment shack, and the Girl rejoices when she gets a job cleaning other peoples' homes. She has a husband back in the Czech Republic, but she talks as if it is over.The Guy seems content to compose and sing on the streets, but the Girl urges him to cut a CD of his music so that he can get a contract and make real money. Together they get a loan and get a weekend of professional recording studio. Some of his street musician friends provide back-up.As it turns out the two main actors were already friends, and their working 'chemistry' is great. Over half of the movie is music and/or singing, so it is virtually a musical. Very good music. Very nicely done, with a good resolution.SPOILERS: Even though the Guy and the Girl became close friends and had a great affection for each other, they never became lovers. Eventually she helped him decide that he needed to go to London and look for his girlfriend, and also the Girl's husband decided to come to Ireland and be with his wife and young daughter.",Null,1,2,2 February 2008
Ready Player One," Near future, virtual reality rules.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library and found it thoroughly enjoyable, even though we are grandparents and far removed from the virtual reality, gaming crowd. This is a Spielberg movie, and even though this story is unique it has many of the movie-making elements he used in such movies as 'E.T.', 'Raiders', 'Jurassic Park', 'A.I.' and more recently 'The BFG'. Imaginative cinematography, interesting action, and a really killer of a sound track. That alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.There is also a good story going on. It is Columbus, Ohio in 2045, it is somewhat dystopian and many have turned to a virtual reality existence in something called Oasis. It is a form of escape, it allows one to avoid dealing with real world issues. Upon the death of the creator and owner of Oasis it is announced that the winner of a contest, finding obscure clues in Oasis, would be given Oasis and complete control of it. So the story becomes a contest between a few dedicated gamers and a big corporation using its resources to win the contest.The key gamer is Texas native Tye Sheridan as 18-yr-old Wade, who in virtual reality goes by Parzival. He is helped by British actress Olivia Cooke as Samantha who goes by Art3mis. His intention are honorable, he realizes that people need to get back to reality, to connect with each other rather than gravitate towards virtual reality.The movie is really well made, and even though it is long at 2+ hours it never wore out its welcome.",Null,1,1,22 September 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," In a 1970s cold war spy story, very nicely done but very difficult to follow.
","My wife and I saw this on DVD. We enjoyed it, the whole movie is interesting and filled with established actors in most roles. But when it was over we wondered if we were the only two who had a hard time following everything.So I first went to old reliable (for me), the critic Ebert. He wrote almost exactly what we had been thinking, he couldn't follow it either, even though he has made a career of following sometimes complex movies and making sense of them.So next I read a number of user reviews here, as well as many of the discussion items, and guess what? The most common theme is how difficult it is to follow all the characters and to understand what was going on. So I give this movie a favorable rating, I enjoyed it very much, but frankly it is very hard to follow. And when it was all over, I knew who the spy was, but I can't really say what all I saw in the movie.Gary Oldman plays what turns out to be the central character, George Smiley . There had been an incident, Smiley was fired from the British secret agency, but now the old chairman of the group has approached him. They strongly suspect that there is a mole, a traitor in the organization and that it is one of the top five members. Smiley is asked to come back to investigate and figure it all out. Which he eventually does.The movie's title comes from a code system used during the investigation and required communications. Each man being investigated was given a code name ... Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, etc ... and one of them would turn out to be the spy! Some action, but mostly quiet and often incomplete conversations which ended in vague, indirect references or implications. Enjoyable movie but very hard to follow. Maybe I already said that?",Null,4,6,14 July 2012
The Hateful Eight," Pornographic violence, absurdist dark comedy with eight hateful characters in one room in the Old West.
","I saw this on DVD from my local public library. Set in Wyoming a few years after the Civil War, it was filmed in the Colorado Mountains. The best part of this movie are the early outside shots of a stagecoach running on a snowy road in Colorado with the Rocky Mountains as the backdrop. I've visited there many times, rode motorcycles through the mountains, it never gets old.We usually attach the descriptor 'pornography' to graphic sex but here the pornography is the graphic violence, a Tarantino trademark. It seems to be his way of being absurd, as if to say 'If it is over-the-top graphic then it won't be taken seriously.'There is a very good core of a story here, a bounty hunter is transporting a notorious and wanted female member of a gang to Red Rock where she will be tried and hanged, and he will collect the bounty. But a snowstorm forces them (plus a few others) to hole up in a roadside place of business. The rest of the movie, long at 2 hrs and 45 minutes, takes place in and around that one-room place of business.The first hint that things might not be right is when they arrive and try to open the door voices from inside yell 'You have to kick it open', then they have to take boards and nails to close the door. Much later in a flashback we see how the door was damaged to make that necessary.The 8 main characters are all untrustworthy and the story is to see which would prevail. There are shootings with blood spurting out, often complete heads blown off. The blood and gore take over and the story becomes secondary.This has many interesting points and good characters but in no way is a good movie. The highest ratings are from young male viewers who seem to like the cursing accompanied by all the blood and gore. But for me, I could never recommend this to anyone I know.When I first learned about this movie last year I had no intention of seeing it, but my curiosity got the best of me. I am glad I saw it, to know what a really poor movie looks and sounds like.",Null,2,7,9 May 2016

Now those still alive are mainly in their 70s and 80s, many still acting.It is set in WW2, primarily in Italy. A group of ragtag aviators flying bombing runs. The story focuses on Alan Arkin as Capt. John Yossarian, bombardier. He is probably the most sane one there but he wants to survive, he wants to go home. At first it would be after 25 successful missions, then it got pushed to 50, then to 75. He was losing patience. It is mostly a madcap type of absurdist comedy. Most of it works, some of it doesn't for me. Still I am glad I took the time, it is such a classic.",Null,1,1,13 August 2018
"I, Tonya"," Absurdist comedy retelling of the Tonya Harding story. Much of it is accurate.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. Perhaps the biggest thing to keep in mind is the overview at the beginning, ''Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly.' The interviews were true, not all the details could have been.Meaning the story here in the movie is pretty much what the principal characters had to say but each one had his or her own version of 'the truth.' Throughout the movie characters commonly look into the camera and speak, as if they are speaking to us, the audience.The climax of the whole story of course is the incident where Harding's main rival, Nancy Kerrigan, was clubbed on the leg after a practice session in an attempt to remove her from future competitions by breaking her leg. Margot Robbie is a reasonable Tonya. But even more impressive is Allison Janney as Tonya's abusive mom, LaVona.Much of the movie is presented in an almost absurdist style and frankly is very entertaining. Most of the time. I remember Tonya and Nancy very well, it is interesting revisiting that time in this movie's presentation of the 'facts.'",Null,0,0,1 April 2018
We Were Soldiers," 'Daddy, are they going to try to take your life away? Yes, Cecelia, they're going to try but I'm not going to let them.' ","Mel Gibson stars as General Harold Moore, who wrote the book, so we know before the film begins that he makes good on his promise to his young daughter, to not let the Viet Cong 'take his life away.' But in the end he says, 'I'll never forgive myself - that my men died and I didn't.' The film covers a key battle in November 1965 that occurs over three days, but Moore served for over 9 more months in Viet Nam. However, this film is only secondarily about a battle fought almost 40 years ago. Instead, it is really about the wives and children left behind, waiting for their husbands and fathers to return, or for the dreaded telegram delivered as a death notice. We get to know the wives and children stationed at Ft Bragg, Georgia. We see the young mothers and their babies, the wives getting together for companionship. The peaceful life between telegrams, the grief upon delivery of the next one. Moore's wife actually takes on the task herself, getting the telegrams from the cab driver, and delivering them personally, comforting her friends. And finally, the return of her own husband, a deeply religious man who can barely accept the loss of his men.I saw this film on DVD, but did not get to look at any of the extras. The battle scenes are among the best ever filmed, although they took pains to make them as graphic and gory as possible. I suppose that helps us to really detest war. The surround sound is used to good effect, you can hear bullets and helicopters surrounding you during the heat of battle. However the video transfer is just ordinary, more grainy than most current releases, but adequately sharp.As the story ends, we hear Moore's voice-over as a young American wife reads his letter of condolences, looking at her deceased husband's photo, and the camera dissolves into a young Vietnamese wife reading a similar letter while looking at a photo of her deceased husband's photo. And we see the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, a sober message during these times when our own president, who stayed far from the Viet Nam war, is now threatening war against Iraq.

Molly's Game," Molly Bloom, running high stakes poker games.
","I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. My wife skipped.Jessica Chastain plays Molly Bloom, a bright young lady from Colorado, an Olympic-quality skier who hoped to attend law school. To take a break between the end of her competitive skiing and her enrollment in Law School she moved to Los Angeles, took a couple of jobs, then fell into a job which required her to assist in legal high-stakes poker games. This eventually branched out to the point where she staged and ran her own games, still legal, because she was not taking a cut, but earning a very nice living on tips from the wealthy gamblers. Because the stakes kept getting higher and her financial risk high if a gambler could not pay what he borrowed, she began to take a cut and this crossed over to illegal.We have to keep in mind that this movie is based on Bloom's own book, so it is the story from her side. However I found it to be a fascinating story, one that most of us only wonder about. What really goes in in high stakes gambling? The movie is a bit long at just over 2 hours but it held my interest all the way through. And Chastain shows why she is one of the best actresses today.Good movie.

Dear John," A rather nice romantic story, I found it better than the critics suggest.
","The story is set in 2001 and the years immediately following. The year is important because the event of 9-11-2001, the destruction of NYC's twin towers by terrorists, becomes the big event that deflects an otherwise simple relationship story. Set in Charleston, South Carolina and surrounding areas.Channing Tatum is John Tyree, Army Special Ops, and we meet him as he lies wounded in Afghanistan. But the story then quickly flashes back to 2001, in the summer when he was 21. The handbag of a very cute girl accidentally gets knocked off a pier and into the water, and while one suitor goes towards the shore to try to retrieve the bag the easy way, John jumps directly into the water to get the bag. He becomes the girl's instant hero.The girl is pretty Amanda Seyfried as Savannah Curtis. She will soon be starting her final year of college. While John is on two weeks' leave they fall into, as Ebert says, 'PG-13 Love.' (Roger Ebert gives this movie a low rating, but to me it is better than that.)John is to finish out his remaining year of duty, while Savannah finishes out her remaining year of college, they will reunite then live happily ever after. That was their plan, until the 9-11 event. But then everything changes.The other key characters are Richard Jenkins as Mr. Tyree, quiet, shy, methodical, and consumed by his coin collection, which is extensive. Henry Thomas (of 'E.T.' fame) is Tim Wheddon, local friend of Savannah's family, with a small autistic son.Good movie, examines the realities of life and how major events can cause plans to be scrapped. MAJOR SPOILERS: After 9-11 John re-ups along with his squad, he and Savannah keep in touch by letters, until he fails to hear from her for weeks. When he finally does she tells him she can't wait anymore and is engaged. He eventually finds out it is Tim that she marries, but now Tim has cancer and money has run out. Also John's dad dies. Anonymously, John sells the coin collection and donates the money to Tim's cause. In the end, much later, we see Savannah in a caf√© and John outside, they see each other, she goes outside and embrace. The ending isn't explained, but one possibility is they eventually got together after Tim died.",Null,1,2,22 June 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Wonderful, cutting edge motion-capture animation, but for me a 'so-so' film.
","This movie, 'Tintin', of course got a lot of advanced publicity and true to its producers and directors is a smashing success. It is hard to say how it could have been improved. It certainly reminds the viewer of scenes from 'Raiders' and young Tintin certainly is an Indiana Jones type of action hero. But I watched it with a general low level of interest. I can suspend by disbelief when I am viewing real actors playing roles. Especially when the action includes things that 'seem' possible. However viewing animated characters do things which seems impossible, for me, is akin to watching old Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote cartoons.The plot is fine, young Tintin is wandering through a flea market and buys an old model ship, which his cat and dog fight in his apartment breaks off the mast. Inside the mast he finds a metal tube with something written on a piece of parchment. Soon his apartment is robbed and the model stolen. He eventually learns that three models were built and each had a message, when put with the other three may give directions to a great hidden pirate treasure.So this takes Tintin and old sea captain Haddock on a harrowing journey all over the world, repeatedly narrowly escaping capture and/or death. And eventually to the treasure. Jamie Bell is super, voicing Tintin. As well as Andy Serkis voicing Captain Haddock. Plus the villain is voiced by Daniel Craig. Plus a bunch of other established actors. There is an interesting 8-minute DVD extra on how the Tintin movie came to be, including a clip from something Peter Jackson put together, with his own face for Haddock. And, in fact in the movie itself Haddock looks mostly like Peter Jackson. Tintin's face and expressions looked very familiar to me and very much like a red-headed version of Nathan Corddry who plays Adam on the TV series 'Harry's Law' starring Kathy Bates. It had me wondering if they used him as a model for the animated Tintin.SPOILERS: After Tintin and Haddock managed to get all three parchment notes, superimposing them and looking at the characters through light formed geographic coordinates, and when they followed them to an old mansion found it was Haddocks's and a hidden basement contained treasure.",Null,1,3,8 May 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A perfect blending of script with acting of Newman and Redford.
","September 2019 edit: I just watched it again, after 14 additional years, and a couple of weeks after watching a Butch and Sundance documentary. It has aged well.This is the movie that placed Redford on the 'A list' of actors. Relatively unknown in 1967, when production began, the bosses wanted a better known actor, perhaps Steve McQueen. But Redford, just 30, turned out just perfect as the Sundance Kid. Newman as Butch Cassidy was in his early 40s and together, as they did in 'The Sting', their acting chemistry resulted in this classic. At first it was panned by many critics but the story of friendship struck a chord with movie-goers and the Newman/Redford combination made it a hit.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid were real outlaws, operating in the late 1800s and early 1900s. While the script romanticizes them quite a bit, the overall story is mostly accurate. However, there forever remained a question about what really happened to them. This movie depicts one scenario. The real Etta Place was a prostitute but here she is a school teacher, played by the beautiful Katharine Ross.The movie establishes the characters early with a bank robbery and escape. Then the middle story involves their being hunted by a hired band of 6 in retaliation for several train robberies. Humor is injected in lines such as, 'If he would just pay us what it costs to hire them, I wouldn't have to steal his money anymore.' They manage to escape in the great scene where they jump off a cliff into a river. Tired of running, Butch and Sundance, with Etta along, travel to New York, then take a ship to South America to start fresh.The DVD has a nice presentation in Widescreen. The extras are interesting, with modern day interviews with the main actors and others.While the real outlaws traveled all over S. America, this movie has them just going to Bolivia. There they rob banks and still are chased by the band of 6 from America. But their undoing came in a small village at the hands of the local police, bolstered by dozens of military troops called in with loaded rifles.

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. This IMDb main page has a sufficient synopsis of the story so I won't repeat it in what I am writing.I just want to comment on the production values. The looks and motions, walking, running, swimming, etc of the animated characters is probably the best I have seen. The faces of the human characters have exaggerated features, like slightly too large eyes, big legs, etc to definitely place them as intended animated figures. But otherwise they move, talk, and sing very realistically. The water, trees, sky, etc are very realistic.High schooler Auli'i Cravalho is the voice of Moana, only child of the King and destined to be the leader one day. When very young she is 'chosen' by the ocean to make a journey and restore order and beauty to their islands. Ms Cravalho already was a singer in high school activities and sings her songs very nicely here.She is required to enlist the help of Dwayne Johnson as demi-god and shape-shifter Maui. He is reluctant but Moana is very persistent.Overall a very entertaining hour and a half.",Null,2,5,10 May 2017
Crash," One of the better movies I have seen in 2005.
","I actually saw 'Crash' twice, on successive days. The first time alone, the second time with my wife. It is the type of movie that can get even better the second or third time. Movies this good and this intelligent come along very rarely.It has an all-star cast, but my favorites were Don Cheadle as the LA police detective who didn't seem to worry quite enough about his younger brother, played by Larentz Tate. And Matt Dillon as the frustrated patrol officer who seemed bigoted beyond redemption. And Terrence Howard as the director who was trying hard to straddle the white/black line.In the opening Cheadle's character says something about people never touching each other in LA, and they want human contact so badly that they end up crashing into each other. The movie opens with a crash, and ends with a different crash. But to me the movie was about something else. It is about the dual lives most people live, the one where we do what we are expected to do, and the other where we do things under stress which represents who we really. Many times during the movie this is played out as some type of bigotry, against blacks or whites, against Asians or middle easterns. The dialog is frank, and the story seldom leads where you think it will. That's what makes it so interesting.The whole movie is over about a 24-hour period. During this time most of the characters come into contact with each other in convoluted ways which probably could never happen in real life, but makes an interesting way to show the ironies of life, how the hurter can become the helper, or vice versa.BIG SPOILERS FOLLOW. Police officer stops a couple, finds nothing wrong, dislikes attitude, humiliates woman with a 'personal' search up her evening dress. Later has to cut the same woman out of an overturned car to save her before it explodes. Hispanic locksmith is thought to be a gang member, white woman thinks he will give keys to home boys, also Iranian man thinks he was cheated, Hispanic man turns out to be a family man with wife and young daughter, Iranian man looks him up to shoot him, daughter gets in way as shot fired, all are OK because gun had blanks. Car thieves run over Chinese man, who they dump off at a hospital, later Chinese wife shows up, he tells her to get check from his wallet and cash it quickly, turns out he was smuggling Tiwanese in the back of his van.March 2013 edit: Just watched it again, I believe it comes across even better now.July 2015 edit: Just watched it again, I am still amazed what a fine movie this is, every character is written and acted just right.",Null,2,8,23 October 2005
Snatch," 'Snatch' is not a good movie, but done in a very entertaining style that many people will enjoy. I laughed a lot.
","SPOILERS:: I cannot discuss my reaction to 'Snatch' (which I suppose relates to the 'snatching' of the large diamond) without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is #142 with a rating of 8.1, primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29, and I suspect most under 21. Among the 'over 30' crowd, the rating is 7.5, which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style, action, witty dialog. But the story, which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys, as in 'Lock, Stock...', is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said, 'Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story, it's all about the action.'My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers, I was intrigued by his gypsy character, a bare-fist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film, and again Pitt shows, as he did in 'Fight Club' and 'Twelve Monkeys', that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.
James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights, I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy, and 'squeek-barking' was funny, as was 'Something to declare? Yes, don't go to England.' Much of the dark humor in 'Snatch' arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious, competent crooks, then the film would not be very interesting. 'Slapstick Crooks' would be a better name.The camerawork and editing, as well as the dynamic 5-channel sound, were all first-rate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value, but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence, a la 'Pulp Fiction', and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves, 'It's only a movie.'",Null,4,8,10 July 2001
BlacKkKlansman," Based on real events in 1970s Colorado, a black police officer joins the KKK.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Although it runs a bit long at just over 2 hours it is such an interesting story, well-told, that it never seemed too long.The whole story is based on the 2014 book by Ron Stallworth, of his experiences in the 1970s in Colorado Springs as a fresh police officer, and the first black man to that position in that city. The character is very well played by John David Washington. In real life Stallworth had been an achiever in high school and wanted to make a difference as a police officer.On a whim he notices an ad which was recruiting members for a new KKK chapter in the Colorado Springs area. Having a phone voice and speaking manner not easily identified as black he successfully applied for membership, and at one point even speaking directly to David Duke in New Orleans.Ron would not have gotten very far in his ruse without a white man to replace him in live encounters, for this he recruited the help of fellow police officer,
Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman who happened to be Jewish, another ethnic target of the KKK. Together they thwarted some serious KKK mischief planned.For a very serious subject the movie director Spike Lee injects a fair share of humor, all very appropriate. Near the end the events of the 1970s are intercut with modern events and protests, showing that white supremacy activities are far from over.",Null,140,212,16 November 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Yet another take on the Spider Man story, just a bit too manic for my tastes.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I read Spider Man comics growing up and really enjoyed the Toby Maguire version in 2002, the origin story was treated well and to me Maguire was the ideal actor to play Peter Parker and Spider Man.This reincarnation uses British actor Tom Holland in the lead role. He is fine, his American accent is very good, sounding much like Michael J Fox in the BTTF movies. He is suitably small and young-looking to play a high school teenager. As this story starts he has had some experience with the Avengers and wants more. Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is his mentor.What I don't like is how Peter is cast as an often silly kid who always seems to be in some mess or the other. And when the action scenes are on they are very manic, to the point where the special effects become primary, the story secondary. Plus the several prior movies have better actors creating more interesting characters. Still, we were entertained, but you can't help comparing them to the ones that came before and when I do, this one doesn't measure up.",Null,3,11,12 November 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A classic, must-see 'black' comedy about nuclear destruction.
","Dr Strangelove, Kubrick's 'black' comedy about nuclear war was filmed in 1963, the year I graduated from high school, and I finally got around to seeing it in 2000!Although the special effects are crude by current standards, they are pretty good for being filmed almost 40 years ago! I have a very difficult time seeing this movie as one of the 10 best of all time.  It definitely is worth seeing, but it is such a strange juxtaposition of comedy (Peter Sellers playing 3 different and funny roles) and tragedy (battle scenes of soldiers shooting and killing each other, nuclear bomb explosions)that one doesn't quite know how to take this film.  You never really get caught up in the drama because the director is always poking you in the ribs with 'Ha, watch how I spoof this next situation.'  It reminds me of a short story I wrote when I was 16, 'The Edge of Night', and in my spoof the hero, 'Her-Bob', was a little late coming home and died when the 'edge of night' fell on him and crushed him. Just because it is radical and different doesn't make it great.  I give it '8' of '10' for a very entertaining almost 2 hours.",Null,1,5,10 April 2000
The Bodyguard," Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston have good movie 'chemistry'.
","Whitney Houston, in a role that wasn't much of a stretch for her, plays a famous singer Rachel Marron. I suppose it is a reality of the entertainment business that 'fans' can get out of control, so bodyguards are necessary. Ms. Marron's handlers are also concerned that she is being targeted for death. They recognize that her personal security isn't as tight as it should be, and with much coaxing get noted specialist Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) to take the job of providing security.When we first see Frank entering the grounds of Ms Marron's home, he doesn't come in the usual way. Instead, he basically breaks in, as a way of demonstrating to himself and others how poor the security was. I really liked the role of Tony Scipelli (Mike Star). Being the current security specialist, and a somewhat intimidating looking person, he doesn't look kindly on his rather small person in Frank coming in to tell them what to do, so he challenges him. That scene alone, where Frank whips up on him is worth the movie.Farmer has been hard on himself since President Reagan was shot, because he wasn't on duty that day. That is part of what he has to overcome personally through the movie.MAJOR SPOILERS. Frank does his thing, security is top notch, there begins some romantic feelings between Ms Marron and Frank, during tense minutes at a concert, Frank figures out who the assassin is, and gets the upper hand. As a professional he realizes that a romantic relationship with his client is out of the question. As the movie ends we see he has taken a job guarding a politician again.Overall a good movie, one of my favorite Kevin Costner roles.April 2008 update: We watched it again, on the special edition DVD. It has an excellent 25-minute special on making the movie, and the picture and sound of the movie are first-rate. This is definitely a better movie than its low IMDb rating would suggest. Costner is good as the bodyguard and for a singer, Houston is excellent in her role.",Null,2,9,25 January 2005
The Beach," 'The Beach' is a really fine film, examines human motives in the search for 'paradise.'
","Some things will always remain a mystery, like why so many reviewers give 'The Beach' a poor review and low ratings. My wife and I (grandparents) both think it is a very good film, and I rate it '8' of 10.  Here's why...A young American man, played by Leo DeCaprio, having grown up on a heavy diet of TV and video games, wants to get away and find some adventure for his dull life. He goes to Thailand, meets up with a crazy man, gets a map to 'paradise', the most beautiful beach on an island, where boulders shield the beach from the ocean. He convinces a young French couple to go along, having to swim the last mile or so.One half of the island is being used for drug cultivation, and those farmers have allowed a community of paradise-seekers to settle on the other end, as long as they don't interfere, and NO ONE ELSE enters the community. Leo and his two friends manage to evade the farmers, and are accepted into the community.Soon after, when rain makes fishing difficult, Leo grabs a spear and goes out, only to be confronted by a shark. He ends up not only killing the shark and providing food for the community, he establishes himself as a rival for 'dominant male'.  That is the high point of his 'paradise' and it is all downhill from there.There certainly is a parallel here to the Adam and Eve story and eventual expulsion from paradise. Also a reminder of 'The Lord of the Flies.' Even though these 20 or 30 men and women all went to the island for 'pleasure seeking', ultimately roles need to be taken, duties accepted, not everyone agrees, jealousy starts to erode relationships, certain people seek power, and when some get seriously injured, 'out of sight, out of mind' is the remedy so as not to upset 'paradise.' In other words, they end up creating on a smaller scale the same world that they sought to escape from. Eventually this 'house of cards' starts to fall down, and ultimately everyone realizes paradise is internal, not some idyllic place.CAUTION - SPOILERS -- 'Sal', the female leader, takes Leo to town for supplies, seduces him, gains power over him.  Leo gets 'exiled' to fend off the unwelcome visitors who received his map, goes half-crazy, the island and the farmers become one big game to him.  Until the 4 visitors get shot and killed, and this wakes him up to the reality - this is no video game. He tries to get off the island, the farmers capture them and read them the riot act, order them off the island, Sal objects, is given a gun and one bullet, shoot Leo to stay on the island. She pulls the trigger, no bullet, farmer tricked her, but all trust was now destroyed, everyone else gets on raft and leaves, only Sal remains, probably does not live much longer. Last scene, Leo in terminal with computers, checks email, gets photo of group on island, taken by French girl, 'Parallel Universe, Love Francoise.' He smiles, but will be forever changed and haunted by his experience on the island.",Null,2,6,29 November 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Fitting closure to the 'Star Wars' series, now out on DVD.
","My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",Null,96,145,7 October 2004
Fast & Furious 6," I saw it for Paul Walker, after his untimely death.
","As movies go I am NOT a 'Fast and Furious' type of viewer. The stories are thin, the car and motorcycle chases, the explosions, the fights are the things that they showcase. Especially the car chase scenes. And of course, Paul Walker died in a sports car accident on city streets. I was a Paul Walker fan. My first encounter was his role in 'Pleasantville' where he was perfect for the role. He has received much unfair criticism as just a pretty face that couldn't act. But if you see all his roles and observe fairly, he was also a fine actor. And by what I am able to learn, a very nice human being.This 6th edition of the 'F&F' franchise has a host of stars. Vin Diesel is Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is the lawman, Hobbs. And Michelle Rodriguez is Letty, who had been one of them, but seems to have turned to the bad guys.The thread of a story is preventing the bad guys from stealing and using a potentially devastating new piece of software, and also getting Letty back.Another of my favorites is MMA star Gina Carano, I hope she continues to get good roles. The picture and sound on BluRay are first-rate, and the climax which involves a very large Russian transport plane trying to take off with cars dangling from it is very impressive. Including the BlyRay 'extra' that shows how they did it.Overall a nicely entertaining movie for anyone who likes this type of movie.",Null,1,4,8 June 2014
The Flowers of War," Based on the 1937 rape of the China city Nanking by the Japanese.
","Christian Bale is one of the actors I like, I find that he always creates a memorable character. In this movie he is John Miller, an American undertaker arriving in war-torn 1937 Nanking to give a recently deceased Catholic priest a proper burial.As he is making his way to the walled-in church and convent compound he has to dodge bullets and finds himself in a large flour bin, and arrives at the gates covered in white powder. This becomes important later as he needs new clothes and finds the deceased priest's vestments fit him. So he spends much of the rest of the movie dressed as a priest, and the Japanese soldiers think he is a priest.The core of the story involves two groups of approximately 12 to 14 females. One group are the 12 to 14 year old children, students that live at the school and convent. The other are the 20-something prostitutes that managed to climb over the fence and seek shelter in the basement of the compound.Over the development of the story John Miller starts out as a simple, money-grubbing man who wants to get paid for his services. He cares about no one but himself. By the end he has come to care for all the girls, young and old, plus George the young boy who helps in the convent. The movie is inspired by real events, but I don't know if the core of this story is real or not.Anyway it is a superb movie, slow-moving but meaningful. It does not sugar-coat the hardships of war. It was a very expensive movie to make, the whole compound and devastated city was a set built on a large parcel of land.The DVD extras are very interesting, showing the process to select actors, almost all unknown and inexperienced. And the interaction between them and Bale, the only 'name' actor in the movie. It was touching to see how many of them were crying as filming ended, because going their separate ways was like breaking up a family.SPOILERS: In the end John realized that a Japanese invitation for the girls to attend a party and sing was really a death knell for them. The prostitutes sacrificed themselves for the girls, allowing John to straighten their hair and make them up to look more like children, so they could go instead. Meanwhile John managed to repair an old truck and, hiding the children under some crates, managed to sneak them out of Nanking to safety.",Null,2,3,17 August 2012
The Way Back," The long escape from a Russian Gulag, easy to praise, not as easy to enjoy.
","DVD from my public library.During the time just before and during WW2 the Russians had a large number of Gulags, prisons, and they didn't need much of an excuse to put someone there. The story here focuses on one of them in Siberia, and as one of the Russian officers says, the landscape itself is your prison. It is far away from anything else and anyone trying to escape by foot would be expected to die at once point along the way.Still a small band of prisoners refused to die in the Gulag and they escaped one blizzardy winter night. The blizzard was a benefit, it helped to cover their tracks. But it was brutal, they peeled off Birch bark to make masks to keep their faces from freezing.The movie is very well filmed, and very well acted. I enjoyed it from that aspect. Plus it is a good story of the triumph of the human spirit, based on real events. But during the middle of the movie many scenes move very slowly as we watch them close to death, crossing vast areas without vegetation or water, trying to get water and food. Not all of them made it.",Null,1,3,30 May 2011
Knocked Up," An adult comedy about relationships.
","The first thing my wife said when the movie ended, 'It would have been even funnier without so much foul language.' 'Knocked Up' is a funny movie, and I suppose the younger generation expects comedies to be filled with foul language and very crude sexual references, but this movie would actually have been much better if it had been toned down.Seth Rogen is Ben Stone, a slacker and part of a larger slacker group of 20-something guys who spend most of every day thinking and talking about sex, while smoking pot, and never realistically expecting to get any. At least not from any decent young lady. They seem to be developing a website that will allow a viewer to find movies that their favorite actors have appeared nude in, and at what exact times in the movie. This they hope will make them money.Katherine Heigl is Alison Scott who works behind the scenes at the TV show 'E!' and is surprised to be given the chance to be on the air. Elated, she and her married sister go out to celebrate. At a night spot, quite by accident because the bar tender was so slow, Alison and Ben meet. He isn't really the kind of guy she would be attracted to, she isn't the kind of lady he really would expect to get very far with, but aided by the personality lubricant we call alcohol, they end up at her place, in bed. Via a very badly missed communication they end up having sex without protection and, 8 weeks later ... you guessed it, pregnant.The script and story truly are bright and entertaining, but the crude language really detracts from it. Still, it is a funny and realistic examination of the relationship difficulties of two people thrown together by an unforeseen incident. Can they make it as a couple, time will tell.",Null,0,4,10 November 2007
Begin Again," Outstanding story of flawed people getting chances to 'begin again'.
","Keira Knightley is Gretta, a Brit living in New York. Her boyfriend, singer Adam Levine as Dave, is very commercially oriented, while she likes to write songs for her own fulfillment. Mark Ruffalo is Dan, a once successful music producer who has not had success for several years, is mostly estranged from his wife and daughter, and seems about to be fired from his job. He is on the edge of self-destruction.One evening at an open mic spot he is having a beer when Gretta is talked into singing one of her compositions, accompanying herself on guitar. Dan sees something in her, and his imagination adds percussion, violin, and other instruments to her simple tune. He knows he can make a hit record with her but he has two obstacles ... she isn't interested and he can't get the record company to put up any money for producing a commercial quality demo.So, much of the movie involves Gretta and Dan finally getting together to make music, and he hits upon the idea of getting volunteer musicians and using the open spaces and sounds of the city itself for the recordings. Hailee Steinfeld is good as the teenage daughter Violet who turns out to have some ability with the guitar. Catherine Keener is good as the mother Miriam. And Adam Levine, although not an experienced actor, does fine in his role. SPOILERS: In the end everyone gets a chance to 'begin again'. Gretta decides to distribute her album herself, via online streaming, changing only $1.00, the amount she would have gotten from the record company if she had let them do it. Dan and Miriam seem to have a fresh start, Violet has a fresh relationship with her parents. Dave",Null,1,3,11 January 2015
Alien," The first in the 'Alien' series, part of a 30th anniversary BD set.
","I remember where I was in 1979 when this movie came out, I was a young professional with 5 little kids from 3 to 10 years old. We didn't have a lot of time for movies and we never got around to seeing this in the theater.Fast-forward to 2010, a re-release of this movie plus the next three in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and today I watched this one. I will watch the other three over the next week or so. Being on BluRay the sound and picture are first-rate, worth seeking out for fans of these movies.The movie has a fine cast of mostly well-established actors but I will only focus on one, Sigourney Weaver in her still iconic role as Ripley. Set somewhat in the future, as the movie begins we see that a merchant spaceship is traveling back towards Earth after a mining mission, the crew of seven are in hibernation pods. The pods open, the crew awakes, and we soon find out it is premature, but for a specific reason. A signal, possibly from intelligent life, is detected from a nearby moon and the ship is preprogrammed to wake them for a possible mission, to investigate for life forms and bring specimens back to Earth to study.They go and in the exploratory mission in fact encounter an alien life form that attaches itself to the face of one of the crew, forcing them to bring the alien back to the ship to save the man. This ultimately creates a number of really serious issues and soon survival of the crew is at stake.This of course is a very well told story and a very well made movie, indicative of its high IMDb rating.SPOILERS: For my own recollection. The crew members, one by one, are killed by the alien as it grows in size and reasoning. Ripley finally realizes only she can escape and must blow up the mother ship and its cargo to destroy the alien. As she sets that in motion and retreats to the smaller escape ship, once there she finds the alien has stowed away there also. She puts on the space suit and releases a toxic gas that gets the alien in position that she can open a door and have it expelled. Then she puts herself into a state of hibernation. In the next movie, 'Aliens', we find out that she was in that state for 57 years before being recovered.",Null,1,3,14 August 2017
The Book Thief," A delightful movie of a tough time in Nazi Germany amidst war.
","I found this movie on DVD at my public library. I purposely went into it not knowing much about it, I normally just like to see what unfolds. It is set mainly in 1938 to 1945 Nazi Germany as war breaks out and Nazis are looking to purge out the Communists and the Jews.The movie is narrated by Roger Allam as 'death', the Grim Reaper, and the movie starts with his voice-over. There is a family on a train, a mother and her two children, a daughter and a younger son. The son gets sick, bleeds from his nose, and dies. They are forced to bury him near the train line during their journey.We find out where they are going, to Stuttgart, a childless family are set to adopt the children, because the mother is unable to keep them, presumably because she is considered a communist and must flee. But the new parents get only one, the girl, and thus only half of the 'allowance' the government would give them. Times were tough, they needed the resources.The title reference belongs to the little girl, wonderful young (about 11) Canadian actress Sophie N√©lisse as Liesel Meminger. It is her story, she yearns for knowledge and is particularly attracted to books. She is in virtually (maybe actually) in every scene, the success of this movie depends on her and she carries it well. She is not so much a 'thief' as she is a 'borrower'. However right after a large book-burning in the street she picks up an unburned book and takes it home. When asked if it was hers she says 'It wasn't always mine.' The movie probably also would have fallen flat if her adopted parents had not been great, and they are, played by Geoffrey Rush as the happy and generous Hans Hubermann, and Emily Watson as the gruff and frowning Rosa Hubermann. Also good was the blonde kid she became friends with, Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner.Very nice cinematography and sound engineering. In the approximate 1:45 into the movie, the bombing scenes were filled with explosions that rattled the pictures on the wall of my home theater room.I have seen a number of movies set during Nazi Germany during that era and this is one of the best. It is the little girl's story and how she survived the war and prospered.",Null,0,0,8 April 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A gruesome story, not for the faint of heart, but Depp is a joy to watch.
","Johnny Depp is Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. But he didn't start out that way. In fact he was a young, naive man with a pretty wife and a very young daughter. But something happened to destroy his whole world in Olde London, and that is the catalyst for the story told here.Helena Bonham Carter is Mrs. Lovett who owns the bake shop below Sweeney's barber shop. Things are tough, good meat is hard to get and expensive for her meat pies, so we find her struggling. It turns out that she and Sweeney are made for each other.Good old, versatile Alan Rickman is Judge Turpin, who doesn't always have the best interests of the law in mind. His trusty sidekick is Timothy Spall as Beadle.It is hard to say what audience this movie is for. My wife had no interest in seeing it, but I enjoyed it for the performances and the production values. There is lots of blood and gore, but much of it in a whimsical manner.It is fairly well known that most of the actors, including Depp and Bonhan Carter, had never sung before in any official capacity (singing in the shower doesn't count!). The DVD has a very interesting 25 minute extra which in part discusses the process. I found Depp to have an outstanding stage singing style, but listening to Bonham Carter was not so pleasant.SPOILERS: The dishonest judge admired the young wife and had Sweeney arrested and put out to sea to die. The movie opens with him coming back to London after perhaps 15 to 18 years, with revenge on his mind. His plan was simple, to get the judge into his barber chair and slit his throat. But things didn't work out that way, the evil judge had Sweeney's now almost grown daughter held captive in his home. But Sweeney really turned demonic when someone recognized him and tried to blackmail him. That forced a killing that sparked a new enterprise. He would slit throats so that Mrs Lovett would have an ample supply of fresh meat for her pies. And they were a big hit with customers. But eventually both Sweney and Mrs Lovett met their own deaths.",Null,0,0,4 May 2008
Blades of Glory," A really dumb comedy, but something kept me watching to the end.
","Honestly, I have found very few of Will Ferrell's roles enjoyable. He just isn't a comic actor that I like. Here he is brash and rude figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels. His main competition is played by Jon Heder, who I always seem to like in his various roles. In fact, he is one of the two characters I like here. He is Jimmy MacElroy, an orphan who was adopted so that his father could turn him into a champion figure skater.The premise for the move begins when the two men get into a fight during the awards ceremony of a national competition where they tied for 1st place. As punishment, they were banned for life from individual competition. So they each went off and worked in menial jobs.One day Craig T. Nelson as the old Coach sees a TV news report where the two get into a fight again, and visualizes them as skating partners. There is no rule against them making a comeback as a skating pair, so they are entered and begin training.The bad guys turn out to be Will Arnett as Stranz Van Waldenberg and Amy Poehler as his sister Fairchild Van Waldenberg. (In real life they are husband and wife.) They are reigning National pairs champions, and they will do anything to win, including getting their sister, Jenna Fischer as Katie Van Waldenberg, to spy on Chazz and Jimmy, and later cause friction designed to break them up before the International competition.While the movie has numerous funny scenes, overall I found it to be a pretty dumb movie. Hard to recommend, but if it is a free rental as I got, might be an enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes.",Null,1,1,9 September 2007
Horrible Bosses," A plot with lots of potential but most of it wasted. Tedious movie.
","DVD from my public library system.The story revolves around and weaves through three different situations where a good, nay exemplary, employee is saddled with a horrible boss.One is a timid dental technician who has a 'sexual deviant' record, but only because he was arrested late one night taking a leak in some bushes with no one around. He works for the female dentist from hell, Jennifer Aniston as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. You have not witnesses sexual harassment until you've seen her in action.Another is the veteran employee who is up for promotion to V.P. and does everything he can to cater to the boss without scruples or morals, then finds out the boss was leading him on all this time. Kevin Spacey expertly plays the boss, Dave Harken.And the final is a faithful right-hand man in a chemical manufacturing company, but the old boss dies unexpectedly with a massive coronary (heart exploded) and the young son without scruples or morals takes over to make the workplace a hell. That horrible boss is Colin Farrell as Bobby Pellitt.So where do we go from there? See how each manages the situation to turn it around to something productive? No! They decide that the only solution is to kill all three horrible bosses. And the path they take is a bumbling one that isn't particularly good or funny. In a take-off from Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train', they decide to kill each others' bosses but it never quite works out that way.Good talent wasted in what ultimately is a horrible movie.",Null,0,1,9 December 2011
The Polar Express," The technology used to make this movie is even better than the movie itself!
","So, there was this popular book, 'The Polar Express', and a group of wealthy and famous actors, writers, and directors decided to make it into a movie. But how do you translate the magic of the book into a magical movie? You use cutting edge technology, along with very versatile actors.Tom Hanks plays 4 or 5 different roles, from a small child to a parent and a hobo, to Santa himself. Yes, his voice is different for each, but that's the easy part. They used a technology with large numbers of sensors around important facial areas, hands, arms, legs, and torso to later generate computer animation. So the animation looks very real, while the characters are obviously not real. Adults are used to model children, but the result is the form of a child. Great things, these computers are. I wonder what we did before we had them? Maybe draw each cell by hand??? The DVD has a beautiful presentation of the movie, with superb surround sound. The train sounds like a real train, if you have a good subwoofer in the system.The whole story is about believing. When the train gets to the North Pole, just a few minutes before Christmas, we see Santa's workshop is more like an industrial city, big enough to make all those gifts for kids around the world, with not a few, but thousands of elves. I liked the celebration that occurred, when the very large bag was loaded onto the sleigh, and Santa exited through large doors into the courtyard where everyone waited for him, cheering and dancing as they celebrated another successful preparation.",Null,0,2,3 January 2006
Black Mass," The mostly true story of the rise and fall of South Boston gangster Whitey Bulger.
","I was able to watch this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, she doesn't care for this type of movie.First the title, I was able to find this online, 'Black Mass' is a phrase, which essentially represents 'a perversion of the Catholic mass,'' is a metaphor for the FBI's corruption, with Bulger as the devil. 'It plays in the idea of an unholy alliance.'' Johnny Depp received a Best Actor nomination for his role as Bulger, complete with prosthetic makeup which, according to those who knew Bulger in the 1970s and 1980s, was eerily reminiscent of Bulger himself. The look, along with Depp's acting, was genuinely menacing to some of the cast members, according to the 12-minute feature on the DVD extras.Is it a good movie? Well yes if you believe that it is primarily factual. As we see in the movie Bulger leaves Boston and travels the world under assumed names until captured some years later and he is now in prison for the rest of his life. He disputes the content of the source book, as do several other key characters. Depp requested, through his lawyer, a face-to-face with Bulger, but was denied, reportedly because Bulger was not happy with the story being presented.The movie has lots of bloody violence and foul language throughout, as might be expected of ruthless mobsters. I choose to believe most of it is factual and as such is a fascinating look inside organized crime, informants, and FBI connections.",Null,0,2,14 May 2016
Nacho Libre," Funny Jack Black movie, especially for the younger set.
","I watched this movie with a couple of teenagers and they laughed often and loud. I did too. But my wife found it less funny. You have to be in a silly mood. Jack Black is Nacho, a Friar who works as a cook at an orphanage in Mexico. There never seems to be money for real food, so he always serves a sick looking brown paste with a few broken tortilla chips on the top. One day he gets the idea that if he could wrestle for money, he could buy real food. He forms a partnership with skinny Esqueleto (H√©ctor Jim√©nez, with the rubber face smile) to compete in tag team wrestling. They lose their first match, but get money anyway. The next day, salads for everyone at the orphanage! The story gets complicated when pretty young nun Sister Encarnaci√≥n (Ana de la Reguera) comes to the orphanage. Nacho seems to fall in love with her. But everything is kept on the straight and narrow.There is a funny scene where a gypsy king sends Nacho up a cliff to eat the yolk of an Eagle's egg, so that he can get the strength of an Eagle to help him wrestle. The big showdown comes when Nacho must wrestle his former idol, Ramses (played by a real Mexican wrestler).All in all not a very meaningful movie, but entertaining if you are in the right mood.",Null,0,0,5 November 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Post WWII story of three guys coming back home from the war.
","This was shown today on TCM channel.Three service men are getting discharged and are headed back home right after the war, a Captain who was in Jimmy Doolittle's command, a Seargent who as a civilian had been a banker, and a sailor who didn't see any real action but lost both hands when his ship went down under enemy fire. All three live in the same town and as they fly home in a military plane, they get in front to watch the USA go by beneath them.Fredric March is the banker, Al Stephenson, who comes home to his wife, Myrna Loy as Milly Stephenson, and his two almost grown kids. The daughter is Teresa Wright as Peggy Stephenson, and she eventually gets entangled with the Captain.Dana Andrews is the Captain, Fred Derry. He has a wife but she apparently has been running around on him while he was being a war hero, and their marriage appears headed for a crash.The surprise of the movie is newcomer Harold Russell, a real military veteran who lost both hands while training soldiers, as Homer Parrish, the sailor who comes home with hooks where his hands used to be. He has a girl back home, but now he doesn't believe he can expect her to cope with his disability.Adding a musical touch, and his natural acting, is Hoagy Carmichael as Butch Engle, owner of a popular local hangout and a relative of Homer's.This movie was made to highlight some of the issues returning war veterans faced. Not only was employment often an issue, but also the state of those who they come home to. Plus, war has changed the men, and that provides additional challenges.

The Town," Bank robbers in Charlestown, Boston.
","The title 'The Town' is a reference to that area of Boston, on the north side, called 'Charlestown', or to locals, 'The Town.' It was settled back in the early 1600s, later was annexed by Boston, and built up a heavily Irish Catholic population after the potato famine of the 1840s resulted in many Irish settling there. As the introduction tells, per square mile this area has historically produced more bank robbers than any other area in the world.It is presumed that robbery is a family trait, passed down to the kids. Ben Affleck is Doug MacRay, his own father is in prison, and his mother disappeared when he was a young boy. In present time he leads a small band of 4 who rob banks, working for the 'florist' who comes up with leads and helps to launder the stolen funds.As the movie opens they are robbing a Boston bank, and in the process find themselves required to take a hostage, British actress Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey, the assistant bank manager. Blindfolded, she is driven in broad circles and let out near the water, told to walk until her feet feel water. But when they look at her drivers license they stole, find she lives in their neighborhood, and worry that she might recognize them, so they need to consider eliminating her, something they never do.Through some wise detective work they isolate the guys they think did the crime and begin setting up surveillance to get evidence for a grand jury. This effort is led by Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley. This is a very good movie, not simplistic in its approach or in its outcome. There is a sympathetic member of the gang, who wants to make sure Claire does not suffer, and there is a hot-head who seems to have nothing to lose, after 9 years in prison for murder. It is a delicate balancing act to keep the group on task.Ben Affleck directs and stars, and had a hand in writing the script. Fine British actor Pete Postlethwaite is a key character as Fergus 'Fergie' Colm, the florist who has his hands on the operations. He died recently, this January 2011, and it was a mixed blessing seeing him in one of his last performances. Chris Cooper was Stephen MacRay, Doug's dad in prison. SPOILERS: Doug takes it upon himself to watch Claire, to see if she has anything to identify them. Unexpectedly they meet at a laundromat when she asks him if he has change, then they form a friendship which leads to a love affair. She thinks he is a rock-breaker, a laborer. They both decide they want to get out of Boston, maybe to Florida. But when Doug tries to get out of the 'business' Fergie threatens him and those he cares about, so he agrees to do the last job, a $3.5Million heist of the Cathedral of Boston, Fenway Park. It doesn't go well, an alarm is tripped, police arrive, a gunfight ensues, eventually all are killed but Doug who escapes in a police uniform. He makes it back to the florist and disposes of him, hides a satchel of money in the community garden that Claire works in, and heads out of town by train. We see that Claire used the money for improvements to a community center for the kids. We see Doug on the bayous of Florida, and the orange he left with the money is her clue to look him up.",Null,1,2,17 January 2011
Underworld Awakening," Fun to watch India Eisley develop as an actress.
","There is a TV show, 'The Secret Life of the American Teenager' running for 4 years now and India Eisley plays the little sister of the main character Amy. I don't watch it anymore but from the first episode she was in I couldn't take my eyes off her any time she was in the scene. She has a natural acting style and a particular look that captures the camera and doesn't let it go. So it was nice to see her here, in something totally different, as the lab-created daughter of Selene. And she even uses a type of British accent.As I watched the movie I found myself wondering if many fans actually watch it for the story, or for the characters and the action. There is lots of action, and much of it is the bloody, gory type. Kate Beckinsale of course is back as Selene. There is some sort of ongoing battle between the Vampires and the Lycans who change into these beasts that look to be the size of a large great ape. Selene has her hands full fighting them.In this story Selene and Michael are wounded, jump in the water, and a type of explosive device is set off. Next thing we know she is encased in a frozen state in the lab of Stephen Rea as Dr. Jacob Lane of Antigen Corporation. When she breaks out she thinks a day has passed but it in fact was 12 years. She finds out during that time she has been given a daughter and much of the rest of the movie has her fighting to retrieve her daughter that has been captured and brought to a hidden location.That daughter is India Eisley as Eve . She doesn't have a large part, but an important one, and her short time on-screen is very effective. I look for her to break out into bigger roles, as she is still a teenager.I can take or leave this sort of movie, although Beckinsale is terrific as Selene. I did particularly enjoy one scene near the end when she is fighting the strongest and baddest of the Lycans, we see her reach into his abdomen then withdraw her hand. He says 'You know I will heal right away.' She responds, 'I am counting on it', then we see she is holding the pin from a grenade which now is sealed inside him. As she ducks around a corner there is a big explosion and bits of flesh flying through the air.Camp.",Null,1,4,22 May 2012
Closer," There are no likable characters, but an interesting movie if you like watching people cheat.
","Set primarily in London, 'Closer' has only four characters who matter to the story. Natalie Portman is young New Yorker Alice (or maybe Jane?), new in London, and who has a chance meeting with Dan (Jude Law). Maybe it is because she was looking left instead of right at the intersection and is hit by the vehicle. Dan is a London newsman, his job is writing obituaries for the newspaper. Julia Roberts is a bit daring as Anna , a photographer. Quite by different accident, Dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) comes into Anna's life, then they all come into each other's lives, for better or for worse. Mostly for worse. None of them are 'model' people, and Larry is certainly not what you would want your doctor to be, or maybe your doctor is! How would you know? Interesting character studies, but with no likable characters, I found myself a bit unconcerned after it ended.SPOILERS. Portman seemed intent on shattering her 'girl' image and here plays a stripper, in some very revealing costumes. Roberts also plays against her usual roles, as here she cheats sexually willingly. Larry surfs the internet when he can, looking for dirty-talking young girls for sex. Angry that Anna put him off, Dan pretends to be a horny girl and lures Larry to the aquarium to meet Anna, as retribution. But Anna and Larry hit it off, and eventually get married. But Anna still has groans for Dan and she cheats. Larry is controlling, and by sheer will gets Alice in bed. Each in turn destroys the confidence and love of the other. At the end, Alice returns to New York, we see on her passport that she really is Jane.",Null,0,2,21 May 2005
Suicide Squad," DC comics villains team up to save the world.
","I watched this movie at home on DVD from my public library, when my wife was out of town. It is not her kind of movie anyway.The premise is interesting, some supernatural villains have surfaced and the fate of the world is in the balance. A high-ranking government official hatches a secret, unofficial plan ... a group of highly dangerous, incarcerated meta humans will be sprung to use their special powers to defeat the villains. What is their incentive to cooperate? Each is restrained while a tiny capsule, the size of a grain of rice, is injected into their necks. If a button is pushed the capsule will explode with such force that their head will be blown off. We actually see it work when one of them tries to go rogue at the first sign of conflict.I don't give this movie overall very high marks. There are no good guys, everyone is bad to different degrees. Much of the fighting in the middle of the movie are mysterious faceless creatures. Maybe a fan of all the DC characters would know what they are but for me it didn't seem very interesting.My favorite characters are Margot Robbie playing a goofy but dangerous Harley Quinn. And her boyfriend/lover/husband perhaps, Jared Leto all but unrecognizable as The Joker. And, Viola Davis as the rogue government agent Amanda Waller. The other characters are uninteresting in comparison. Even Ben Affleck as Batman makes brief appearances in Gotham at the beginning and at the end. Can be an interesting 2 hours of entertainment if you like these characters. The ending sets up for a sequel which is already planned.",Null,0,1,11 February 2017
Elf," Whimsical fairy tale, repeated viewing has become our Christmas Day tradition.
","Will Ferrell plays Buddy, who grew up with Santa's helpers, thinking he was an Elf. This is his story. Ferrell is much better here than he is in other movies. In fact, this is the only role I like Ferrell in. Pleasant viewing for those who like a modern fairy tale.Born to a single mom, baby Buddy was placed in an orphanage, and one Christmas night, while Santa (Ed Asner) was eating a cookie, crawled out of his bed and into Santa's toy sack. Upon discovery when Santa got back to the North Pole, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raised Buddy, who was quite larger than the other elves. Finding out his true identity, and who his real father was (James Caan), Buddy set out to find him in New York.When he does, comedy follows, as Buddy doesn't know any of the customs of the real world. In the process he makes a friend in pretty Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) who was dressed as an Elf, working at a store preparing for Christmas.Self absorbed dad is made to see the light, And eventually enlists Buddy to help create new, interesting children stories for new books.December 2019 update: I first saw this in 2005 but today, Christmas 2019, we just finished watching it again.

Shutter Island," A dark psychological thriller, set in the institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island off the Massachusetts coast.
","The story is set in 1954, within easy memory of World War 2. While it is in color, but with subdued colors, it evokes memories of the 1940s and 1950s film noir genre.A prisoner named Rachel has escaped and two US Marshals are on the ferry to Shutter Island, dispatched to help investigate the incident. Things become even more complicated when a storm, which they refer to as a hurricane, hits.Leonardo DiCaprio is certainly good and convincing as US Marshal Teddy Daniels. The Marshal with him, and who refers to Teddy as 'boss', is Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule.In the institution are Ben Kingsley as the head doctor, Dr. John Cawley. Another doctor is Max von Sydow as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring. Ted Levine with his ominous voice is the Warden. John Carroll Lynch, who was Marge's husband in 'Fargo', is Deputy Warden McPherson.As Teddy gets inside the gates of the institution we notice that his treatment by the staff is a bit unusual. Yet when he requests information, or a meeting with others, it is usually provided for him, but it appears with some reluctance.This is a very good mystery, and one where seeing it a second time can give the viewer a whole different perspective.MAJOR SPOILERS follow, where I explain my take on the whole movie. There probably are other explanations that are plausible. Please read no further if you have not seen the movie.This is an example of a story with an unreliable narrator, otherwise it cannot make sense. Daniels is that unreliable narrator. He tells others that his wife died from smoke inhalation in their apartment, but later we find out that is a made-up memory to mask what really happened. We also find out that Daniels isn't is real name, it also has been made up to mask unpleasant memories, his real name is Laeddis. His wife was Michelle Williams as Dolores Chanal, we only see her in flashbacks. After the fire in their apartment they moved to a Lake House, where Daniels (Laeddis) comes home to find she had drowned their children, and in a fit of passion he killed her. He is not a US Marshal, he has been a patient for the criminally insane for two years. In a last-ditch effort to get him to recognize and live with reality, his 'visit as a Marshall' was set up, and his partner was really his primary psychiatrist. In the end it didn't work, he was still not dealing with reality and what must have been an accepted procedure in 1954, was last seen headed for the lighthouse where a partial lobotomy was to be preformed. In the alternate explanation, he DID realize who he really was and acted like he didn't in effect choosing the lobotomy because he couldn't live with the reality.",Null,2,6,29 July 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Its best feature is giving your subwoofer a great workout!
","It was almost 3 years ago when I saw the initial Captain America movie with Chris Evans in the title role. I wrote 'This is my kind of movie.' And it is, a good story and appropriate action.I did not like this followup nearly as much. The story is OK but as seems to be the trend in modern action movies, too overloaded with visual effects, gunfire, and great explosions. It just so happened that this is the first movie I watched with my new powered subwoofer and the low bass in this movie gives it quite a workout. Even at moderate viewing volume I was able to measure SPL levels as high as 98 dB at my viewing position. That's a lot of bass!! Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers, aka Captain America. So that the story can facilitate him looking just like he did at the end of the last movie, he has been frozen in a state of suspended life for most of the past 70 years. As a result he had no knowledge of historical events during the 1950s through the early 2000s.But the big current event was the treason by the agency that now is calling itself (in secret) Hydra. They have developed a very long list of individuals who they say need to be eliminated, and new machines are scheduled to be activated to get this done. Steve's job, along with a few loyal allies, is to stay alive as they hunt him down, and to stop Hydra. Other key roles are filled by Samuel L. Jackson as good guy Nick Fury. Scarlett Johansson as good guy Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow. Plus Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka the flying Falcon, and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill. Also good to see good guy Emily VanCamp as Kate, aka Agent 13.The leader of the bad guys is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, along with Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier.The story is OK, to me the explosions and gunfire overdone to the point of becoming tedious while waiting for additional story elements. But it sure gets your subwoofer working!",Null,1,2,27 September 2014
Capote," Not a Capote bio, but focuses on his research into his famous book 'In Cold Blood.'
","DVD from my public library, excellent picture and sound, with few extras, but of interest is some actual footage of Truman Capote.This movie spans late 1959 through 1965. Capote already was a successful writer, but the results of his exploration into the small town Kansas murder of the family of 4 catapulted him to international recognition and riches.Philip Seymour Hoffman is superb as Truman Capote, winning the Oscar for Best Actor. His friend and assistant was Catherine Keener as author Nelle Harper Lee (to Kill a Mockingbird). Chris Cooper is local law enforcement man Alvin Dewey. And Bruce Greenwood gives a low-key performance as Jack Dunphy, Capote's long-time companion.In a real sense, the events and resulting book that gave Capote fame, also took his life away. As the 1960s grew on, and the two convicted killers' executions (by hanging) were delayed by appeals, Capote grew frustrated that he could not complete his book. Even though he had befriended the two men, in the last stages he was impatient for them to die, to write his final chapter. It was perhaps the guilt of those feelings which pushed Capote to the drug and alcohol abuse that killed him at age 59.Superbly made and acted movie.",Null,0,1,29 April 2006
Life of Pi," 'So, which story do you prefer?', asks Pi Patel.
","'Life of Pi' is one of those stories that get you thinking and people talking about 'what does it all mean?' The line, near the end, where adult Pi asks the writer, 'Which story do you prefer?' is telling, because he doesn't say 'Which story do you believe?' This is not a story with one definite answer of what really happened on the boat, at sea for most of a year. The author of the source book doesn't even take a stand, he wrote it to be a modern day fable, a well-told yarn.I find the movie best enjoyed just by watching it and enjoying the story, and the beautiful cinematography without worrying too much about deeper meanings. It is a story about young Pi (short for Piscine) Patel who has a personal exploration with spiritual matters, and when he finds himself at sea in a lifeboat, with an adult Bengal Tiger, he uses his faith, his belief in God, to carry him through and trust in ultimate survival. And it doesn't matter if any individual viewer believes in God, only that young Pi does.Suraj Sharma is teenager Pi Patel in the 1970s, his family is forced to sell their zoo animals, all are on board a Japanese freight ship when, in a mighty storm the ship sinks, and the next morning Pi finds himself sharing the boat with an injured Zebra, a Hyea, and after a while, hiding under the tarp, Richard Parker, the adult Bengal Tiger. Eventually only Pi and Richard are left on the boat, and much of the movie is their saga of survival before eventually landing on the beach of Mexico.The movie starts and ends in modern times, with Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi Patel, a college professor living in Canada with his wife and two children. An author, Rafe Spall as the Writer , is there to learn of Pi's story and write a book. In the end as Pi tells of the Japanese representatives of the shipping line visiting him in the hospital, they found his story hard to believe. So he told them a second, different, simpler story. When the writer questions the stories, searching for an answer, Pi asks, 'Which story do you prefer?' The author of the book things we should prefer the first story, because everyone else dies anyway, but it is a much better story.I have it on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are both just great.

Lost in Translation," Filmed in Tokyo, with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, one of the better movies I've seen in a while.
","For anyone who wants a synopsis of this movie, the critics Ebert and Berardinelli have excellent, complete reviews of 'Lost in Translation', and they both give it their highest ratings.My wife and I saw it tonight on DVD, with DTS 5.1 sound and both think it is a remarkable movie. I like Bill Murray in just about everything, and this will go down as one of his strongest performances, as Bob, the actor in Japan for a week doing whisky commercials. Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, the young wife virtually abandoned in the city to do her own thing as her photographer husband (Ribisi) goes to various locations for shoots.What I liked most was the realistic feel. Being in a strange city, with unusual customs and a language you have no hope of understanding. Meeting someone who because of circumstances (age, marital status) will only ever be a friend. Being able to talk freely. Reflecting on where we've been and where we might be going. Many of the negative comments about this movie relate to an impression that it is 'boring.' I'll put on my 'maturity hat' and state that anyone who thinks 'Lost In Translation' is boring simply was not able, at least while they watched it, appreciate the inner beauty of this movie.The scene that made the whole story come together for me was when they were in one of their hotel rooms (doesn't matter which), overhead shot, they were in bed talking, fully clothed, he is on his back staring at the ceiling, she is on her side, eyes probably closed, the tips of her feet barely touching the side of his leg, and he moves his hand and puts it on her feet. Then the scene fades to black. It is the kind of tender, non-sexual touch that tells us how close they have become, and that theirs is a relationship of mutual trust and admiration, not one of lust.People like Bob and Charlotte really exist, and they really do meet up in very similar situations. After a week, they must go their separate ways, he to his family and activities of his kids, she to wait for her husband and figure out how to get out of the rut. We sense that he does not love her the way she needs, and we wonder what will happen.Before IMDb eliminated its discussion feature there was a lot of dialog about what he whispered to her in the street at the end of the movie. To have made it obscure is suitable, it allows each viewer to imagine what they thought he would have said. In real life he is 34 years older, he does have a family, she is still just trying to figure her life out, to me it would have been a comment of genuine affection and encouragement that things will work out well for her, either with her husband or with someone else.",Null,294,408,7 February 2004

Superb video and sound, the powered subwoofer was given a good workout.'Dr Strange' is a character created by Marvel, first appearing in comics in 1963. Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats.This 2016 movie serves as the origin story, a brilliant but egotistical surgeon has a car accident which severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery. He searches the globe for a way to repair them and in Kathmandu encounters the Ancient One. After becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's students, he becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts as well as martial arts. Along with knowing many powerful spells, he has a costume with two mystical objects‚Äîthe Cloak of Levitation and Eye of Agamotto‚Äîwhich give him added powers. Strange is aided along the way by his friend and valet, Wong, and a large assortment of mystical objects.Benedict Cumberbatch is Dr. Stephen Strange and Rachel McAdams is his girlfriend, Dr Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is Wong and Tilda Swinton is The Ancient One, borrowing from the dark side to live for so long. In this movie Strange's chief adversary is Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius, out to defeat time for the universe.This is good 'popcorn' entertainment with well-respected actors. The story itself is rather simple and not very different from many fictional sorcery and magic stories. The movie borrows heavily from such movies as 'Back to the Future' (space-time continuum) and 'The Matrix' (bullet time cinematography and mystical double-speak), 'Inception' (bending roads and buildings), and all those shows which have featured multiverses and alternate universes. What is great here are all the digital effects and the sound track. Yes, just 'popcorn' entertainment, and Stan Lee makes his usual cameo appearance, sitting in a bus laughing at a comic book.

We Are Marshall," They 'are' Marshall.
","It is factual that the charter plane carrying home the Marshall football team crashed and burned, killing all on board, on November 14, 1970. My second daughter was 1 month old. Only 4 varsity team members survived, those who had stayed behind for various injuries and personal reasons.This is almost two movies, a short one followed by the longer one. The first part of this movie, 'We Are Marshall', deals with the events leading up to the crash, and how the community deals with it. The second part deals with the efforts to re-build football at the Huntington, WV University.The college administration was ready to indefinitely suspend plans for football, but the team captain who had stayed home for a shoulder injury got virtually all the students to gather outside the board meeting location and repeatedly shout 'we are Marshall' as a sign they supported beginning again right away. Things were not easy, after going through a long list of former Marshall football stars, all rejecting the offer, someone showed up out of the blue for the head coaching job.Matthew McConaughey is superb as Jack Lengyel, an unknown who came to Marshall to pump up the enthusiasm and get things going again. I don't know how true to the real character he was, but I know that he made the movie most interesting. Jack held no false pretenses, he directly approached everyone with what he thought needed to be done. Including a rival coach to learn how to run the 'veer' offense.Key was David Strathairn as University President Dedmon, who needed to get the NCAA to approve letting true freshmen play varsity football, otherwise Marshall could not field a team, and could not recruit effectively. After letters and unreturned phone messages failed to get NCAA approval, Jack had a pivotal conversation with Dedmon. Asked if he was married, and getting an answer '25 years', Jack went on to say 'I'll bet you didn't propose by phone, and I'll bet she didn't say YES by letter. You need to go to Kansas City and talk to the NCAA in person.' Which he did, in the rain, and got approval.Mashall wasn't successful right away, at least not in the 'V' column, but they were successful at getting the tragedy behind them. Eventually they became very successful, surpassing anything they did before 1970. This movie is a telling of that story and it is a superb human-interest story, a very-well made one.",Null,4,4,7 November 2007
Barry Lyndon," Redmond Barry and Barry Lyndon, the Ecstacy and the Agony.
","I had never seen this 1975 movie until now, as part of the 9-movie Kubrick DVD set recently released. It was made about 5 years after Ryan O'Neal achieved fame in 'Love Story'. It is a long movie, even by Kubrick standards, right at 3 hours, originally with an intermission. With narration throughout the movie, it is more like having the book read to you, with visual images and sufficient dialog added. And at the beginning we are told Redmond Barry will become Barry Lyndon, so as the movie unfolds I found myself watching and wondering when and how.Overall I found I very enjoyable. It is mostly a serious subject but done with much humor and whimsy.The story is set in the 18th century, and includes the Seven Years' War years of 1756 through 1763. It ends in 1789. The star is Ryan O'Neal as Irish teenager Redmond Barry, probably in the early 1750s, when his dad died in a duel. Young Redmond unfortunately was infatuated with his slightly older cousin and, to keep her from marrying an English officer, challenged the man to a duel with pistols. Redmond apparently killed the officer and, for his protection was given a horse and some money and told to disappear to Dublin. Only much later did he find out it was a ruse, his pistol did not have a lead ball, and the officer lived and married his cousin.But all of this set Redmond onto a whole new trajectory, becoming enlisted in the British army to fight France, then as a deserter became part of the Prussian army. All the while learning the ways of the world. Unfortunately he learned to survive by trickery and gambling.As he grew older he had few options for leading a successful life but became attracted to the young wife of an older, crippled nobleman. When he died, Redmond married the Lady Lyndon and he took the name Barry Lyndon. This never set well with the son of the deceased man, something which would eventually cause Barry his own demise.",Null,1,1,19 April 2013
Interstellar," This is my kind of movie, Sci-Fi with a good story and lots of action.
","I am a Scientist, and I have always been fascinated with travel into space, ever since I looked up in the 1950s with my dad and spotted the Russian Sputnik satellite overhead in the night sky. This movie, 'Interstellar', is my kind of movie. I saw it at home on Blu-Ray.As one would expect for this type of movie the picture and sound are both superb, and many times the deep, rumbling bass rattled the fireplace grill and the framed posters on my wall. It is long, at 2 hours and 45 minutes to the closing credits, but every minute was attention-grabbing. I will watch it again.The setting is the future, not too distant, and Matthew McConaughey is former Astronaut Cooper, now a corn farmer. Where he lives are recurring giant dust storms, a barometer of how close the planet Earth is to no longer being able to support human life. Everyone is worried but also busy surviving.Cooper also has a bright 10-yr-old daughter and together they make sense of some strange happenings in her bedroom, books falling off the shelves, dust making patterns, they figure out some coordinates that take them to the top secret location of the remaining NASA headquarters. In secret they have been developing a space ship capable of going to the outer reaches of the Solar system to encounter a wormhole, they think put there by intelligent beings, to allow passage into a distant system that may have planets that can support human life. Cooper is needed as pilot for the mission, not knowing if he will ever return to his family.One of the scientists making the trip is Anne Hathaway as Brand, daughter of the old scientist leading the project. Plus several others. There is an intelligent robot with Bill Irwin as the voice of TARS. (As an aside, Irwin had a recurring role on the old TV series 'Northern Exposure' and his presence here brought back fond memories.)So the whole story gets pretty complicated and cannot always follow good science. Still it is extremely well presented, with a totally novel ending. Writer/director Nolan borrows from his 'Inception' bag of tricks, when every hour on a planet near a black hole is like 7 years back home, so everyone on Earth ages far ahead of the crew. Really, really good movie.SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end Cooper and his ship are being sucked into a black hole, the ship is being ripped apart, he ejects and, instead of being consumed he ends up in a type of matrix behind the walls and bookshelves of his daughter's room, he can see her, he realizes it was actually him who those years earlier had given her the signals. Forward to a few years later, he is on an orbiting sanctuary, while he contemplates joining Brand now on a new planet trying to colonize it.",Null,3,11,3 April 2015
Full Metal Jacket," The American Marines in Vietnam.
","I clearly remember when this movie came out, and I avoided it because of the title, the mental image of the title, seeing someone wear a full metal jacket. Now that I am a gunman I understand the reference, ammunition with a soft metal core, commonly lead, jacketed with a harder metal, like brass. Interesting title, it was extracted from a line spoken in the script.The story is split roughly into two almost equal parts. The first takes a rag-tag band of new Marine recruits and follows them through basic training where they become skilled killing machines. Matthew Modine is Pvt. J.T. 'Joker' Davis, gaining his nickname for his tendency to look for humor in almost any situation. Vincent D'Onofrio is overweight and out of shape Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence , given his nickname for his general ineptness. R. Lee Ermey, who also happens to be an ex-Marine Sgt. is Gny. Sgt. Hartman. He had originally been hired as a consultant but was so good he was hired in the role.The second half of the story has the men in Vietnam in the 1960s. Joker ends up as a reporter, while the others are infantry. There they meet up with bad-ass Adam Baldwin as Animal Mother . He ends up being instrumental in a rescue and flushing out a sniper.Some critics have complained that the story isn't cohesive, but that didn't bother me. It seemed to offer a very realistic view of basic training, and some idea what the American soldiers experienced 'In Country.' A bit of battle, a bit of street prostitutes, a bit of interviewing for views on the war. I could have been there, I was drafted in 1968, but ended up staying in the USA. A good friend of mine was on the front lines, shooting and being shot at. SPOILERS: Each half of the movie ended with very dramatic events. 'Gomer Pyle' had been humiliated and pushed so hard that in the end of basic went a bit crazy, at night in the latrine area, right before graduation, he shot and killed the drill Sgt. then put the gun in his own mouth and killed himself. Then the climax of the second half was an encounter with an unseen sniper who killed two of the soldiers. When they finally surrounded the building it turned out to be a young Vietnamese woman, probably a teenager. She is shot, and lying on the floor strewn with rubble, is in obvious pain and saying over and over, 'shoot me, shoot me.' Joker puts her out of her pain and the movie ends with the Marines marching and singing the 'M-I-C-K-E-Y, M-O-U-S-E' song.",Null,0,1,16 April 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Angry and profane characters, could have been much better.
","This movie received lots of Oscar buzz and the actors really are great. My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library.There are a number of writer/directors who relish in angry, profane characters with few redeeming values. This is one of those movies. 
Frances McDormand is Mildred, divorced and angry, mostly because her daughter was raped and killed 7 months earlier and she doesn't think the local police are working hard enough on the case.On the small road to her rural home she notes three old, dilapidated billboards and decides to use them to poke fun at the local police chief, hoping to shame him into working harder on her daughter's case.Sam Rockwell is one of the mostly inept local cops, Dixon. He is a drunk and a hot head. The captain is played by Woody Harrelson as Willoughby. He has a not-so-secret secret, that he is dying from cancer.Ultimately the movie turns into a revenge story, and it doesn't even matter if the revenge is towards the guilty ones. Overall mostly a disappointment because this could have been a much better movie if it had been better written and the characters made a bit more appealing.",Null,1,2,7 April 2018
Empire of the Sun," Christian Bale's performance as the English boy in China during the war.
","I viewed this movie mainly for the performance of young (12 or 13) Christian Bale, and I was not disappointed. This is a rather long, involved movie, about the British living in China during the 1940s, and suddenly finding themselves swept up in the Japanese invasion, which coincided with the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 8th, 1941. Bale, as young Jim Graham, separated from his parents, is in virtually every scene, and is required to carry the movie. He does it admirably.John Malkovich is one of the Americans, Basie, that Jim encounters in his journey. It seems that Basie only cares for his own survival, and only befriends others that may help him in that regard. Other Americans he meets include Joe Pantoliano and a young adult Ben Stiller.The story is based on the book, written by a real British citizen who as a boy went through the same experience. It is not clear how much of what we see is fact, how much has been dramatized for the movie, however since it is a Spielberg movie, I suspect the whole story is very plausible.SPOILERS. Expecting some action from the Japanese, Jim's family left their home and went to a hotel in Shanghai for a few nights. While there, the Japanese invasion began. As Jim and his parents were holding hands, trying to make it through the thick crowd, Jim dropped his model 'Zero' plane, and when he let go for just the few seconds, mom and dad were swept away. Jim found himself alone to survive. He ended up in an internment camp, where food was scarce and may died. Over the years there he lost his enchantment for the Japanese. Several years older, when the war ends, he is reunited with his parents, who looked like they had it pretty easy during the war. Through the experience Jim went from a pampered young boy to a young man.",Null,1,4,18 September 2006
American Sniper," The focus on Chris Kyle and how the job of sniper changed him.
","I am not a native Texan, but having lived in Texas almost 30 years makes me almost a native. When Chris Kyle was murdered in 2013 by a war veteran he was trying to help it made big news in these parts. So it was with that in mind my wife and I went into viewing this movie.In summary it is a super-good movie, thanks to Clint Eastwood who directed and supplied some of the music, and Bradley Cooper who did such a fine job portraying Chris Kyle. It shows the difficulty these young men and women operate under in a foreign land to fight terrorism. It can't help change you, and most of the core story here is how it changed Kyle, and his ability to deal with the real world and fit back into his family after his last tour of duty.It is based on his own book, but some of the incidents have been questioned, and surely some changes were made when developing the script for the movie. Still it is a very gripping drama, as much of the action is portrayed as what the sniper sees through his scope as he surveys the comings and goings below his usual high perch atop a building.Bradley Cooper is super as Chris Kyle and Sienna Miller is super as his wife Taya Kyle.",Null,0,5,18 June 2015
Glory," The story of the first black regiment to fight for the North in the Civil War.
","What I don't understand, watching 'Glory', is how military leaders can expect to win the war, or even battles, without forming a strategy for fighting. We see them marching, coming upon enemy troops, then firing until one retreats. Perhaps they really did have planning meetings before each actual conflict, like the one which ended this movie, however the director chose not to give us any glimpse of that and I think it was a mistake to film it that way.However, that little picking of nits aside, 'Glory' is a fine film, and the main characters are very well portrayed by Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, and Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for his supporting role. It had to be set in the Civil War (1862 and 1863) and based on actual events, but it is not so much a story about the war as it is about a group of men feeling their worth, and a barely competent leader (Broderick) learning how to lead. SPOILERS follow, please read no further. The government wanted only a 'token' black regiment, one to work but not fight. They had difficulty even getting guns, shoes, and uniforms. Much of the story is their realizing they were fighting for themselves, not for the 'white man.' In the final scene, their leader volunteered them for the difficult task of leading a charge on a Union fort, hopefully paving the way for other troops to come in and clean up. The fort was never taken, their leader died as did most of the men. However their bravery resulted in 180,000 additional black troops fighting for the North and influencing the outcome of this Civil War. Great movie, presented nicely on DVD wth Dolby 5.1 sound.",Null,0,1,23 December 2003
The Devil Wears Prada," Entertaining look at the fashion business.
","I didn't know much about this movie as I began watching it, but I knew with Meryl Streep in it I would like it. In her role here as difficult fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly she shows us once again why she is among a rare few who are the best in the business.But the story is really about young and smart Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) from the midwest, who turned down a chance to study law at Stanford for the lure of journalism in NYC. She is interviewed for a job as an assistant to Miranda, without even knowing who Miranda is. There is nothing about her fashion sense (none) that would make her right for this job, but Miranda hires her anyway, not happy with he last few.Brit Emily Blunt plays Emily, Miranda's other assistant. Many refer to this movie as a comedy, but it really isn't. Oh, there are many funny things in it, but it really is more a serious look at the fashion industry, and how a young woman 'comes of age' in this difficult situation.SPOILERS. Andy eventually begins to dress the part, and with her strong desire to prove Miranda wrong does everything she can to be the best. Even securing copies of the unpublished manuscript of the next Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters. But her boyfriends and other friends take a back seat and relationships suffer. Andy finally realizes what is important, walks away from Miranda and the fashion industry, and gets a job with a newspaper. The hiring editor tells her, 'Miranda says you were her biggest disappointment, and we would have to be crazy not to hire you.'",Null,0,1,15 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Rather silly and dull movie, but the beautiful images and great sound make it worth a watch.
","This second prequel is similar to the first, but here Jar-Jar Binks isn't as obnoxious and his short screen time didn't detract too much. The story is silly, a far alien planet is manufacturing an army of clones of a bounty hunter and the Jedi knights have to travel to keep peace. There is a tremendous final battle scene, a bit over long and over done. No 'travel time' is depicted anywhere in the movie, so we in effect have people traveling many, many light-year distances in a very short time. Plus, when they communicate over very great distances, it is virtually instantaneous like a cell phone call. I suppose they figured out how to greatly speed up light speed. My bigger complaint is the acting. Natalie Portman was not a good choice. Even though I am a fan of hers, and she was just perfect as the mature little girl in movies like 'Beautiful Girls' and 'Leon, the Professional', in the 'Star Wars' movies her acting is very wooden, her changes of vocal and facial expression are almost nonexistent. Although she is striking in her tight white costume, she comes across as just an older version of her little girl characters. It could be that she is simply very limited as an actress. However, Ewan McGregor once again was very well cast as Obi-Wan.
I enjoyed the movie for what I intended, just a fun movie with a great sound track and gorgeous images. However in total it is a silly, simple movie and just a shadow of the movies which represent the original Star Wars Trilogy.",Null,2,8,5 January 2004
Corpse Bride," Funny, whimsical story using puppet animation.
","I was a bit disappointed, only because of the publicity this little film received. I was expecting something better. But taken as it is, this is a pleasant, rather short animated fable. In the 'extras' we see that small sets and puppets are used for the animation, and it is done very well. It therefore has more of a '3-D' look than we see in computer animation like Shrek or Monsters Inc. Another interesting feature is the coloration. In the 'alive' world the colors are very muted and dark, almost black and white. But in the 'dead' world things are very colorful and bright. It makes an interesting way to contrast the two, so that death doesn't seem depressing at all.The story is very simple. A marriage is arranged, the intended meet for the first time the day before their wedding. The groom is very shy, and is having trouble saying his lines, which MUST be recited just so for the marriage to be valid. So he goes off by himself into the woods to practice. This environment is suitable, he says the lines perfectly, and slips the ring on a twig as practice. But the 'twig' turns out to be the protruding skeletal hand of a young woman who was killed on the eve of her wedding, and was still dressed in wedding garb. So, the movie deals with the complications of this young man accidentally gaining a 'corpse bride.' SPOILERS FOLLOW. The dead world considers his marriage to the corpse legitimate and there he meets lots of other dead people, plus his old pet puppy. But he longs for his real intended bride, so they find someone who cooks up a potion to get them back to the alive world. Complications arise but at the climax the young man is about to drink poison so that he can become dead to make the marriage to the corpse legitimate. But the corpse realizes that he really belongs with his alive intended bride, she stops him, and all ends well.",Null,0,0,13 March 2006
Lion," His name means 'Lion', orphan searches for his home in India.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is a well-made movie of an essentially true story, it shows the connections humans can make with each other.The story originates in a small village in India, young Saroo's mother is so poor she carries rocks to earn some money to feed the small family. Saroo's brother is going to a nearby town to work at night, after much begging brings Saroo, 5, along with him. But the boy is too young, he cannot stay awake, when he does wake up can't find his brother and ends up on a train being taken out of service and headed 1000 miles away to Calcutta. Once there Saroo finds that he cannot even speak their language, cannot explain where he is from, and ends up in an orphanage in 1986.Nicole Kidman is Australian Sue Brierley, married but without children. When she was but 12, we eventually learn, she had a vision of a small brown boy coming up to her, she interpreted that as a message. As an adult she and her husband decided there were already enough children in the world, they would adopt orphans from India instead of having their own.Dev Patel plays the grownup Saroo Brierley, some 20+ years later in Tasmania. He loves his adopted mom and dad but never quit having the visions of his home and family all those years ago. Eventually, using Google Earth on his computer, with a lot of persistence, he tracks down his place of origin.In a nice touch the end of the film includes clips of the real Saroo and his adopted Australian mom in his original village in India, meeting up with those he had left behind all those years earlier.A very worthwhile movie.",Null,2,3,7 June 2017
Forrest Gump," A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.
","Once again, I watched 'Forrest Gump' for Christmas. While it isn't a 'Christmas Movie', to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine. Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way 'A Wonderful Life' has become a classic.",Null,3,7,2 September 2001
Gone Baby Gone," A question of ethics and morals, what would you do?
","A very good movie, directed by Ben Affleck in the same Boston neighborhoods he grew up in. A young girl disappears, the police and private investigators search for her, but when you don't find a child within the first day or so, usually it means the child is 'Gone Baby Gone.'In the movie Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie tells a cop he is 31, even though he looks like he is 20. He really was 31 when the filming was done. The younger brother of the director, he does a great job as the neighborhood small-time investigator hired by the family to help find the little girl. Michelle Monaghan as Angie Gennaro is his girlfriend and partner.Morgan Freeman is good as Capt. Jack Doyle, the police chief whose men are investigating the disappearance. One of the detectives is Ed Harris as Det. Remy Bressant, originally from Louisiana. His partner is John Ashton as Det. Nick Poole.The grieving mother is Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, who claims she was gone for about 30 minutes when her daughter disappeared. As Kensie begins to talk to those who know her, he soon finds holes in her story. Things are not as straightforward as everyone first thought.It would spoil the movie experience to know how all this turned out. But in the end many will be asking themselves, 'What would I have done?' The movie doesn't seek to answer that question.SPOILERS. The mother had been at a bar, drinking and snorting drugs when her daughter disappeared. She had also been working small jobs as a local 'mule', delivering drugs for a dealer. In one trip, she and her even more shady boyfriend stole the large sum of cash and hid it. The daughter was actually removed from her home as a way to give her a better life. Her brother in law was involved, as well as Jack Doyle, and in a late night ambush, set up by the cops, the drug dealer was killed, they faked the little girl's jump into a deep pond, and Doyle after resigning planned to take the little girl away and raise her as his own.

"Monsters, Inc."," Superb animation, a most inventive story, fun for the whole family.
","'Monsters Inc' came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life', 'Shrek', and 'Disney's Tarzan' are in. First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy 'kitty' with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer.

The Lost City of Z," As the British say 'Lost City of Zed.'
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are first-rate, the 'extras' are brief and not terribly interesting.The story here is based on a real British military officer turned explorer, Percy Fawcett. About a 20-year period is featured between 1905 and 1925. We see Fawcett, and later his son, on expeditions into South America, and his fighting in the first World War.The lead is played very convincingly by Charlie Hunnam as Percy Fawcett. He had some experience in map-making and was asked to travel to S. America to establish the precise border between Bolivia and Brazil, to settle the dispute between those countries, and to do that required his party to travel to the source of a particular river. There had been rumors for a long while of a 'lost city' of a refined culture, and when Fawcett found remnants of pottery and other signs of civilization in the deep forest, thought to be unexplored, he became obsessed with finding that lost city. He would call it 'Zed' representing the last find he hoped for.It is an interesting glimpse into the early 20th century life in England, where men hardly hesitated to leave wife and children, often for years at a stretch, to go off exploring. The movie is more of a character study of Fawcett and those in his circle than it is of exploring S. America, although it contains a lot of that also.As history tells Fawcett and his oldest son went off in 1925 for what turned out to be his final expedition. The movie dramatized what 'might' have happened but no one really knows. Did they find the city and decide to live there? Or were they murdered by the indigenous tribes? My bet is on the latter.",Null,0,0,23 August 2017
Southpaw," Gyllenhaal carries this story of a man who has to hit bottom to become a real person.
","I watched this on DVD from my public library. I think it is a terrific movie and Jake Gyllenhaal gives a super performance as the prize fighter Billy Hope. But my wife didn't care for it, she usually doesn't like movies based on this theme and she walked out after maybe 30 minutes.Billy Hope seems to have it all, a beautiful wife and a young daughter that adores him, an upscale home and a faithful entourage. But Billy got to where he is, undefeated world champ, because of his anger and rage. Seemingly impervious to pounding by his opponent, when he got tired of the 'boxing' he just moved in and knocked out his opponent.But it is that same anger that toppled him into the depths of despair. At an event with his wife, he was being taunted by another fighter who wanted a title chance. Billy was able to shrug off the 'I'll take your title' taunt but couldn't when the other man said 'I'll take your bitch too.' Most of the movie turns out to be what Billy does after his fall, how he learns to control his rage, and for the first time how to really box smartly.His wife is Rachel McAdams as Maureen Hope and Oona Laurence is his daughter Leila Hope. Billy meets Forest Whitaker as gym owner and trainer Tick Wills who helps him get back on a good track.Good movie and Gyllenhaal is super.SPOILERS: Billy dealt with the other guy's taunts by getting into a fight with him in a hotel lobby. Someone had a handgun, a shot is fired, Maureen gets hit and she dies in Billy's arms. He is devastated, underperforms in his next fight, loses his house, wrecks his car, his daughter is put into protective services, she is angry with Billy, Billy's management moves to a different fighter.

Ant-Man," Reminded me of an excellent 'Mission Impossible' movie.
","'Ant-Man' is part of the Marvel Universe of action fiction, and in fact Stan Lee has his customary cameo in it. We viewed it on BluRay and the picture and sound are first-rate. The concept is a scientist (Michael Douglas) has developed a technique to shrink the size between atoms some 25 years earlier but shelves it, and in fact denies it, because his prot√©g√© has evil intentions for it, making the world a more dangerous place. But petty criminal, just out of jail and locked out of his young daughter's life, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, gets a chance to climb out of his hole by helping implement a strategy to defeat the evil scientist. To do this he has to put on and learn to use a suit which can convert him, at the press of a button, into Ant-Man, literally the size of an ant but retaining all his power. So in that tiny package his power is more like a super power.Evangeline Lilly has a key role as Hope van Dyne, Corey Stoll is good as the evil scientist Darren Cross, and when dressed in his own suit, Yellowjacket.There are characters from other Marvel stories, like Anthony Mackie who is in such series as The Avengers and Captain America, plus Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter of 'Agent Carter.'The story is good and often humorous, Rudd is really good in his role, and the movie overall is very entertaining.",Null,0,3,18 December 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," 'You'll never get a boyfriend when you look like you've just wandered out of Auschwitz.' (Bridget's Mum)
","Go Renee! Houston girl makes good as a British girl. This film is really a commentary on those women who mis-manage their lives, become unattractive, untalented, and lament that 'all the good ones are taken.'  Well, 'duh!', they were taken by all the young ladies who actually took care of themselves, developed skills, and are attractive. It is a good film, certainly not great, and will be remembered by the same fans who remember 'Three Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Notting Hill', not because they all have Hugh Grant, but because they all have a similar look, wit, and 'feel' to them. I like all of them.Bridget is '30-something', beginning to have visions of growing old without 'A MAN', and some day dying alone, being found days later, half-eaten by her dogs. She begins a diary and begins a self-improvement plan. However, she doesn't make much progress and fortunately is found attractive by Colin Firth's character because he 'likes her just the way she is.'  This is a running theme in fantasies of single women everywhere, wanting someone 'to love them just the way they are.'  Unfortunately, in real life few of them are cute and attractive as Bridget is in the film. Hugh Grant is fine as the cad.The DVD is a very good one. Not only the film itself, but most of the extras, like music videos and deleted scenes, are in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The surround is used very effectively, although there is not much opportunity to showcase either rear channel sounds or deep bass. The widescreen picture is just perfect. There is a good 'making of' feature, and several deleted scenes which added some extra enjoyment to the whole story. I have rated it '7' of 10.",Null,0,0,10 October 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," I enjoyed it. My kind of entertainment.
","Poor Steve Rogers. It is 1942 and the USA has entered the conflict that would become known as World War 2. Steve desperately wants to join the Army. He is from New York but after being rejected there tries to gain entry at several different New Jersey recruiting locations, each time being rejected for his small size and frail looks.But Steve is nothing if not persistent, and finally gets someone to accept him. Predictably he is deficient in most areas requiring quickness or strength, but he has more perseverance than any of the others.What Steve didn't know was the scientist was looking for the perfect subject of his project, a serum and a treatment that could convert anyone into someone with greatly magnified qualities. But magnifying qualities that the person already had. And Steve had exemplary qualities.The experiment worked, Steve became a hero of sorts, and people coined the nickname 'Captain America.' The government put him to good use, traveling around the country, dressed in his Captain America suit, and participating in skits to boost loyalty and confidence during this difficult time.But Steve wanted more, he wanted to go where the action was, to fight for his country. And when he gets the chance, he earns the 'hero' title.Chris Evans is Steve Rogers, who becomes Captain America. I would be curious to know what cinema tricks they used, to show him as a short, thin, weak young man then as a taller, strong muscular young man. Maybe 'face replacement' techniques that have become popular in recent years. Maybe I'll look it up.Anyway, I enjoyed it. My kind of entertainment.",Null,3,5,12 November 2011
American Hustle," 'Some of this actually happened.'
","This movie is apparently loosely based on real people and real events in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Grifters and scam artists who were asked to help catch bigger fish. The Irving Rosenfeld character in this movie (Christian Bale, putting on 40 pounds for the role) appears to be based on Mel Weinberg, many of his scams involved desperate businessmen who had been denied loans, and his fee, up to $5000, was to arrange the loan. Of course the loan was never sought, the victim was told the loan was not approved, Weinberg kept the fee. This is portrayed in the movie and ended when a real estate guy from Pittsburgh reported him to the FBI.Christian Bale is Irving Rosenfeld and Bradley Cooper is Richie DiMaso, the agent who was intent on using Irving to expose and prosecute. Rosenfeld's partner in scams is Amy Adams as British Sydney Prosser. Jeremy Renner is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito who wants to do good for his people but gets caught up in the bribes. Jennifer Lawrence is Irving's wife, Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She is a bit of a loose canon and causes problems with the sting.This movie comes from the same writer/director that brought us 'Silver Linings Playbook' and of course uses many of the same actors. It is best described as an absurd comedy, obviously well-acted and great entertainment if you like this kind of movie. Robert De Niro makes an appearance as a mob guy in a small but significant role.",Null,1,4,27 April 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great action and mystery movie, my wife and I enjoyed it.
","For me a good barometer for an entertaining movie is how often I look at the DVD player's clock to see how much is left. I didn't even glance at it until 28 minutes, and for me that is great. It means I was immersed in the story and the action, and that is why I watch movies. This third 'Bourne' movie is a fine one at that.Matt Damon continues as Jason Bourne, this time knowing a bit more about himself and his precarious station in life. It begins in Moscow, about 10 minutes (according to the extras) after the last one ended. He makes his way over to London's Waterloo train station to meet a reporter who he believes can lead him to the source of the hunt to eradicate him. There is a super scene with Bourne evading the guys chasing him. Unfortunately the reporter doesn't fare as well.Julia Stiles is back as Nicky Parsons who sympathizes with Bourne's plight and remains his ally. Always competent David Strathairn is CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen. And Scott Glenn is CIA Director Ezra Kramer. Albert Finney is Dr. Albert Hirsch, head of the division that indoctrinated Bourne and others in the covert experimental program.Joan Allen is back as Pamela Landy, and she has a critical role to play counter to Vosen, who is bent on exterminating everyone who might expose the illicit operation.A really, really good and entertaining movie. Should be seen more than once, several days apart. Matt Damon has really made the role of Jason Bourne his own, and now it would be hard imagining anyone else playing it.",Null,0,1,29 December 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," A very funny, original script for a 'high school' movie.
","Watching '10 Things I hate...' I was not aware it is based on Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew.' I'm not a big 'Shakey' fan, so that's neither here nor there. And, just last week I watched another 'high school' movie - 'Never Been Kissed' - and '10 Things...' is in every way a better movie. The acting is good, the situations are funny, and the clever writing is very original. The ending where the 'pay for date' scheme becomes apparent and then resolved is pretty predictable. But that's about all. We laughed most during the scene on the archery range. 09DEC2004 update: Since I first saw this movie, I've seen probably another hundred 'teen' themed movies, which supports my original contention that '10 Things' is indeed one of the better ones of the genre.",Null,0,1,31 May 2000
Fargo," An almost perfect film in its genre.
","I had watched 'Fargo' several years ago, and just last night re-watched it on DVD. I intended to see half of it, go to bed at my normal time, and see the last half this morning. But it isn't that kind of movie. It draws you in, the dialog and editing are so good, you want to keep watching. And so I did. It deserves its high rating.some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you haven't seen 'Fargo' yet.
Bill Macy is perfect, absolutely, as 'Jerry' the car sales manager who can't quite get his life in order. You see, Jerry basically cares only about himself. He has some unspecified debt, his father in law (Harve Presnell) is rich but has a very low, deservedly, opinion of Jerry. So Jerry does the only thing he can figure, through a paroled  American Native car mechanic that works in his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs (Buscemi and Stormare) who will kidnap Jerry's wife, hold her safe, until Jerry convinces pop-in-law to pay a ransom, which he uses to pay off the thugs and erase his own debt. Ever the schemer, Jerry tells the thugs he will split $80,000 with them, but really plans to extort $1Million and just give them $40,000. In an early scene to establish character, we see Jerry scamming a customer by charging him for a 'topcoat' treatment that he said a day earlier he would throw in free. Jerry was simply a very flawed person.Things go terribly wrong, thugs get stopped at night in the snow, Stormare shoots the cop, plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing the crime scene. Margie (Frances McDormand, oscar winner) is the town sheriff and gets on the trail. She calmly travels to the Twin Cities, interviews people, pieces together clues, finds the hideout near the lake, comes upon Stormare grinding up Buscemi's body, the dead hostage in the cabin. In the interim the father in law gets gunned down, as well as a parking lot attendant. This film is best classified as a very dark comedy. Margie and her fisherman husband are two of the very few normal people in this film, The others - Jerry, his family, the mechanic, the thugs, the prostitutes - are all way off center, and some of the situations and dialog are very funny, within the context of a film where a number of murders are committed. The funniest scene is during the shooting of Presnell, who wounds Buscemi on the right cheek, and he spends the rest of the film with rather large strips of paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding, his hands and coat collar red and blood-soaked. I mean, there's really nothing funny about murder, but the Buscemi character is very funny.",Null,10,16,28 January 2003
Rush," 1976 was an exciting year in Formula One racing.
","This is a Ron Howard film of a predominantly true telling of the 1976 year of Formula One racing. Featured are the world champion from 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda, and his rival Brit James Hunt, seeking the world championship. Lauda and Hunt were quite opposites, the Austrian the focused, precise, calculating racer. It was a profession he was very good at. The Brit a flamboyant risk-taker, a womanizer who enjoyed a good drunk after a victory, and who nervously vomited before a big race.The actors chosen are excellent, with costuming and makeup resembling the real racers quite closely. The Aussie Chris Hemsworth puts on his best British accent as James Hunt, and Daniel Br√ºhl (full name ' Daniel C√©sar Mart√≠n Br√ºhl Gonz√°lez Domingo ') is authentic as Niki Lauda.This is much more than a telling of the racing season. In the hands of director Ron Howard we are treated to selective slow motion and stop action, and even POV shots of the racing engine's intake and exhaust valves at work from inside the combustion chamber. In slow motion, of course!Surely some archival footage was used, but they recreated certain racing situations very realistically. Overall the cinematography (shot digitally) and the sound track are superb. A very enjoyable movie, of two fierce competitors who gained deep respect for each other, in spite of their attempts to bury each other on the track.Their spouses were capably played by Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller Hunt and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Of note, Hunt died at a relatively young age of 45, but Lauda is still going strong in his 60s, as an aviation entrepreneur.June 2019 edit: Lauda died recently so I took the opportunity to watch this again. I enjoyed it almost as much now, 5 years after my first viewing.",Null,3,3,23 May 2014
Notting Hill," Highly likable, cute film with Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.
","OK, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out why this film was made - to capitalize on the cinema popularity of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in the late 1990s. On first viewing I thought 'there isn't anything substantial here, but a good script and good acting make it a very enjoyable viewing, deserving a rating in the mid-7 to low-8 range'. But after viewing it several additional times over the years I have come to appreciate it more, and it has become one of my favorites to re- watch. It has a lot more depth than I realized in my first viewing. Plus it contains a collection of great characters on the British side of the casting.Grant plays a shy and unassuming bookstore owner in Notting Hill section of London. Julia Roberts plays an American movie star, and the film is about their romantic possibilities. If you are a 'romantic' and like to see two young lovers try and figure it out, then this is a very enjoyable film. I think most of us men can identify with Grant's character, even though the object of our affection perhaps was not a movie star.The DVD extras shows a bit about the 'making of' Notting Hill. Of interest to me, even though street shots of the Notting Hill area are used, all the filming 'inside the bookstore' was done in a studio on a set created to look like the bookstore.I now (2016) own the BluRay version and the picture and sound are a definite improvement over the DVD, plus the 'extras' are a bit different. This remains one of my favorite movies.",Null,0,2,27 November 2000
Nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal gives an award-quality performance as crazed and focused nightcrawler.
","Years before this movie was ever conceived the term 'nightcrawler' was applied to those guys who prowl the late night with police radio and video camera with one goal, to get to the scene of some gruesome accident or crime scene to get footage they can sell to a TV news group. This is a fictional story about them, and focuses on one of them. Jake Gyllenhaal is Louis Bloom and as the movie opens we see him clipping chain-link fence. As a security guard approaches and with a smile on his face Bloom tries to talk his way out of the trespassing. Then he sees the man's watch, overpowers him, and steals his watch. Soon we see him at a salvage yard to sell his scrap steel and copper, including a few manhole covers.That is about all we get as a hint to his backstory, he clearly has little money, drives a very old Tercel, but he studies a lot on the internet and has ambitions to do something that will become high profile. He has a great belief in himself, but absolutely no scruples.One night when he happens upon the scene of a bad accident he stops and is amazed by the man filming the site. It is an activity he had no exposure to but, being a fast learner, figures it out and soon is getting footage that others miss, mainly because he has no scruples. And, as we eventually see, he is not at all above creating havoc so that he can get an exclusive.Bloom is ruthless, with his pursuit of havoc, in the way he treats the young assistant he hires , and in pursuing a relationship with a news director twice his age (Rene Russo, who was actually 60) otherwise he just may take his exclusive footage elsewhere. And as the story progresses we see his fees getting larger and his cars getting fancier.It is difficult to describe how good Jake Gyllenhaal is in this role. You get to really believe he is this half-crazed, egocentric prick who would, and does, throw anyone under the bus to get his footage. If he is first at a crime scene or accident he does nothing to see if he can help the injured, he just wants to get his footage.My wife said there aren't any good, sympathetic characters here, and that is about right. But it is entertaining in its relentless drive to show Bloom's focus on what he wants and seems to always get. Louis Bloom",Null,0,0,4 March 2015
The Aviator," Howard Hughes, flawed genius.
","Superb movie! It deals with Hughes' early adult years, from his 20s through his mid 40s, when he left Houston and invaded Hollywood and Washington, forcing lasting advances in movie-making and flight, and calling the bluff of devious politicians. By any measure Howard Hughes was a genius, always thinking ahead, bigger, better, higher. Nothing was impossible, as long as you had enough money and enough people working for you. He never hesitated to risk going broke when he believed in a project. Suffering from mental disorders now known as 'obssessive/compulsive' , as it got worse Hughes spent much of his old age as a recluse. But his ideas and those of scientists he hired have changed aviation, space exploration, electronics, communications, and even movie-making. The 2-set DVD has a number of interesting 'extras' which show how wide Hughes' impact was. Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes, and delivers an award-quality performance. Always dependable Cate Blanchett is equally good as Katharine Hepburn, very closely capturing the unique cadence and sound of her voice. Other stars include beautiful Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, head of rival Pan Am Airlines. Alan Alda as the shady Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn. The opening scene shows a young boy of about 10 or 11 standing nude in a tub of water, his mother bathing him while she says and spells 'quarantine', while warning young Howard about the dangers of various diseases. This we assume was the seed planted by his mother which, germinating and growing in his adult mind, was responsible for Hughes' mental illness. When both dad and mom were dead while Howard was barely in his 20s, he took the Hughes Tool (oil drilling bits) fortune to Hollywood and satisfied both of his interests, making 'Hells Angels' about fliers in WW I.The movie does not try to cover all of Hughes' life, but touches on significant events of a 20-something year period. Desiging and flying a plane that broke speed records. A record flight around the world. Near-death crashes. Failed military contracts, including the Spruce Goose. Romancing the stars. His growing phobias. A landmark film.",Null,1,6,5 July 2005
L√©on: The Professional," Unconventional love story. A professional hitman and his protege', a 12-year-old orphan.
","Updated February 2020: A very intriguing, action-packed 2 hours and 11 minutes. I was bothered a bit by the same thing that bothered Ebert's accurate review, namely the idea of a young girl aspiring to be a 'cleaner' like the man she adopts after her parents and siblings are killed by a rogue cop when a drug deal goes bad. Also the implied relationship the young girl sought, telling the hotel clerk 'he's not really my father, he's my lover.' Or the circuitous discussion of whether first-time sex is enjoyable, or the scene where she tells him to sleep next to her in the bed. This character is not a little teddy-bear hugging child, but a mature 12-year-old who wants to have a relationship with the older man, no matter how absurd it seems. Probably the French influence.However, all that aside, 'Leon' is an entertaining and action-packed film. This was Natalie Portman's (Mathilda) first film role, two years before her smart performance in 'Beautiful Girls', and she is quite remarkable. Gary Oldman is his usual crazy self. Jean Reno is cool as the hit man, a role that fits his image perfectly.The opening scenes, where Leon is hired to 'advise' a man to stay out of NYC, is one of the best I have seen in any movie and establishes Leon's profession and skill set. And of course the closing OTT action. But the vast middle of the story is a non-sexual love story between Mathilda and Leon, something that neither had experienced before.I initially saw it on DVD, then more recently purchased the BluRay version which has an enhanced soundtrack, especially with inclusion of some really deep bass at appropriate places to heighten the tension. This is one of my favorite re-watches, I've probably watched it more than a dozen times. The BluRay disc also has a set of interesting extras, including actors reflecting on the experience of making Leon.",Null,0,4,28 June 2002
Oblivion," If you can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with.
","It is 2077. The Earth has been mostly devastated by a battle with aliens in 2017. But humanity was being relocated to Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Most of the land is to be avoided, because of radiation. But there is an area safe for human life, and a small team, an 'effective team' of two people monitor the automated drones and the big machines that are harvesting energy from the ocean.Tom Cruise is Jack, and Andrea Riseborough is Vika,and they make up the team. Most of their memories have been wiped, they live in a futuristic apartment high in the sky, and Jack uses a flying contraption to do his job.We never actually see Melissa Leo, only her image on a monitor as she talks with Jack, but she is only known as 'Sally', with an exaggerated southern drawl, and she seems to be the person in charge of monitoring Jack and Vika, the drones, and the energy-harvesting machines.Let's just leave it at this, not everything is as it appears to be and, when a type of spaceship crashes in the area, Jack finds 5 people in suspended animation pods, apparently from the year 2017. Solving this new riddle is the subject of the rest of the story.This is science fiction, it can raise any number of questions, but if you just go with what you see, it is very nice entertainment. SPOILERS: Jack was in fact one of the astronauts from 2017, and one of the people he recovered from the pods was his real wife, Olga Kurylenko as Julia. Then Jack apparently encounters his own self, and eventually finds out there are many of him, as clones. Sally most likely is not a real person, but only an image, and there is no colony on Titan, there is no dangerous area of radiation, it is all a misdirection to get humans to keep harvesting the Earth for the aliens. Jack gets aligned with a group of other human survivors, lead by Morgan Freeman's character, and they devise a plan to travel to the alien command center and with nuclear explosives destroy them. But Jack has to sacrifice himself. Mission accomplished, his wife Julia is seen in a bucolic setting with young child, and a Jack clone walks up.

Bohemian Rhapsody," Totally worthwhile biopic of Freddie Mercury. Best Actor for Malek.
","My wife and I watched this in March 2019 at home on BluRay from our public library. I watched it again in January 2020. Picture and sound are first rate.This movie almost swept the film awards season, winning many of them and just missing 'Best Picture' Oscar. But Malek did get the Oscar for his performance.Back when they were most popular I never recall paying any particular attention to the rock group 'Queen' but as a music lover have long been aware of their name. And of course the lead singer Freddie Mercury, without him in particular this would have been a very forgettable band.Rami Malek, who shares similar ancestry, plays Freddie Mercury who in real life died at 45 of complications from AIDS. Malek was fitted with prosthetic teeth and given more width to his nose to more resemble Mercury. Malek sings, to provide realism, but all the singing we hear in the movie is Mercury's voice, the credits simplay say 'Queen' for each song.Overall a brilliant biopic of a very complicated musician and singer who was determined to entertain and to live his life the way he wanted.I also really enjoyed the various extras on the disc, particularly how they developed a new technique to simulate a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the live aid concert in 1985. Basically using individual images of real people, 'extras' dressed in various garb and performing various motions, then via computer building all those individual moving images into blocks that when complete looked authentically like a large crowd.",Null,1,2,13 March 2019
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Based on Airman Adrian Cronauer, of 'Good Morning Viet-Nam' fame.
","This movie has a special meaning for me, I was a 20-yr-old college student in Air Force R.O.T.C. in 1965, we all knew of the Vietnam war, most of us were starting to think about what it would be like to go. I ended up not going, but many of my friends did, and those who returned were changed by the experience. Seeing this movie and the scenes, although not filmed in Vietnam, bring back those memories.In one of his defining roles Robin Williams was Adrian Cronauer, an Airman who was a radio disk jockey for the military, coming into Vietnam from Crete. On his first day he starts his 6AM radio show with his now famous 'Good morning viet-nam.' This is actually accurate. And a few other things are accurate, but as Cronauer says that if he had done all the things depicted in the movie he would still be in Leavenworth prison (in 2008, when he said that). But what is realistic is that the radio personalities were supposed to help keep up the spirit of the GIs, many who had never left home before and were now in this very foreign place. So hearing some American humor and music would help take their minds off where they actually were.For me the most memorable part of this movie is when Louis Armstrong's rendition of 'A Wonderful World' was playing while the film clips showed fighting, destruction, and killing. That is the political message of this movie.Forest Whitaker was also great as what became Adrian's sidekick (at least in the movie) as Edward Garlick, and who would take over the spot after Adrian was drummed out for misbehavior. In reality he was not drummed out, he followed his orders, and served his full one year there.So the movie is mostly fictitious in the way Adrian was depicted but is is more entertaining than it would have been if they had simply shot it in documentary style.",Null,1,1,2 January 2015
American Pie," Raunchy, silly, poor excuse of a movie, but entertaining in spots.
","I saw 'American Pie' in July '99 when it first came to the theater, something I rarely do anymore with DVD and 'home theater' at my disposal. Anyway, I remember clearly, when the lights went on at the end a young lady looked around and told her boyfriend, 'Look at all the old people in here.' I was one of 'the old people.' This week my wife and I saw the highly mutilated version, sanitized for TV, and it is only a shadow of the real film.Simple plot - 4 friends make a pact to lose their virginity before graduation from high school.  That thin thread motivates all the situations that follow. The movie is bad because it depicts 'SEX' as a somewhat frivolous activity that all boys, and many girls, spend much of their free time thinking about. That's my real gripe about films like this, it cheapens relationships and gives already confused teenagers and young adults more motivation for immoral behavior.Still, there are a few genuinely funny scenes. My favorite is the extra-powerful laxative that results in the kid going quickly, but into the girls' restroom. The internet video of 'Nadia' changing and getting sexy in the boy's room. The 'sex talks' between son and father. The 'contaminated' beer on the nightstand. Mom and dad coming into his room while we was getting off on watching scrambled porn on TV. There are a few sweet moments at the end, however the film overall has a very flawed message and in a generous mood I rate it '4' of 10.",Null,1,3,17 February 2002
Burn After Reading," Too much use of the F-word, but a very clever, convoluted comedy.
","From the minds that gave us such screwball stories as 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' comes 'Burn After Reading.' A common theme in all these movies has that something which shouldn't be such a big deal does in fact become a big deal, and all hell breaks loose as a result.Frances McDormand is Linda Litzke, right smack in middle age, and working at an exercise spa. She looks at herself in a mirror and sees boobs that need to be propped up, a tummy that needs to be tucked, and lower arm skin that needs to be trimmed. We see her in consultation with a cosmetic surgeon. But to Linda's dismay her work health insurance plan will not cover the costs. What is she to do? Meanwhile John Malkovich as government agent Osbourne (Oz) Cox is being reassigned, he doesn't know why, and his bosses won't give a straight answer. So he decides to quit, 'honor' and all that, and write his memoirs. He dictates his fictional story onto his voice recorder and eventually transfers them to his computer. This simple story is what gets mistaken for Russian secrets and sets the rest of the story in motion.Linda's dim-witted co-worker at the exercise spa is Brad Pitt as Chad Feldheimer. When a janitor finds a computer disk in the dressing room, and Linda and Chad view the contents, they mistake Oz's fiction for real government secrets and Linda decides that is her way to get her cosmetic surgery paid for. They will contact the Russian Embassy and give them the disk in exchange for money.The cast and relationships are very convoluted but include Tilda Swinton as the wife of Oz, Katie Cox, who is not faithful to their marriage. George Clooney as Harry Pfarrer, who also is not faithful. The always steady Richard Jenkins as the spa manager Ted Treffon. Elizabeth Marvel as Harry's wife Sandy Pfarrer, who also is not faithful. And J.K. Simmons (news editor, 'Spiderman') as CIA Superior who quits trying to make sense of all he hears about this case and just wishes everyone would disappear. Including the bodies! Again, I don't know why they insisted that several of the characters, especially Oz, use such pervasive foul language, because it detracts from the story. But other than that it is a clever and entertaining dark comedy, as are all of their movies.",Null,0,4,30 January 2009
Watchmen," Super heroes in an alternate universe.
","I find that to appreciate this movie it helps to think of it as a presentation of an alternate universe, similar to, but not the same as, the one we know.For example the president is Richard Nixon, in his third term in 1985. In our universe Nixon was president briefly, and resigned in shame in 1974.But in this universe there are a group of superheros known collectively as 'Watchmen' but for political reasons Nixon has banned them from duty. So part of what we see in this movie are the superheros 'in retirement.' But their desire to fight crime is still there.The rather long, but never boring, movie involves a somewhat complex plot of one former superhero plotting to destroy a large part of humanity as a way to unite the USA and Russian factions against nuclear war. But most of the fun in the movie is being a part of their universe.Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is the most visually fantastic character. In an unfortunate lab accident years earlier he was transformed into this being that in bound neither by space nor time. We see him as a muscular and naked blue figure. Quite an imposing sight.Jackie Earle Haley, the skinny kid of 'Breaking Away' fame all those years ago, is good as Rorschach. I love his line when in prison and being taunted by the others, 'You think I am in here with you, but you have it wrong. You're in here with me!' What a menacing little guy, who wears a mask that is a Rorschach Test in constant motion.My favorite is Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg, and the retired Nite Owl II, a superhero much like Batman, with a similar costume and a flying, indestructible vehicle that he hides in a cave underground. His requires some dramatic acting and he pulls it off well.His girlfriend is Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter, and she is quite a figure with nothing on. They have a couple of nice scenes together.Carla Gugino is one of my favorites, and here she is Sally Jupiter, Laurie's mother, and the retired Silk Spectre. Even with old makeup on, Gugino looks better in her 70s than most look in their 30s.Overall a fine and entertaining movie, in a style that reminded me much of 'Sin City', another movie with Gugino.",Null,1,4,26 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," Really good action film, Damon makes a good secret agent.
","I'm one of those lucky ones who don't read the book before I see the film, so I can take it on its own merits. I found it to be very good, and better than such recent high profile thrillers as 'Minority Report' and the like. Matt Damon is good as the secret agent found floating in the Mediterranian Sea south of Marseilles and picked up for dead by fishermen. Poor guy, couldn't remember anything about who he was, but quickly figured out he must have had lots of training because his awareness and defense skills were second to none.SPOILERS - READ FURTHER AT YOUR OWN RISK.As everything unfolds we find out he was a highly trained assassin with a place in Paris and many different passports under many names. He had been sent by a highly covert operation to snuff an exiled former African leader who was threatening to expose things if he were not reinstated. But, an assassin with a conscience is a handicap and, when he saw the children with his target, could not do it and instead was shot and dumped. So the whole film is his trying to find out who he really is, while his covert organization thinks he has snapped so are trying to kill him. But he is too good, he always gets the upper hand, and there is a great chase scene through the streets of Paris, him driving a red Mini, police chasing in cars and on motorcycles. With Marie (Franka Potente) at his side. About halfway into the film they are alone, she begins to kiss him, and in his memory loss had a moment to try and figure out if he liked girls! He figured it out...In the end, he is presumed dead, the covert operation disbanded, Marie ends up with a cafe and motorbike rental on a small Greek island, and he finds her. Good movie, good ending. I suppose the reason I liked it so much is the way we pull for the underdog, here both Bourne and Marie, who only want to have a safe, normal life. The DVD picture is excellent and the surround sound is very dynamic and aggressive. Very high entertainment value.Sept 2017 edit: Just watched it again, still a nicely entertaining movie.",Null,0,1,1 March 2003
The Italian Job," Pretty exciting two hours!!
","My son Greg gave me the deluxe Widescreen Edition DVD of 'The Italian Job.' Until I watched the extras after seeing the movie, I didn't know that an original movie of this same title was made in the 1960s. However, it was more of a comedy, and the new version is quite different. The movie starts with a job in Italy, followed by a double-cross, followed by a heist of the loot in Los Angeles. Very creative, very exciting. No lasting value, but an entertaining way to spend almost 2 hours, for Charlize Theron, if nothing else! The DVD is a very nice one, especially for those who enjoy seeing various 'making of' extras.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, stop reading, OK!?The first heist in Venice has them creating several blasts that allow a safe with gold to fall through several floors and into the water, where the gold was extracted while a boat chase with fake safe was used as a decoy. Edward Norton plays the group member who double-crosses the others at an Austrian pass, wants the $35Million in gold bars all for himself, kills Donald Sutherland, but the others get away by driving off the bridge into the frozen lake and using breathing gear. They track the gold to L.A. where they enlist Sutherland's daughter (Theron) a legal safecracker to help them. Wise to the plot, Norton arranges three armored trucks to leave his house, one with gold, which they figure by remote measuring of rear tire compression, take control of L.A. traffic lights, cause the truck to go a certain route, a blast causes the truck to fall into the train tunnel, where with the help of red, white, and blue Cooper Minis they get the gold to a freight car and leave town, Norton is taken away by Russian friends for 'disposal.'",Null,0,1,29 December 2003
Baby Driver," A young couple love story, complicated by bank robbers.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to skip it. The movie is entertaining because it has something for most audiences. For those who like a good love story we have the young couple trying to figure out how to make it together. For those who like to watch gunfights we have those, and for the viewers who like exciting car chase scenes and wrecks we have those.The story is about a teenager named Miles but who goes by Baby. As a young boy his parents argued a lot and one argument resulted in a car crash that killed them and left Baby with some hearing impairment so as a teenager we always see him with headphones playing music. He lives with an older disabled man who is his foster father. He is played by Ansel Elgort.Growing up he made unwise decisions 'boosting' (stealing) cars, became expert at in and in the process an expert get-away driver. His biggest mistake was stealing the expensive car of a crook, Kevin Spacey as Doc, who is forcing him to be a robbery getaway driver to work off his debt. So we do see several of the jobs and Baby's driving skill.But the real story is Baby's wanting to get free of his criminal burden and when he meets a pretty young waitress, Lily James as Debora, also wanting more out of life, the two of them begin to look forward to a long road trip. If Baby can work free of Doc.SPOILERS: In a series of events that worked out well for Baby each of the key crooks died in an extended gun battle. Baby managed to escape, with his bag of money, and with Debora. But he is trapped by police on a bridge and captured. At trial several testified that he had a good heart so to moderate his prison time the 20-year sentence was stipulated with a possible parole after 5 years, which he got, and Debora was waiting for him. They make a cute couple.",Null,0,2,1 November 2017
Justice League," The Justice league has to re-animate Superman to save the world.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. My wife skipped, not her type of movie.In essence this is a continuation of the 'Batman vs Superman' movie, in this story a mythical character Steppenwolf has returned with a plan to destroy the whole world, perhaps the whole universe. As he gains more power the six remaining members of the Justice League are trying hard but seem to be fighting a losing battle. They really need Superman but can they figure out a way to re-animate him? To bring him back alive?Well as we know anything is possible in the comics. And now we know the world is still here, so there's that. As a long-time superhero fan I found the movie a bit uneven but still enjoyable. As much as the movie, I enjoyed the approximately 14 minute BD extra that explains the history of the Justice League and its characters in the comics, and some of the changes over the years. Plus the picture and sound are first-rate, my powered subwoofer really got a workout!",Null,0,0,3 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very high production values, very long, perfect for 'Ring' fans.
","I went to school in the 1950s and 1960s. I never read 'The Hobbit' nor any of the 'Ring' trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about, although I already knew there were 'Ring' fanatics of all ages out there. I got a 'free' DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be 'Ringheads.' The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of 'extras', several 'making of' plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year. While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that 'the fellowship of the ring' will undertake, to ultimately return the 'one ring' to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a 'great' film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect.  However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the 'Ringheads' out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments.",Null,7,12,10 August 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Visual masterpiece, the message is secondary.
","As I look back on the Matrix Trilogy, and particularly this third one, I think of them more in the genre of comic books brought to the big screen. Except these never were comic books. This third installment, right at 2 hours running time, continues with the concept of 'NEO' as the savior of the real world. The movie begins in the real world, in one of the ships, the now familiar green computer code traveling down in columns on a black background, with some discussion of 'the machines' heading towards Zion, due to reach it in just under 20 hours. If the machines are successful, perhaps mankind in the real world will be destroyed. Meanwhile, NEO is somehow trapped between the Matrix and the real world, at a train station, and only the 'train man' can get him back home. The Oracle again plays a key role.While at the train station NEO meets a man, his wife, and their young daughter, who are really computer programs in the Matrix, but speak of 'family love.' This represents a conceptual evolution within the three Matrix movies, the idea of computer programs attaining emotions.The movie continues and fierce battles between the men and the machines are shown. It appears as though Zion will be destroyed. But NEO begs the mysterious powers to hook into the Matrix, to go back and fight the program. He is asked, 'What if you fail?' He answers simply, 'I won't.' He encounters multiple Agent Smiths, the visuals are fantastic, with even some Superman like flying scenes high above the city. In the end, after 12 minutes of fight on film, the will of NEO overcomes the computer programs, all the Agent Smiths are destroyed, and at that moment the machines retreat from Zion, 'The War Is Over.' I prefer not to try to analyze the film's message too much. One is obvious, the triumph of good over evil. However, to me this last chapter, and in fact all three Matrix movies, are to be enjoyed mostly for the superb visuals that the Wachowski brothers have created. I find it most enjoyable to just sit back, watch and listed, as the stories are told in classic comic book style.",Null,1,4,22 December 2004
Man of Steel," I enjoyed the different take on the Superman story.
","I grew up on Superman and Superboy comics, and I have enjoyed all the various Superman movies. Even the Supergirl movie. Each brings its own sensibility to these stories. None of them are 'the best', they are all good.This one starts with a full 20 minutes devoted to the Krypton society, how the rebellious Jor-El (Russel Crowe) and his wife had a baby the natural way, after hundreds of years of only designed babies being produced. How the planet was dying, the friction Jor-El had with Zod (Michael Shannon), and their decision to sent the baby Kal-El towards Earth so that he might be the salvation of their race.We see some, not too much, of Clark Kent's youth, but mostly him as a 30-ish adult (Henry Cavill) , moving from place to place and working. His dad (Kevin Costner) had cautioned him to not reveal who he really is and what his powers are, but when a catastrophe struck and he was forced into action, afterwards he moved and used a new name.But reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) got on his trail, essentially tracked his existence, asking questions, until she found him. So, in this version Lois knew Clark Kent and knew of his super powers before he even went to work as a reporter at the Daily Planet.The climax of the movie is when Zod eventually finds him and wants Kal- El because he figures out Jor-El had used Kal-El's blood cells to code the information needed to re-start the Kryptonian race, and Zod intended that they would take Earth for their own, meaning the extinction of Earthlings in the process. Superman resisted this and the two had a lengthy, very destructive fight in Metropolis.And there is where all three of us said the movie simply over-did this battle and destruction of a large part of Metropolis. Yes, Superman did prevail, but seeing so much CG destruction just for 'effect' seems much more extensive than it needed to be, and detracted from the overall movie.Good movie, we all enjoyed it, Cavill makes a very good Superman. I just wish the battle near the end had not been so extensive and destructive, it would have made it better for me. Other good characters were Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White.",Null,5,7,11 December 2013
The Color of Money," 'Money won is twice as sweet as money earned.' (Fast Eddie)
","The more of his movies I see, the more I think that Paul Newman may be the best actor of modern times. Here he is Fast Eddie Felson, a well-off liquor salesman, a former pool hustler, was one of the best. As he explained to young Vincent (Tom Cruise, 23), 'Money won is twice as sweet as money earned', and that is what this movie is about. Although by his own admission he 'has quit', Eddie misses the action and sees an opportunity to get back in by teaching the hustling game to brash, fiery, and talented Vincent, when he witnesses Vincent demoralizing one of the hustlers by beating him so easily. But Vince is a tough case, he is so competitive that he can't lose for the sake of suckering in a mark. By Eddie's accounting, if you lose a few hundred then you might win a few thousand when other hustlers think you are an easy mark. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is Carmen, Vincent's girlfriend. Helen Shaver is Janelle, Eddie's girlfriend. Good movie, especially for Newman and Cruise.Tom Cruise made this movie around the same time as 'Top Gun'.SPOILERS. The movie ends at Atlantic City during the big 9-ball tournament. When Vince and Eddie split, Eddie began training again, got new eye glasses, entered the tournament, determined to get his form back. 'Money earned' was not good enough anymore. As luck would have it, Vince and Eddie met in the elimination bracket and, in a very close match Eddie won. He appeared at the height of his skill. But later Vince came to his room and gave Eddie $8000, his share of a hustle. Turns out he purposely lost to Eddie, to set up a bigger take. Eddie had taught him well, but was so distraught he forfeited his next match, he hadn't earned it. The movie ends with Eddie challenging Vince to a game, vowing to play him as long as it takes to beat him.",Null,0,2,30 June 2005
Radio," 'Radio' gets the highest rating from me, a superb human story.
","'Radio' is billed as a fictional story based on real people, but I suspect it is predominantly a true story. In 1976 a mentally challenged young black man (Cuba Gooding Jr) is given the name 'Radio' because he loved radios and always had one with him. His dad was dead and his mom worked most of the time to support the two of them, and 'Radio' had been basically cast aside, hardly able to speak and with no education, was seen daily pushing his shopping cart through the streets of this small South Carolina town. After some of the high school athletes give 'Radio' trouble, the coach (Ed Harris) makes 'Radio' and offer, to join them at daily afternoon football practice, maybe he can in some way help out. We don't fully understand why the coach does this, as it is not presented as any kind of direct tie-in to the hazing, but it becomes clear later in the movie, during a conversation with his teen daughter who was feeling a bit neglected.I liked this movie so much because it plays squarely on the human principle that none of us are islands, we are instead all connected as a community and what we do to one, bad or good, reflects on the whole. Regardless of the human topic, great things start with the efforts of one, and here it was the coach taking the time and patience to help this young man become something more than a daily wanderer through town. The short clip at the end of the movie, of the real 'Radio' who today is in his 50s, shows us that things have worked out well. Gooding Jr is no doubt superb as 'Radio', proving that he indeed is one of the better actors working today. But Ed Harris is mostly responsible for how well this story resonates, because he had to play the coach perfectly, and he did. Ed Harris just reinforces why he has been a premiere actor for so many years.SPOILERS follow, quit reading, OK!?  As it turns out, he explained to his daughter, when coach was 12 and making deliveries, he encountered a young boy, perhaps handicapped, basically in an outside wire cage, treated more like an animal. He saw him many times, and as he matured realized that maybe he could have done something. When 'Radio' came along these many years later, he decided he wouldn't let that happen again. He knew we could and should do more to help the disadvantaged. He bought 'Radio' meals, let him participate in practices as a 'coach's assistant', eventually began letting him on the bench with the coach during games. Not all the parents, or the school board, were happy with this. After the football season we witness, the coach resigns his head coaching job, but remained as a teacher. The short clip at the end of the movie shows the real 'Radio', on the field with the team he still 'helps coach.'",Null,0,3,14 July 2004
28 Weeks Later," I enjoyed '28 Days Later', but this one not so much so.
","In '28 Days Later' we saw a story of a rage virus in a chimp being released as activists free the chimp. Most of England is destroyed or uninfected people leave. At the end of 28 days, we see an uninfected couple, and we view this as hope they (and perhaps others) can survive and re-populate.In this sequel which is a bit more than 6 months later, all infected die off and they are in the process of bringing healthy people back to the London area. The USA armed forces are there to help control things. But not everyone alive is clean, and that starts another infection.This story is not nearly as interesting, and the movie relies way too much on horror action involving those infected against those healthy. It goes on too frequently, and for too long, so that it becomes more of a distraction that an aid to advancing the story.Pretty marginal movie.",Null,3,8,24 November 2007
Cast Away," It is 'Cast Away', not 'Castaway.'
","The title is significant. We normally think of the word 'castaway' as a noun, referring to the person. But this film is 'Cast Away', a verb and its adverb, which literally mean 'to throw, fling, or hurl from a place or position', and that is precisely what happens to Chuck (Tom Hanks). He is thrown from his time-controlled life, and into one with a totally different set of priorities.Spoilers follow;This movie project was conceived by Tom Hanks, inspired by an account he heard of someone who actually was stranded on rocks at sea, and the experience so terrified him that he never wanted to see that place again. Hanks and his writer enlisted the help of survival experts, and much of what is depicted on the island is plausible. The project spanned about 5 years, and actual filming was done in 2 phases - before and after Hanks lost 50 to 60 pounds.Chuck is a ground ops expert for FedEx and his whole life is governed by the clock. When he goes to Russia, he ships himself a digital clock to show them how slow their delivery is. He has to fly around the world on short notice. A cargo explosion over the Pacific causes the plane to ditch and only he survives, washing up the next day on a small island. (Several surrounding islands were removed digitally.) He has been 'cast away', far away, where no one will find him. Suddenly time becomes unimportant, and that is reinforced over the next 4 years on the island.As survival experts tells us, the 4 things for physical survival are water, food, shelter, and fire. For emotional survival, someone to share things with. For the latter, Chuck finds 'Wilson', which started out as a volleyball in one of the FedEx packages that washes ashore. Opening packages was a defining moment for Chuck, since it goes completely against what his job stands for. Opening the packages is a first acknowledgement that he may not be found.He learns how to open coconuts for water and food, by accidentally splitting a rock which gave him a sharp 'blade.' He learns to take rain runoff from large leaves. How to spear fish. A hatchet from a pair of ice skates. A net from a dress.  Wood friction and kindling to make a fire for warmth and cooking. And a cave for shelter. A 'calendar' from a beam of light entering the cave. This element of 'time' becomes a tool, rather than a captor, as it allows him to calculate when winds will be favorable for sailing out to sea.The writers initially wanted a 'discovery and rescue' on the island, but Zemeckis (director) said that wouldn't work. Chuck had to reach for himself the point where he would 'make' his rescue by risking death at sea. A familiar theme, 'The Truman Show' and 'The Matrix' come to mind. So Chuck makes rope from bark, and builds a raft with a sail from half of a portable toilet that washes ashore.  Another defining moment was when he cleared the waves, saw his 'home' disappear, and knew it was now a new game, him against the sea. Back home after a Russian ship rescue, for Chuck it is like a resurrection. Nothing is the same. His girlfriend (Helen Hunt) is married and has a daughter. FedEx and 'efficiency' are no longer important. In the very last scene, after he delivers a package that had been with him for 4 years on the island, with a note 'your package kept me alive', we see him meet the beautiful redhead sculptor in rural north Texas. As he ponders which fork in the road to take, we see in his face that the sculptor may in fact be the beginning of his new life, his second chance, that will be totally different.I am glad that the writer and director took the moral road, in having Chuck tell his old girlfriend, 'you need to go home', rather than any hints at splitting up her marriage, even though they were obviously still in love with each other. Life gives us choices, and we have to make them wisely and with integrity.Why was this film made? I believe, to show what it is really like on a 'desert island', and how coming to grips with aloneness and survival can have such an impact on a person and his priorities.  The experience is not at all like what may have been depicted in older films like 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Blue Lagoon', or the TV series 'Gilligan's Island', which each come off like a pleasant, long vacation. And, to perhaps show us how easy it is to become wrapped up in a 'time-controlled' rat race without soaking up what is around us.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and the DVD 'extras'. I found the Dolby Digital track slightly more interesting than the DTS track. The optional commentary track clarified some points about the story, but mostly addressed location challenges and techniques for sound and film. I rate this one '8' of 10. It was difficult to make and was made well, still the story is not particularly groundbreaking.",Null,0,2,13 June 2001
Lilo & Stitch," Great animation, cute story, too much violence for my tastes.
","Our granddaughter is visiting this week so one of the DVD rentals was 'Lilo and Stitch.'  My first question, why didn't they spell her name 'Leeloh'? That would have been easier to pronounce correctly. While I enjoyed this animated movie, I enjoyed the extras even more. The DVD picture is absolutely first-rate, and on a HD TV looks virtually film-like. Also the 5.1 surround sound is used well. The extras include such things as the animation technique used, and the design which used all 'rounded' characters and objects to add to its friendly appeal. While I enjoyed this movie, compared to other recent animated films (SHREK, MONSTERS INC, DISNEY'S TARZAN, ICE AGE) it would be closer to the bottom of the list.
The rest of this review contains SPOILERS, so please do not read if you have not seen Leeloh and Stitch yet.The premise is an illegally 'created' little monster on a distant planet, who is sent into exile towards a desert astroid, but the smart little thing figures out how to escape and end up on a Hawiian island. He is built to be impervious to heat, cold, explosions, essentially 'unbreakable'.  But when he gets caught under a big rig and knocked out, he is mistaken for a strange-looking dog, and ends up in the pound where Leeloh and her big sister (parents are dead) adopt him and take him home. Programmed to destroy everything he is quite a handful, and eventually is responsible for destroying their beautiful house. But Leeloh's loving care, and her repeated reference to 'family' eventually gets Stitch to transform.
Near the end the aliens show up to nab Stitch (project 626) and return him to proper exile, but being a 'by the rules' people defer to Leeloh's adoption papers from the pound and leave Stitch with her. The house is re-built, everyone seems happy, the ending sets up a sequel which is now in the works.  Here's why I did not like it as much as some. To me 'animation' is a fun medium and an animated film should be mostly fun. Disney's Tarzan for example, while there is an early scene where a Leopard has killed the parents and is trying to nab the baby Tarzan, it is brief while the rest of the film is fun.  In Leeloh and Stitch, the little monster is just too mean, too destructive, that it was hard for me to have any empathy for him. Secondarily, while I in general like the animation style used, all of the Hawiians were drawn with these rounded pig-like noses and very heavy legs which are not attractive at all.So, yes I realize it just might be ME, but that is my honest reaction. Leeloh and Stitch is a very well done movie, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as most of the other recent animated films.",Null,0,3,19 April 2003
The Village," A study of group dynamics more than a scary movie.
","I saw 'The Village' on DVD, picture and sound are superb. We have a small village in the wilderness somewhere, it appears to be the late 1800s. They are self-sufficient, have no contact with the 'outside' world, avoid anything red, and the elders meet to make decisions for all. They appear to be one big family, the younger ones appear happy, the elders somber. The movie is NOT about what it seems initially, and I do not discuss that until after the 'spoilers' warning below. Not one of the best movies I have seen lately, and in the end not very thought provoking, but still and enjoyable almost two hours. Feb 2010 update: After almost 5 years I saw this again. I was only planning to watch a small part of it but found myself immersed and watched the whole thing again. Knowing the basic 'twist' didn't matter, in some ways it was more enjoyable to see how the story was constructed. Just a bit prolonged and slow in some scenes, but overall a very good movie.SPOILERS FOLLOW. William Hurt plays Edward Walker, chief elder and father of the blind girl, Ivy, played by Opie's daughter, Bryce Howard. Their few buildings and modest sized field are surrounded by Covington Woods, which the elders say are inhabited by 'those who we do not speak of.' Occasionally they will see a strange looking creature dressed in red flowing garb, and some of their livestock and chickens will be found dead, and skinned. Sometimes even large red 'slashes' painted on some doors, after all villagers emerge from their hiding places in cellars. Only Lucius appears unafraid, saying 'I don't worry about what might happen, only what needs to be done.'The whole thing is a ruse by the elders to keep the youngsters from straying. They created the red costumes and hide them under floors, and only use them when necessary to reinforce the fear. We only find out at the end, when Edward opens a secret box, and see newspaper clippings, all the elders were there because they had lost a loved one to violence related to the love of money and other material things. Edward, a Pennsylvania professor who also lost his wife, took all these people into a remote section of a Game Preserve to attempt this experiment, to live in isolation from the rest of the world and worldly treasures. A simple and pure life. Their plight is illuminated when Jucius (Joaquin Phoenix) is mortally wounded by the village idiot Noah (Adrian Brody) who become jealous when Ivy and Lucius decide to get married. Since all the elders had pledged to never leave the Village, and Ivy had pledged her love for Lucius, she was allowed to go through the forest to find a town and medicine to cure Lucius' infection. Noah discovers a red costume and follows her, in a very forced plot twist, and she tricks him into falling in a pit. At the end of the road she climbs over a wall, is spotted by a modern time Ranger in a vehicle, no one is supposed to be in the Game Preserve, she tells him her story, he finds medicine at the nearest ranger station, she brings it back to the Village, we suspect the Village will continue in its experiment.",Null,14,21,9 February 2005
21," Taking Las Vegas by card-counting.
","It is important to realize that card-counting is NOT illegal, but casinos really don't care for people who do it because it skews the odds in their favor, and a casino can lose big.Inspired by a true story of MIT students who did this, the movie has a very nice feel to it. Brit Jim Sturgess comes across much like Toby Maguire here, as Ben Campbell, serious student who is trying to get into MIT Medical school, but can't afford it unless he gets a grant. Ben also happens to be a natural math genius.One of Ben's professors is Kevin Spacey as Prof. Micky Rosa. When Mickey sees first-hand how Ben's mind works, he gets to recruiting him to join a small group that works hard in off-hours to master a card-counting technique. Then, they take their skills to Vegas on weekends and win lots of money.At first Ben wants no part of it. But a girl he already had his eye on, the prettiest girl at MIT, Kate Bosworth as Jill Taylor helps in the recruiting effort. Eventually Ben is hooked.The movie does a good job of switching between the rather boring academic lifestyle at MIT and the swinging glitz of Vegas.The fly in their ointment becomes Laurence Fishburne as Cole Williams, who works for the casino as a 'loss control' expert. He soon gets onto the trail of Ben and the others.Good, suspenseful movie. The ending is sort of 'forced', but my wife and I enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Ben is doing great but at one point gets sucked into the glamour of the moment and goes against their own rules and loses $200,000. Since Mickey is in for 50% of everything, he sees this as his money, and demands that Ben pay it all back. But Ben is saving his winnings for $300,000 that medical school will cost. Micky is a poor loser and steals the money Ben had stashed above his dorm bed in the ceiling. But Ben gets the last laugh, luring Mickey to Vegas one more time, where a trap had been set for Cole to capture him. And the basic outcome had Mickey obligated to restore all Ben's grades, and in the end it appeared Ben would get the grant to pay his medical school.",Null,0,0,30 September 2008
The Revenant," Winner of many awards, a story of survival in the 1800s.
","I watched it at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, not her kind of movie.A 'revenant' strictly speaking is someone who was dead then came back alive. That isn't exactly what happens here but for the men who left Glass for dead it may as well be accurate.Leonardo DiCaprio is Hugh Glass, and for this role he finally won his Best Actor Oscar. He is part of a medium sized hunting party, they are amassing animal hides to take back to civilization to sell. They have to watch for Native Americans who can be deadly.But Glass tangles with a Grizzly Bear that surprises him. He survives but is very badly wounded and when his men find him do not believe he will survive much longer. His nemesis is Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, also a member of the party but only wanting to take care of himself, and with a hostile attitude towards Natives.This is a long movie, right at 2 1/2 hours, but it is a very captivating story with great cinematography, mostly in the Canadian mountains in winter.MAJOR SPOILERS: Left behind in the snowy woods to watch over Glass are his son, a half-breed, a young soldier, and Fitzgerald, who only wants to get back to his pelts and get his profits. He kills the son and buries Glass, still alive, and they leave. But Glass doesn't ever give up, he pulls himself out of the grave and crawls because his legs are damaged.

Trouble with the Curve," Well-balanced baseball themed movie, Adams and Timberlake play well off Eastwood.
","I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s as a baseball fan, playing some ball and seeing teams like the Dodgers, the Cardinals, the Mets, the Giants, and the Colt 45s play MLB. So seeing this baseball themed movie with a veteran like Clint Eastwood was just a joy. There is little actual baseball playing here, the focus is on scouting. Embedded is the story of a man and the strained relationship with his adult daughter, a high-powered Atlanta lawyer.Clint Eastwood is veteran scout Gus, who does it the old-fashioned way, he reads newspapers, goes out to see what prospects look like, and has developed a sense that allows him to 'hear' clues. But old Gus is losing his eyesight, he stumbles over things, he gets angry, everyone around him senses something is wrong, but Gus is too proud to admit he has early macular degeneration. Plus the hot-shot scouts using computers for their scouting razz him about being out of date.Amy Adams is one of my favorite actresses, she is very attractive and athletic, and always creates interesting characters. Here as daughter Mickey (named after Mickey Mantle) she must be a top-notch, hard-nosed lawyer pushing for partnership in the firm, plus be a capable, knowledgeable baseball person who has 'scouting' instincts. She and Gus have not been on good terms for years, since her mom died when Mickey was 6. She always struggled with what she saw as Gus simply being an 'absent father'.Gus may lose his job when his contract expires in 3 months, he has a critical scouting trip coming up, Mickey learns about his eye problem by pressing the eye doctor, so to protect her dad she takes time off a critical project of her own to join him on the scouting trip. This eventually affords them the opportunity to clear some things up.One of the people she meets in Justin Timberlake as Johnny, an old friend of her dad's, he was recruited by Gus as a pitcher but his career ended prematurely from being over-pitched and he suffered shoulder injuries. So now he is scouting, and hoping for a promotion to on-air commentator for the home team.While the whole story is straightforward and easy to follow, there is a lot of complexity and the movie is done very well. Plus the resolution in the last couple of scenes is very heartwarming. My wife and I both enjoyed it. Good movie.I saw it twice, 4 days apart, and enjoyed it even more the second time.A bit of trivia, there is a character, Rigo, who is working as a peanut vendor at a school baseball game. When he tosses a bag it seems that he has a pretty good arm. Later he becomes the subject of a 'discovery' as a lefthanded pitcher. Jay Galloway, totally new actor, plays that role, he was chosen because he in actuality is a lefthanded pitcher in school.(Of note, the young hitter Billy Clark, lonesome for his mom, is played by Clint's real-life son Scott Eastwood.) SPOILERS: The hot-shot computerized recruiters drafted a kid who was a good hitter, but Gus and Mickey had determined he can't hit a curve ball ('Trouble with The Curve'). Meanwhile Mickey 'discovered' Rigo, throwing outside her motel room, she put on the mitt and caught a few, 'listened' for the right sound. She talked Gus's boss into giving him a tryout. He pitched against the new recruit, who failed to make even contact with any pitch, fastball or curveball. Mickey would give up her quest for law firm partnership and become an agent as a start to her baseball career.",Null,2,2,12 February 2013
Bridge of Spies," Good movie, long but never seems long.
","Watched it on DVD from our local public library.This movie has special significance to me, I was a teenager during the approximate 5-year period this movie is set, about 1957 through about 1962. I remember the news when Powers was shot down in the U2 spy plane over Russia and the cold war propaganda it generated.In this Spielberg movie, 'inspired' by true events, Tom Hanks is insurance lawyer James B. Donovan. There is an arrest of a suspected Russian spy and the government asks Donovan to be his defense lawyer, allegedly to show the world that even a suspected spy would get proper due process. But it was clear (at least the way this script is written) that all that was wanted was a quick conviction.A critical move was to talk the judge into giving the spy a life sentence instead of death, he reasoned that maybe the spy would eventually talk, but even if he didn't maybe there would be a future opportunity to use him in an exchange.That opportunity came in the early 1960s when Powers was flying a high- altitude U2 photo mission over Russia but was shot down. After that the government asks Donovan to try to negotiate a prisoner swap, to get Powers back. This required him to travel to East Germany as the Berlin wall was being constructed. There is a lot of tension and close calls but the mission is accomplished, also with the release of a young 25-yr-old student who did nothing wrong but was studying Economics in Germany.Surely there are some things fabricated but overall it is a nicely entertaining movie based on real people and real events.",Null,0,0,6 May 2016
Pitch Black," Beginning of the 'Riddick' series on movies.
","I recently saw the 2013 'Riddick' movie, and enjoyed it for the type of Sci-Fi entertainment that it is. But it is obvious that there must be some story preceding this one, so I looked up the earlier movies. Fortunately I found 3 of them on a 2-disk DVD set at my local public library. This one, 'Pitch Black', was the first in the series. It starts after criminal (Vin Diesel as) Richard B. Riddick has been captured by a bounty hunter and is being transported, along with a number of non- criminal passengers, via spaceship to a distant penal planet. It is far enough that everyone is placed in a type of cryo suspended animation state and the ship is on some sort of automatic trajectory and the crew would be awakened as they neared the destination. The spaceship encounters some unexpected debris, probably some asteroid remnants, that pierce the hull and causes it to lose pressure as they near an unknown planet. They get sucked into its gravitational field and as the hull starts to burn we know there must be oxygen in the atmosphere. After a very rough landing which destroys the spaceship and kills most occupants, a core of 10 survive, including Riddick and Radha Mitchell as pilot Carolyn Fry. The bounty hunter is Cole Hauser as William J. Johns.Most of the movie involves these crash survivors trying to survive on a hostile planet. They end up involving Riddick in the escape attempt as he has skills they need. The planet is occupied by some vicious alien creatures that only come out when it is pitch black, and are very efficient killers. They find remains of a geologic expeditions 22 years earlier, plus a small spaceship that they may be able to use as an escape vehicle if they can get it in working shape.I always imagined Australia to be an uninviting place, and it sure looks like it in this movie filmed in various locations that look like an alien planet. This earlier movie is not up to the standards of the most recent one, but is still entertaining.SPOILERS: In the end a few more die at the hands of the alien creatures, including Johns and Fry, but Riddick and a couple of others manage to avoid death and the movie ends as their spaceship has taken off and is headed away from the planet.",Null,0,2,15 March 2014
Split," Night Shyamalan creation, hit-N-miss drama with a long running time.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my local library. As several reviewers have already written Night Shyamalan, who started out so well, in fact 'Unbreakable' is one of my favorite movies, made some real stinkers after a few early hits. So 'Split' is a return to form, sort of. I didn't count the number of personalities, they say it is 23, but James McAvoy is really, really good as the several distinctly different split personalities. As the movie begins one dad is giving a ride home for his daughter and two friends and, as he finishes loading the trunk of the car someone comes up, drugs him, and drives away with the three girls. It is one of those many personalities.I liked the first 20 minutes or so, and I liked the last 20 minutes or so. The vast hour+ middle has a lot of talking, either the abductor with his psychiatrist or the abductor with his captives. Some things do happen but the great middle of the movie moves very deliberately.Who would really like this movie? Those who like a good character study above all. Shyamalan likes 'twists' and there are some but mostly unnecessary to the core story of a man fighting with his demons and three young girls trying to regain their freedom.I particularly enjoyed the young actress Anya Taylor-Joy as one of the girls, Casey. Not so much for her acting, which was fine, but she has these wide-set eyes and lips so perfect that they look like they were carved by an artist. Just a totally unique look.Plus I am a fan of Haley Lu Richardson who was one of the girls, Claire. I have seen her in several movies and she is simply a very good actress.SPOILERS: In the end we find that the girls had been held in an underground maintenance area in the Philadelphia zoo, someone found them and the survivors were freed.",Null,0,1,8 November 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," Pretty strange and gory movie, not the kind of movie I enjoy.
","My 17 year old neighbor warned me, she had seen this movie at the theater with her boyfriend and she told me to stay away, it isn't a very good movie. Well, it was a 'free rental' from my public library, so what the heck? The premise is interesting -- radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing from 1945 to the early 1960s caused a sub-race of mutants that are very, very mad. And love to kill things and eat them raw. A family heading west on vacation stops at an out of the way gas station and are told of a 'shortcut' that turns out to be their undoing. The main of the movie is to see if they and their dogs will survive in the rugged desert hills against these mutants. Hint -- they don't all make it.The movie uses blood and gore for shock value, a number of times. The best thing about the movie is that I was very glad when it was over.",Null,3,4,24 August 2006
Cold Mountain," Homer's Odyssey, superimposed on a Civil War background in the 1860s.
","What we always learn from movies about war is that men always start them, and war is terrible for everyone. So the story is familiar. Young men go to war, most get killed, while their wives, children, and girlfriends back home miss them and wonder if they will ever see them alive again. A few of the older, less-capable men stay behind to preserve the peace, but they inevitably get caught up in power and jealousy, and become evil men that the women have to fight in their own war back home. Some men in the army get fed up with all the carnage, and waiting for the war to end, so they become hunted deserters, trying to find their way back home. Meanwhile, as years pass, those who stay home become changed. All that is in 'Cold Mountain', in a story not too different from Homer's Odyssey, except Ada (Kidman)is waiting for Inman (Law), while Ruby (Zellweger) is hoping to stay on the farm that she is working with Ada. It is long, at two and a half hours, and slow at times, but best appreciated almost as a 'mini-series.' Watching it in four 40-minute sessions, with food, exercise, and toilet breaks, made a lot of sense to me! Overall a very good, worthwhile movie. All actors did super jobs, but my favorite was Zellweger as Ruby, truly an Oscar-worthy performance.SPOILERS follow, in all the rest of my comments, you may want to quit reading now. The movie is edited in an interesting manner. We see Ada and Inman three years earlier, meeting, as she moves to this small town with her father, a minister. He is shy but very capable. She is outgoing and well-educated, but has no skills. Can't cook, can't garden, can't clean house, and after her father dies suddenly is practically helpless. Later after Ruby shows up and becomes her partner on the farm, and they are building a fence, Ada says 'This is the first thing that I ever made that has some use.' Ruby is just the opposite, she can do anything that a man can do.The parallel story is in 'present' time near the end of the war, Inman is injured, a volunteer reads him a letter from Ada, which motivates him to walk away from the hospital, basically becoming a deserter and hunted man. He begins the long trip back to Cold Mountain, walking along rivers and through forests. He encounters the equivalent of sirens and a cyclops, plus other hazards, becomes part of a chain gang of prisoners, escapes as all others die. Meanwhile Ada is forming a new life, as a partner (non sexual) with Ruby, all the while hoping to see Inman again.In the snow, in a remote area, Inman finally shows up, and pretending there is some religion somewhere that says you're married is you say 'I marry you' three times, they profess their devotion to each other and have one night of bliss in a well-made, tasteful love scene. The next day the rogue enforcer shows up, is snuffed, but one of his men shoots Inman, who a little while later dies in Ada's arms. A tragic ending for him that parallels the fate of the men in 'Das Boot', dying after surviving all sorts of perils before apparently making it home safely. In the end we jump to about 7 years later, judging from the age of the red-haired girl that is Ada and Inman's daughter. In spite of his death, he had given something good. Ruby had a husband and young child and, the war being over, all were living happily on the farm. Ada also had become a capable person.",Null,1,4,7 October 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," A fitting follow-up to the first Kung Fu Panda movie 3 years ago.
","It is hard to believe that it has been 3 years since I saw the first one, 'Kung Fu Panda.' I just reviewed my comments from that earlier movie and see that it was not explained how a Panda came to have a goose as a father. This movie covers that quite nicely, as it fits into the story. Plus, it ends with Po's biological Panda dad realizing that his son lives, and I imagine that will set up part of the story in 'Kung Fu Panda 3.' That remains to be seen.Also as I commented 3 years earlier, the animation is just eye-popping, the detail and the movement of both characters and their layers of costumes. Jack Black of course is back voicing Po, and a new menace has arisen to threaten the very existence of ancient China. That menace is aptly voiced by Gary Oldman as the peacock Shen. Angelina Jolie again is the voice of Tigress, and Dustin Hoffman is the voice of the old master, Shifu.The story isn't easy to explain so I will not try. However it involves Shen getting lots of metals to make very destructive canons, and Po, Tigress, and the others thwarting their plans. And we do find out, as a baby Panda Po had to be abandoned for his own survival and Mr Goose found him and raised him, an adopted son.",Null,0,1,2 January 2012
American Psycho," I saw it for Christian Bale, a fine performance in a so-so movie.
","I long have had this movie on my mental list of things to see. I was expecting something totally different.The movie in essence is a parody of the modern American businessman, especially those in the financial and trading businesses in New York. The lead is Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, good looking, fit, but shallow, really empty, inside. A really funny scene has men comparing business cards, and at the end Bateman can only see murder of the one with the best card as a way of saving face.There's quite a list of good actors here -- Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Chlo√´ Sevigny (as Bateman's secretary), Reese Witherspoon (as Bateman's fianc√©e), Jared Leto, and Willem Dafoe as Donald Kimball, the detective trying to solve the disappearance of one of Bateman's co-workers.SPOILERS. We see Bateman murdering co-worker Allen because his were the most impressive business cards. He hires hookers, has fun with them, and murders them. In one scene we see several bodies in a closet, wrapped in clear plastic. But in the end when he tells his attorney he has killed Allen, and many others, the attorney says that's impossible, I had lunch with Allen in London just recently. And, near the end we see a character that supposedly was murdered. So how much of it was in his mind? Maybe it doesn't matter, his whole fixation on himself was his psychosis.",Null,0,3,19 November 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Parents beware, too much frank 'F' talk and language spoils it for many.
","I like the premise, I like much of what the movie communicates. But Alan Arkin's 'grandpa' character was too filthy for me to like this movie overall. In one scene, while the whole family is in the van, he is telling his 15 year old grandson that his one advice is 'while you are young, 'F' (the sex act) all the girls you can', continuing to advise him to do it now, while he is still under 18, so he won't get in trouble with the law. All in front of mom and dad, but little daughter is listening to music on headphones and can't hear.This kind of writing is puzzling and bad, because it is unnecessary and cheapens an otherwise good movie. Not to mention the bad message it gives to any teenager that might be seeing it. The story could have been better told with milder, less graphic dialog and still established the character for the events near the end. After that scene, the movie never recovers for me.Greg Kinnear is obsessed with his '9 steps' to success, thinks he has a contract lined up with a firm to publish him, meaning big $$$bucks at last. But his daughter gets a last minute chance to compete in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest in California, meaning they have to take a road trip from Albuquerque. All the reasons why are complex, and are explained in the opening scenes. Mom, dad, daughter, angry and mute son, heathen grandpa, and an uncle on suicide watch. Much of the movie involves misadventures along the way, plus additional misadventures at the pageant.SPOILERS. The pageant itself makes fun of child pageants, with little girls dressed up and made up almost looking like prostitutes, singing and dancing. Our little miss sunshine does a dance taught her by her grandfather, who dies on the trip to California. It is a sexy, stripper dance, and the whole family gets in trouble, let go only if they promise to never, never ever come back to California to compete in anything.",Null,2,7,14 January 2007
North by Northwest," Entertaining, if not deep, Hitchcock road movie.
","When you take this story outside the realm of Hitchcock and Grant, and think about the story, it is a very simple and uninspirational one. For my viewing time and pleasure, there are very many movies, both Classic and modern, that are better than its rating would indicate. Still, Cary Grant and Eva Saint are fun to watch, and we get to see an interesting cross-section of the US. The DVD has a superb video transfer, almost film-like on a big screen, HDTV. Perhaps even better than what audiences saw in the theater back in 1959.SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading, OK!? Grant is a simple business man who gets mistaken for an undercover agent by the bad guys, so they kidnap him and the rest of the movie is his escaping and trying to find out what is really going on. He meets Saint on a train, she hides him in her compartment, but she is really working, under threat, for the bad guys. The chase takes Grant to a rural road in Illinois where the famous airplane scene takes place, ending when the plane crashes and explodes into a fuel truck. Then he ends up in South Dakota, and an exciting chase scene at Mount Rushmore, then at the crook boss's house, where Grant foils their plan to take Saint out of the country. The crooks get caught, it turns out the agent he was mistaken for was a phantom anyway, set up for covert purposes.",Null,1,3,7 October 2004
Knowing," Novel and interesting approach to determinism vs randomness and chance.
","Nicolas Cage is Astrophysicist John Koestler, and in an early present-day scene we see him in lecture to his college class. He is posing the question, is it determinism or randomness that leads to everything in the world as we know it? Did the Earth just happen, for example, to end up at just the right distance from our Sun to support life and evolution, or was there some grand plan that resulted in it? Having lost his wife just a year earlier in a fire, his current attitude is just that $$it happens. But in this movie the story starts 50 years earlier, when during part of the dedication of a new school all the students draw on a piece of paper 'what they think the future world will look like' and each is placed in an envelope with the student's name, and all is placed in a Time Capsule in the ground in front of the school building, to be opened in 2009. So here we are!One of the present-day students is Chandler Canterbury as John's son, Caleb Koestler. As fate (or determinism??) would have it, Caleb ends up with the envelope of young Lucinda's, and we saw in 1959 that her 'picture' consisted in a long and seemingly random list of numbers with no apparent pattern.This two-page list of numbers ends up at home and gets John's attention. Was the young girl just emotionally disturbed, or is there a message in the numbers? The movie is about John's search to unravel the mystery, and to come to terms with his own issues in life. Good movie. I saw it twice, about 2 weeks apart, and enjoyed it both times. It contains a few scary concepts.SPOILERS FOLLOW: Lucinda was not crazy, she was being spoken to by what might be considered angels, or maybe merely highly evolved aliens, it doesn't really matter. Her 'picture of what the world will look like' was actually coded to describe terrible events which resulted in many dead. The first one John decoded was the sequence '0911012996' which represented the 2996 that were killed in the 09-11-2001 Trade Center airliner attacks. John spent a whole night checking each coded date and the number that died with 100% correspondence. One included the date of the fire his wife died in. But there were other numbers which took a bit more time to recognize as coordinates for the locations. But all this meant nothing without the big kicker, the impending giant solar flare which was to burn up the Earth and kill everyone. But right before that happened John was able to get his son and a female child to a pre-selected spot where alien ships were to remove the chosen few to a far-away planet in another galaxy so that they could be the seed to continue life.",Null,0,0,29 July 2009
Hugo," The young boy who keeps the clocks running in the Paris train station.
","With as much advance publicity this film received ... several Oscars and awarded best film of the year by some groups ... it would be easy to be disappointed, but my wife and I were not. It is a very entertaining and very visually pleasing movie. Set in 1930s Paris the first thing is not to be thrown off by all the characters speaking with a British accent. In a form of throwback this is how movies were often made back in the middle of the 20th century. The story starts with the Paris train station at its busiest, with the Eiffel tower in the background. In the first 2 minutes we get glimpses of most of the main characters, and all of them by the 4 minute mark. The title character is Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret whom we soon discover is living in the expansive walls of the train station and keeping the massive clocks wound and running. We wonder, how did he get to this point, and why is an 11-year-old allowed to do this? Hugo is a fictional character but Ben Kingsley plays the real Georges M√©li√®s, the French auteur who in the late 1890s and early 1900s made dozens of movies each year, and pioneered many of the film techniques that would shape the future of the industry. M√©li√®s was in his 70s by the 1930s and was nearing his demise. He had long quit making movies and now makes a small living selling items in the train station. This movie is a relatively accurate depiction of him. Their paths cross when Hugo is trying to pilfer a mechanical mouse but is grabbed and forced to surrender his notebook, with the mysterious drawings of an automaton, a mechanical man that also had a history in M√©li√®s' life.What might seem like an unusual choice Sacha Baron Cohen (of 'Borat' fame) plays the Station Inspector after petty criminals and runaways. He is very effective in this role.American Chlo√´ Grace Moretz (vampire in 'Let Me In'), about the same age as Butterfield, is Isabelle and lives in M√©li√®s' household, although she says he is not her grandfather. She and Hugo eventually become fast friends and she helps assure his notebook is not burned.Jude Law has a small but important role as Hugo's dad.So, what is this movie about? The young boy gaining some resolution about his dad and becoming a spark to get M√©li√®s excited about movies again right before his death. SPOILERS: Hugo knew little about the automaton that his dad salvaged when it was being discarded, but the notebook was of his dad's drawings to try to rebuild it. His dad died in a tragic explosion and fire and Hugo took refuge in his dad's old job to avoid being placed with his drunkard uncle. The automaton originated with M√©li√®s who was shaken by the images it brought back in his mind.",Null,0,1,26 March 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Virtual non-stop action, and not too bad a story either.
","I won't give T:3 a very high rating as a movie, but I will give it a high rating for entertainment, especially for action junkies. During the first half there is an inspired 'chase' scene that is like nothing I have ever seen before, from its sheer audacity to the unabashed destruction in its wake. Arnold Schwarzenegger, now California Governor, seems to have been born to play the Terminator. However, although he looks much like the Terminators in the prior two installments, tells us that he is in fact a different edition.Nick Stahl is the 20-something John Connor, object of the killing cyborgs of the two earlier editions. We remember that John Connor is supposed to be the savior of the world after the destruction by the machines, and once again future machines have sent one of their own to the present to exterminate him. (I don't know why they didn't send one back to a time when he was maybe 3 or 4, seems he would have been an easier target then!)The exterminator this time takes the form of beautiful model turned actress, Kristanna Loken as T-X. (Reports are that she bulked up with muscle for this role, and she looks quite menacing, in a good way!) She is ruthless in her pursuit of her targets, but it seems she sometimes fails to take good opportunities to exterminate certain targets. But it is a movie, after all.So, once again the movie is about the two terminators from the future, passionless, one programmed to kill John Connor, the other programmed to protect him. Which one do we think will succeed? Claire Danes also has a good role, as Kate Brewster, assistant veterinarian, who also has a father Robert Brewster, a military man, who has leadership of some future state of the art computer network system.This movie is a broad comedy and the lead characters play it that way, especially Schwarzenegger and Loken, the cyborgs from the future. It is a dark comedy, to be sure, because there are a few people killed in cold blood. Not a great story, but an interesting one, and it has more action than one person needs in a 2-hour viewing.Edit: April 2020, watching it again after all these years, it has pretty much the same impact on me.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The machines have manufactured a sophisticated computer bug which systematically begins disabling all systems worldwide. No more communication with defense installations gets the Pentagon nervous and Robert Brewster is forced to put the prototype intelligent computer network in service, trusting it will find and defeat the bug. Instead, it becomes all part of the machines' plan, to launch an all-out war of destruction. John and Kate end up being directed to a safe shelter in the mountains, designed years earlier for the President, and they are destined to be the two to repopulate the world and continue the fight against the machines.

U-571," Really good WW II submarine film, great picture and sound for DVD home theater buffs.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 'U-571' is the fictional German U-boat in this story, set in the north Atlantic in 1942. The basic premise are the several 'allied' boats which recovered German message encoders which helped win the war. This is a fictional account of one of them.The human interest story is the young officer Tyler, played by Matthew McConaughey, who had just been passed over for a 'captain' assignment, because his commander, played by Bill Paxton, didn't think he was 'ready', including being able to sacrifice some of his men to save a mission. So, you very quickly realize that taking command and sacrificing his men will become part of the script.The movie starts with the sub U-571 being attacked and damaged, and a fire kills all the mechanics, so they cannot get the boat running. They use the encoder to send a secret mesage to get help. The Allies pick up the location of the transmission and figure out it is a U-boat and send an American sub dressed up as a german sub to get there first, with plans to capture the encoder and sink the sub so the Germans won't be wise to the deed.The plans go awry, the American sub is sunk, Paxton is killed, 'Tyler' becomes the de facto captain of the injured U-571 and attempts to get to Greenland for safety. The American mechanic gets one set of engines running well. The one German survivor, their captain, is chained up but still manages to wreak near havoc until they 'wrench' him! But the German destroyer figures out what is happening, uses depth charges to further damage the U-571, 'Tyler' hatches a plan to outsmart them, and finally gets their last torpedo on target. As the story ends an American airplane spots them and rescue is near. 'Tyler' becomes the captain that he wanted to be. In a somewhat syrupy scene, Harvey Keitel's character said, 'I'd go to sea with you anytime.'The DVD has both DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 selectable sound tracks. I wasn't able to notice any difference between the two. The surround sound really puts you in the middle of the action, and the explosions, all 38,751 of them, are very realistic. The picture color and sharpness are without flaw.My wife and I found the film very entertaining. To those few critics who think this film is not historically accurate, see the DVD 'extras'. They used experienced WW II submariners as consultants, and built the sets very accurately. The story itself is fictional, and fiction is 'fiction', so portrayed events are not intended to be real.  For total enjoyment with a somewhat predictable story I rate it '7' of 10.",Null,1,2,21 April 2001
The Shining," REDRUM! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
","I can't exactly say why, but up until today I had never seen even any part of this movie. I have it as one of the 9-movie Kubrick DVD set from my public library. I am not a big fan of the horror genre, it just doesn't satisfy my movie-watching tastes, but I mostly enjoyed this one. More for the visuals than for the story. It starts grandly, with an overhead (helicopter) shot of a small car traveling along a secluded road in a mountainous setting. I immediately recognized it as the Going to the Sun road in Glacier National Park, going westlerly along St Mary Lake towards the Continental Divide. Only this opening sequence was shot there, to establish a sense of isolation, of a man making a trip that perhaps he was not prepared to handle.Jack Nicholson is writer Jack Torrance , and he has taken an over-winter job as caretaker of an isolated mountainous lodge that gets snowed in from October through May. Bringing along his wife and young son, he hopes the isolation will allow him proper inspiration and time for his book.Shelley Duvall is his wife Wendy Torrance , and Danny Lloyd is his son, Danny Torrance, perhaps 6. The other key character is veteran Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann , the normal chef at the lodge.The title comes from a reference that 'shining' is a psychic ability that allows people to communicate telepathically, and even a building, like the old lodge, can 'shine.' This is what causes Jack to gradually spiral down into a form of madness, causing him to threaten his wife and son with harm or death. And 'seeing' parties of long-dead hotel guests.Ultimately I found it to be a rather empty thriller, but I really enjoy Kubrick's sense of style, and the way he framed scenes cinematographically. Nicholson is good, but his character is somewhat the same but an expansion of what he plays in movies such as 'Five Easy Pieces' and 'One Flew Over.'SPOILERS: In the end Wendy, fearful of Jack, gets a baseball bat, and defending herself whacks him on the head. He tumbles down stairs, she drags him into a food storage area, locking him in. He does get out but chasing his son in the snow gets lost in the huge maze outside, and freezes to death while Wendy and Danny take the snow vehicle to safety.",Null,0,3,15 April 2013
American Beauty," A really fine, unique movie about life, but not for youngsters.
","Please don't get this movie confused with another 1999 movie, 'American Pie', which was a funny but rather crude movie about horny teenagers all trying to get laid.'American Beauty' is about real life, about dysfunctional families who don't realize why they are crazy. Until Lester (Kevin Spacey) figures it out. Quits his job, quits pretending he is something he is not, and learns to really begin to deal with life. There are lots of laughs, but also lots of drama.Make no mistake, this is a movie about Lester's life and death. 'American Beauty' has the courage to look at 'us'. It does so through the eyes of Lester Burnham who tells you at the beginning that he will be dead within the year. Interesting concept!!There are several other stories in the movie, but they are there only as they relate to Lester's. In some spots, it would be easy to walk out of the movie because of where you think it may be going. But stay, watch the whole thing, see how it all fits together and I think you'll agree it is a rare movie among all the special-effect, mega blockbuster that seems to be turned out like beanie babies. Although this one is totally different, the way its messages come through may remind you of movies like 'Fargo' and 'A Simple Plan'. If you didn't think those were fine movies, skip this one.Kevin Spacey gives an award-quality performance. Most middle-aged men will quickly identify with his character. But turn the roles around and women should just as easily identify.The reason I say this movie is not for youngsters is because they have not lived enough to comprehend and identify with the characters. But the sex and language are not nearly as bad as some mainstream movies. There is nudity, and graphic discussion of sex acts and body parts among teenagers in this movie, but it probably was necessary within the overall context. I give it 9 of 10, a must-see for any adult who enjoys examining his or her situation in life.2009 edit: I have watched this movie several more times and have enjoyed it as much as I did on the first viewing.2014 edit: I upgraded to Blu-Ray for this movie, it is worth it.",Null,3,7,10 October 1999
Over the Hedge," An extended cartoon story, with superb animation.
","Even before I saw 'Over the Hedge' I was reflecting on where animation has gone the past 6 to 8 years. I remember being blown away by 'A Bug's Life' and 'Disney's Tarzan.' The animation was so great and the stories were equally good. But more recently, as animation has gotten even better, we are getting used to it, and enjoyment depends on there being an excellent story. Movies like 'Shrek' and 'Monsters Inc' qualify. But many are just good animation, ad I find myself getting tired of just watching good animation.This movie falls somewhere in between extremes for me. I found the story moderately interesting, but not good enough to sustain an 80 minute story. I most liked the squirrel character Hammy, voiced by Steve Carell. He can do so much with his voice acting, and the animators met the challenge with his animated character.The main part of the story has Bruce Willis as RJ the raccoon stealing from a hibernating bear, getting caught, and then RJ trying to con the rest of the animals to do his reparations for him, collect all the things that RJ inadvertently destroyed. Mostly this involves the animals traveling across the hedge separating their woods for the subdivision. One plan has them trying to get the collar from a cat, because the collar has a device that electronically opens the pet door. This will allow them entrance to the home and its store of food items.The voices are an all-star cast, with Garry Shandling as Verne, Steve Carell as Hammy, Wanda Sykes as Stella, William Shatner as Ozzie, Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, Thomas Haden Church as Dwayne the animal control man, Allison Janney as Gladys the home owner, Eugene Levy as Lou, Catherine O'Hara as Penny, and Avril Lavigne as Heather.",Null,0,0,2 November 2006
The Alamo," Good movie for anyone wanting a dramatization of battles fought for Texas' independence.
","I live pretty near Washington, Tx, where the Republic of Texas began almost 200 years ago. The park, Washington on the Brazos, has a remarkable visitor center with displays which tell the story of Texas. This movie, The Alamo, was made by Texans to show, as accurately and entertainingly as possible, the fall of The Alamo to Santa Anna, followed closely by the eventual defeat of same by Sam Houston to secure Texas' independence from Mexico. Santa Anna saved his life by agreeing to sign away the territory. Dennis Quaid, a native Houstonian, plays Sam Houston very effectively. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as Davy Crockett, violinist and sharpshooter, and spinner of tall tales. Overall a very satisfying movie for anyone who is interested in the subject.The DVD's sound and picture are first rate. The extras are worth seeing. During the filming of the Alamo scenes and battles, the extras were asked to look over a list of all those who died defending the Alamo, and pick an actual person to portray. Some of the extras actually descended from those deceased hero's, and played their own great grandfather or distant uncle. When you see the scene in the movie, you can see it on their faces. They were not 'just extras', they were standing in the place of those real hero's, and it made a difference.",Null,3,4,14 October 2004
Wanted," Comic book approach to a 1000-year-old fraternity of assassins.
","This movie starts off a bit strangely and, if we had known upfront that it was based on a graphic novel it would have made sense sooner. The main theme is a fraternity of assassins so there is quite a bit of graphic killing, but it is done in a comic book style and I believe most viewers will accept it as such.James McAvoy is Wesley Gibson in a boring office cubicle job and with an extra large woman for a supervisor. He is about to go crazy there when one day at the supermarket he gets caught up in an assassination attempt. In the process he meets Angelina Jolie as Fox, they escape in a wild car-chase scene, and she tells him that he is destined to follow his father into the 1000-year-old fraternity of assassins.The targets of the assassinations are obtained in a very unique way, woven into fabric in a binary code. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, who operates the weaving mill, and who shows Wesley how things work.In addition to Fox, there are character names like Cross, Gunsmith, The Repairman, Mr. X, The Exterminator, and The Butcher.The plot is fairly convoluted, but suffice to say that certain characters have superhuman powers, like the ability to slow down time so they can, for example, dodge bullets, or shoot such that their bullet smashes against a bullet headed for them. At times the photography reminds one of the 'Matrix.' This isn't really my type of movie, but I was fairly entertained.",Null,0,0,3 January 2009
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," A great sequel, and IT IS even better than the first movie.
","In one of the DVD extras Ben Stiller comments that they wanted to make this second Madagascar movie better than the first, and from my vantage point they did it. There was more going on, the story was more interesting, and the dialog was more clever.This movie actually opens with a short scene to show how, many years earlier, the New York lion Alex was captured as a cub and how he ended up in the zoo, followed by his and the other animals' escape that resulted in becoming stranded on Madagascar.After that suitably short flashback, the movie picks up where the first one left off. The band of Penguins have made their way to Madagascar and they, along with the locals, are working diligently to restore a long-lost crashed plane to flight worthiness. The images and dialog are so inventive and interesting. When they finally get airborne, headed back to New York, it is clear to us they will never make it.In yet another inventive and funny sequence, the plane ends up crash-landing in Africa, coincidentally the same region where Alex had been born and where his father and mother still lived, peacefully along with all the other animals. So the main of this movie involves how the group from Madagascar integrate into the existing African animal dynamics, and how they must cooperate to save the animals from an unexpected drought. Very inventive, very interesting and entertaining movie.Ben Stiller is back as the voice of Alex the lion. As are Chris Rock as Marty the Zebra, David Schwimmer as Melman the giraffe, Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria the Hippo, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the little animal Julien.New actors include (deceased) Bernie Mac who does a great job as Zuba, the father of Alex. And Alec Baldwin as Makunga, the lion who covets Zuba's leadership, and who is always trying to make trouble for Zuba.",Null,3,4,4 August 2009
Heartbreak Ridge," Vintage Clint Eastwood, as a tough Marine drill sergeant Tom Highway.
","As I was watching this movie my immediate thought was 'I wonder if his name was chosen because of the old phrase 'My Way or the Highway'?'. I can't answer that but it sure seems appropriate.I saw this on streaming Netflix.We right away get a glimpse of the character Clint Eastwood plays in the opening scene when he and a bunch of others are in a jail holding cell, swapping stories. When a large, mean-looking guy comes up and says derogatory things about Marines, Eastwood gives it right back to him. When the mean guy tries to beat him up, he is subdued in a couple of seconds, then Eastwood goes right back to his stories. He plays Sergeant Thomas Highway, a by-the-book, no-nonsense platoon leader who received a medal of honor many years earlier, in a battle few even knew about, at Heartbreak Ridge. But now he sometimes drinks too much, gets in fights, and is getting close to the mandatory retirement age. (He was actually about 55 during filming, and looked real good.) So most of the movie is about Highway getting re-assigned to his former post and put in charge of a rag-tag platoon of men who were lazy, disrespectful, and hardly ready for possible battle. Which he does quite admirably. Lots of funny stuff in there also, and many great one-liners. Also, Highway's former wife, Marsha Mason as Aggie, still lived and worked in the community as a bar hop so they could rekindle their animosity towards each other. I really like this movie, even though I waited almost 25 years to finally see it. After getting his men in shape, they were called to assist in a raid on Grenada, to recover a group of American students being held there. They turned out to become the heroes of the fictional invasion. There really was a 1983 invasion of Granada, to safeguard Americans living there during a coup.",Null,0,1,16 January 2011
Salt," Angelena Jolie as Evelyn Salt, in a female equivalent of a Jason Bourne role.
","We watched this on DVD (theatrical version) with Emily, who had seen this movie a couple of times already. But she noted that certain key points in the movie were different, including the ending. After reading a bit, it seems that there are at least three versions of this movie, 'Salt.'The movie opens 'two years earlier' in a prisoner exchange with N. Korea, where they had been torturing Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, to get her to admit to her role as a spy, but she insisted that they were wrong. Out, and back in the USA, we see her working for the CIA. Then, as she is about to leave work to go celebrate her anniversary, a Russian comes in and says he knows about a plot to kill the Russian president on an upcoming visit, and further that there are quite a number of Russian spies implanted in the USA culture, living as Americans but planning an eventual destruction of the USA.Then he says the spy's name is 'Salt. Evelyn Salt.' That gets her on the run, a journey which doesn't end for the entire movie.I like Jolie as an action hero. Jason Bourne has nothing on Evelyn Salt, and we see her get out of some very sticky situations. The topic is current, as during the past year some Russian spies living here had been discovered, and deported. The extent of the story presented in this movie is very far-fetched, but makes for good entertainment.July 2019 edit: We watched it again after 8 years, this time on the BluRay version I bought a while back, again it comes across as a highly improbable but exciting and entertaining caper.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As we see Salt run we wonder if she really is a spy planning to kill the US President. But we also see she never kills people, only wounds or disables them. Until she comes upon the Russian spy hideout, where she kills all that are there. So we figure she really is a Russian spy, implanted for a long time, but she has come to realize their mission is not a good one, and now she is doing what she can to stop it. In the climax of the movie the POTUS is in an underground safe place, guarded by trusted Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter, but he turns out to be a traitor. He is trying to start a nuclear war, with Iran and Israel as prime targets, and she has to stop the launch sequence. In the end, still not knowing for sure what she is, she is allowed to escape by jumping out of a helicopter into a lake, and as the movie ends we see her running through the woods. This sets up a sequel, as she had explained that there are lots more embedded Russian spies.",Null,1,3,2 January 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Parody of musician biographical movies.
","I had high hopes for this movie. I like John C. Reilly and he always creates memorable characters. But this movie steps across an uncomfortable line, with frequent frank and often 'dirty' sexual references. It dips too much into toilet humor to retain its parody edge. I was overall disappointed.This movie is a parody of musical biographical movies like the Johnny Cash 'Walk the Line.' It follows much of that movie closely as we see young Dewey Cox playing a game with his brother, with swords, and Dewey accidentally kills his older brother. Several times during the movie the mean dad is heard to say 'the wrong boy died.' Reilly plays the grown up Dewey Cox. Of course he has a nice wife and kids back home but as he is on the road gets unwisely involved in booze, drugs, and wild women.On a positive note, Reilly does an admirable job singing the songs in this movie. But for me that was not enough to salvage it. I could not recommend it to my friends.",Null,0,1,28 May 2008
We're the Millers," A lot more entertaining than I thought it would be.
","Somewhere a few weeks ago I came across a list of 2013 movies that a fan made, of the better movies of that year. This one is on that list so I looked it up and found it on BluRay at my local public library. I watched it without my wife, this is NOT her kind of movie.It is of course a silly comedy with lots of vulgar language and frank sexual references. Some of it falls totally flat but there are enough really funny moments that overall it is quite entertaining, for those who don't mind the sex talk and vulgar language.It starts in Denver, Jennifer Aniston is a stripper, Rose O'Reilly, a neighbor is marijuana dealer Jason Sudeikis as David Clark, a young homeless female is Emma Roberts as Casey Mathis, and goofy young neighbor is Will Poulter as Kenny Rossmore.Against all odds the four form a team to travel to Mexico in a large RV to transport a load of marijuana for a local distributor, Ed Helms as Brad Gurdlinger. David figures if they pretend to be a happy tourist family they can get back through the checkpoint without being checked. To his surprise, when they get there the Mexicans load up a ton of the drug.The trip back across the border and to Denver doesn't go smoothly at all and that is where most of the humor is inserted. What starts out as four people who really have no desire to be with the others eventually turns into a 'family' of sorts, each looking out for the other.SPOILERS: Brad is totally dishonest, he had promised to pay David 1/2 $Million for delivering the drugs safely to him. But he backs out, and as soon as he does DEA agents descend on him, with David's cooperation. He and the rest of the impromptu 'family' have to be put into witness protection and are relocated to a suburb, meeting the new neighbors over the fence they announce 'We're The Millers.'",Null,1,1,16 May 2016
Apocalypse Now," Exaggerated fictional account of an American military leader gone insane.
","Even I find it a bit remarkable that just this week I got around to seeing this movie. I was rummaging through the movies on the shelf at my local public library and found this one on Blu Ray. Of course the picture and sound are both remarkably good, and includes very deep bass in key scenes where it is appropriate.Two versions of this movie are on the disc, the original 2+ hour version with neither opening nor closing credits. Also the 'redux' version released a few years ago, it is 3+ hours long. While the basic story is the same in each, the longer version includes a couple of scenes cut from the original. Neither of them affect the main story.The main story is about a rogue military leader in the late 1960s, in a good performance Marlon Brando is Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. He has ended up somewhere in Cambodia and off the radar. He is accused of killings that may or may not be justified in the context of the Vietnam war.In an equally good performance is Martin Sheen as expert assassin Captain Benjamin L. Willard. he is called in specifically to do a covert mission, if caught he was never sent, to find Kurtz and 'terminate his command', which really meant to assassinate him.To do this a small crew with a small boat are assigned to him, and they head out not knowing for sure when and where they would end up.What makes this movie so striking are the makeup and cinematography which take the acting of Brando and Sheen up to another level. My only gripe with the movie is how they made so many of the military guys seem like frat boys using bad judgment and acting stupid. I am Vietnam war age, I knew several who went and served and to me it disrespects all the thousands who went and did not act like stupid frat boys.",Null,0,0,24 July 2016
Disturbia," A mostly entertaining modern take on Hitchcock's 'Rear Window.'
","Somewhere in the middle of the movie the main character makes a reference to the big city suburbs as 'disturbia' (suburbia) and that is the source of the name of this movie, a reference to disturbing things that tend to go on in neighborhoods.Shia LaBeouf is the lead character Kale Brecht and the movie begins with him fishing trout with his dad in a beautiful setting with Rocky Mountains as a backdrop. They are close, they are having fun, but a horrific crash on the way home results in the death of his father. This is necessary to set up the rest of the story, young Kale becoming depressed and under-performing in school. His Spanish teacher makes a comment about his dead dad, Kale decks him, and goes to court. He ends up with a 3 month home imprisonment with ankle monitor, and this allows him to spy on neighbors as a way to kill time.Pretty Sarah Roemer as the 'hot' Ashley Carlson moves in next door, and to Kale's surprise she starts to hang out with him. They start spying together on a neighbor that Kale suspects is the killer of a lady in the news as missing.Carrie-Anne Moss of Matrix 'Trinity' fame is his mom, Julie Brecht. Aaron Yoo is his funny Asian friend who gets involved too.This movie is nowhere near the quality of Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' but for a modern horror movie is pretty well made and enjoyable.BIG SPOILERS. David Morse is Robert Turner, the neighbor on the other side. He drives a blue 1960s Mustang with a dented left fender, as reported in the news as a suspected vehicle. As Kale spies on him, he sees things that lead him to believe that he is a serial killer of women. Now his mother is also in danger as she has become friends with Turner. In a complicated ending scenes, there is a secret part of Turner's house where Kale finds corpses and other evidence of his crimes. (I would imagine that it would have smelled pretty bad in there!) In a terrific fight in his house, Kale and Ashley manage to fight off Turner, find his mom in Turner's house, and when the police arrive Turner is dying in his own dungeon with shrub shears sticking into his chest. Pretty disturbing stuff.",Null,0,0,19 November 2007
The Patriot," Mel Gibson kicks British Butt in 1776 as the 'ghost', the Patriot, I rate it '8' of 10.
","CAUTION -- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --On DVD is really the only to see and appreciate this film. Not only are the picture and sound perfect, with John Williams music, but the DVD extras give additional insight into the making of the movie.  Much effort was taken to make it historically accurate, from the costumes to the battle techniques to the outcomes of the various battles.  Some military men, like Washington and Cornwallis, were genuine. Others, like Gibson's character, were composites of 2 or 3 genuine soldiers. Research at the Smithsonian was the source of authenticity for this film. The film was set and shot in South Carolina.DD 5.1 sound is used very effectively, especially during the battle scenes where you almost duck to avoid flying bullets. Also the early scenes, in a house, with battle explosions in the distance, in the left or right backgtound.Overlaid on the historical period from 1776 through 1781 is a fictional story of a man who did not want to fight this war. After his son was executed by the dastardly British officer, and later his oldest son killed in battle at the sword of the same officer, he vowed to help win the war, and to kill the officer. As an audience, we know how it will all end, yet the film never gets dull.  Although they obviously were two separate efforts, 'The Patriot' and 'Gladiator' are very similar films - in both a brave and expert military man just wants to be with his family, but ends up tracking down and killing the man who is responsible for harming his family.This film is great entertainment, and a great reminder of how much our ancestors gave to establish the US of A. And what a key role the French played at the end to ensure vistory over the British.  The English may not enjoy this film as much. I rate it a strong '8' of 10.",Null,1,19,17 March 2001
Edward Scissorhands," A fable about fitting in ... or not.
","I had seen this movie years ago, and recently found the DVD at my public library. Watching it again was almost like a fresh experience. Depp was very young, Ryder was a teenager, and they were perfect. The DVD extras has a few 'sound bites' from several actors and the writer and I was particularly struck by how poorly the young Depp expressed himself. But that is history.An old inventor (Vincent Price) living on the mountain at the end of the cul-de-sac in this flat Florida suburb has made this boy, Edward (Johnny Depp), but didn't have a chance to finish him when he dropped dead. Edward still had scissors for hands, and many nicks on his face from inadvertent cuts.Peg (Diane Wiest) is an Avon sales lady and is having a particularly unproductive day, when she decides to drive up to the old house on the hill, go in, and try to find someone to sell Avon to. She encounters Edward and does what any mom would do, she took the orphan home, gave him some clothes, and sat him at the dinner table with the family.Edward is, of course, very different. While the old inventor explained lots of things to him, Edward had never experienced social settings, he had no idea what real people did in real everyday life. Kim (teenager Winona Ryder, before her felony days) is Peg's daughter and she sort of takes a sympathetic liking to Edward, in the end defending him against her mean boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Kathy Baker plays Joyce, the over sexed neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, and Alan Arkin, sounding a lot like Christopher Walken, is the dad, Bill, who takes everything in stride.The movie is mostly entertainment, seeing how this unusual character Edward copes with his new surroundings. But it is also a story about acceptance of someone who is different. Edward never quite fits in, even though he fascinates people with his skill, sculpting hedges or cutting hair. The movie has a somewhat dark ending, but the only one possible in this impossible situation.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Jim is relentless, and ends up following Edward back to the old house on the hill, along with Kim. He is mistreating her too and, angry, Edward stabs him and Jim falls to the ground below, bleeding and eventually dead. Kim tells the gathering crown that Edward died in the building collapse, but in fact he was safe. Kim narrates the story as a very old woman and when the little girl asks if Edward still lives she says she is sure of it, because before him it never snowed, but now it snows every winter. And we see Edward using his scissor hands to carve yet another ice sculpture, and the fury of his actions send up a snow storm of sorts.",Null,0,1,14 August 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Good movie, deals with the heartbreaks in life and our searching for the Silver Linings.
","As are many good movies, this one is based on the book by the same name. My wife is an avid reader and finished the book not long before we saw the movie, in glorious detail and superb sound on Blu-Ray. She says the movie is basically faithful to the book, but of course has to leave a lot out to stay at an approximate 2-hours running time. One thing she mentioned in particular, as a change, Pat Sr. seems a bit more mellow and likable in the role De Niro creates for the movie.Bradley Cooper is the lead as Pat , and we see him coming back to his parents' home after an 8-month absence. After he had come home to find his wife in the shower, naked, with another man, he sort of went berserk and ended up in a mental hospital. But when he gets home, trying hard to use all of the tools he was taught to tame his bi-polar disorder, he continues to talk as if he and his wife will reconcile.His good friends and neighbors, a couple, invite him for dinner and to meet the wife's younger sister, Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany . She has had a fairly recent tragedy, her husband died in an unfortunate incident. But Pat and Tiffany get along from the start as fire and ice, oil and water, vinegar and bleach. In other words, they clash. Usually in this type of movie it means they are actually meant for each other.The movie has a really fine cast, rounded out by Robert De Niro as Pat Sr. He has his own issues, a bit 'OCD' having to arrange his remotes exactly a certain way on the table, and now running a gambling business of sorts, puts a lot of faith on 'karma', if Pat Jr. watches a game with him on TV, for example, their Philadelphia Eagles have a better chance of winning.So basically all the main characters have serious issues, and the movie is about overcoming them and figuring out a way to make it through life and relationships. One thing I like is the use of dance as a catalyst for Pat Jr.'s recovery, he is basically roped in by Tiffany to learn a routine and be her partner in an upcoming dance competition. It also ends up getting tied to a gambling bet, but that is minor. The real idea is that people, and we see it also in autistic children, often an art, like dance or music or painting can help them overcome many issues and function at a higher level. Dance was able to do this for Pat Jr.Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance as Tiffany, and it is easy to see why. At her young age she is already an acting force, and when you look at her various roles to date, all different, it makes sense.",Null,1,4,16 May 2013
Divergent," In the future, 100 years after the great war, divergent people are hunted down.
","Divergent: differing from each other or from a standard.That is the main theme of the movie. In this future dystopian Chicago, over 100 years after the great war destroyed most of the world, the city is partly in ruins and has a great protective fence/wall around it. Society is divided into 5 factions, according to the person's characteristic strengths. A few don't fall into any category and become factionless, essentially homeless. But 'divergent' people occasionally are born, they don't have one strength but several and are looked upon with great suspicion and distrust.Shailene Woodley is really good as Tris (short for Beatrice) who, along with her brother, are entering young adulthood and along with scores of others are being tested. But her tests are inconclusive, because she is a divergent. But she must not reveal that, otherwise there is a good chance she will be killed by the authorities.Tris chooses the Dauntless faction, they are brave, nothing scares them, they shy away from no conflict and their job is to keep Chicago safe. Much of the movie deals with the rigorous training for several weeks, during which Tris exhibits some problem-solving skills that makes other suspicious of her.Theo James is one of the instructors, called Four, for his four fears, and he and Tris become attracted to each other. Ashley Judd is good as her mother Natalie, who it seems also is a divergent, only revealed to her daughter near the end.My wife and I watched it, she had read the book maybe 18 months earlier, we both enjoyed it. June 2015 edit: We just watched it again after 10 months and enjoyed it even more this time, knowing the basic story. Looking forward to the DVD of the second one.SPOILERS: There was a rebellion, a faction was trying to take over society leadership and Tris and Four got caught up in the effort to stop them. They were able to avoid the effects of a serum because both of them are divergents. In the fighting both her mom and dad died, but she and Four survived and squashed the rebellion. As the movie ends they have hopped a train and are headed to the perimeter, probably to the outside world, setting up the sequels that are in the works.",Null,0,0,16 August 2014
Ender's Game," Very entertaining Sci-Fi story.
","My wife read the book and after we saw the movie, on Blu-Ray, she said the basic story was consistent with the book, just a lot of stuff in the middle had to be shortened to make a movie less than 2 hours.It is somewhat in the future and the apparent overall theme is to defend remaining Earth from an alien species that had attacked at some time earlier. It builds on the idea that the present day and future warriors will be the younger generation, the guys and girls who grew up playing video games. Their vision and coordination can give them the superior skills necessary to defeat an enemy. But there is another theme, relating to whether it is ethical to strike the perceived enemy in a pre-emptive manner, to destroy them before they have the chance to strike you again. The story focuses on Asa Butterfield (of 'Hugo' fame) as Ender Wiggin. He is one of a number of kids who have been selected for their potential, but they still have to go through a tough training and weeding out sequence. Most of them wash out at some point, but Ender keeps showing that he has skills and insights that make him a leader, such as being put in charge of some misfits who eventually work their way to the top of the class. He eventually is chosen as 'the one' who will lead the military force against the enemy.Harrison Ford is Colonel Graff and Ben Kingsley is Mazer Rackham. Both of them appear to be top guys in the military planning, I was never sure which one of them was the top, but probably Graff. Four of us watched it, and found it to be a really good story and the movie was interesting all the way through. SPOILERS: After having a bad failure in an advanced training exercise, Ender's group was given one last 'exercise' to see if they were ready, and they took a very unusual approach to sacrifice some of their space ships to protect the main ship and destroy the alien planet. Immediately after he learned that it wasn't an exercise, they had actually destroyed the civilization, of an intelligent species that looked like giant ants and communicated via thoughts. Ender felt great empathy for them because it was done not in defense and he thought trying to communicate would have been a better approach. In the end he meets with one of the queens and takes an egg, determined to find them a planet where they could continue their race.",Null,1,2,22 February 2014
Monsters vs. Aliens," Beautifully animated science-fiction movie, entertaining enough.
","We saw this last night on DVD. When we saw the extras it became clear that the movie was made as a 3-D movie. While the DVD is a straightforward 2-D movie, the images are so clear and interesting it looks almost like 3-D.The story is just interesting, science-fiction fluff, but not as good and as interesting as movies like 'Wall-E' or 'Monsters Inc.'.Reese Witherspoon's voice is Susan Murphy, getting ready to go into the church for her wedding. Then we see the explosion of a planet, supposedly some time earlier, and a glowing blue-green piece flies away, and is headed for Modesto, California, where Susan and her fianc√©e' live. As fate would have it, the meteorite falls on Susan. It doesn't harm her, instead the 'mojo' of the projectile becomes part of her, and when she walks into the wedding chapel she is glowing a soft blue-green. Then she begins growing rapidly, into a giant woman. In this form she is nicknamed 'Ginormica'. Of course the wedding ceremony is aborted.The US military reacts right away, under the leadership of Kiefer Sutherland's voice as General W.R. Monger (war monger). Seems for about 50 years he has been in charge of a top-secret program where real monsters are captured and held in a location that is also top-secret, and after shooting drugs into her, Ginormica is brought there. She meets several of the monsters, including Seth Rogen's voice as B.O.B. (who is a blob without a brain), Hugh Laurie's voice as Dr. Cockroach who can't be crushed and killed, and Will Arnett's voice as The Missing Link.The bad guys are creatures with 4 eyes from the planet that got blown up, they need to get back their 'mojo' that is now inside Susan. So they first send an giant robotic probe that just about destroys San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, but Susan and the other monsters manage to prevail. So the creatures themselves come to Earth to re-capture the mojo.We can all pretty well guess what happens, and when Susan finally is returned to normal size realizes what a heel her fianc√©e' is and she is headed for a better life.",Null,0,1,12 October 2009
Save the Last Dance," Very nice study of modern inner-city race relations.
","SPOILERS - 'Save The Last Dance' is about race relations. Older movies often explored this in the form of a black male (To Sir With Love, etc) into a predominantly white setting. This film does the opposite, transporting a very white and blonde female high school senior from the East into an almost all-black Chicago inner-city school. Although Sara (Julia Stiles) is not at all intimidated by the new setting, she is definitely a fish out of water, needing to learn a new language of slang, a new way of dressing, a new way of hip-hop dancing, and learning to deal with jealousy as she befriends Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), the good-looking and college-bound black senior. As Sara finds out, in the black culture such upstanding young men are highly prized and young black women resent their being lured away for the pool by young white women.The director of 'Save The Last Dance' is a black man, Thomas Carter, who over the years has directed a few other movies, but a larger number of high-profile TV series. Among his goals for this film was to make it as true to current life as possible, and in viewing it I believe he has achieved this. A distraction was the obvious age discrepancies of some of the actors. For example, high school senior 'Derek' was played by a 30-year-old actor, and several of the other high-schoolers appeared between 25 and 30.
As the story starts, Sara is living with her mother, studying ballet, and auditioning for Juliard. She earlier pleaded with busy mom to be there for support.  Mom was not there, Sara botches her modern dance routine, later finds out that mom died in a car wreck while trying to make it to the try-out. Distraught, Sara blames herself and her dance interest, and vows to give up ballet. Moving to Chicago to live with her estranged dad, a local jazz trumpeter, attends the local public school.  Among the friends she makes is Derek, who teaches her to dance hip-hop, encourages her to take up ballet again, and the two develop a teen love relationship.In the end, Sara gets another chance with a Juliard audition in Chicago, and finds she will be accepted. Derek yearns to be a doctor, a pediatrician, also finds he is accepted at Georgetown. Derek's friend, Malakai, shrugs off good advice, gets in trouble again, is carted off by the cops. Derek's high school sister has a young child, about 2 yrs, and battles with the father over his obligations. Thus this film touches on a number of real issues in modern teen life. The DVD has a number of very interesting extra features, including comments by the director and several of the actors, plus a few deleted scenes which fill in a couple of 'holes' in the script. Overall a very worthwhile film that faces the difficult issues of black/white race relations head on, but in a positive way.",Null,0,3,8 August 2001
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," You have to be in the mood, and I was in the mood! Very entertaining.
","I probably would not have hunted down this DVD but I usually watch everything my public library gets, and I enjoy both Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. I enjoyed it in the same way I enjoyed 'Abe Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.' The most known version of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale has the stepmother convincing their dad that the kids eat too much and with a great famine at hand their only (selfish) means of survival is to take the kids into the deep forest and abandon them. After the second abandonment the kids were not able to get back home, found the gingerbread and candy house of the blind witch, were captured and fattened so that she could eat them. But she was out-foxed and they were able to throw the witch into the fire and burn her.This movie begins with that same theme, and we see the witch burned. But most of the movie takes place when the kids had grown up and achieved a reputation as witch hunters. In fact they had destroyed hundreds of them. Jeremy Renner is the adult Hansel and Gemma Arterton is his adult sister Gretel.But the region is now threatened by a more powerful witch, Famke Janssen as Muriel. With the upcoming blood moon which will attract many witches Hansel and Gretel have their work cut out for them. Fortunately they find Pihla Viitala as the good witch Mina. And a very large troll, Derek Mears as Edward, who had been in service to Muriel, ends up helping them. This is just a fairy tale and if you are in the right mood can be very entertaining. I was entertained!",Null,0,1,25 February 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well-crafted mystery, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this
","I am generally NOT a fan of re-makes, especially one so close in time to the original (2011 vs 2009). But this is such a rich, interesting story that they pull it off quite well. The story remains set and filmed (mostly) in Sweden, each character uses his or her version of a Swedish accent. But it is a more elaborate production and takes the whole story up a notch. In my comments on the 2009 movie I wrote, 'All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else.' Now I must echo that for Rooney Mara. Who would have thought, from her role in 'The Social Network'? She deserved the Oscar nomination and it would not been wrong if she had won. Daniel Craig is the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is Henrik Vanger, who hires him to re-look at the disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. And Stellan Skarsg√•rd is Martin Vanger. In an interesting casting Robin Wright is Erika Berger .The story follows the same arc but some of the story elements are presented differently, often in more detail. The scenes with Lisbeth and her dastardly guardian are more graphic. In the original Blomkvist has to spend 3 months in jail after his conviction, here it appears he only has to pay a large fine. And there is another key difference I will mention below after 'spoilers.' Overall an excellent movie, and since I saw the 2009 version about 10 months ago, this one was very fresh to me. I hope they make the second and third ones too, but that seems to be in doubt right now. SPOILERS: As in the original Nazi Martin Vanger was the perpetrator of many unsolved killings, and he was responsible for the niece's disappearance, she fled because she was afraid. In the original she was found in Australia. In this version she was found practicing law in London under a different name. After Martin's death in a fiery car crash she was able to reconcile with her family.",Null,2,7,28 March 2012
Dreamgirls," Superb musical, based on the stage musical, MoTown singers in the 1960s and 1970s.
","'Dreamgirls' is almost a pure musical. There is very little spoken dialog, instead characters more commonly break out in song to speak their minds. This surely is a turn-off to some viewers, but I rather like it. The whole production is very well done and high profile actors like Foxx and Murphy are very good 'stage' singers. I was only disappointed that I didn't get to hear Glover sing.The story is clearly inspired by other singers and groups that came out of Detroit, 'motown', in the 1960s and 1970s. The group that became the 'Dreamgirls' has a clear resemblance to 'The Supremes' and the lead singer Deena Jones (Knowles) was made to look and sound much like Diana Ross.Jamie Foxx is Curtis Taylor, Cadillac salesman and budding musical manager. He sees an opportunity to get the girls exposure as backup singers for unpredictable star 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy), and eventually helps get them into solo performances. But Curtis is also untrustworthy, in his love life and in his business dealings.The real treat and surprise of the movie is Jennifer Hudson (American Idol contestant) as Effie White, the best singer among the girls who becomes upset at having to take a supporting role and is replaced. Hudson won an Oscar for supporting actress and she is just a marvel to watch and hear. She gives a stunningly meaningful performance, and when she sings makes everyone else pale in comparison.",Null,0,1,15 May 2007
Being John Malkovich," Totally neat and fun movie, but *not* the 23rd best of all time!
","'Being John Malkovich' is one of those innovative films that come along only rarely. For reasons that become clear in the second half of the movie, there in fact is a 'portal' that allows people to enter and spend exactly 15 minutes in John Malkovich's mind.  What happens when a puppeteer enters and discovers he can learn to actually control Malkovich?  What happens when Malkovich finds out about the portal, and actually enters his own mind?This movie is total fantasy, no real 'message', just fun entertainment. It is well-acted and well-directed. I personally give it '9' of '10' for total enjoyment.  However, if one were really to get down to a ranking of recent movies, there are a whole host of recent movies (e.g. Shakespeare in Love, A Simple Plan, Fargo, Lone Star, The Matrix,American History X, Saving Private Ryan, etc) that, in my opinion, are in total better movies.  Still, see 'Being John Malkovich' if you haven't yet, it is really great fun!I viewed the DVD.  Although very nice, the 'extras' are fairly lame by current DVD 'extra' standards.",Null,1,4,16 May 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A mostly unfunny movie that insults its audience's intelligence.
","Steve Carell is a funny guy. Who could ever forget his anchorman schtick on 'Bruce Almighty'? But here he plays Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old guy in a little boy's psyche, still collecting action figures in their original boxes, 'because they are more valuable that way.' Not owning a car but riding a bicycle. And, by the way, he is still a virgin. This movie tries too hard to be frank and shocking in its language and sexual references, some involving a woman having sex with a horse. Most of it comes off as NOT funny, but just distasteful. His acting style here could easily be swapped for Ben Stiller in any of Stiller's movies. I definitely would not recommend this movie to any of my friends. I put it in the same category as another similar failed attempt, 'Ron Burgundy Anchorman.' So, most of the story involves Andy's friends and co-workers trying to help him get laid. But Andy seems to have a genuine streak that makes him reluctant for casual sex just because. He meets Trish (Catherine Keener) who has a small shop across the street from Andy's work, and she shows an interest in nice guy Andy.SPOILERS. In a totally predictable set of events, Andy and Trish come very close to sex, they agree to postpone it for 20 dates to get to know each other, then she finds out he is a virgin, they argue and split very briefly, he chases her on his bicycle, he crashes, she comforts him, they end up in bed, his virginity smashes, they get married in the end.",Null,13,29,19 December 2005
Face_Off," For action junkies, but too, too much graphic violence.
","Ok, I know it is hard to make this kind of movie without all the shooting and killing.  But director John Woo seems to revel more in the killing than he does in the story.  Still, I must give it 6 of 10, if you can ignore the fact that virtually everything depicted is impossible.I rented the DVD because I heard it had great action and a real kick-ass surround-track.  And it wins on both counts.  Want to test your subwoofer? The explosions will do that. However, this is an example of the type of movie that trivializes killing, and will be responsible for some crazy person acting out and killing a few people in real life.  We would all be better off if this type of movie were never made.",Null,3,6,17 September 1999
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Men who fight not with weapons, but with their minds.
","There apparently was a 'New Age Army' back in the 1983, and they apparently did have a Psychops (psychological operations) branch, but this movie is based on a book, and while the main characters are based on real soldiers, I have to believe it is mostly a work of fiction.Scotsman Ewan McGregor is an American writer, Bob Wilton. He is in Kuwait searching a story when he meets George Clooney as Lyn Cassady. He remembered the name from some interviews he did with a former Psychops member, and they started their modern day (2003) journey.The movie has some interesting, and laugh-out-loud, moments, but overall is disjointed and seemingly random, and comes down to a series of episodes of the strange things these men apparently did. Then when you get to the end (spoilers below) you wonder what the purpose is.It also features Jeff Bridges as Bill Django and Kevin Spacey as Larry Hooper, both former members of the Psychops operation, but now (2003) involved in some non-military operations.SPOILER: Bob Wilton ends up getting his story, and NBC does a spot. But the only thing that appears (the real Ann Curry simulating a news cast) is that certain captives are tortured by forcing them to listen to a certain children's song for 24 hours straight. Back in the office Bob, inspired by being with Cassady all those weeks and hearing what they could do, decided he would run through the wall and into the next office, and he does! Somehow he just passes through it. I have no idea what to make of that ending, it is whimsical for sure, but so what??",Null,0,1,11 May 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mr Lane, meet the IMF team.
","'Mission Impossible' and I have a long history. I am old enough that I used to watch the TV series when it was popular all those years ago. Way back in 1996 Tom Cruise starred in the first of the modern series of IMF movies. That first one I seem to recall wasn't that good. But the second one, in the year 2000 and featuring 'Chimera' was much better. And they continued to get better with each succeeding one in 2006 and 2011.In this installment the IMF seems to have been disbanded, but there is a rogue British agent who has his sights set on havoc around the world and that includes killing leaders of various countries. Tom Cruise is of course back as Ethan Hunt and he has to lead his team to find this man and capture him.One of his team is Jeremy Renner as William Brandt and in a very nice casting choice British actor Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn. There has to be a pretty girl and that part is played by Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Plus another good casting choice is Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell.The rogue is played by British actor Sean Harris as Solomon Lane. The action takes us to places such as London and Seville. We have car chases and motorcycle chases. We have airplanes and fancy weapons. We even have an opera in Vienna. This is a worthy Mission: Impossible movie, at just over 2 hours it is constantly entertaining. I saw it on BluRay at home with a surround system including a powered subwoofer and the picture and sound are very impressive.",Null,0,1,18 December 2015
She's the Man," Amanda Bynes makes this just a fun, entertaining movie.
","I don't know how well she would do a dramatic role, but playing a teenager as she does here and in the older movie 'What A Girl Wants', Amanda Bynes is at the very top of the young actress list. The story was 'inspired by' Shakespeare's 'Twefth Night', but Bynes is what makes a rather inconsequential movie much fun to watch. My wife and I were very entertained.The basic story, Viola (Bynes) and her tomboy soccer friends find out that their high school is cutting its girls soccer team for lack of student response, and the coach of the boys team doesn't want to give them a chance to try out. Meanwhile Vy's twin brother Sebastian, who writes songs and plays music, gets a chance to sneak over to London for two weeks, with each divorced parent thinking he is with the other.Vy hatches a plan, with the help of her friends she will get a short wig, some heavier eyelashes, tape her chest, deepen her voice, and go to her twin brother's new school for him, and make it on the soccer team to help beat her own school that will not let her play. The story can work because Vy could look enough like her twin brother, and no one knew him yet. But not all goes smoothly, as Vy only gets second team, and needs to improve drastically to get to play in the first game. She makes a deal with her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum), who is the star of the soccer team. If he will get her good enough to make first team, she will help get him a date with the classiest girl in school.The fun starts right away as Vy shows up at school, and does her best to 'bond' with her new teammates, while also needing to go undetected as a girl. Lots of funny situations, and Bynes handles them perfectly.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As Vy is about to get her chance at the big game, her brother shows up a bit early, goes to his dorm room, and the next day is hustled out in uniform and face paint. He has no clue what is going on, and besides is a pretty poor soccer player. Puzzled, the coach pulls him out. Vy tells him what happened, she gets the uniform, a student spy exposes her true identity ( she smiles at them as she pulls up her shirt to prove she is a girl, but the camera is discreet). But the coach lets her play anyway, in the last seconds with the score tied 1 to 1, she gets a deflection and kicks it past her former boyfriend to win the game. Then, she also gets her roommate, Duke, and fixes her twin brother up with the pretty girl, who had actually fallen for Vy when she thought she was Sebastian.",Null,1,3,14 September 2006
Spider-Man," DVD review - yep, definitely a fun movie, and a great DVD to own.
","Breaking with usual tradition, the 'Spider-Man' DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.no SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action.  **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now!  It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when 'clicked', jumps you to a brief 'making of' segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to 'extras', like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making 'Spider-Man.'  Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A 'must have' for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like 'avoid this movie'. Be certain those are 'bogus' reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, 'Spider-Man' is a definite 'must-see.'",Null,67,89,1 November 2002
Jarhead," A unique look at training for war.
","It was the Gulf War, the time Iraq invaded Kuwait, and our troops went in and quickly set things right. It was the epitome of a non-war. I remember it well because my daughter was in the Air Force, stationed in England, working in a military hospital, and preparing for all the casualties they inevitably would have to deal with. There were no casualties.Marine recruits are called jarheads. This movie tells a story about a marine recruit who turns out to be the best sniper of his division. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swofford, 'Swoff', who also wrote the basis for this story. So I presume it is fairly fact based. Swoff enters the Marines without knowing what he's in for, and the movie shows the difficulty of basic training, but after he gets his gun, and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), he really is psyched to get some enemy kills.Much of the middle of the movie deals with the deployment of American troops in the desert, for about a half year, fighting hard to not let boredom get the best of them. And dealing with the inevitable letter that their wife or girlfriend had left them. The movie is not about the war, it is about the men who almost fought, and how it affected their lives once they returned to civilian life.SPOILERS. The climax is during the only mission, when Swoff and Troy are sent to take out two officers in a control tower. They get there, Swoff gets the enemy in his sights, when an officer shows up with the news that they will do an air strike instead, to quickly dispose of the men and the tower. But Troy pleads with him, just let them pick off one of them, it won't hurt anything. Just one kill would validate all their training and waiting in the hot desert. But to no avail, the air strike came, the men went home and never fired one shot at the enemy.",Null,1,2,27 March 2006
Shrek Forever After," I was prepared to be bored, but this one is actually pretty good.
","This movie borrows greatly from two other fables, the James Stewart movie 'It's a Wonderful World', where he finds out what the world would be like if he never had been born, and the old Rumplestiltskin fable.Mike Myers is of course back as the voice of Shrek. After some glimpses back at what happened in the earlier Shrek movies, we see him encounter a new, strange little man, Rumplestiltskin, who makes him a deal that seems too good to be true. Shrek had just had a difficult day, with a crowd, a party, his triplets, and his wife, Fiona, and just wished his life could be the way it used to be. Rumplestiltskin would grant this request, give him a whole day of peace, in exchange for just one day of Shrek's life. Contract signed, Shrek gave up the day he was born, which means he had never been born, and the world he knew became much worse for it.A much 'darker' story, but as it unfolds becomes quite interesting.Eddie Murphy is back as the talking Donkey, Cameron Diaz is back as Princess Fiona, and Antonio Banderas is back as Puss in Boots. The marvelous new character is Walt Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin.SPOILERS: When Shrek starts to investigate this new world of his he comes upon a band of Ogres where he is now the small one, and to his surprise their leader is Fiona. But Fiona doesn't know him, and the only way the spell can be broken is if he kisses his 'true love' before daybreak. When he finally convinces Fiona to kiss him, nothing happens, because she has not yet come to love him. Then in a battle with Rumplestiltskin Shrek sacrifices himself for the good of all the other Ogres, Fiona falls in love with him, kisses him at the very last second, restoring the world they once knew, with Rumplestiltskin done for.",Null,1,1,19 January 2011
Collateral," Vincent, The Professional, spends one night in Los Angeles.
","'Collateral' has some parallels to the Besson movie, 'Leon, The Professional.' In each the 'professional' has a job to do, is highly capable, and never hesitates. Here Tom Cruise plays 'Vincent' who is in Los Angeles for one night of work. He needs a way around town, so Max (Jamie Fox) happens to be driving the cab that picks up Vincent. Moderately interesting movie, a different role for Cruise. SPOILERS FOLLOW, the movie cannot be described without doing so. Vincent has been hired to snuff out four witnesses, plus the prosecutor, for a drug related trial about to begin. He simply tells Max that he has four 'clients' to visit, and hires the cab for the evening. At the first stop, second floor, the shot man flies out the window and onto the roof of the waiting cab. When Max finds out what is really going on, he freaks out, doesn't want any part of it, but Vincent won't let him out. Based on police conversation of a similar spree in another city, the cab driver was the last to be killed.In what at first seems to be a soft spot in Vincent, he goes with Max to the hospital to visit Max's sweet, elderly mom, even buying her flowers. However, later that night Vincent warns Max, perform as requested or Vincent would put a bullet between mom's eyes. Prosecutor 'Annie' (Jada Pinkett Smith ) was to be the final victim, someone Max had met earlier that evening when he gave her a ride to a downtown office.

Dunkirk," Dunkirk episodes, not a complete story.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Absolutely no 'extras', which is a disappointment, but the picture and sound are great, the subwoofer had our viewing room rumbling with the battle action.I glanced and some of the 'user' reviews and it seems many are disappointed because this movie isn't what they expected. Instead of a comprehensive treatment of the whole Dunkirk events the movie focuses on a few particular elements. A fighter pilot attempting to protect ships from German bombers. A small band of soldiers trying to escape back to England. A pleasure boat owner as part of a civilian group volunteering to help retrieve stranded soldiers. In that effort Christopher Nolan, who both wrote and directed, succeeds well.The Miracle of Dunkirk is important historically because is was early in the war, 1940, and on the order of 400,000 troops were vulnerable. If they were lost then Britain surely would not have been able to succeed later. The effort saved on the order of 338,000 troops when it was all done.",Null,0,0,30 December 2017
The Machinist," I really liked the style, but the overall story somewhat less.
","I suppose many would consider 'The Machinist' a neo film noir. Although it is filmed in color, the processing gave a very muted color that often looks almost black and white. There is a red car which appears at various times, and it is about the only thing that is bright. The muted colors work very well for this noir story, set on the USA west coast, but filmed in Spain. This is not a story about good people for whom everything works out well in the end. It is a fairly gripping psychological study that for me fell a bit flat in the final act, but well worth watching for the style and Bale.Christian Bale plays a very skinny Trevor Reznik, a blue collar machinist who says he hasn't slept in a year. When not working, he often looks sleepy when still, but never quite dozes off. He has what would usually be called a girlfriend, whom he sees regularly and cares for, but Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a prostitute. He leaves her very nice 'tips'. He also becomes friends with the waitress at the airport coffee shop, Marie, and also leaves her big tips. An accident at work throws everything in turmoil, and as the story progresses we suspect that not all is as it seems.MAJOR SPOILERS. Michael Ironside is a fellow machinist Miller and while distracted Trevor accidentally starts the machine that Miller was working on. Miller loses part of his left arm, gets a big settlement, but everyone at work turns against Trevor. He ends up being fired. He often sees a red car with a mysterious man in it, he purposely walks in front of a car to get hit so he can report a false hit and run, so the police will identify the red car via its license number. It turns out to be his car that he reported stolen a year earlier. The man isn't real, Trevor finally figures out that he had killed a young boy a year earlier in a hit and run, it was the guilt that was keeping him from sleeping, causing his weight loss (flashbacks showed him healthy), and only after he turned himself in was he able to sleep again.

The Intouchables," Very entertaining telling of a story based on real people.
","My wife doesn't watch foreign movies with English subtitles, so I had to go it alone. I know some French so it was easy to just glance at the subtitles to understand the conversations. On DVD from my public library.This is a superb movie based on real people. It is a serious subject, a wealthy quadriplegic otherwise in the prime of his life, victim of a para-sailing accident. But it is done with such style, hopefully reflecting the real person, that it is constantly interesting and entertaining.Established French film star Fran√ßois Cluzet (I call him the French Dustin Hoffman, for his looks and acting style) is Philippe, very wealthy and living in Paris, but only able to move above the neck. He has nurses and other attendants, but as the story opens he is interviewing hard men for the job of personal caretaker, someone able to help him take showers, get dressed, move him to and from his wheelchair, drive him places, things like that. Tall, strong, and very dark, Omar Sy is Driss, a smart and capable young man who has had a hard life growing up and now knocking around as an adult. He is at the interview just for one reason, he has to have proof he is looking for work to collect government assistance. But he doesn't really want the job, he does nothing to endear himself. But just as hospital roommates Edward and Carter hit it off in 2007's 'Bucket List', Philippe and Driss seem to need each other. Driss gets hired, to his own surprise, and the arrangement works out famously.What makes it work as a relationship, and as a movie, Driss never takes pity on Philippe, nor does he let him drift into self-pity. He makes jokes, in good taste, about Philippe's inability to move. In one scene, Driss has a letter for Philippe, and puts in on his chest. After smiling and watching in twitch for a few seconds, Driss says 'OH, you can't move your arms. Let me open it for you.'There is even a scene where, after flying to the Alps by private jet, Philippe and Driss have a session to go paragliding, of course strapped in with experienced men. Then, as the movie ends we get a short glimpse of the real men, still good friends.Good movie!",Null,3,6,27 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Interesting to watch the money-making machine march forward.
","Don't get me wrong, regarding my summary comment, I don't begrudge any of the money made off the Harry Potter books and now movies. Harry Potter was a good idea and few people in the history of literature have been able to create such interesting characters and stories. What I mean is, after the first movie there isn't much new. We see the continuing story of Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts, supported by a cast that includes many of the best British actors. The movies are done in a style that makes it clear they are fantasy, so even when the protagonists are 'in danger', wink-wink, we know that they aren't really in danger. because we know that Harry Potter and his friends will always prevail.SPOILERS follow. In this installment there is a mysterious 'prisoner' who is out exterminate Harry Potter, already having been responsible for the death of Potter's mother and father. Of course this is not true, but is to cover up the real villain, who is one of the professors at Hogwarts. We are introduced to a wonderful animal (I forget the unusual name it was given) which seems to be half horse and half giant bird, which Potter is able to fly on. This comes in handy for an escape later. There is a tree that can move its trunk and branches fast enough to swat people. There is a trinket that enables Harry and Hermoine travel back in time, in a 'Back To The Future' type of manipulation that allows Harry to save the life of the strange creature. All done in a fine fantasy style. I enjoyed it, for what it is. Light fantasy entertainment, with no lasting aftertaste.I especially enjoyed, in the DVD extras, watching the trailers for the three Harry Potter movies. It is fun to see how the three young actors, the real people, have literally grown up during the trilogy (so far) from young children to young teenagers.",Null,1,3,21 January 2005

Everyone thinks Linguini can cook, when it is really Remy.So, most of the movie is to see how Remy will be able to interact with Linguini to create great dishes.

Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher is a pretty bad movie.
","OK, I admit I laughed a few times. But overall this has redeeming values only if you are the type who gets a kick out of dirty, trashcan humor. Otherwise its theme, of a teacher who just happens to be a very bad person, just never gets very interesting.Cameron Diaz is that bad teacher, Elizabeth Halsey. We never really get to see if she could be a good teacher, because she doesn't try to teach. She would rather show the kids a movie in class.As the movie begins, she is engaged and about to get married. But with the help of his mom, the young man tells Elizabeth to get lost, when he realizes she is only a gold-digger, only wanting someone to take care of her. Someone wealthy so she can have all the things that she wants.Justin Timberlake does add some interest, as substitute teacher Scott Delacorte. When Elizabeth finds out he is of a very wealthy family she takes a great interest. But he never gets interested in her. Just a bad teacher who is a bad person and stays that way.

After I watched this new one, I popped in the 2002 movie to compare them back-to-back.While the overall story of a high school boy, interested in photography, and being raised by his aunt and uncle, becoming Spider Man after being bitten by an engineered spider during a class field trip is the same in both movies, most everything else is different. I found myself trying to guess who Mary Jane Watson was going to be, but this one has no Mary Jane Watson. Instead it has Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, whose dad is a policeman. I like Stone, and she did fine here, but I found myself wondering why she was not MJ. Andrew Garfield is the newest Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker. He of course plays it a bit differently and I enjoyed his performance.The core of this story involves a scientist who had known and worked with Peter's dad, Rhys Ifans (the absurd 'Spike' in 'Notting Hill') as Dr. Curt Connors. Somewhere along the line he has lost his right arm below the elbow, and his research seeks to use lizard DNA engineered to regenerate limbs in humans. Not everything goes as he would like and when he injects himself the arm grows, but he also turns into a giant and very vicious lizard with human speech and intelligence. He becomes the villain that Spider-Man must defeat. Their fights destroy lots of stuff!Overall a fine movie, I enjoyed it.",Null,2,5,2 December 2012
The Lego Movie," 'Everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a team.' (song)
","This is a curious movie. I had not heard much about it, but knew it was highly regarded. My wife and I started watching it last night, but shut it off after about 45 minutes. It didn't seem interesting at all.But today I gave it another chance, finished it, and now understand. While it never will be one of my favorite animated movies, it was fun to watch especially during the last 10 to 15 minutes.I tried to find out about how they made it by re-watching it with the DVD's cast commentary, but let me tell you that is one of the most annoying commentaries I've ever witnessed. Fortunately someone asked if most of the movie is computer animated or actual shots of Lego pieces, sort of in a claymation style of animation. As it turns out almost all of it uses computer-generated images, but they did it in a way that it looks like real Lego pieces were used. I would guess that a person who grew up with Legos (not me) would get a bigger kick out of it. There's some funny stuff, like being afraid of the 'Kragle', which we see is 'Krazy Glue' with the letters 'z-y-u' scratched out from use. But it mainly seems to want to give the message that each of us has the ability to accomplish great things, and 'everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a group.'SPOILERS: For most of the movie we see Lego figures and Lego machines in various settings, buildings, streets, etc. Their small world is animated, it is as if they are alive, and I suppose in a sense they are. But then we see it is a giant Lego set built in a basement, and the dad (Will Ferrell) comes down the stairs to see his young son has made some alterations to what Dad had built. At first dad was angry, but then he realized that his son had to exercise his creativity too.",Null,0,0,8 July 2014
Aliens," The second in the 'Alien' series, part of a 30th anniversary BD set.
","The year 1986 was when I moved my family from the New Orleans area to Texas. A career move to a new job and I don't recall ever seeing this move back then.Fast-forward to 2010, a re-release of all the first 4 'Alien' movies in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and I now have watched Alien (1979) and today I watched this one. Picture and DTS sound are excellent as we have come to expect for BluRay.I watched the extended director's cut which is about 2 1/2 hours long and it never seemed too long.In the first movie Sigourney Weaver as Ripley barely escaped the Alien after the rest of her crew were systematically killed. She put herself and the ginger cat into hibernation, not knowing for sure where she would end up.As this movie starts we see her escape pod captured by a larger space vessel and when she awakes finds that she had been asleep for 57 years. During that time her young daughter grew up and died. But then during the debrief sessions no one believed her story, they could not detect any trace of alien tissue and accused her of incompetence.However that same far-away moon had been settled with a terraforming operation and now over 150 people were residing and working there, including some families. When a normal communication from the site is missed a team is assembled and sent to investigate.(Aside, we see them go into the hibernation pods, later to wake up, but are not given any hint of the actual transit time. It must be a very long time, but no more than a few years.)When the team arrives all they find is devastation and a few dead people in pods that the aliens used for their growth. Plus one survivor, a small girl of about 8 years old, dirty and scared and hiding out. She is first-time actress Carrie Henn as Newt. She and Ripley eventually bond and their mutual survival becomes the focus of the story.Paul Reiser is good as Burke, representing the business interests of the operation and ultimately wanting to save his own skin. Lance Henriksen is good as the emotionless robot Bishop. Bill Paxton is a bit 'over the top' as Private Hudson, always either wisecracking or being scared out of his wits.A really good, tense movie, most viewers rate it clearly about the seed movie Alien.SPOILERS: For my recollection, with lots of bullets, fire, and explosives they manage to escape from most of the aliens, but with many casualties. In the end only Ripley and Newt are alive when they come upon the 'queen' alien, the large one laying eggs, Ripley thinks they get away from it but find it in the escape space ship and she has to once again figure out a way to eject it into space, and blowing up the manufacturing site to kill all the remaining aliens. With difficulty she does it and she and Newt go into hibernation pods as the movie ends.",Null,1,1,16 August 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Dramatization of a real person treating himself for AIDS in the 1980s.
","Saw it on DVD. It is set in Dallas during the 1980s but filmed in New Orleans. In fact near the end when Ron is driving and gets out of his truck, it is under the ramps to the New Orleans bridge to the West Bank, and one sign even shows it to be an on-ramp to I-10. The film was nominated for a number of awards and Matthew McConaughey in the lead role of Ron Woodroof won the Oscar for best actor. To prepare for the role of a man with AIDs he lost a reported 30 pounds for the shoot. And watching the film I can see why he won the award. Jared Leto also does a fine turn as Rayon, the homosexual cross-dresser who became a partner in Ron's business to distribute medicines, which became known as the Dallas Buyers Club. The deal was each 'member' paid $400 a month to be in the club and the medicines were free. Leto also won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role.I always like seeing Jennifer Garner and here she is Eve, a doctor that treats Ron when he first is hospitalized, and who later becomes sympathetic to his cause. The credits say the characters are fictional but certainly Woodroof was a real person and this movie tells his story. He really was diagnosed in 1986 and given only a few months to live, but in fact lived an additional 6 years. He attributed that to the medicines that he took, sourced from many places around the world, rather than rely on the 'approved' treatments of the time.",Null,1,1,8 March 2014
Now You See Me," Very interesting movie, because you are always wondering what they are after.
","'Now you see me, now you don't' is a commentary on performers who do magic tricks. Of course we all know there isn't really 'magic', the magician performs some sort of diversion so that you don't see what is really going on. Now you see me, oops, now you don't.The four magicians here perform as a team, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco (brother of James). As the opening scenes play out we get a glimpse of each one of them before they began working as a team. So they hold shows in various cities, always performing fantastic illusions. Sometimes vast amounts of money disappear. Like from a bank in Paris. They appear to teleport someone from the audience, but they don't really.Morgan Freeman has an interesting role, he attends and videos their performances, with a goal of writing about them and explaining how each illusion is accomplished.Mark Ruffalo has an equally interesting role, he is the detective trying to catch them in the act and pin certain crimes on them. It is an entertaining story, and the actors pull it off well. You find yourself wondering, 'What's next? And how are they going to do it?'Big SPOILERS: As the story lines wrap up we find that we, the audience, were involved in a big deception. While it looked like the Ruffalo character was just an incompetent detective, he was actually the master magician, son of a legendary master escape artist. The four of them were working to impress him with their skills to be invited into the exclusive magician's fraternity.",Null,0,2,10 October 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The XMen go 'back to the future'.
","For one who likes an exciting and entertaining movie this one does exactly that.It starts in the future, but only about 50 years past 1973. So that would make it about 2023. The XMen mutants are desperately fighting androids and are losing badly. The only solution it seems is to return to 1973 and change the sequence of events that led to the development of the androids.Since they can't really time-travel, the body of Wolverine actually stays in the future but his mind is projected back to 1973, where his body looks pretty much the same. Once there he has to look up the much younger Xavier and Erik, and then convince them that he is indeed from the future and to gain their assistance in changing events. It isn't easy, otherwise it would be a very short movie.This is the version where Jennifer Lawrence is cast as Mystique and she is very good in the role. The movie also has a very nice, aggressive soundtrack with deep, picture-rattling bass.",Null,0,3,3 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," A disappointment, compared to the previous Capt America movies.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. This one again stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America. But it also includes a whole potful of other stars, too many to mention in my brief comments here.On the plus side the special effects and sound track, with plenty of surround and deep bass, are first-rate. On the negative side, I have a basic dislike for this type of story that has most of the superheros fighting each other. It was the same for me in the recent 'Batman v Superman' movie. I suppose the movie makers are always scrambling for new ways to make the stories interesting but this just doesn't work for me.The other gripe is the heavy emphasis on massive destruction during the fights. I realize many fans crave this and like to see all the destruction but for me it takes away greatly from my enjoyment.So what we have here is basically the whole world getting upset that the band of superheros jump into frays without any guidance, they do their own things, and often there is severe collateral damage, even the deaths of innocent people. Since they have super powers it is difficult to require them to comply, and during most of the middle of the movie the various supers battle each other. It isn't pretty.Overall a fail, in my opinion.",Null,2,9,1 October 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Mostly entertaining, compared to the Harry Potter stories I'd have to call this a 'miss'.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is set in the 1920s, when Eddie Redmayne as Newt is on his way to Arizona to free a giant flying beast back to its original home. We don't learn why he was with Newt. But he stops in New York and mixing up his suitcase with that of a baker trying to get a bank loan to start his own business creates all kinds of chaos. Newt's suitcase is the kind only a magician would have. He sets it on the floor, opens it, and climbs inside to reveal he is in another world, one filled with all kinds of 'fantastic beasts.' The visuals are excellent as well as the acting. But the story often is very confusing. Something is causing a large amount of devastation of various buildings, but what it is and why is it going off?I really enjoyed the various Harry Potter movies, their stories were more clearly presented, but this movie, while mostly entertaining, is not that special.",Null,0,0,6 May 2017
Gandhi," Surely the British are not that stupid.
","A wonderful and important movie, I never saw it back in the 1980s nor any time since, probably because I knew it is over 3 hours long. But, confined to my TV room recuperating from foot surgery, I watched it today. I found it on Netflix streaming movies.The movie received a whole host of awards, including Oscars for best picture and best actor, Ben Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi. In fact he so looked the role that many people in India during filming thought he was the ghost of Gandhi.The movie is very long, and it moves very deliberately especially during most of the last hour, but all of it is interesting. It starts in India in 1948, with his point-blank assassination in 1948. Then it switches to 1893 South Africa where Gandhi, a lawyer fresh from his London education, first got exposed to blatant discrimination, just for the color of his skin. He did his first work there for non- violent resistance to effect needed change in unjust laws.The rest of the movie spans about 1913 through 1948 in India, much of it covering his working through non-violent resistance to eventually gain self-rule for India. At one point when asked by a British official 'Do you expect us to just walk out?' The answer was in the numbers, 100 Thousand British and 300 Million Indians.The movie is as much an indictment of British stupidity as it is Gandhi's work for rights. Good movie.",Null,0,1,24 December 2014
American History X," All too real, addresses hate across ethnic groups.
","Edward Norton is skinhead Derek Vinyard, with a very large Swatsticka tattoo on his left pecs. Somehow he has become very jaded, unhappy, and against any ethnic group but his own. Part of it resulted from his firefighter dad's death at the hands of a black man, while dad was fighting a fire. Now Derek worships everything Hitler stood for, white supremacy. Not just against blacks, but also against Jews, Hispanics, and Asians.One night late, while Derek and his girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk) are consummating their affair one more time, Edward Furlong as younger brother Danny Vinyard alerts Derek that some black dudes are breaking into his vehicle. He goes out and chases them away, killing two of them. He has only underwear and a big grin on his face as the cops arrive to arrest him.While Derek is serving his prison time, younger brother Danny is beginning to follow in his footsteps. Stacy Keach as Cameron Alexander is the older man who fills all of them with propaganda.While in prison Derek learns and mainly by association with a black inmate in the laundry job begins to question many of his supremacy beliefs. As he gets out, he has resolved that all of his former beliefs are bullspit, and resolves to make sure that he protects his family, and guide Danny away from Cameron.Avery Brooks is teacher Dr. Bob Sweeney, a black man who helps to set a good example. But we see in a family flashback that dad had much earlier instilled the prejudice that Derek and Danny now fought to overcome.Hard to watch movie, but very good.SPOILERS: Derek returned to announce to Cameron and everyone else that he wanted no part of his former association with them. But shortly in an incident at school, his brother was shot, assassination style, in the boy's bathroom.",Null,1,7,6 April 2008
Ocean's Eleven," A fun movie to watch, but overall is somewhat overrated.
","some SPOILERS - Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is just getting out 4 years in prison, and his wife (Julia Roberts) has divorced him and gone with the richest hotel and gambling magnate (Andy Garcia) in Las Vegas. Danny wants revenge, to get his wife back and steal all the money, estimated at over $150Million on the night of the big fight. Of course vault security is about the best anywhere, so he has to enlist the help of 10 others to pull all this off. Thus the name of the film, 'Ocean's 11.'  With only two weeks of preparation.  Nothing in this film is credible, so we just relax and watch the stars (Pitt, Damon, Roberts, Cheadle, and others) do their things. Of course, they succeed, and the film ends with Pitt getting Clooney after his '3 to 6 months' for parole violation, with his wife back, and two of Garcia's men following him.The tricks they pull to case the joint, to prepare for the heist, the actual pulling off -- nothing is new but still interesting.  Of note is that all the characters are 'bad', even Roberts' who knowingly associates with criminals. Garcia's character is known to have men whacked if they cross him. So that's supposed to make us not feel so guilty about enjoying a heist pulled off successfully.In summary, good light entertainment, lots of stuff to make you smile, but no lasting impression. Realistic rating on IMDb is probably in the 5 to 7 range. The DVD is good, and the deep 'rumble' when the giant safe doors open and close make it sound realistic. There are a couple of extras, but nothing to write home about.",Null,1,2,18 June 2002
Pearl Harbor," Good film. This review which follows is perhaps the most balanced anyone will find.
","some SPOILERS will follow...I purposely waited until 'Pearl Harbor' was on DVD so that I could see it not only in the comfort of my own home theater, but also take advantage of all the interesting extras sure to accompany the DVD. I am not disappointed. What follows are (1) a review of the film itself, (2) a commentary on the misleading negative reviews, (3) a short discussion of the statistics of IMDb votes, and (4) a comment on the DVD itself.REVIEWING THE FILM - The film itself is rather long, about 3 hours, on 2 DVDs. As we see from the 'extras', great care was taken to incorporate realistic stories composited from several real Pearl Harbor heros, and to accurately recreate the horror of the surprise attack at 7:55AM on Sunday, December 7, 1941 by the Japanese. It is a highly pro-USA account, but considering that this is a 'movie', and the target audience was primarily American, that makes sense.The story starts in 1923, in Tennessee, where boyhood friends Rafe and Danny pretend to fly and shoot down Germans. Cut to 1941, Long Island, where both of them are fighter pilots.  Rafe falls for pretty nurse, Evelyn, then is asked to go to England to help fight the Germans. Very successful there, he is eventually hit, ditches, is recovered by French, but presumed dead. Distraught and now both assigned to Pearl Harbor, Danny and Evelyn become friendly, real friendly, she becomes pregnant.  Rafe is alive, he shows up, there is an emotional struggle among the three to do the right things.
Then the attack comes, all three are heroic, Evelyn in triage, Rafe and Danny shooting down 7 enemy planes. As the war progresses, Jimmy Doolittle conceives of a plan to launch bombers from a carrier, and Rafe and Danny volunteer to participate. The success of this mission is pivotal in the Japanese feeling vulnerable while the USA feels they can win the war. Rafe survives but Danny doesn't. In the end, Rafe and Evelyn and young son 'Danny' are seen building their lives, all forever changed by the events of WW II.Is the movie perfect? Far from it. Are there some cheesy lines? Sure there are, mostly because it seeks some 'entertainment' value. However, the film overall is a fine achievement, showing through a fictional love story how some of the people likely were affected during that historic period. Plus, it contains 30+ minutes of truly magnificent re-enactment of that short but critical attack on Pearl Harbor. It cannot help reminding us how horrible war is.My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, everyone should see it and understand it for what it represents, without being overly critical of what some may consider its weaknesses. We thought Ben Affleck was very effective as Rafe and Kate Beckinsale as Evelyn. The best acting accomplishment, however, was Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The IMDb ratings for 'Pearl Harbor' cluster near '7' and that, or '8', is an appropriate rating, compared to all other modern feature films.MISLEADING NEGATIVE REVIEWS - 'Pearl Harbor' is a victim of 'the bandwagon effect', where people read the opinions of others then adjust their own opinions to reflect the majority. At release, many well-known critics (see Ebert, for example) said some very negative things about this film. General audiences then went to see the film, and, jumping on the bandwagon, formed negative opinions also. Reading many 'user reviews' reveals that the majority of the unbiased reviews are quite good, which is appropriate. To learn more about this do an internet search on 'bandwagon effect' and read several of those summaries.STATISTICS - The 13% of '1' IMDb votes for 'Pearl Harbor' and the 15% of the '10' votes are equally out of place.  Remove those two extremes and the votes cluster strongly around a rating of '7' and are fairly normally distributed.  Compare that, for example, to a less-emotional recent film, 'The Yards', which clusters much like 'Pearl Harbor' but without the unusual '1' and '10' votes. 'Pearl Harbor's' current rating is 5.8 while 'The Yards' is 6.7, with almost identical median votes.  All of which supports the contention that this film deserves a rating of about '7' overall.THE DVD - As DVDs go, this one deserves a '10'.  It has either Dobly 5.1 or DTS 5.1 sound selectable. As I have found in all other DVDs where both are available, the Dolby sound track is much more aggressive in the low bass region. Example, at my normal volume setting for movies (-20dB), and at my listening position, the first big explosion at 90 minutes into the film recorded 102dB in Dolby but only 93 dB in DTS.  Since the dB scale is logarithmic, that represents EIGHT TIMES as much sound on the Dolby track. That is not a subtle difference! The DTS track overall is more realistic, however with a great subwoofer the Dolby track is certainly more exciting.
Disk #2 has the last 1/3 of the film, plus two very nice extras. The first is a 47-minute 'making of' which in many ways is more fascinating than the film itself. Just money would not have made this film. The men and women behind the location scouting, first-hand accounts, filming, special effects did almost unimaginable work to get this film made.The second nice extra is a 45-minute History Channel special on the 'Unsung Heros' of Pearl Harbor. Watching it convinces us of the accuracy and validity of the story told in this film. As I have said in other reviews, anyone still watching movies in the theater or at home on VHS are missing at least half, sometimes more, of the enjoyment of recent-release movies. DVD has come of age and it is the only way to go.",Null,4,11,1 March 2002
Jackie," Portman gets it right, portraying Jackie Kennedy.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.Maybe it was different in the theater, but on the DVD the sound mix is annoying, the musical score is often ponderous and way too loud, detracting quite seriously from enjoyment of the movie.Regarding the actual story, I remember Jackie Kennedy quite well, I was a freshman in college when JFK was murdered, and I remember the later years when Jackie married Aristotle Onassis, everyone assumed because he was wealthy. So watching any movie of Jackie, for me, is a pale imitation of having lived through it.Still, Natalie Portman is credible as Jackie Kennedy, who was only 31 when she became First Lady, and only 34 when the events of 1963 occurred, pretty close to the actual age of Portman. I don't recall it seeming so young back then but today it seems very young.When you listen closely to Jackie Kennedy you hear a slight speech impediment, a trait her daughter Caroline inherited. Portman clearly spent lots of time studying and practicing because she pretty much gets it right. This movie focuses almost entirely on the events right before, during, and right after JFK's murder in the streets of Dallas, showing how Jackie reacted to what was going on, what demands she made, how she (and others) compared their almost 3 years as President and First Lady to 'Camelot.' The storytelling technique is to use a fictional journalist, played by Billy Crudup, doing an in depth interview of Jackie in her residence after leaving the White House. For those who have grown up in more modern times this is a good movie to give a glimpse of this complex and often mysterious former First Lady.",Null,0,0,30 May 2017
No Strings Attached," Profane in its concept, even the 'cute' actors don't make this a worthwhile film.
","There was a time not long ago when dialog in movies pointed you to what might be happening, and the rest was formed in your own mind. You could make it as clean or as profane as you wanted. Not anymore, even the cute blond 20-something script writer for this movie spells everything out, with very base descriptions of body parts and body functions. It may work for teenagers but it doesn't work for thoughtful adults. It makes the whole movie come across as profane and dirty just for the sake of 'dirty.'Then there is the overall concept, that it is just fine and normal for two long-time friends, now adults, to just hook up for casual sex any time either of them is horny, because that serves the same function as a good bowel movement when you are bloated. I am disappointed that fine actors chose to play these roles. The critic Ebert has an excellent review.The girl is Natalie Portman as Emma and the guy is Ashton Kutcher as Adam. The best role however is Kevin Kline as Adam's dad, Alvin, who ends up hooking up with Adam's most recent ex-girlfriend. I may be one of the few who recognized Cary Elwes in the low-key role of Dr. Metzner. Although he is nearing 50, with his youthful features and a light beard his character could pass for 35.Not a very good movie at all, but those who enjoy profane comedic situations will likely enjoy this. SPOILERS: Naturally Emma and Adam cannot go on forever with a no-commitment, casual sex arrangement. She is afraid to commit to anyone, but he loves her. When he expresses his love and she retreats, he calls it quits. But eventually she misses him too much and they end up together, happily ever after.",Null,1,2,10 June 2011
Tropic Thunder," A silly Ben Stiller movie with lots of vulgarity, but funny if you are in the right mood.
","Let me admit up-front that I am tired of movies which feature non-stop vulgarity and dirty sexual references, and this movie has all that. In my opinion that keeps it from being a superb movie. But if you can ignore that, there are some very entertaining parts.Ben Stiller is the writer, director, and star, but the best performances are by two other actors.Robert Downey Jr. is award-winning Australian actor Kirk Lazarus. For his role in this movie, Tropic Thunder, which relives the daring rescue of soldiers in the 1960s Viet Nam, he underwent a controversial skin coloration procedure which made him look like a black man. So within this movie Downey plays several roles in fake trailers which introduce the character at the beginning of the movie, then he plays a black soldier, and then he plays a blue-eyed, blond Australian. He does all of it well, showing why he is one of the best actors today.In a definite supporting role Tom Cruise is bald, slightly portly, and irreverent producer Les Grossman. Back in the states, while the movie crew encounter cost overruns in Viet Nam (actually filmed in Hawaii), Les is on the video phone reading them the riot act. At one point, angry at the director for having the cameras off during a very expensive jet bombing run, he tells one assistant to go over and punch the director in the face. He does! Matthew McConaughey is also good in his supporting role as Rick Peck, one of the agents. When his man, who he also considers his best friend, gets captured by real Viet Cong and imprisoned, he has to weigh the cost of rescuing him against the promise of a new airplane that Grossman made him.Ben Stiller is Tugg Speedman, who has had some flops recently and needs to get back in the public favor with a hit. He is depending on this movie.Jack Black is Jeff Portnoy, sort of a white parody of Eddie Murphy who makes the fat family movies and plays all the parts. Portnoy makes fat family movies where everyone passes gas.Nick Nolte has a good role as Four Leaf Tayback, who wrote the book that Tropic Thunder is based on. Only later the actors and crew find out that Tayback never served in Viet Nam and his whole story was a fabrication.So the whole movie is about their trying to make the movie after the director is blown up after stepping on an old French land mine. While they think they encounter Viet actors with guns shooting blanks, they actually encounter Viet enemy running a large scale drug business, shooting real bullets, and trying to kill or capture them.",Null,1,3,18 February 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Well, it is different, but I am not the target audience for this movie.
","It was showing on Netflix streaming, and I had nothing else to do in this record hot Texas summer, so I watched it. I have to give credit, it is a very interesting concept and much of the dialog is snappy and interesting. But overall it is not the kind of movie I enjoy.Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, musician wanna-bee, and mostly a social misfit. Shy and with low confidence, he has a girlfriend, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau, that is 5 years younger, and underage. When he discusses this with his friends Scott is quick to point out that they haven't even kissed, and he is sometimes tempted to hold her hand. But the real action starts when Scott gets his eye on pretty Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, and Ramona seems to like Scott also. But Scott soon finds out that he has to fight and defeat Ramona's 7 evil former lovers if she is to be his.The first couple of fights are interesting but it soon became more of the same. I found myself just waiting for them to be over so I could see where the new romance might go.Not really my kind of movie. And I am not a big Michael Cera fan.",Null,8,14,6 September 2011
Enchanted," Very entertaining fantasy romantic comedy.
","This movie starts with traditional, old-fashioned Disney animation, and continues this way for about 10 minutes. Julie Andrews is the Narrator. It is about a fictional kingdom where mean Queen Narissa wants to keep her stepson, Prince Edward, from the throne. She especially wants to keep him from falling in love. When it appears that he has found his true love, Giselle, she is lured and thrown into a magical well, and she emerges from a sewer in the middle of a busy Manhattan street.Amy Adams is perfect as naive Giselle, lost in this bewildering land. She catches the attention of a New York divorce lawyer, Patrick Dempsey as Robert Philip, who was in a cab with his young daughter Rachel Covey as Morgan Philip. They come to her aid and a friendship begins.Meanwhile, Prince Edward finds out what happened and he jumps into the well to find his true love and bring her back. James Marsden is good as the not-too-bright Prince Edward. They are eventually joined by Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, and much later Susan Sarandon as the mean Queen Narissa.What else can I say, it is a fantasy, an animated Disney movie come to life with real actors. Amy Adams does her own singing and reveals a nice, stage musical type of voice. There is nothing much new here that hasn't been done before, but the actors create a nice entertaining movie.SPOILERS: As all the characters encounter each other in New York, Giselle finds that she doesn't really love Prince Edward, instead is falling for nice guy Robert and his small daughter. They end up staying together in New York. Meanwhile Prince Edward is falling for Robert's girlfriend, and they go back through the magic well and get married as cartoon characters back in the fantasy land after the mean Queen Narissa is disposed of in New York.",Null,2,4,28 March 2008
The Usual Suspects," Intriguing script, it pays to watch it more than once.
","It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple 'Verbal Kint'.What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five 'usual suspects', perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan.So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is 'How much of this was really true?' That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he?The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs.An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU.MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably 'gold' watch and 'gold' lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S√∂ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S√∂ze continues.",Null,0,0,10 September 2013
Inside Out," Nicely animated, we learn about the 'head office' behind each of our emotions.
","Very nice animation, it tells the story of a young girl who has grown up in Minnesota but is uprooted when her dad and mom have to move to San Francisco with his job. Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.But the animated movie isn't so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of 'head office.' It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley's Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley's Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.I like it for the novelty, it makes one think.",Null,3,22,11 December 2015
The Duchess," Family and politics in early 19th century England.
","After I saw this movie I did a bit of research to find that the characters are real historical figures and the story told is apparently very accurate.Keira Knightley stars as Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire. She gained that title when at 17 she married the Duke of Devonshire. At first I thought maybe Knightley was not the best choice for the role, as she is very attractive, but the original Georgiana apparently was a beauty in her own right. In light of all that it may be harder to understand why her husband was so indifferent to her. Veteran Ralph Fiennes is amazingly good as her husband, Duke of Devonshire. It become clear from the beginning that he only wants two things from her, loyalty and a son as an heir. He seems to have no interest in her, no passion for her, except for what she might provide for him. When she has several miscarriages and then 2 daughters he becomes very impatient.Charlotte Rampling is good as Georgiana's mother Lady Spencer. And, if that name sounds familiar, that is the same Spencer family that are ancestors of Lady Diana Spencer who became Princess of Wales when she married Prince Charles, and who died in the unfortunate accident in France in 1997.A key character is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who went into politics at a young age and eventually became Prime Minister in 1830. His role here is important in that he and Georgiana had an affair and a love child after her own marriage crumbled when her husband took up with her good friend Bess Foster. All in all a very good period piece, and a real slice of English history. It is interesting to see the family and political dynamics and how powerful the wealthy were. Probably still are.",Null,1,2,1 January 2009
Die Hard 2," Somewhat better than the first 'Die Hard' movie.
","I know that many rave about the first Die Hard movie, but for me this second one was much better, with a better story. I just found myself wishing it had been a bit shorter, it made me tired just seeing everything McClane had to endure.Bruce Willis is L.A. cop John McClane, in Washington, D.C. waiting for his wife's plane. But he notices something fishy about a couple of men, follows them to a secure baggage handling area, and ends up in a big gunfight. This leads him to believe there is something more sinister in the plans, but has trouble getting the local police to believe him. Bonnie Bedelia is back as his wife, Holly McClane.The main bad guy is William Sadler as Col. Stuart, and the whole plot is to gain control of a drug lord, Franco Nero as Gen. Ramon Esperanza, being flown in under arrest. Their plan involved putting incoming commercial jets in jeopardy, as a way to get Esperanza rescued and flown to Central America in a waiting 747.Dennis Franz, who later became a fixture on NYPD Blue is good as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo, the local cop who tries to get McClane thrown out. A bit ironically, Fred Dalton Thompson who today is a Republican candidate for the upcoming presidential nomination was Trudeau, in charge of air control at the airport.Overall a good, complex story with lots of action. And, of course, McClane always comes out on top.SPOILERS. At the end the bad guys have the drug lord and the 747, but McClane gets a local news helicopter to drop him onto the plane's wing as it taxis for takeoff. A door opens and he fights one bad guy, who ends up getting sucked into the jet's engine. The second bad guy manages to knock McClane off the wing, but not before McClane had opened the fuel dump valve to spew jet fuel. As the plane accelerates away, McClane smiles and throws a cigarette lighter onto the trail of fuel, which catches up to the plane's wing just as it rotates for takeoff. The plane goes up in a big ball of fire, all on board are roasted. McClane wins again!! Good stuff.",Null,0,4,6 January 2008
Yesterday," Inventive story and a very entertaining evening of Beatles music.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. We enjoyed it very much, it is one of the better movies we have seen in recent months.Set and filmed in England, British actor Himesh Patel as Jack Malik is a teacher but an aspiring songwriter. The problem is his songs aren't very good. He has a long-time friend, also a teacher, Lily James as Ellie Appleton, who actually serves as his manager although he doesn't get much work as an entertainer.Then something very unusual happens, the result is that Jack seems to be the only one who knows who the Beatles are. When he starts to play and sing 'Yesterday' for his friends they love his song. Same with all the other Beatles songs that he can remember. His career takes off.It was nice to hear all the Beatles music but the thrust of the story is mostly his coming to terms with his guilt in having everyone think he is a great songwriter. Also coming to realize that maybe he and Ellie have much more than just a 'friendship.'Even Ed Sheeran has a role, not just a one-scene cameo. Good movie and the acting is very appropriate.",Null,0,0,5 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A continuation of 'Infinity War', Thanos has to be dealt with and it takes all Avengers.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched 'Infinity War' where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can't watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video 'noise' to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.I don't see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?",Null,1,8,26 August 2019
Quantum of Solace," Not much of a Bond movie, just lots of action and gunfire.
","I hate to say it, but the critic Ebert got it exactly right. This is not a very good '007' movie. Daniel Craig as James Bond is a good action hero, but 007 is not an action hero, he is the master of 'cool'. Ebert's review is a sort of call to restore the 007 themes to what we have come to expect, and I have to agree with him.Olga Kurylenko is the 'Bond Girl' as Camille. (She reminded me very much of Catherine Zeta Jones in 'Mask of Zorro', both in looks and in voice.) She is appropriately pretty and exotic, but there wasn't any real chemistry with 007.The evil one is Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene who is leading an illicit effort to corner the water supply in Bolivia, but when the movie was over neither my wife or I could explain what the story line was. There is lots of action, but it is hard to figure out why everyone is after everyone else.Unusual 007 movie.",Null,2,10,8 April 2009
Gone with the Wind," 'I'll figure a way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day.'
","It is a bit remarkable that I, a long-time fan of the movies, only now got around to watching GWTW, even though it was released just 6 years before I was born. I was able to get the DVD of the restored film from my public library. A film this old and this famous, a film that has been analyzed so much over the decades, there really isn't anything I can contribute to its description or analysis. My only intent here is to capture a few of my own reactions to the story and to the characters.Certainly the central character is Scarlett O'Hara played well by Vivien Leigh, as a spoiled and impetuous young lady (she must have been 24 or 25 during filming) in deep southern Georgia. She and her family are hit hard by the War Between The States, not only changing their lives but resulting in their beloved plantation 'Tara' being left in ruins.Scarlett had a very hard time loving, or even really caring, for anyone. She wanted the things she wanted and found ways to get what she wanted, most often by manipulation. When she met Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a wealthy man from Charleston, she saw him as a ticket back to wealth. But in a manner befitting both of their strong wills, there was a deep affection between them that they just were unable to express in a productive and loving manner.Even though Gable was obviously a big movie star, I have not seen much of him before seeing GWTW. Even if we ignore his uncredited roles, he had about 40 movie roles before this one, and almost 30 more after that. So seeing him here is really the only role I can relate to, and I found him just perfect. GWTW is a melodrama, the war is just interwoven to make Scarlett's and Rhett's stories more interesting. Some fans will certainly muse, that had the story not ended where it did, Scarlett would have made good on her final lines, to restore Tara and get Rhett back: 'I'll figure out how to get him back, After all, tomorrow is another day.' Perhaps as a reflection of their roles in this movie, neither Gable nor Leigh reached 60. He was 59 when he died of a heart attack, and she, reportedly a very heavy smoker, died of tuberculosis when she was only 53.",Null,1,2,1 October 2013
The Butterfly Effect," One of the more interesting movies I have seen lately.
","I have always loved 'science fiction' movies, because I have no trouble suspending my disbelief and just going along with the premise, and see what turns out. To be able to imagine 'what if' that really could happen? I really enjoyed 'Butterfly Effect.' As they say in the trailer, 'If you change one thing, you change everything.' Evan (several actors at different ages) is not your usual kid, he has periodic 'blackouts' and the doctors have no explanation. So at 7 he is asked to begin daily journal writing, and these journal entries become springboards for most of the drama for the second half of the movie. By our current scientific knowledge, what happens in the movie is clearly NOT possible, but it makes for a very thrilling two-hour ride.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The movie begins in present time, grown Evan (Ashton Kutcher) is in a blue institutional coat, barricades himself in a room, and he mutters something as he writes a note, 'If you find this note that means my plan didn't work out ... I need to go back and do something to save her.' The 'her' was Kayleigh (Amy Smart, grown up), the girl he grew up with and is the only one he ever loved. In one of his 'going back' episodes, trying to prevent the death of someone else, the dynamite he was trying to dispose of accidentally killed Kayleigh. But I am getting a bit ahead of myself...When the kids were 13, smoking cigarettes and looking at 'Hustler', Kayleigh's mean brother Tommy suggests they blow something up. A stick of dynamite stored for years in his dad's thermos, the fuse is too short so Evan has them use his short cigarette as a fuse extension. Slow to blow up, a young woman and baby come home, go to get the mail, and they die in the explosion. This messes everyone up, I suppose if Evan had not suggested the fuse mod, everything would have turned out different. When Evan and his mom move away in a moving van, he holds a note to the window for Kayleigh, 'I'll come back for you.' But he doesn't.Cut back to the present time, Evan is in college, excelling in Psychology, interested in 'memory association.' He celebrates seven years with no blackouts. But he and mom go to a Psychic as a joke, she looks at Evan's hand and horrified says, 'You have no time-line. You were never meant to be.' Which was prophetic. But he goes back to find Kayleigh, who was a waitress, she is angry the way her life turned out, 'Why did you leave me here to rot?' Back at college he receives a phone message from Tommy, 'She killed herself tonight. She's dead ... and so are you.' Evan by now had figured out that through mind control he could read a particular journal entry and go back to that point in his life and, perhaps, change things. He goes back to age 7 when Kayleigh's dad was trying to make a porno video in the basement with Evan and Kayleigh, and in his adult voice but as a 7 year old, told their dad to never touch Kayleigh again. When he awoke, everything was different. He was a frat boy, Kayleigh was in his bed with him. But Tommy had grown up a criminal because dad's perversion had become directed at him instead of at Kayleigh. Tommy showed up on campus, there was a fight, Evan beat and killed him in self defense, but was imprisoned awaiting trial.Finally deciding to make everything right, he went back to prevent the explosion in the mailbox incident, they save the mother and child, but Evan gets both lower arms blown off, Kayleigh grows up as the girlfriend of another. Still another attempt, to destroy the dynamite years earlier, results in Kayleigh's death at 7. Setting up the final scene where in a final desperate act of love for Kayleigh, Evan views a home movie taken in the hospital when he was about to be born. He goes back to that point, as a baby about to be born, and strangles himself in his mother's womb, as a way to save Kayleigh.I understand from reading elsewhere that this director's cut on the DVD ends differently from the one shown in theaters. The whole movie illustrates the point that 'if you change one thing, you change everything.' Near the end of the movie, grown Kayleigh tells Evan that she lived with her dad because she wanted to stay near Evan. So, if Evan had never been born, her life would have turned out different. In the brief glimpses we see at the end, indeed all of Evan's friends turned out to have better lives.",Null,2,8,10 February 2005
Legends of the Fall," Epic story of Tristan, destined to either become crazy, or become a legend.
","I had seen this movie years ago, shortly after its release, and didn't remember much of it, especially how good a movie it is. Thanks to one of the sweetest college freshmen in the whole world, who gave me the DVD as a gift, I was able to appreciate it again today.The movie begins with a narration in what is probably close to present time, at least later than 1963, that explains the key theme -- some hear their inner voice very clearly and choose to follow it instead of the rules of the world, and as a result they become crazy, or become a legend.Brad Pitt is the feature actor as Tristan Ludlow, who clearly hears his own inner voice and follows it. For a period of time during the middle one-third of the movie it appears 'crazy' will be his fate. However in the end we see that he indeed did become a 'legend.' The story begins in 1913, and the mountainous Montana homestead has Anthony Hopkins, retired Army Col. William Ludlow, as the patriarch of the family which includes three quite different young men. The middle one was Tristan, blonde and with a fire inside him that made him follow a different path. He was not afraid of anything, and he was not afraid of dying. As a teenager he had a close encounter with a Grizzly, wounded on his arm, but quick with a knife cut off one of the bear's toes. It is said that after such an encounter the man and the animal remain part of each other.The oldest son was Aidan Quinn as Alfred Ludlow, intelligent but dull, a straight-arrow sort who believed in and followed the rules, at least until he found out how the world and politics really work. The youngest son was Henry Thomas (of 'E.T' fame) as Samuel Ludlow, idealistic but timid, and his older brothers always tried to protect him.One day Samual brings home his fianc√©', Julia Ormond as Susannah Fincannon, a young lady who had no family of her own. He considers himself very fortunate to have her, and his two brothers are obviously taken with her also.The big event that begins to cause tension in the family is the war in Europe that we now know became World War I. In 1914 the three young men travel to Canada to join up, in spite of the protests of their dad, soured against the all governments and their wars. He wanted them to stay within the safety of their isolation in Montana. They end up in France, fighting the Germans.The movie has an epic feel to it because of the 50 years it spans. It is primarily Tristan's story, to see whether he will be crazy or be legend. In that process it touches all in his immediate and his extended family. All the performances are good, but Pitt and Hopkins especially show why they are two of the best. The musical score and the scenery are beautiful.SPOILERS FOLLOW: During the fighting in France, Tristan takes it upon himself to protect Samuel, who goes to the front line anyway, unprepared for what was to occur. Tristan went to save him, but instead saw him gunned down. After he dispatched with the two Germans who killed Samuel, and saw he couldn't save his brother so he cut out Samuel's heart, in the old Native American tradition he learned. The heart was sent home for a proper burial on their land.The two older brothers became estranged, Alfred blaming Tristan for their brother's death, even accusing him of wanting Samuel dead so that Tristan could have Susannah for himself. Tristan went away for several years, traveling the world, experiencing all he could, always on the verge of insanity. Susannah had told him she would wait for him for as long as it took, but after one letter from Tristan proclaiming himself 'dead' and not to wait any longer, married his brother Alfred. So Tristan came home to a dad partially paralyzed from a stroke, and his fianc√©' married to his brother.Many additional things happen, Alfred getting into politics, Tristan bootlegging whisky during Prohibition, other people close to him die, but Tristan always seems to pull through. Then finally, in 1963, he dies in an encounter with a Grizzly, somewhere in the north. As the narration tells us, it was 'A good way to die.'",Null,0,1,3 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Typical Coen film in that nothing is typical. Compelling character study.
","I figure that I really like about two-thirds of the Coen Brothers movies. 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' are a couple of my favorites. They seem to do best in movies where good and evil, serious and funny, are juxtaposed. This one is very interesting, but has a sort of open-ended finish that may upset some viewers.The movie starts with a narration by Tommy Lee Jones who plays small county sheriff Ed Tom Bell, not too far away from retirement. As in 'The Valley of Elah', he is superb here. His part of this story begins when they find a bunch of bodies out in the scrub land, apparently a drug deal gone bad.Josh Brolin is Llewelyn Moss, a laborer type of man who happens upon the dead bodies while he is out hunting for Antelope with a high-powered rifle. He finds the bodies, and the drugs, and wonders where the money is. When he finds it, in the large briefcase, it is two $$Million in $100 bill packages. He isn't wealthy and decides his best course of action is to keep it. However, since the bad guys end up with his personal information when in a change of heart he goes back to give water to a dying man, and he almost gets killed himself, he decides that he and his wife need to leave their trailer and run.Javier Bardem is the very menacing man with no moral compass, Anton Chigurh. He is out to get the money back and doesn't have any qualms about killing anyone he encounters, even if they do nothing to him. He chases Llewelyn across Texas and into Mexico and back.Woody Harrelson is excellent in a small role as Carson Wells who also chases Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald, who was so good as a teenager in 'Trainspotting', is Llewelyn's simple wife, Carla Jean Moss.One of my all-time favorites, Barry Corbin of 'Northern Exposure' fame, plays Sheriff Bell's older brother Ellis. It was 10 years ago that I was an extra in a movie, and had the chance to sit with Corbin and have a pleasant conversation as we waited for the sound guy to get ready.MAJOR SPOILERS: Llewelyn's end comes at a cheap motel, and Chigurh ends up recovering a good portion of the money. As he is driving, he is distracted and gets into a severe crash at an intersection, but he manages to limp away. Sheriff Bell retires and muses over there not being a place for old men in our country.",Null,3,6,12 April 2008
The Love Guru," What happened to the old, funny, innovative Mike Myers??
","If you spend a bit of time studying Mike Myers you have to admire the guy. He is smart and witty and all that shows in the Austin Powers movies, especially the first two.But as demonstrated in 'The Love Guru', Mike Myers has become a tired, stale act. One that keeps on trying for cheap laughs via the route of potty humor.It starts from the very first scene, where the Guru explains that he was born in America but raised in India, and for no good reason injects comments about a hot dog and a penis.I have come to loathe the stupid Will Farrell movies, and now I can add the stupid Mike Myers movies to that list. Let's hope he can stand back and realize that, and return to his genuine, original, funny, inventive self for his next attempt.",Null,2,8,28 October 2008
District 9," What a different and interesting alien movie.
","I am so aggravated! I just almost finished typing a very complete set of comments here, and accidentally hit a key that wiped it all out!! Well, one more time...This movie was made by a group very inexperienced in movie-making, and with actors that had little experience in movies. To turn out an effort this good is amazing in itself. It will be interesting to see if the movie maintains its lofty IMDb rating once greater numbers of votes roll in.The movie begins as a documentary. A very large structure, essentially a very large space ship, has been suspended for some time over the Johannesburg, SA area. Eventually they are able to work their way inside it and find perhaps a million aliens in poor shape. They decide to remove them and relocate them to an area outside the city named 'District 9.' At first blush the aliens appear to be more like large insects with two legs and two arms. I found myself wondering 'why don't they just exterminate them?' But as we see more, they have intelligence and a language, and obviously had operated the large ship through space and into our world. One thing removed from the ship were large, powerful weapons which can only be fired by someone (something?) with the alien DNA, so the government is trying to figure out how to make them useful.The lead actor is South African Sharlto Copley as Wikus Van De Merwe. He is put in charge of the effort, after a few years, to evict the aliens from District 9 and relocate to another area. But while searching one hut he is sprayed with a mysterious fluid, which eventually begins to turn parts of him into alien-like.The rest of the movie is hard to describe, much easier to understand when viewed. Overall a very good, different alien movie.",Null,3,6,24 December 2009
Mamma Mia!," Really 'Papa M.I.A.' on a Greek Island.
","M.I.A. ... missing in action, adequately describes the father(s) in this sweet story. As always, Meryl Streep gives an awe-inspiring performance, with her acting and singing, and her 'Winner Takes It All' outdoors is just as good as anything that has been performed on the silver screen.This movie is the adaptation of the stage play which simply is a tribute to the ABBA songs. To tie it all together is an improbable, but sweet, romantic story. It works!Meryl Streep is Donna Sheridan who has been on this picturesque Greek island for 21 years, since her mother told the pregnant Donna to never come back home. So she stayed there, had her baby, and has been operating a run-down hotel for all those years.Cute 21-year-old Amanda Seyfried is her daughter, Sophie, and the event at hand is her marriage. Sophie finds her mom's diary from all those years ago and figures out that she had been romantically involved with 3 men during the time she became pregnant, so without her mom's knowledge Sophie sends wedding invitations to all three men, on the chance that one of them is her real father, whom she has never met.One of the 'fathers' is Pierce Brosnan as Sam Carmichael. Another is Colin Firth as Harry Bright. And the third is carefree sailor Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Bill Anderson. As good script writing would have it, all three of them appear at the same time and, in fact, all make the short trip from mainland to the island on Bill's sailboat after the other two barely miss the ferry.The movie is a musical. Everyone sings. Most of them had never sung outside the shower before. And it works! The DVD has very interesting 'extra' features that show how much musical work was done to get all the actors to the point that they could do justice to the ABBA songs.Joining Streep were Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. They were old friends who returned for the wedding, and provided the harmony voices for the songs.I like music and singing and I like this movie. It is totally funny and entertaining.Update May 2013: Just saw it again after almost 5 years and enjoyed it as much as I did the first time.",Null,0,1,27 December 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Meh! A very long movie that leaves you without a conclusion.
","OK, I admit I am not a big 'Ring' and 'Hobbit' fan, I didn't read the books growing up and have a moderate appreciation for the movies so far. The very first 'LOTR' movie is my favorite, it introduced the themes and the characters. But now I see these movies just for the novelty and for the sound. Yes, the sound. I like theater sound. In my home theater I have a nice surround sound system with a monster powered subwoofer. I would enjoy this movie as much with my eyes closed.But I must mention one revelation, Evangeline Lilly as the Elf Tauriel. I had not heard of her before seeing this movie and I find her just about the cutest thing on screen. At first she reminded me a bit of Cate Blanchett, but a lot more attractive. A lot more attractive. And a good actress also.(I took the liberty of looking up more web images of her in a bikini and she is a real doll!) Anyway Ian McKellen is of course Gandalf and Martin Freeman is of course the young Bilbo Baggins. This is actually a big spoiler throughout the movie, because we know Bilbo grows up to be the old Bilbo we see in the LOTR movies, so any time he gets in danger we are certain he will escape to safety, we just don't know how.Most of the rest of the cast are interchangeable, almost generic actors. In costume and with the Hobbit languages it is hard to distinguish one from another.So, while I enjoyed the visuals and the great sound, the ending was a big disappointment. The last scenes were inside the mountain with Smaug in the dragon form, lots of fire, lots of close calls. But Smaug is not destroyed, in fact flies away as the movie ends, and all the others wondering what kind of evil they might have sparked Smaug to do now. Sort of an 'Oh, spit...' moment.I will see the next installment, as I watch pretty much all the movies my public library gets on DVD or Blu-Ray. But these movies are definitely for the fans who can immerse themselves in the make-believe world of the Hobbits.",Null,3,6,26 April 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Story behind to story of Jesse James and his death.
","I grew up in the 1950s and in movies saw the 'romanticized' view of Jesse James, but never really knew anything about him. This movie portrays the gritty every day of Jesse James' last years, starting when he was a 'middle-aged' 34 and with a wife and two children.Brad Pitt is Jesse James, portrayed as suspicious of all his 'sidekicks' and quick to dispose of someone who he knew or suspected might turn on him. They would be told 'we are going to take a ride' and the other person never came back. Brad Pitt is superb in this role.Mary-Louise Parker is good in a small role as his wife, Zee James. The other main character is Casey Affleck as 'that coward' Robert Ford, and Affleck is also superb in this role. About 15 years younger than Jesse, we learn that Robert grew up idolizing him and as a 19-year-old desperately wanted to join the James brothers, first approaching Frank James (Sam Shepard), and finally getting in with Jesse.Sam Rockwell is also good as Robert's older brother Charley Ford. I enjoyed this movie, although a bit long at about 2 1/2 hours, because it looked intensely at the characters, not the criminal activities. I feel like for the first time I understand a bit about the real Jesse James and what a fragile existence the criminals of that day led.SPOILERS. As time passed Robert Ford became more and more unhappy with Jesse, and in the end arranged, along with his brother, to have Jesse turned in. However, in Jesse's own home, as he was on a stool dusting a framed picture on the wall, Robert Ford shot him from behind, killing him. Robert went on to to perhaps 800 stage performances re-enacting how he killed Jesse James, but in the end someone shot and killed Ford.",Null,1,3,6 February 2008
Tigerland," New look at an old subject, too bad it was filmed in Florida, not at Ft Polk, La.
","I grew up in the piney woods of Louisiana, just south of Ft Polk. In fact, my father actually worked there as a civilain many years ago. So that was part of why I was anxious to see TIGERLAND, a movie about US Army recruits receiving their final training at Ft Polk, 'Tigerland', right before shipping out to Viet Nam in 1971. While it is a good, intense, unconventional look at war, I was disappointed that they filmed it in Florida.  I bought the 'budget' DVD for under $6 US, and watched it last night. Very good film, if you don't mind foul language and some Amry training violence.some SPOILERS follow, please do not read further if you have not seen TIGERLAND yet.Bozz is the main protagonist, a young man from Texas, who has natural leadership qualities but doesn't believe in the war and simply wants to get out. He also helps some of his buddies get out.  This film looks in general at this rag-tag bunch of young men, boys really, who for the most part are law-abiding and patriotic but simply have no desire to go overseas and get killed. I suspect the characters depicted here are not too different from real recruits and draftees back in the early 1970s. I was draft age back then and I clearly recall hoping that I would not have to go.The DVD is fairly basic, but good. The whole film was done on 16mm, and much of it hand-held, so you get a rather stark, grainy look to a full color film. However it seems to fit the subject well.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
Remember the Titans," Entertaining, and with a story all peoples should see, I rate it '8' of 10.
","'Remember the Titans' is about the 1971 Alexandria, Va football team that dealt productively with mandatory racial integration. On the surface it is a football story, but it really is how the students, parents, and business people of Alexandria were brought together by these football players and coaches.Denzel Washington as the new coach, coming in to take over, and Will Patton, the outgoing head coach who becomes defensive coordinator, are both fine actors and are never better than they are here. The story is fairly predictable, and the Titans win the big championship on the final play of the final game. The script is a bit patronizing to our emotions at times. But we know this story is a real one, and the characters were real people. Many of them, including the two coaches, were there in the making of the film. The DVD sound is just great, and you can choose between DTS and Digital Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The extras give a real insight to the making of this film, including interviews of the two original coaches and many of the players. As the writer, who is a black American, commented, during adversity among the races we may not end up loving each other, but at least we can understand each other and appreciate the differences. Well put. This is the kind of movie everyone should see, because it accurately portrays the struggle of school integration, which is still fresh in many of our minds. Bravo to those who had the guts to make this film.",Null,2,5,4 May 2001
Toy Story 4," A very entertaining continuation of the Toy Story movies.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our local library.There isn't much to say about these types of animated stories of toys that come to life when people aren't watching. They are fantasy and just meant for entertainment. Is this one entertaining? Yes, it is.The 'storyline' described here on its IMDb main page aptly sums up what the movie is about. There are a number of clever jokes to add to the entertainment.I just want to comment on one of the voice actors, Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom, an Evel Knievel type of motorcyclist daredevil. During his movie career some have criticized Reeves for his lack of dynamic personality, but his voicing of this character should erase all that doubt. He turns out to be my favorite in this cast of voice actors.",Null,0,0,23 November 2019
Batman Begins," The defining Batman movie so far. Superb!
","June 2014 update: Just watched it again on Blu-ray and it still holds up ver well.January 2011 update: I watched it on Blu-ray and the additional clarity and sound are definitely worth it for a movie like this. July 2008 update: We watched this again today as a prelude to the new one, 'Dark Knight', hitting local screens today. My opinion of this one has not changed!I rarely buy DVD movies anymore, what with my public library's vast collection for free, and the absolute dearth of worthwhile movies the past few years. But I bought this one, the deluxe special edition, such was my anticipation of a superb movie. I was not disappointed. If anything, it is even better than I had hoped. I am still a fan of the other Batman movies, but this one is on another level by itself. As the title suggests, this Batman movie really is the story of how it all begins. From the experiences of Bruce Wayne, the child, to Bruce Wayne who begins to fight crime and accept his new role as savior of crumbling Gotham City. It has less of a comic book flair, more of a real gritty look at a mortal man learning the skills to become a super hero, cuts and bruises and all.Christian Bale was so good as the skinny machinist in the movie of that name, he is quite a contrast here as the muscular but svelte Bruce Wayne/Batman. I think Michael Caine was a perfect choice to play his loyal assistant Alfred. The essence of Bruce Wayne's preparation for his crime fighting role is in a far away place in snowy mountains, where he is mentored by the character played by Liam Neeson. Much later, this character shows up as a menace that must be defeated. I believe Katie Holmes has received unfair criticism as Rachel Dawes, the childhood friend of Bruce's who now works in the DA's office. I enjoyed her role in the movie and think it fits well.I am so used to seeing Gary Oldman play a bad guy, it was refreshing to see him as the good cop who, in the end, becomes a key player in Batman's fight against the men who want to destroy Gotham. Always dependable Morgan Freeman turns in another perfect performance as Lucius Fox, smart and loyal employee of Wayne Industries, under-appreciated until the very end, and who helps Bruce Wayne assemble much of his fighting toys and Batmobile.(As an aside, it is interesting that so many actors from Europe were playing 'American' roles with American accents, including Christian Bale, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, and Gary Oldman, but they all pulled them off quite well.) 'Batman Begins' - a new favorite of mine. The DVD picture and sound are great as expected, with very nice and interesting extras.SPOILERS -- SPOILERS. As Bruce Wayne begins to realize and accept his mission, the crisis arrives in the form of bad guys, led by Neeson's character, planning to destroy Gotham by putting a debilitating chemical into the water supply. But it only is activated via the lungs, so they also steal a powerful microwave generator which can vaporize water in the water supply. Bruce and a couple of others get inoculation, the plot is foiled by Batman, assisted when the high speed train carrying the generator is made to crash and the villain is also destroyed. At the end, Batman gets the calling card for his next nemesis, 'The Joker.'",Null,3,8,23 October 2005
The Fault in Our Stars," Teenagers facing life and premature death issues.
","I found this one on DVD from my local public library. It is a good movie, although it has a few too many very slow-moving scenes. It deals with teenagers with illnesses that will likely take their lives all too soon.I became a fan of young Shailene Woodley when she was the lead in that teenage TV series in 2008. She is a very pretty girl who also looks very innocent. While she might not have looked 'rough' enough for the role in 'Divergent', here she is perfect as Hazel who has been fighting a type of cancer and weakened lungs. So much so that she has an oxygen machine with her everywhere.Young actor Ansel Elgort is an interesting pick for her love interest. In their last movie he and Woodley had the role of siblings in 'Divergent'. Here he is Gus, a cancer survivor with an artificial right leg. Hazel and Gus met at a support group meeting.The focus of the story is Hazel's, seeming to accept her fate and not understand all the fuss everyone else is making, particularly her parents, Laura Dern as Frannie and Sam Trammell as Michael. But her meeting Gus causes her hope for the first time, he falls in love with her and she eventually with him, even as she does not understand why.An interesting development involves Willem Dafoe as Van Houten, Hazel's favorite author. Gus corresponds on her behalf, resulting in an invitation for her to travel to Amsterdam to meet him. It is there that she achieves the clarity of her purpose and life.It is a sad and yet uplifting movie at the same time.",Null,0,1,13 October 2014
Twilight," Good, entertaining vampire love story, with some humor in the script.
","The only thing I knew about this movie before seeing it was (1) it involved vampires and (2) it is very popular with the younger generation of females. After seeing it I can understand why. While it is neither a great movie nor a poor movie, it is a very interesting story of forbidden love, and even though I am not a female of the younger generation I found it very enjoyable.Kristen Stewart, still a teenager, is Bella Swan, living in Arizona with her mother. But mom recently re-married and her baseball husband travels a lot, so Bella decided to go live with dad so that her mother could have more freedom. She didn't do it with malice, just because she is a caring and wise girl for her age.Billy Burke is her dad Charlie Swan , the sheriff in the local small town of Forks, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. (I have vacationed in that area, it is beautiful as the film shows and was a good choice for this movie.) Bella had spent some time growing up there but had not visited for a number of years. So her return was a reunion of sorts, but she quickly became the new girl at school, and attracted a lot of attention.But the one student who really grabs her attention is Brit Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen. Just looking at the screen we are struck with his looks, almost as if he has lots of makeup on, and later we find out why. By chance Bella gets paired with Edward in Biology, but he seems to have an immediate dislike for her, is rude, and tries to get a transfer to a different class. This puzzles Bella.The movie is almost 2 hours long and my wife and I enjoyed it. Some of the dialog was predictable, and the unresolved ending which sets up the sequel is predictable. But the movie is filmed beautifully and the idea of a human and vampire relationship is treated in a fun and novel way.SPOILERS: As probably everyone knows Edward is a vampire. When asked how old he is, he responds '17'. When further asked how long he has been 17 he responds 'A while.' He was saved from dying in the 1840s, and being an immortal vampire stays looking 17. He and his family (dad is the doctor in town) have vowed to give up human blood and live a vegetarian life. Edward and other vampires are addictively attracted by Bella's scent, and that is why Edward tried to get away from her initially. Now he is her protector, and has to destroy a vampire from a different clan that tried to have Bella for dinner. But one of them survives and we see her as if to say 'I'm going to get Bella.' So there probably will be a sequel.",Null,1,5,28 March 2009
Liar Liar," Not as good on repeat viewings.
","Several years after my initial viewing, I saw 'Liar, Liar' again this week, a free DVD loan from my county library. It was not as good as I remembered it. While Carrey is good as the lawyer who must be truthful for 24 hours after his son's birthday wish, his over-acting finally gets to you and spoils a rather unique fantasy story.SPOILERS - stop now if you have not seen the film Jennifer Tilley plays a loose woman being divorced from her husband who wants to give her nothing since a pre-nup specifically lists adultery as grounds for such. Carrey is trying to defend her but cannot lie, or even stretch the truth. In the courtroom the climax comes when it is brought to his attention that she lied on her marriage application years earlier, she was only 17 and thus not of legal age to execute a legal pre-nup, so she gets half of the estate.I mostly liked Maura Tierney who played Carrey's understanding ex-wife who appears to be headed across country with her boyfriend (Cary Elwes, playing an American). In the end, it appears that son and father will do better, dad will do better at keeping dates, and maybe even a reconciliation between mom and dad. Cute movie, but Carrey's over-acting takes much of the lustre off.",Null,0,3,28 February 2003
Wreck-It Ralph," Good, funny story, a very entertaining animated feature.
","I am always leery when any movie gets lots of praise, and this one has had its share. But it deserves all of it. The story is very interesting, reminding me a lot of 'Monsters, Inc' in that the characters in arcade games had lives of their own when the arcade was closed and they were not being 'played.' And the voice-acting is some of the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Plus the animation makes the characters' expressions so interesting. With all the mediocre animated features out now, this one shines as one of the best.The feature arcade game is 'Wreck-It Ralph', where Ralph wreaks havoc and Felix the repairman with the magic hammer has to go behind him and repair things. That is the object of the game, players need to manipulate Felix to repair Ralph's messes. But Ralph after 30 years has become tired of being the bad guy, he wants to be a hero, to be liked.John C. Reilly is the voice of Ralph, doing a good job. But the real star is Sarah Silverman voicing Vanellope, the little girl in a different arcade game that Ralph enters. When you put her voice acting together with inventive animation, she is as much fun to watch as 'Wall-E'. The visual design is very clever. In the arcade all the various machines (games) are plugged into a common power strip. Since characters in arcade games are just electrical signals, in their miniature world they travel within wires and circuits. So the inside of the power strip is made to look similar to the concourse of a train station, with the several tunnels off to each side leading towards the power cord of a different arcade game. So, even though they are not supposed to leave their own game and enter another, they are able to do so and in fact do enter other games. All very interestingly done.The overall story and its conclusion is a bit intricate to summarize easily, but is straightforward and easy to follow. Good, entertaining movie.",Null,0,0,14 May 2013
Blue Crush," A 'must have' DVD if you also have a surround sound system with subwoofer.
","Critic Ebert has a very complete and accurate review, and I will not repeat any of it here. I bought 'Blue Crush' as a used rental DVD, real cheap, and it is a perfect disk. The basic story has been told many times, but it is done here better than many. However, there is one thing that moves it from the 'ordinary' to 'outstanding - the cimematography and the sound.After most of the first hour of the film sets up the characters and the situations, we are treated to surfing the Hawaii 'pipeline' by surfers. One DVD extra shows how they do 'face replacement' so that the pro surfer appears to be star Kate Bosworth. With many cameras in the waves, and sometimes under them, we get a unique perspective of being on top of a giant wave, or being inside the wave as it is breaking.  All the while a very aggressive sound mix makes you feel like you are there also.  This is definitely a good DVD to have for demonstrating the quality of your digital 5.1 surround sound system with good powered subwoofer.I suspect anyone who saw 'Blue Crush' at home, on VHS or DVD, with sound fed into the TV speakers has seen a different movie. That's because the sound track plays such a key role. This isn't a great movie, but a very good one. I believe its most realistic IMDb rating is somewhere around '7' or '8'.",Null,35,44,21 April 2003
To Rome With Love," Just a fun romp, as most Woody Allen movies are.
","As the extra on the DVD explains, Woody Allen is a fan of the older Italian movies and wanted to do an homage of sorts, to make a movie in Rome with some of the Italian style and comedy represented in those older movies.He has several, independent, parallel stories going on, each with its own quirks. I like Woody himself in small doses and here he has one of the roles, as a dad, recently retired from the classical music business, traveling to Rome to see his daughter and meet her Italian fianc√©e. Most of the humor involves Giancarlo, the father of the fianc√©e, and the actor is Fabio Armiliato, who in actuality is a well-respected operatic tenor. He is an undertaker and they discover that he sings really well in the shower, but only does so-so in the audition that he very reluctantly goes to. The solution is funny, they modify well-known operas so that he always sings while taking a shower, and the audience loves him. Roberto Benigni, of 'Life Is Beautiful' fame, plays Leopoldo, a lowly clerk, who one day is unexpectedly confronted by cameras and microphones, for no apparent reason everyone takes an interest in every detail of his life, what he eats for breakfast, what kind of shaving cream he uses, whether he wears briefs or boxers. He is very annoyed. Of course it is Woody's comment on people who become 'famous for being famous' with no basis. Later when people lose interest in him he misses the attention and tries to get it back.There is a bit about a young aspiring architect meeting up with an architect who had, like the young architect, lived in the same area of Rome 30 years earlier. Now he is known for designing shopping centers. Another bit is about a young couple taking their honeymoon in Rome and getting separated, he meeting up with a hooker, she with a hotel robber, then finding out they would rather lead a more normal life away from Rome. You can look for deep meaning in Woody Allen films but to me there isn't any, just some humorous scenes and characters that more often than not are a commentary on some facet of our everyday lives. But examined from a unique Woody Allen angle.An aside, for years Woody Allen has insisted that his movies have a 'mono' soundtrack, because that is the way it was at movie houses. Yes it 'was', many years ago. But modern movie houses have incorporated some form of 'surround sound' for years now. Well this movie, 'To Rome With Love' has a Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. And when I went back to check, 'Midnight in Paris' (2011) did too. But every movie before that is listed with a 'mono' sound. It is nice to see Woody Allen has finally accepted modern sound design, it makes the movie much more enjoyable.",Null,1,2,11 February 2013
Bridesmaids," I could feel my IQ dropping at least 20 points while I watched this movie!
","Oh, I laughed very often and very loudly. My favorite was Melissa McCarthy, one of the friends who could best be described as 'large and in charge' in most scenes she is in. It was a brave choice, very un-glamorous with little or no makeup, she was a hoot in all her scenes.But the main character is Annie (Kristen Wiig) as the maid of honor for her best friend's upcoming wedding. Annie is in a bad run of bad luck, with her love life, her job, and her apartment mates. Most of it she causes herself, by being a real putz of a person.When she does get into the wedding planning, she is surprised to find another 'best friend' of the bride who happens to be wealthy. The two of them end up competing for the status of 'best friend of the bride.' I like Wiig. She is funny and a good actress. This just isn't the best script. As I mentioned in my lead off comment, I laughed many times, and generally was entertained. But it really is a dumb movie.A free DVD loaner from my public library.",Null,6,10,20 October 2011
Meet the Fockers," I was determined to not like this sequel, but I found it much fun, with so many screen legends.
","Having been a movie-goer for over 50 years now, it was impossible for me to separate the actors from their characters in 'Meet The Fockers.' But that was fine, I enjoyed it. We have De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand (and to a lesser extent Danner), entertainment and screen legends, playing these funny, stupid characters. How far they have come, from the days when they likely would only have played serious parts. As all of us get older, and we fully realize that we no loner have to prove ourselves, it gets to be fun again, like it was when we were children. Watching these veteran actors be silly was as fun for me as was the actual story.Even though this is a sequel to 'Meet The Parents', the movie takes its own deranged but fresh approach to the upcoming wedding of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). While the first movie focused on Greg's attempt to get Pam's parents to accept him, this sequel focuses on the first time the four parents get together. The setting is Focker Island in southern Florida.One of the funny sidelines is the 15-year-old son of the former maid. The boy looks just like a younger Greg Focker. Is this his son, conceived when Greg was only a teenager, messing around with the maid? All in all a silly movie, but a very enjoyable one.",Null,0,0,22 November 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Peter Jackson franchise marches on. In all a pretty entertaining movie.
","The RING movies and now the HOBBIT are indeed well-written and well-acted. But in truth, the location, New Zealand, is the star of all these movies. In the DVD for this movie is a 6-minute 'extra' which is simply a feature on New Zealand and the various locations for the main scenes. Some of them, like Hobbit Town, are now also being turned into tourist attractions, to allow fans to visit the actual areas and, as the narration suggests, even be able to knock on the door of Bilbo Baggins' residence. In the first of the RING trilogy we learn that Bilbo has had possession of the last remaining One Ring, and Frodo is charged with the task of returning it and having it destroyed. In this movie, which amounts to the first prequel, we see how 60 years earlier Bilbo comes into possession of the ring. It starts with a bit of Middle Earth history, where one group had its homeland taken away, and now Gandalf is recruiting young Bilbo to be part of an expedition to regain their land for them. Along the way many perils await, and we see most of them, and the narrow escapes that ensue. Of course they had narrow escapes, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie, would there? One of them was Bilbo's encounter with Golum in a cave, and it was Golum dropping the ring that afforded Bilbo the chance to get it, and then to use it to escape to freedom.Ian McKellen is of course appropriate as Gandalf , and Martin Freeman, young-looking for a man in his 40s, is good as the young Bilbo . These have been great movies for Tolkien fans, all extremely well made, and also a gold mine for Peter Jackson and the team responsible for making them. This one ends in a manner that sets up the sequel, and in fact the next two HOBBIT movies are already in post-production.",Null,6,20,1 May 2013
Before Sunset," Worthy second chapter. Will we see another in 9 years??
","Michael Apted has made a series of movies every 7 years, showing us how children from different British classes have grown up from age 7. This year, 2005, he presumably will give us '49 Up.' In an analogous sense, in 1995 we saw Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and talk all night in 'Before Sunrise', and now in 2004 we see them meet and talk all afternoon in Paris in 'Before Sunset.' Maybe in 2013 we will see them in 'All Day and Night.' A good movie, but I did not enjoy it as much as the 1995 movie.Jessie is on a brisk world tour to publicize his new book, and Celine shows up unannounced. He is taken aback when he sees her, but finishes up his press gig and book signing, to tell her hello. He only has an hour or two before he has to leave to catch a flight back home, so they agree to make the best of it, go get coffee and talk. The screenplay was written by Hawke, Delpy, and director Linklater. Much of the filming was done with a steady cam following them through the streets of Paris.Spoilers follow. The book Jessie had written was the story of his and Celine's meeting in 1995. She recognized that, and realized it was him, so looked him up. After the usual small talk, they begin to exchange superficial information, but eventually get personal. Jessie had gone back to Vienna 6 months later as they had agreed, Celine planned to but a relative died. They both wondered what would have happened if they had re-connected. Jessie is married with two children, but does not seem in love with his wife. Celine has a boyfriend, but that too doesn't appear to have the right passion. They find out they both lived in New York at the same time in the late 1990s. They begin to realize they are soul mates. At the end, he is having tea in her apartment, she has sung him a song she wrote about them, he asks for another, she says 'You'll miss your flight', he smiles and responds, 'I know', and the credits roll.Perhaps it ended that way to set the stage for the next installment. It is implied that he stayed with her for at least an extra day, and who knows what might follow. Since this movie deals with disappointment and failed loves, it is not as pleasant a movie as the earlier, more ideal one. And, there is something about Ethan Hawk that I don't like, not sure what. And his character here seemed a bit juvenile for a successful author. The first time he made an absurd comment, quickly followed by 'I'm just kidding', it was OK. After about the 5th time, it had become annoying.",Null,2,3,5 March 2005
Non-Stop," Entertaining and suspenseful, is there really a hijacker on the flight to London?
","This movie of course manipulates the audience, it has to last almost 2 hours so they created ways to lead us towards one direction, then another. I admit, it had me guessing and in the end all my guesses were wrong.Ever since he was so successful in 'Taken' as the special ops guy who can defeat almost anyone in almost any situation, Liam Neeson has had serial success in similar roles. And for good reason, he is big, menacing, and good in those roles.Here he is Bill Marks, an air Marshall, being assigned to a non-stop overnight flight from New York to London. It is about a 6 to 6 1/2 hour flight. Things seem to be going smoothly, he meets a seemingly nice lady sitting next to him, Julianne Moore as Jen Summers.When everything is quiet, with the plane at cruising altitude over the Atlantic, things begin to get strange. Bill gets a text message on his secure phone. As more and more messages come through it is clear that someone, most likely on the airplane, wants $150 Million to be transferred to an account otherwise a person will be killed every 20 minutes.On the surface that would seem easy to sniff out and prevent but it gets very complicated. So almost all of the movie involves Bill's efforts to safe the passengers and save the plane, once he suspects there might also be a bomb onboard.(As a side note, it was nice seeing Michelle Dockery as one of the flight attendants, Nancy. She is so cute I could watch her in anything.)SPOILERS: The first person to die, quite mysteriously, was the pilot. Later Bill discovered a hole from the toilet wall to the cockpit and remnants of a blowpipe, he had been shot with a poisonous dart. After he had to fight and kill the other air Marshall he discovered cocaine in that man's briefcase, but hidden inside was also a bomb. The account for the money was actually Bill's account, so he was suspected of being a terrorist, but that was a ruse by the two guilty men, who had a plan to parachute to safety once the plane was brought down to 8000 feet, then the rest would die in the blast and plane crash, allowing them to capture Bill's money that would have been transferred to any number of trusts around the world. But Bill sniffs them out, they are killed, the bomb explodes but having put it near an exit door with all the luggage stacked against it, the copilot was able to crash-land the plane and all survived. Bill and Jen made a date.",Null,0,0,18 August 2014
Man on the Moon," A must-see film for anyone who is interested in the real Latka Gravas.
","I am a big fan of the old 'Taxi' TV series. In fact it is my all-time #2 TV series, behind 'Northern Exposure.' Andy Kaufman's 'Latka' was surely one of the most intriguing characters on 'Taxi.' In fact, it was several years before I realized that Andy Kaufman was an American and didn't really speak like that! So, when 'Man On The Moon' came around, for me it was a 'must-see.'As everyone now knows, Jim Carrey did a marvelous job as Andy. In fact, his not getting a good run at best actor clearly illustrates the politics of the Oscar awards. As any semi-biographical like this, any plot and character development is constrained by what really happened. Fault Andy if you will for living the life he did. But we cannot fault the film makers for producing a wonderful film of this wierd comic talent. If you like Andy Kaufman, or are just curious about him, see this movie and you will love it. Otherwise, don't bother. If you do, then don't bitch about it. A solid 8 of 10 rating from me.",Null,0,0,29 July 2000
The Princess Bride," 'As you wish' means 'I love you.'
","By virtue of the 'under 29' female vote, 'Princess Bride' is somewhat overrated on the IMDB, but still is a good, fun movie.  I rate it '8' of 10.The recently-released special edition DVD is the one to view. The colors are nicely saturated in most scenes, it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and there are lots of extras, including one of the better 'making of' specials. One of my favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin, and here he is great as the Spanish swordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of the six-fingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright's first film, as a 19-year-old, playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfect as her love interest. Andre the Giant, who died in 1993 at age 45, was so fitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine, entertaining, funny film.

Saving Private Ryan," Not only action-packed war movie, it has a very nice personal story.
","The whole movie is the quest for one particular soldier, and the mission to bring him home safely.  The invasion at Normandy begins the movie.  The opening is very hard to watch, not only because of the very graphic violence and mutilation of war, but also the memory of all those who gave up their lives. Once you get past that scene-setting episode, the rest of the movie is much more pleasant to watch.  Tom Hanks, as always, if fine in his role, as are all the supporting roles.  But, who was the last person to see a poorly-done Spielberg film? You owe it to yourself to see Private Ryan, if for no other reason but to remember the ugliness of war.",Null,1,5,7 September 1999
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Great animation, entertaining but not up to the charm of the first one 4 years earlier.
","I saw 'How To Train Your Dragon' just about 4 years ago. I just re- read my comments from back then, to recall my reactions to it. That is a very charming movie, where the young dragon hunter Hiccup wants to impress his massive dad, traps a seldom seen nighttime dragon. He damages the dragon's tail in the process, but manages to fabricate a piece of a tail, and befriends and trains the feared dragon.In this recent movie Jay Baruchel is back as the voice of Hiccup, and since the first movie the two have bonded and are seen constantly flying as a team. But the story comes from a rival dragon trapping clan threatening the existence of Hiccup, his dragon, and the rest of his clan. So the movie contains many conflicts, battles where dragons are trapped and people are threatened. While I applaud their efforts to come up with something different, this movie has none of the charm of the first installment. There is a touching human-like story, but overall nowhere near what we saw in the first one.SPOILERS: A new character is voiced by Cate Blanchett as Valka , the long missing mother of Hiccup, feared to be dead. She is discovered as everyone is out to defeat the bad guys, and she is reunited with her son and her husband, Stoick, voiced again by Gerard Butler.",Null,4,8,21 November 2014
The Pianist," Just trying to survive the war, so he could play piano again.
","This movie is too long for what it depicts, one Jew's struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the second world war. The movie doesn't cover any new ground, the audience doesn't learn anything new. However, being a personal project for the director may account for its length. I hadn't planned to see it, because if you've seen one holocaust film, you've seen them all. And that is not in any way intended to minimize the horror of the mistreatment of the Jews, but how many times does a person need to see it reinacted to grasp the message? It happened, it was bad, we all need to do our part to see that nothing like that happens again. But I saw it for Adrien Brody, the hawkish actor who won the best actor Oscar for his performance. And, after seeing it, I believe it was deserved. The first hour of the movie established the setting and danger, the middle hour spends too much time showing the protagonist trying to survive, hiding in bombed-out buildings, scratching for food. We know it all happened, but if you show everything, the movie is 6 years long!!  The movie starts with actual black and white film footage of 1939 Warsaw, and we see its residents leading normal lives for that period. Then, cut to the movie, the pianist is playing for a live radio broadcast when bombs or artillery shells begin to explode and all Jewish families begin their fights for survival. Forced to wear identifying arm bands, eventually they were banished to their own ghetto, then the trains came. SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, please read no further. The last half hour of the movie pulls everything together. The pianist is helped by a German soldier who discovers him, has him play piano for him, then secretly brings him food as the war winds down. When the Russians finally come to Warsaw, the few remaining Jews are out of danger, the Germans are imprisoned, and eventually the pianist is playing again for the radio, and the final scene is his playing a concert before a live audience. The pianist was a real person, this movie is a true story based on his book.",Null,5,10,26 June 2004
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson shares with us the whimsical goings on in his creative mind.
","I watched this movie twice. The first time I neglected to consider that it is a Wes Anderson movie. As such I tried to make sense of it in the usual way and, while I enjoyed it enough, my second viewing a few days later was much more fun. In fact, I'll go so far as to say this is one of the most fun movies I have seen in quite a while.The most common element of every scene is that there is nothing in common with normal expectations. Every scene is done in a very careful, particular style. Whether it be colors, or camera angles, or unexpected dialog, often all of these and more, the whole movie is a delight of invention.The phrase 'never a dull moment' applies.The story has three layers, 1986, 1968, and 1932. It starts with the older author telling of his younger self meeting with a mysterious man who tells him of his past, in 1932, and that is the story featured. It is about how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel in a fictional place. It involved wealthy guests, a bisexual concierge, and a very new lobby boy, destined to become the old owner of the hotel.It has a great cast of some of the best actors, many of them typical participants in Wes Anderson projects. The story is fun, but it really is secondary. The filming and story-telling mechanism is the best aspect of this movie.I watched it again March 2017 and in February 2020, and each time found it as enjoyable as ever.",Null,2,5,25 July 2014
The Favourite," Based on the real Queen Anne, early 1700s, a fine first half but the second half falls apart.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. Its greatest claim to fame is Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne, just recently was awarded the Oscar for best actress.It seems to be a mostly fact-based glimpse into the later years of Anne, sickly and overweight, often confined to a wheelchair. A new worker comes to her residence and there arises a competition for the Queen's affection.We pretty well enjoyed the first half of the movie, it sets everything up nicely and shows the great contrast between the royalty and their entourage, enjoying themselves at home, while husbands are on the front lines fighting the French. As the movie gets closer to its conclusion the story doesn't hold up, and when it ends we are left wondering, 'What is the symbolism of all the rabbits running around the Queen's bedroom?'The movie also uses some interesting, but sometimes annoying background music. And the extensive use of fisheye lenses for many shots becomes disconcerting. When the viewer starts to focus on the filming technique then it ceases to be a useful approach.I am glad we saw it, but I came away with a great degree of dissatisfaction.",Null,1,4,15 March 2019
Seabiscuit," Truly fine dramatic movie of a real horse, and the real people he helped save.
","Set mainly between 1910 and 1938, the movie 'Seabiscuit' is about a racehorse that waited to show his stuff until the right set of people came along. Jeff Bridges plays the owner who had been despondent after losing his young son in a car accident. Chris Cooper plays the horse trainer who had lost his 'west' as fences went up and motorcars began spoiling the plains. Tobey Maguire plays the jockey, too tall and almost too heavy, and who had lost his family during the depression, leaving him to ride horses, essentially deserting him. This unlikely trio recognized the potential of this ornery and too small horse, and together they made racing history.
Gary Ross wrote and directed, based on a best-selling book. Ross also was responsible for 'Pleasantville', one of my favorite movies, as well as being the screenwriter for two other smart comedies, 'Big' with Tom Hanks and 'Dave' with Kevin Kline. So it came as no surprise that I really enjoyed 'Seabiscuit.' This is an old-fashioned movie where time is taken to develop characters and tell a good story. At key points in the movie we also see authentic B&W stills from the era, which adds to the realism. Overall, one of the better movies of 2003.The DVD is beautifully done, with a sharp picture and realistic surround sound. During the racing scenes, you can actually feel the pounding on the track. The 'making of' extra is also worth a look, as is the feature on Seabiscuit, with racing film from his heyday.",Null,1,1,23 December 2003
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A comedy-horror movie, nothing but laughs all around.
","It was a slow Friday night and a bunch of us were looking for a Netflix streaming movie to watch. Natalie and Creighton recommended this one. We were a bit leery but gave it a go. We enjoyed it all the way through, it is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.First off it is a parody of the type of story where good-looking college kids meet dangerous-looking characters from the back woods. The kinds that you might expect to kidnap you and dismember you into a wood chipper. In the process some of the college kids tell old stories about things that supposedly happened years ago.Scruffy-looking Tyler Labine is Dale and old reliable Alan Tudyk is Tucker. Fast friends for a long time, Tucker buys a dilapidated cabin in the woods and the two of them load up the pickup truck with equipment to go straighten things out.As fate would have it (or better yet, scriptwriting) a group of college kids are headed to the same general location for a fun weekend of drinking, swimming, and mischief. One of them is pretty Katrina Bowden as Allison, who somehow wanders off by herself, strips down to underwear and climbs on a rock to dive into water. In a boat not too far away are Dale and Tucker, observing, but when they make a noise Allison, startled, slips into the water and hits her head. The guys have to save her, and bring her to the cabin.Meanwhile the rest of the college kids, with hot-headed Jesse Moss as Chad stirring the pot, the remaining ones decide Dale and Tucker are bad, trying to kill Allison, so they begin to do some real stupid things. Not all the college kids survive.There is nothing socially redeeming about the story, it is just written as a parody and acted for laughs. And for that it works really well.",Null,1,3,21 June 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Yeah, we really enjoyed this movie, great action in an almost impossible mission.
","You know after a while the actual plot of these 'Mission Impossible' movies isn't really that important. I doubt that any of us really care that much about the story. We enjoy these movies, if we enjoy them at all, for the stupefying action and the highly improbably escapes from what seems like sure disaster.Tom Cruise of course is back as Ethan Hunt, the absolute best I.M.F agent. And even though he is close to turning 50 (later in 2012) he still does most of his stunts and can run with the best of them. Here the mission becomes to stop a terrorist who wants to start a nuclear war, that will deplete all civilizations equally, because he figures that will allow humanity a fresh start.The pretty girl this time is Paula Patton as Jane Carter. (Is that a take-off from John Carter??) I was not already familiar with her body of work but she turns out quite good for this role. Another member of the team is Brit Simon Pegg as computer expert Benji Dunn. And the fourth is Jeremy Renner as William Brandt.The villain is Michael Nyqvist (of 'Dragon Tattoo' fame) as Kurt Hendricks .Can you guess if the I.M.F. team succeeds to get the codes and disarm the nuclear device right before it destroys San Francison? Hint ... San Francisco is still there! Good entertainment, even though ti runs over 2 hours it was thrilling all the way through.",Null,1,3,5 May 2012
Revolutionary Road," Family drama, DiCaprio and Winslet are two of our best actors.
","I personally found it a bit unfortunate that the movie is titled 'Revolutionary Road' because that gave me some unfounded thoughts about its content. In fact it is the name of the street where they buy their first home in Connecticut in the 1950s, as did many New York city office workers who commuted by train.Leonardo DiCaprio is Frank Wheeler in an office job that clearly doesn't offer him any challenge. He undoubtedly works there because his father before him worked for the company, in sales. But it is a job and it allows him to pay the bills. Probably common among this type of worker.Kate Winslet is his wife April Wheeler who has aspired to be an actress but instead has settled into being a suburban housewife with a son and a daughter.But the movie actually starts 7 or 8 years earlier when they catch each other's eye at a social mixer, and each immediately finds the other fascinating. The thrust of the story is built on this, often young people get married for a type of fascination that soon fades away and which must be replaced by a totally different set of circumstances that link them and allow them to remain a happy couple.The couple, now in their 30s, remain seemingly happy but each has a type of wunderlust that distracts them at times. For Frank it may be the cute young secretaries in the office pool. For April it may be the thought of getting out of Connecticut and into something more appealing.A change of direction comes when April is looking at old photos of her husband, in Paris during the war, and reminds him that he had said Paris is the place he would really rather be. She has this idea, if they sell their home and use their savings they can move to Paris, she can get a job as a well-paid secretary working for a US Embassy and he can leisurely figure out what he really wants to do with his life. But is she really doing this for her husband, or is it more for herself?This is a good family drama, set in the 1950s but could have been set in more modern times. Virtually every married couple goes through at least some of these things on the road to a long-term relationship. It was fun seeing Leo and Kate together again, 12 years after 'Titanic.'SPOILERS: Even though Frank and April had not been 'close' in some time one evening they have passionate sex in the kitchen, during the time they were planning the sale of their home and their move to Paris. Ten weeks later April tells Frank that she is pregnant, but she thinks she can safely have a self-abortion. Frank is mortified, that she would think of killing their unborn child, and even wonders if she even wanted the two children they already have. Meanwhile on a lark Frank does something flippant at work which turns into a great idea, and is offered a big promotion and raise to join a group in the very new field of computer sales. All this gets them to re-think their plan to move to Paris, plus when Frank confesses he had a brief affair with a secretary April tells him she doesn't care, she doesn't love him anyway. They have a big fight, April seems to get over it the next day, feeds Frank before he goes to work, she performs the self-abortion at 12 weeks with tubes and a suction bulb, she bleeds, and even taken to the hospital she does not survive. Frank is never the same, he resigns to working and taking care of the kids.",Null,0,2,19 June 2009
Foxcatcher," John Dupont, obsessed with wrestling, in the end a convicted murderer.
","This movie is based on a mostly true story of John Dupont's strange involvement in wrestling. What it doesn't cover is that Dupont earned a PhD from Villanova in 1973 and in his 30s and 40s did some valuable scientific work in his field of natural science. Also not covered was his marriage at age 45, lasting only a few months, and in divorce hearings she accused him of pointing a gun at her and tried to push her into a fireplace.So this movie depicting him as a bright but socially inept man who only had one friend as a child, later finding out his mother paid the boy to be his friend, seems pretty close to the mark. This movie focuses on the late 1980s when he got Olympic champion brothers Dave and Mark Schultz to come to his wrestling training facility he built at his Foxcatcher residence. Dupont is depicted as a man who bought his involvement in championship wrestling. He seemed to need to impress his elderly mother even though he was already in his 50s. He put on a show, pretending he was the coach, when in fact Dave Schultz was coaching the team. A really good movie of a very flawed man and his sad ending to what could have been a very nice life. Almost unrecognizable was Steve Carell as John du Pont, plus Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz and Mark Ruffalo, himself a wrestler in high school, as older brother David Schultz. SPOILERS: Just in case anyone is not aware, in 1996 when Dave Schultz and his family were still living on the Dupont property, Dupont drove up, Dave greeted him, Dupont asked 'Do you have a problem with me?', fired several times with a handgun, Dave Schultz died of the wounds, Dupont was convicted and sent to prison where he died in 2010 at the age of 72.",Null,1,2,8 March 2015
28 Days Later...," 'Staying alive is as good as it gets.' (Selena)
","'28 Days Later' opens with views of rioting and other violence all over the world, then the camera gradually pulls back to show us a Chimp, strapped down, being shown these images at a Primate Research center via multiple monitors. Activists break in to free the Chimps, ignoring a warning that they are infected with a new 'rage' virus that spreads very quickly and those infected are in a constant 'rage' and, quite miraculously, only attack those who do NOT have the virus. So, this movie is about what could happen if, through carelessness, humankind unleashed a devastating virus that would threaten to destroy all of civilization. I quite enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect by any stretch, but held my interest to the closing credits, and beyond, with some interesting 'extras' on the DVD.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The main story starts '28 days later', we see Jim naked in a hospital bed, no one else around. He strips off the tubes, grabs some scrubs, and takes a stroll into London. All the familiar landmarks, not a person or moving vehicle in sight. The only sounds we hear are the fluttering wings of pigeons. Newspaper headlines tell of the virus and the exodus of British from their island. However the news stops after reporting that large cities like New York and Paris are infected, so the virus may have spread all over the world. For anyone not yet infected, 'Staying alive is as good as it gets', says Selena.Jim gets away from some 'infected' he encounters, and ends up with Selena, plus Frank and his 14 year old daughter, Hannah. They have a self-powered radio, randomly scan and hear a broadcast message telling of a safe place and possible cure northeast of Manchester. The next third of the movie is a road trip, as they find a taxi and supplies from a grocery store and head north, on deserted main highways. They approach Manchester and see the whole city in flames and smoke. Frank gets infected when, looking up in a barn, has a drop of fluid from a dead body drop into his eye. Almost immediately in a rage, we hear gunshots, see the soldiers, the three survivors are taken to the compound. They think they are safe, but Jim learns from the commander of the nine men, 'I promised them women', there really was no cure, the message was just to try to get women. Jim reacts by trying to run away with Selena and Hannah, but is subdued and taken out by two rogues to be shot. He escapes, looks up to see commercial jet contrails, knows there is hope, eventually gets the best of all of the others, he and the two women escape in the taxi. They end up in a country farmhouse, Selena sews sheets and other fabrics together to make a very large 'H E L L O' which is seen by a jet fighter flying low, and we suspect they will join other survivors and begin to re-populate the world.",Null,2,5,7 February 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," Yes, it is a very long movie, but the DVD on a large screen HDTV is worth it!
","To put the running time of 'Lawrence of Arabia' in perspective, it is like watching four 55-minute programs in a row.  I watched it in three segments, last night, this morning, and this evening. Then I watched the opening scene (after the dark screen musical intro) again, which had much more impact than seeing it the very first time. The DVD is just marvelous. The original movie was shot in 70mm film format, which gives a remarkably beautiful picture, and the transfer to DVD was done very well. Even without a good story, the photography alone can keep one interested. However it is a good story, about this misfit, under utilized as a map maker in the British military in WW-I, sent to Arabia and, much like a modern day 'Joan of Arc', motivates them to unite and defeat the Turks. Peter O'Toole creates a memorable 'Lawrence of Arabia.'SPOILERS follow, tread carefully.  The very opening scene is years after Lawrence came home to England, he is on his motorcycle, going down a narrow country road, increasing his speed, until cresting a hill sees two bicyclists in his lane, he swerves and brakes, highsides, goes off the road, and is killed. The irony is, after surviving unbelievable conditions and savage tribes in Arabia, he died near home in a silly motorcycle accident. As the movie itself develops, we see in his first desert crossing, his compassion for human life. Near the end of the movie we see a changed Lawrence, one who says of the enemy 'take no prisoners, no one lives.' We don't exactly know what caused the change other than the craziness that comes with war and brutality.A very worthwhile movie, with stars like Peter O'Toole (T.E. Lawrence), Alec Guinness (Prince Feisal ), Anthony Quinn (Auda abu Tayi), Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish ) and Jos√É¬© Ferrer (Turk officer). However, it probably would not come across very well on a small screen TV. It is best viewed in a theater, or on a wide-screen, HDTV.",Null,2,4,21 December 2003
It Follows," A slice of life with a spooky stalker following. Where did it come from? Where will it lead?
","I managed to find this movie on DVD at my local public library. It isn't my wife's type of flick so I had to watch it by myself. I had to hold my own hand when things got scary! The story has no beginning and no end, it is a sort of slice in the life of a band of teenagers. I will focus on only one of them, Maika Monroe (probably 19 or 20 at filming) as Jay Height. She is your fairly typical teen and has been dating a new guy. They get amorous, they sleep together, he disappears but she starts to see a strange, zombie-like form following her. But only she can see it. Tracking down the boy he tells her it was transferred to him during sex with different girl, now he has transferred it to her, she must have sex with a different guy to get rid of it.Whoa! Stop here. What kind of moral degradation is that? Teens just matter of factly thinking it might be OK to 'infect' someone else just to get better themselves? Is that sort of like 'If I can give you AIDS then I will get better and that is OK'? Well as it turns out the situation is not so simple. It seems that none of them can really get rid of the mysterious zombie-like entity that might kill them if it manages to touch them. They try to lure it into a swimming pool to kill it by throwing all kinds of plugged in electrical devices. Then the movie ends without resolution. This does not have a very high rating, even then it seems too high. It isn't a very good movie and it isn't that scary. Plus the morals are off the chart wrong.",Null,1,9,4 August 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Excellent premise to show how apes might have come to take over from humans.
","Last week my wife and I saw the newer Apes movie, 'Dawn of...' and while watching it, and getting a glimpse of Caesar's back-story, we realized we had never seen this one, 'Rise Of...'. So we watched it last night. As an overall impression I think this one is clearly a more interesting movie. It is about a scientist, played by James Franco, working to develop a type of virus that would repair brain cells. He had a particular interest as his dad living with him had already begun to develop dementia.The virus works but eventually the body develops autoimmune responses making its effect temporary, so he has to tailor a different virus.Meanwhile the apes used for research at his company get some of the virus and begin to exhibit signs of greatly enhanced intelligence. An incident causes them to put down all the apes but the scientist finds that one of the Chimp females had a newborn, with the green specs in his eyes, indicating he had inherited the intelligence.Bringing him home and naming him Caesar he progresses very rapidly with intelligence absent from other Chimps. So where the 'Dawn Of...' features the apes in their own colony in Muir Woods, eventually battling the humans in San Francisco, this one contains all the events that lead up to that, how the apes gained intelligence and how they escaped to form their own colony.Good movie!SPOILERS: Caesar (played well in motion-capture by Andy Serkis) ends up in a facility for apes outside San Francisco. He figures out that the serum his 'dad' was working on could give all the apes intelligence so he plans a break-out and theft to do that, then they all break out to go to Muir Woods, having to battle and defeat police on the Golden Gate Bridge to get there. Meanwhile we see that the last virus is harmful to humans, it gets transferred to the neighbor, an airline pilot, and as the movie ends we see a graphic depicting this virus being spread all over the world. In 'Dawn Of...' we learn the virus that made the apes smart also killed most of the Earth's population.",Null,3,5,20 December 2014
Cars," Great fun, with a nice story, and super good animation.
","In some parts while I am watching an animated movie, I like to close my eyes and listen, to pick out the voices. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Tony Shaloub, and George Carlin were easy. But Bonnie Hunt sounded just like Ellen Degeneres to me. Oh well, you can't win them all!In this movie there are no people, not even animated ones. All the characters are cars, trucks, tractors, scooters, etc. Each has its own look and personality, and as it gets older, it ages in voice and wisdom. This is state of the art animation. All the scenery looks as real as an animated movie can make it, even down to the patterns of reflections in the shiny car bodies.Owen Wilson voices the central character, Lightning McQueen, a rookie car hoping to win the yearly Piston Cup. The movie starts with the final race in Florida but an unfortunate development requires that they have one more race, a week later, in California. McQueen is good, but he has an inflated ego and doesn't want a pit boss.Paul Newman is great in everything, and here he is the town judge Doc Hudson. McQueen has gotten lost on his way to California, is caught speeding in this little community on Route 66, and must repair some damage before he is allowed to move along.Bonnie Hunt is the sexy Sally Carrera, and McQueen takes a liking to her. The funniest character is voiced by Larry The Cable Guy as Tow Mater the slow-witted tow truck that eventually befriends McQueen. There is a cute nighttime scene where Mater takes McQueen out to the fields where the tractors are asleep to do some 'tractor tipping' (like some boys do cow-tipping at night).The critic Ebert has a very complete and accurate review. This is a fun movie which also has a message about modern interstate highways cutting through for speed of travel, and in the process causing once thriving towns to become virtual ghost towns.SPOILERS. McQueen finally finishes repairing the road surface that he had damaged, makes it to California, and is trailing in the 200 lap final race. But Doc Hudson, former Piston Cup winner in 1951, 52, and 53 shows up, with headphones, and is McQueen's crew chief. With the help of some advice, quick tire changes, and some fancy driving, MQueen has the race won. But he sees the third competitor disabled in the infield, so McQueen loses the race by going to his aid, and becomes the hero in the process.",Null,1,2,14 December 2006
Avengers: Infinity War," Thanos only wants to destroy half the universe. Can the Avengers stop him?
","The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn't necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn't easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes. For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.Now I see there is a 'an untitled' Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.",Null,0,0,17 September 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Perhaps a bit overrated when it come out, still it is a very nice movie.
","As I write this review, 'Crouching Tiger' is at spot #18. As I look through the whole 'top 250', I think it belongs somewhere below #150. I own the DVD and it is a very nice one. The sound, the print, all beautiful. But the story is a very ordinary one. After a life of crime-fighting, the master wants to retire and set his sights upon the woman he never had time for before. A new warrior and an old nemesis show up, complicating things. Chases and fights, and a couple of plot twists later and you have this story. It has been told many times, in slightly different ways, in any number of films and books.What is unique here, is the setting in old China. The fighters reach a non-human plane which allows them to float in the air, or run up walls, and fight among the bamboo tops. Although done differently, it is not substantially removed from the fighting we see in such recent films as 'The Matrix', 'Charlie's Angels', or even 'The Mask of Zorro.' Not to say that any of these films are intentionally similar, but upon closer examination really are very similar, both in story elements and in fighting style. So, I give this one a rating of '8' of 10. It is one I will enjoy viewing many times, but it is not the 'greatest film ever' as so many reviewers feel.This is a movie, and I have no trouble with the 'gravity-defying' scenes. However, my biggest complaint is that the feet movements are not consistent with the rate of body movement and that makes it look fake. It seems that with all the trouble they went to for the special effects, they could have attended more to this issue.A word about the languages. The DVD allows a selecting of English dubbing, and I watched it that way the first time. Although it is very well done, the speech pattern is very consistent with the actors' mouth movements, it doesn't sound 'real.' It sounds like 'dubbing done in a studio', and detracted from the realism. The second time, I watched it in the native language, with English subtitles, and I found it much better that way.",Null,0,0,13 July 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino gives us his recollection of Hollywood in 1969, even though he was only 6 then..
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. Then I watched it again 4 days later. You get so much more after you know what to expect. With as much press this movie has received, including just winning the Golden Globe for Best Picture, I was skeptical, I was prepared for a letdown. But I wasn't, I thoroughly enjoyed and was entertained by its 2 hour and 40 minute running time.The year 1969 is memorable for a number of reasons, the moon landing, my finishing graduate school, the Chappaquiddick incident, my first daughter being born. And also Sharon Tate. The story here comes to a climax on August 9th, 1969 which is the day Tate was murdered by members of the Manson family. Anyone seeing this movie and not knowing that will likely be confused.The running story involves two fictional characters, Leonardo DiCaprio as somewhat famous TV Western actor Rick Dalton, and his old pal, almost like a brother, Brad Pitt as Dalton's stunt double, Cliff Booth, who also happens to be well-trained and well-equipped as an accomplished fighter. Dalton' career is on the decline, he is afraid he is on the verge of has-been, so he goes to Italy to make several spaghetti westerns.Cliff is getting less and less work, but doesn't appear to worry about it at all, happy to live frugally with his dog in a small trailer behind the seedy drive-in theater. He remains loyal to his friendship with Rick.Margot Robbie is the only other I will mention, she is good as Sharon Tate who, with her husband Roman Polanski, lives next door to Dalton. In his movie 'Inglourious Basterds' Tarantino writes a completely different story of Hitler in WW2, suffice to say his writing of the fate of Sharon Tate for this movie also departs significantly from history. Sort of a 'what if things had happened differently?'The only complaint I have is that so much of the dialog is filled with filthy language, not just an occasional F-bomb here and there but FILLED with it. That is Tarantino's style, I think he does it too much, but it is his movie. Even with that I find this to be an excellent and entertaining movie, deserving of its accolades. I watched it twice before I returned the BD to the library, the second viewing was as entertaining as the first.The extras on the disc are interesting also.",Null,3,6,9 January 2020
Behind The Candelabra," Roy Harold Scherer, Jr and W≈Çadziu Valentino Liberace.
","I remember when this movie came out, I convinced myself I didn't want to see it, I wanted to remember Liberace for the entertainer I saw many times on TV shows over the years. But last week I found the DVD on the shelves at my local public library and decided to see it.It is interesting, in one scene late in the movie we see headlines of the death, via complications of AIDS, of Roy Harold Scherer, Jr., better known to most of us as Rock Hudson. The world was mostly shocked when we found this hunk of a movie star was a homosexual in private life.It was not such a surprise to find Liberace followed suit a couple of years later in 1987. We knew he was flamboyant but he was an entertainer, a pianist, and few really cared.The story here is based on the book by Scott Thorson who is played by Matt Damon. Thorson quite accidentally when he was still 17 visited the home of Liberace and began an attachment that last a number of years. But Liberace always seemed to have his eye out for young, attractive men and the natural tension and arguments ensued.Michael Douglas is pretty good as Liberace, he does the best he can to imitate the entertainer's mannerisms and way of speaking. But Douglas has a particular type of gravelness in his voice that worked great in 'Romancing the Stone' but it bothered me all the way through this movie.It isn't a great movie but it is often entertaining and gives an up- close glimpse into the world of Liberace, at least from Thorson's viewpoint.",Null,0,1,25 May 2016
Gone Girl," Based on the book, did he or did he not kill his wife?
","We saw this highly anticipated movie on DVD at home. I was a bit hesitant at its almost 2 1/2 hours running time but it never seemed overly long.However when it was over it didn't quite feel genuine, even in the context of a fictional story. Something about the final scenes just didn't seem worth the long story that I had just watched. The basic premise is straightforward, a man comes home and his wife of 5 or so years isn't there and a glass-top table is overturned and broken, but it doesn't appear to be a burglary. His wife isn't home and he is unable to locate her so he calls police. They find evidence that leads them to believe there was a struggle and a pool of blood on the kitchen floor had been cleaned up. They begin to suspect the husband who initially cooperates with police but then hires a top-notch lawyer once it seems he is becoming the prime suspect. The man and the woman are both very flawed people. We find out about half-way into the movie exactly what happened, and the second half of the movie is to understand the 'why' and to see how things are resolved.In spite of the ongoing criticism of Ben Affleck, he is a fine actor and he is good here as Nick Dunne, the out-of-work author who also co-owns a local bar with his twin sister in this Missouri community (filmed in Cape Girardeau) on the banks of the Mississippi River. His wife is Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne.There are events and scenes that make you think but overall it didn't ring very true for me. Still it is an entertaining movie and I enjoyed it, but perhaps not as much as many fans.SPOILERS: Nick is devious, he has a very young 20-ish mistress on the side, but he is not a dangerous person. Amy is the crazy one, we see she had difficult issues previously with men, falsifying abuse reports. She suspects Nick is going to want a divorce and instead she plans to frame him with murder, her own murder, so before she disappears with a lot of cash and an untraceable car she creates a crime scene with her own blood, then cleans it up sloppily on purpose. She leaves a diary, and she tells us she will drown herself. But somewhere along the line she changes her mind, goes to see an old boyfriend, slashes his throat and kills him during sex, shows up back home with no apparent explanation but pregnant. So Nick appears to suck it up and stay with the crazy wife because they are going to have a baby.",Null,2,5,24 January 2015
Mr. Nobody," 'Sometimes they call me CRAFT ... can't remember a f#@king thing.'
","I missed this one when it came out in 2009, in fact I don't even remember hearing anything about it. I recently found it as a new addition in the Netflix streaming movies library. Superb picture and sound, even streaming over the internet.This multi-national film production (yes, shot on film) begins somewhat oddly, showing a pigeon in a cage, with a block of wood on one side and some food suspended out of reach in the corner. It seems as if the pigeon is thinking, and figures out if he pecks at the block to move it near the corner he can reach the food. And he does. The 'pigeon superstition experiment.' And this is associated with the theme of the movie, we make decisions to do certain things and that has wide-reaching effect on a number of other things.The movie cuts backwards and forwards many times as Nemo Nobody, the last mortal human in a New York hospital is being watched, reality show style as he turns 117 on February 9th, 2092, and is being interviewed. The many cuts are made when Nemo was either a small boy, a teenager, or a young adult in different situations. Even in different family situations with different wives and different children.How can all these be possible? How can each be real? Or is anything real? It is difficult to say exactly what the story is here, but for me I found watching it mesmerizing. The images, the whimsy, the fantastical story-telling. Maybe the way film and movies were received when they first began over 100 years earlier.I can't say enough about Jared Leto, who not only plays the recognizable Nemo as a young adult, but also the 117 yr-old Nemo in the hospital. With appropriate makeup and a change in his vocal quality he really comes across as the very old man.Key actresses in his adult life are Sarah Polley as Elise, Diane Kruger as Anna, and Linh Dan Pham as Jean, all wives of his in one version or the other.Other key characters are Rhys Ifans as Father Nemo (actually father Nobody) and Natasha Little as Mother Nemo (mother Nobody). I give this film really high marks, I am certain I will watch it again. But I also recognize some will not enjoy this sort of non-linear story- telling.SPOILERS: At one point when Nemo was a boy of about 9 his parents decided to split up. At the train station he is standing with his father, watching the train pull away with his mother at the train door. He doesn't know what to do, should he go with mom or stay with dad. As long as he fails to decide, then every future possibility is as good as any other, and this is what is depicted during the 2+ hour movie. It touches on such things as the butterfly effect, the Big Bang, time, and entropy.",Null,0,2,4 April 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino is not for every taste, but for lots of blood and interesting story-telling, he can be fun.
","This movie is a tribute to the old Western genre, where the gunfighter is on a mission, and it often involves recovering his woman. As the movie begins with sweeping scenes and men on horseback, there is a very forceful song being sung, reminiscent of the ones Frankie Laine did back in the 1950s, for movies such as the original (1957) '3:10 to Yuma' and 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' (1957). Christoph Waltz is dentist Dr. King Schultz, but as we soon learn he hasn't actually practiced dentistry in years, his profession is bounty hunter. After we see him in action, in a slick barroom scene which ends in his shooting a wanted man, he heads for a bigger bounty in Mississippi. The problem is he doesn't know what the men look like, and he figures, correctly, that they have taken assumed names.So he needs help, and he looks for a certain member of a chain gang of slaves. He finds him in Jamie Foxx as Django , 'The 'D' is silent.' Django knows them, but also seeks to be reunited with his wife, who was sold as a slave to a different owner.They eventually find that plantation and slave owner, Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie, and his place is called 'Candieland.' The wife of Django is Kerry Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft. (She had been raised by a German, and 'Broomhilda' is a corruption of the fictional German character 'Brunhilda'.) Candie is pretty easily fooled into thinking the two men wanted to buy a mandingo fighter (no real evidence that this sport ever existed) but his old slave Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen suspects something is up and correctly figures out Django and Broomhilda know each other, and that the real mission is to take her away. All this results in about the biggest, bloodiest gunfight one will ever see.I will grant that Tarantino's films have their moments, but his insistence on violence and gore surpasses what most viewers welcome in a movie. Even though I knew it was all fake, and over the top, I still cringed. And maybe that is what he wanted the audience to do.",Null,3,4,26 May 2013
Drive," Gosling is stoic in this action crime story where there aren't too many good guys.
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect in 'Drive' but it sure wasn't what I got. Continuously interesting, mainly for the character low-key Gosling plays his ultimately very dangerous character.Ryan Gosling is Driver, that's all we ever know him as. He works in a garage, he works as a stunt driver for movie-making, and perhaps most lucrative he works as a driver for criminals. He doesn't care to know what they are doing, he just gives them 5 minutes to get out, then get back in. With his planning, driving skills and souped-up plain Jane car he reliably gets his passengers to safety. But that is only to introduce his character. The movie really becomes about his friendship with the young lady down the hall of his 4th floor apartment building. She is British actress Carey Mulligan as Irene. We (and Driver) find out she has a young son whose dad is in prison. Driver has a kind heart and becomes a surrogate dad until the real dad come home. And when he does, with a difficult task escaping the criminal element that kept him safe in prison, Driver offers to help him, to pull a big job that will forgive his debt. Albert Brooks, usually the funny man, is a bad guy here as Bernie Rose. And his equally bad guy pal is Ron Perlman as Nino .Not a movie for everyone, it has some very graphic violence, but overall very interesting.SPOILERS: They do a job to steal $1Million that is being held temporarily at a pawn shop. Problem is the money is east coast mob money and a set-up gets the dad killed. The rest of the movie Driver has to figure out how to save himself and especially Irene and her son. He eventually has a show-down encounter with Bernie in a parking lot, Driver gets stabbed but is able to kill Bernie. He leaves all the money there next to Bernie, the presumption being when the east coast crime guys find out about the money they won't be after anyone anymore.",Null,0,2,7 March 2012
Aladdin," Pleasant enough, entertaining presentation of the Aladdin story.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Costumes are very colorful and came out great on BluRay. Plus really good sound.It is the familiar Aladdin story, brought to Disney life in the 1992 animated version where Robin Williams voices the Genie. Here Will Smith plays the genie and while he is OK most of the time he also is overly annoying at times. Plus he has a couple of songs and simply is only barely passable as a singer. His 'rap' at one point is much better.I was really impressed with British actress Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine. She is very attractive, sort of a younger Sarah Michelle Gellar face with a tan, an acceptable actress, but with a beautiful voice as a singer.So, while the story is familiar to most of us it is still a nicely entertaining 2 hours. The disc has several interesting extras.",Null,0,0,3 November 2019
The Theory of Everything," Fine movie with Redmayne's award-winning performance.
","I will always have to wonder how this movie is viewed and received by non-Scientific viewers. I am a Scientist, of Hawking's vintage. My main areas are Math, Chemistry and Physics. So I went into viewing this movie already pretty familiar with Hawking and his works. Eddie Redmayne of course won the best actor Oscar for his performance as Hawking and it is fully deserved. Felicity Jones is fine as his girlfriend who stands by him when his illness is diagnosed and becomes Mrs Jane Hawking. The story here starts in 1963 when Hawking is a new graduate student in Physics and is having difficulty declaring a field of study for his PhD. But he finally gets inspired and writes a thesis on the origin of space and time as a singularity that became the Big Bang. Of course later in life he said his new theory goes against that earlier one.The thing about this type of Physics, there is no good experimental evidence for most of them, making it difficult to know how valuable their contributions might be, aside from his best-selling book 'A Brief History of Time.' As the movie unfolds we don't get a good feel for the time but in the end there are Hawking children in their late teens so it must have been up to about 1990 or so. We see Hawking's physical health degrade, his being fitted with various devices that allows him to communicate.Good movie.",Null,0,1,23 March 2015
Bolt," Very entertaining animated film.
","I saw this on a flight out west, so picture and sound are impossible to judge and comment on, but I was able to enjoy the cute story. It is an old one, about the bond between two people being stronger than the situations around them. The two 'people' in this story are a little girl and a dog.As the movie begins we see a fantastically powerful and faithful dog named Bolt (voiced by John Travolta). As the scene goes on we eventually realize that we are seeing the filming of a TV series on a set. We further see that Bolt doesn't really have any special powers but the scenes are set up to fool even Bolt, and he thinks (as a dog may be able to 'think') that he really is a super dog.As script fate would have it, Bolt finds himself in the real world, and accidentally in a shipping box headed across the country to New York. There he escapes and soon finds out his super powers are not super anymore. Much of the middle of the movie involves Bolt's escapades in trying to get back to Hollywood, and partner up with Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) who he thinks is his real owner instead of just an actress.Penny also considers herself more than just an actress, and missed Bolt, while studio bosses try to convince her that a different dog can play Bolt, since 'the show must go on.' SPOILERS: Bolt eventually makes it back, with the help of a cat and a hamster in a plastic bubble. At the studio Bolt makes it just in time for a big fire in the soundstage, one that the fake Bolt runs from. Meanwhile the real Bolt rushes in and saves Penny. They are reunited, more than just two actors.",Null,3,3,24 April 2009
Frozen," Won the Oscar for best animated film, my 4-yr-old grandson could watch it every day!
","My 'almost' 4-yo-old grandson was visiting when this movie came out on DVD & Blu-Ray, and his mom told us this was his favorite movie, they had already seen it 4 times in the theater. So I bought the combo pack, DVD plus Blu-Ray for all of $20. We sent the DVD home with him, and kept the Blu-Ray for ourselves. Just a side note, as cheap as BD players are now, well under $100, anyone who really enjoys movies at home should get one, the picture and sound are so much better. As good as DVD is, I thought I'd never say that, but it is true.This movie is based on the old Snow Queen story but with some changes for modern audiences. It won the Oscar for best animated movie. The two young sisters lose their parents, King and Queen of this mythical kingdom, and when they finally grow up to young adulthood, the older of the two is to become Queen. But she has a power from birth, the ability to cause a freeze, or even thrown ice bolts, which immediately causes issues. To save her people she runs away, but leaving the small kingdom in a bad way, they need to be defrosted. So the younger, wanting desperately to accomplish something, throws all caution to the wind to find her sister and save the kingdom. She finds that only true love will be able to save the kingdom. Ultimately she finds that in the bond between the two sisters.The voice acting, with the occasional song, is excellent across the board. Kristen Bell is the younger sister, Anna, and she displays a really nice singing voice. Not too surprising since she grew up doing musical theater. Idina Menzel, who is even more experienced in musical theater is the older sister, Elsa. Jonathan Groff is Kristoff, the ice salesman with the sled and the moose. But to me the best was Josh Gad as the little snowman Olaf. As we have seen in other animated movies, like 'Despicable Me' with the Minions, the addition of a cute, interesting minor character can make the whole movie more fun. Gad (who had a short turn as the President's son in a TV series) has such a variety of vocal inflections and even a stellar singing voice simply makes the little snowman the most fun character in the whole movie. Overall a very nice movie, even for adults, and the picture and sound on the Blu-Ray are super.",Null,4,10,23 March 2014
2012," For its genre, a world-wide destruction movie, it's pretty good.
","Everyone going in to see this movie should already know the reference to 2012, the ancient Mayan calendar supposedly predicted the end of the world as we know it would happen around December 21st, 2012. Wow! That's just a little more than 2 years from now. I'd better get that date with Heather Locklear (inside joke with my wife) before it is too late.This story starts in 2009 when astrogeophysists monitoring what they monitor notice the largest and most powerful solar flares ever. Then in India, in old copper mines over 2 miles below the surface of the Earth are measuring neutrino activity never before seen. They mention that these neutrinos have 'mutated' such that their energy is acting like intense microwaves, heating up the interior of the Earth.The story moves to 2010, then into the near future 2011 and finally 2012. During this time they predict then witness increased volcanic activity and movement of plates, with the ground splitting open in ways they did not predict. All this gets them to alert the POTUS, and in turn the other world leaders, to plan some action.Logically we know all this cannot be true, ancient Mayans could not have predicted unusual solar activity and the resulting destruction. but if we suspend our disbelieve for 2 1/2 hours, and just watch it, there is much there to be entertained with. If watching your Earth destroyed can be entertaining.John Cusack is Jackson Curtis, an author. His role in the story is to have him and his children in jeopardy so we can see if they can escape to safety. Amanda Peet is his estranged wife Kate Curtis. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Adrian Helmsley, the head astrophysicist on the case. Thandie Newton is Laura Wilson, the daughter of the POTUS.The most interesting character is Woody Harrelson as Charlie Frost, and we first see him at Yellowstone as he awaits its eruption. Seems he had collected evidence over the years that this was coming, he broadcast a radio show from his traveling motor home, and he claimed he had maps of the location of ships that were being built to save a few hundred thousand people when the doomsday came.Danny Glover is fine as the President of the USA, Thomas Wilson. Just a step down from Morgan Freeman who is usually God.My wife and I enjoyed the movie, decent story and really good destruction special effects.SPOILERS: As it turned out several (at least 8)very large vessels, modern arks of sort, capable of holding hundreds of thousands plus animals, were being built in the mountains of China, so that when the predicted giant tsunamis from the east came they would float above the destruction and eventually re-settle the Earth once the destruction had subsided. The 'road trip' part of the story was to see if Jackson Curtis, his 2 kids, his wife, and a few others could find and then sneak aboard the ark to save their own skins. They make it, barely. The result of all the geologic activity was the north and south poles flipped, the south pole was now in Wisconsin, and a range in South Africa was now the tallest in the world. Plus many others, too numerous to mention. Now all the survivors were preparing to start new lives in this strange new world.",Null,1,3,14 May 2010
The Number 23," We enjoyed the mystery.
","Before we watched '23' two different people we know told us, 'I began watching it but just couldn't stick with it.' So we were apprehensive. But we stuck with it, and it turned out to be a fine mystery movie.Jim Carrey is Walter Sparrow and, through a coincidence, gets hold of a book which dwells on the number 23, the numbers of things which either happened on the 23rd, or the combination of numbers yielded 23. (Of course, this sort of thinking also has to disregard all the times that they do NOT add up to 23.) Anyway, as he reads this book he is startled by how closely it parallels his own life.Virginia Madsen is good as his wife, Agatha Sparrow. In much of the first half of the movie we are shown what appear to be dream sequences, with different character names, but played by the same actors.All in all a fine mystery, well made.MAJOR SPOILERS: As we get to the end we find that the book had actually been written by Walter Sparrow, and he had undergone much therapy to put the past behind him.",Null,0,4,5 October 2007
Ghost Rider," Not great, but very interesting.
","I understand that this movie is derived from a comic book, one that I am not familiar with. So, I just watched it for what it is.

When he was much younger his dad, also a stunt rider, became very ill and was in danger of dying soon. Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles, the devil, shows up and gives Johnny a quick offer, sell him his soul and his dad would become well.As one might imagine, all did not work out well, and as an adult has become the devil's 'bounty hunter'. The special effects are done pretty well.MAJOR SPOILERS. The devil tricked Johnny (surprise, surprise!!) and even though his dad was cured of his aliment, the next day he had an accident and died. The climax of the movie is Johnny's quest to defeat the devil and his henchmen.",Null,0,1,20 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Fitting completion of the X-Men trilogy.
","The words in the movie's title, 'The Last Stand', pretty well sums up what it is all about. In the first installment we learned about the mutants and how they came about. 'X2' was a story about enemies of the mutants. This 3rd one, and presumably the last one (until maybe 20 to 40 years from now), is about a scientist who develops a serum to convert a mutant to a 'normal' human being. And this further leads to a big conflict between the good mutants (the X-men) and the evil mutants under the leadership of Magneto. Definitely a movie for action junkies.The movie has its usual cast of characters, with Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe/Storm, Ian McKellen as Eric Lensherr/Magneto, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey/Phoenix, Anna Paquin as Marie/Rogue, Rebecca Romijn (my favorite) as Raven Darkholme/Mystique, and Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Two great newcomers are Kelsey Grammar as the blue Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast, and Ellen Page (of Hard Candy fame) as Kitty Pryde.SPOILERS FOLLOW. One by one, many of the mutants die. An early one was Professor Charles Xavier, and continuation of the school comes into question. But in the end, it will continue. In the big battle, on Alcatraz Island, converted to a Government office, soldiers use plastic guns with the serum that will convert mutants to ordinary people, to escape Magneto's control of metal. But in a great use of CGI, he rips the Golden Gate bridge from its foundations and deposits one end on the island, the other at the SF wharf, to provide a bridge for his men. Wolverine gets the best of Magneto, when Dr Hank McCoy is able to sneak up behind him and inject him with serum. The last scene, former Magneto is seen playing solo chess in a park in SF.",Null,0,2,14 October 2006
Hellboy," 'There really are things that go 'bump' in the night. We 'bump' back!'
","'Hellboy' is another in the recent series of comic book superheros turned movie superheros. Although I am not a reader of 'Hellboy' comics, it appears that the movie is very faithful to the comic book, and joins other such movies a 'Spiderman 1 and 2' and 'X-Men 1 and 2' as excellent, action-filled entertainment. Ron Perlman has been a superb choice for the role of Hellboy, and as the DVD 'extras' show, it took about 4 hours each shooting day to apply the makeup. In fact, the 2.5 hour 'making of' feature, which is delivered in 40 chapters, is one of the more comprehensive I have seen, and will be greatly appreciated by all 'Hellboy' fans. The great British actor John Hurt becomes Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm, who raises Hellboy and becomes his father. The other character of note is Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair. Hellboy has affection for Liz, and this sets up a key scene near the end. Good movie, mostly well-done special effects.SPOILERS FOLLOW, be warned if you continue reading. The story starts in 1944 in Scotland, the evil guys are trying to destroy the Earth, create a portal which is quickly destroyed by Dr. Bruttenholm and gang, but not before something travels from the 'darkside.' It is a red baby with a tail which they lure with a candy bar, and eventually raise to be Hellboy, fighter of evil in present time, for the secret agency that 'bumps back' to those which go bump in the night. Hellboy is super strong, from his heritage is not harmed by fire or electrical shock, and appears to be indestructible. The evil guys are back to try again to destroy the Earth, Hellboy must stop them. Lots of action in many different places, in the climax Hellboy has to make a choice to save Liz, he begins to go over to the dark side, his horns grow to full length, but his pal reminds him, 'You have a choice, your father gave it to you', which could also be interpreted as the choice God gives us. Hellboy snaps off his horns, destroys the evil guys, the movie ends with Hellboy and Liz together.",Null,1,4,15 December 2004
P.S. I Love You," Much good, some mediocre, but overall a good movie.
","I went into viewing this movie without any idea what the summary was and I recommend others do too. It is more interesting discovering it as it happens rather than know what will happen. So, if you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, read no more and just see it.Hilary Swank is Holly Kennedy, very happily married to Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera) as Gerry Kennedy. They had met maybe 10 to 12 years earlier when she was visiting Ireland. But their relationship has hit a big snag, he is ill and dying. Except for flashbacks, he is only in the very opening scene.But he left an intricate plan in place after his death, one that Holly knew nothing about. It involved letters, a cake, some gifts, and a plan to help her get past his death and on with her life. It even took her to Ireland and her in-laws.Both Swank and Butler are good in their roles, as well as Kathy Bates who plays Holly's mother. However Lisa Kudrow as Denise and Gina Gershon as Sharon, both good friends of Holly, were very annoying to me, especially Denise. Opposite to that sentiment is Harry Connick Jr. as Daniel Connelly who works for Holly's mother. Daniel is a good person but by his own admission has a social defect, he cannot filter his thoughts and says just what he is thinking. This causes some uneasy moments. He gets sweet on Holly after Gerry dies, but she just finds him to be a 'good friend', the kiss of death. However, they do get to kiss before the movie is over, and both agree it feels like kissing a sibling, so both are happy with the friendship. Connick Jr.'s role is my favorite of the movie.Also very interesting is an extra on the DVD where the author of the book recounts how it came about. She wrote it while she was still in college, only because she had this idea in her head. There was no thought of a 'best seller' or an eventual movie. As one might imagine she is very articulate, but also a very attractive young woman, with movie-star looks. Her own story is great.",Null,0,0,13 June 2008

I rate this a very strong '9' and it certainly deserves to be in any top list of movies all-time.To those several hundred of you who rated this movie a '1', I just have one thing to say - all of you are truly movie idiots, and wouldn't know a good movie if you actually saw one.",Null,1,8,7 July 2000
Room," What if your whole life experience were in the same 11X11 room?
","Saw this on BluRay at home. First-rate picture and sound.This movie can't really be commented on without the SPOILERS so anyone reading this before seeing 'Room' might want to defer.The movie is roughly divided into two halves, the first half with the mom and son in the small 11X11 room with only a skylight, no windows, where they have been together for almost 5 years. The captor brings them food and supplies, he has sex with her regularly, with the boy in a closet. The boy still nurses, no doubt as a natural form of birth-control. We witness the boy's 5th birthday.The second half examines the trauma of someone seeing the outside world for the first time after studying about it from books, drawings and TV images. Encountering people, encountering wide open spaces. Plus the trauma of a young woman returning to her real world and family after perhaps the most trying ordeal a young girl can go through, kidnapped as a teenager, kept in a storage shed, having a baby, raising that baby to a little boy.Brie Larson is Joy, known by the little boy only as Ma. She won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Jacob Tremblay, who was probably 7 during filming, is Jack just turning 5. The book and then movie were clearly inspired by the several news stories over the recent past where something similar happened in real life.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A really fine movie, Stiller and Wiig in non-comedic roles.
","I am not a big Ben Stiller fan, but I DO enjoy many of his movies. With that as background, I went into watching this one with a bit of apprehension, but overall I found this to be one of the better movies I have seen recently. And I see about 250 a year.The story here is based on LIFE magazine, known since the 1800s as a weekly magazine with an emphasis on photojournalism. Many of the covers are iconic. It ceased to be a weekly in 1972, and has been published in various forms since then. Now we are seeing the days leading up to its final cover, the magazine going solely on-line.Ben Stiller is mild-mannered Walter Mitty, based on James Thurber's 1939 short story, 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', about a man who had a very vivid fantasy life. In this movie he is turning 42 as a new manager comes in to see that the operation of publishing LIFE magazine gets shut down orderly and people are fired. But Mitty is the manager of 'negative assets', the man who for years has received, examined, and cataloged photo negatives that come in, including those chosen for the covers.Walter is single and lonely and joins an online matchmaking service, and he has his eye on pretty and sweet Kristen Wiig as new LIFE employee, Cheryl Melhoff. (Her character's name is a tribute to Walter Mithoff, the real person that inspired Thurber to name his Mitty character.) But he has an ongoing difficulty getting things going.Another key character is played by Sean Penn as a famous but very elusive professional photographer. He sends some negatives and tells that 'negative 25' is an iconic image and it should be used for the last LIFE cover. But when Walter examines all the images, frame #25 is missing. That prompts him to set out to find the photographer and ultimately image #25. This leads him to such places as Greenland, Iceland, and the Himalayas. One of the things that makes this movie so enjoyable, and my wife echoed this sentiment, Stiller and Wiig do not play comedic characters, their roles are serious but sweet. So the whole movie has many humorous parts in it, but done in a very entertaining way. Also directed by Ben Stiller.SPOILERS: So Walter Mitty gets to live out adventures that perhaps are even better than his fantasy life, and in the end he does get the girl. When he finds the photographer, in the Himalayas, he tells Walter the image was inside the inscribed wallet he gave Walter. It had been thrown into mom's (Shirley MacLaine) garbage in frustration but she retrieved it. Inside was the negative, which became the image for the final issue. It was a photo of Walter himself sitting outside the TIME building, looking at a contact sheet of negatives, doing his job for the magazine.",Null,2,2,12 June 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Second installment, great DVD, story a bit muddled, a movie mainly for 'Ring' fans.
","Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary...'As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the 'Ringheads' out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. 'I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the 'Ringheads' want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a joy to watch.  Just too long and boring in spots.",Null,8,12,18 May 2004
Schindler's List," One of the great films of the 20th century.
","I'll start with an 'aside.' What is a 'film' and what is a 'movie.' I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew 'films' so that the director and editor can create a 'movie'. But I have a difficult time thinking of 'Schindler's List' as a 'movie.' I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, 'Schindler's List' is certainly a 'film', one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.But this 'film', while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a 'connected' man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters.",Null,30,51,12 December 2004
Across the Universe," A story told through the songs of the Beatles.
","It is an interesting concept, make up a story and tell it through a series of popular Beatles songs. The characters will sometimes have the same name as the character in the song, like 'Jude' and 'Lucy'.The period is the 1960s when the Beatles were at the height of their popularity and there was turmoil in the USA, including race riots and discontent over the Viet Nam conflict. Evan Rachel Wood, who sings very well, is Lucy Carrigan, about to graduate from high school. Her sweetheart goes off into the military.Brit Jim Sturgess is Jude, in England, who finds out that his father is an American GI from the war, working at Princeton University, where he travels to look for him. 'Just so we will both know about each other.'Brit Joe Anderson plays Lucy's brother Max Carrigan, who becomes best friends with Jude. Jude and Lucy eventually develop a love relationship.I was a college student in the 1960s when the Beatles invaded America. While I like them and agree that their's was a permanent influence on popular music, I was never a Beatles fanatic. So for me this movie was just 'OK.' The story was contrived to make use of the lyrics and the characters in the sings, and that works pretty well. There are some great visuals and all the characters are competent to good singers.",Null,0,1,16 March 2008
The Lion King," If you are a Hyena, don't ever tell a Warthog that he is chubby.
","My wife and I watched this at home on Blu Ray from our public library, as such the sound and picture are as detailed as anything available.We enjoyed the movie, it is the standard Lion King fable, partly inspired by Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', but it features a new type of animation that results in very real-looking animals and scenery.As much as we enjoyed the movie, I even more enjoyed the 21-minute 'extra' that showed how they made the movie. Everything was created and stored digitally, and the filmmakers used a technique where they were all in a large room, wearing virtual reality goggles, and were able to examine scenes and action together as if they were on a real location observing real animals. It is a cutting-edge type of filmmaking and is why the final product looks so real.",Null,0,1,3 January 2020
The Incredibles," 'Interesting how you begin to care about the story and characters in an animated movie.' (my wife, half-way through the movie)
","An unqualified 'we liked it' for the movie, 'The Incredibles.' It opens with pseudo-newsreel interview footage with the three main characters to show, as the writer/director tells it, the human side of these characters before we see them in wild action. This is a comic book movie, in a time when there are very many superheros, and it focuses on one of them, Mr. Incredible, also known as Bob Parr in his street identity. The animation is superb, the script is superb, the voice-acting is uniformly superb. Especially Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Helen Parr/Elastigirl, Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best/Frozone, and the one I think was the very best, Jason Lee as Buddy Pine/Syndrome. Saw it on DVD, second disk has many extras.SPOILERS. In opening sequences we see Mr. Incredible in action, saving a cat, then stopping robbers with the uprooted tree, saving a man from suicide, and keeping a commuter 'el' train from falling through a hole made by a bomb, all on his way to his wedding. But newspaper headlines tell us citizens begin to sue the various superheros, costing the government much money, so they are put in the superhero relocation program, where they are expected to become regular citizens. The opening of the movie has Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl getting married, and we cut to 15 years later, Bob Parr is working as an insurance salesman, but once a week he and Lucius Best go 'bowling' but in reality are in a car monitoring police radio, just itching to get back into saving people. The grown up Buddy Pine has become Syndrome, out to destroy all the old superheros so he, himself, could become the superhero everyone worships. So on a remote island Mr. Incredible ends up, fighting for his life, when his wife and two children (boy is very fast, girl can become invisible and also generate force fields), where they all team to defeat Syndrome's plan.",Null,2,4,23 March 2005
The Mist," Is it about monsters in the mist, or about the monsters in our psyche?
","Set in Maine and filmed in Shreveport, 'The Mist' is nominally about strange monsters in the thick mist that engulfs a small community one day. But most of the movie takes place in the local supermarket where a strange cross-section of the town's population happen to be trapped, trying to elude the evil things inside the mist.Thomas Jane is the cool one, and dad, David Drayton. He is an artist, drawing movie posters, and with a college education, something some of the locals are jealous of.At the other end of the spectrum is Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody, a religious freak who sees this crisis as God's punishment for bad human behavior.As the crisis deepens and people die, the people in the store become divided into two camps, those who think like David and those who think like Carmody.But the movie is only thinly about the monsters, and where they came from. It is more a study of human nature and how people react to a crisis and to each other. In many respects it is 'Lord of the Flies' among adults.Mostly interesting, but often too exaggerated to be taken as a serious story.SPOILERS: As David heads towards town after an overnight storm, to get supplies and to fix his broken studio window, he notices many military vehicles 'coming off the mountain' in a hurry. As it all turns out they had been doing some experimenting and had opened a 'portal' to another dimension that let some strange creatures through. It was these that were hiding in the mist and endangering everyone. In the end David and 4 others were stranded in the mist when his vehicle ran out of fuel. Not wanting to subject them to the monsters, he shot everyone, even his son. But then as the mist started to lift finds that the military has achieved the upper hand, all died for no reason and David was on his way to insanity.",Null,1,3,30 September 2008
Stardust," Interesting romantic fantasy diversion, with lots of stars!
","As the movie opens we learn that England is separated from a fantasy world by a Wall, which has one obvious large gap. People from England are not supposed to cross, and there is a guard, but one man manages to and has an overnight fling. Exactly 9 months later the old guard brings him a basket left at the wall for him. It contains a newborn boy that he names Tristan. The story resumes 18 years later and Charlie Cox has grown into Tristan Thorn. He is smitten with a local beauty (Sienna Miller) and says he would do anything to gain her hand in marriage. They see a shooting star, that lands into the fantasy nation, and he vows to retrieve it for her. The star turns out to be Claire Danes as Yvaine, who contains the secret to eternal life. Most of the rest of the movie involves Tristan trying to bring this 'star' back to the object of his affection, but in the process he and Yvaine begin to fall in love.The movie is fun and funny, with what amounts to an all-star cast. There is no message different from the standard one, but it is fun to watch. The critic Ebert has a complete review.",Null,1,2,20 December 2007
I Am Legend," Interesting movie about man-made plague that sweeps the world.
","During this film we see clips of an interview with a doctor who explains how they have used genetic engineering to cure cancer. A 100% success rate. However, a few years later this turns into a man-made plague that kills virtually everyone on Earth.Will Smith is Robert Neville, who apparently has developed an immunity to both air-borne and contact-borne microbes responsible for the plague. He is virtually alone in NYC, living in his home turned fortress, and with a lab in the basement. His mission is to develop a serum that will cure this curse. He experiments with rats.As in many other movies of this genre, there is a large group of infected who did not die, but developed a rabid manifestation of the illness, and who could not stand the light so only came out at night, as Vampires might. We see Neville capture one of them, a female that he bound in his lab to experiment on.Much of the middle of the movie shows Neville as he goes about on his daily hunts for food and other supplies that may be left over in the various buildings. At night he barricades himself into his home for protection.He also broadcasts a repeating message daily, if anyone hears him he will meet them at a certain place at high noon. As the Castaway in 'Cast Away' had 'Wilson' to keep him sane, Neville has his dog, Sam, short for Sanamtha. But he seems to be going crazy anyway. Alice Braga as Anna and her young son eventually do turn up, and Neville doesn't trust it, he doesn't believe anyone is alive. But she knows of a safe place in the Vermont countryside where survivors are going. She wants him and his dog to go with them. While this isn't a great movie, it certainly IS entertaining, and sometimes a bit scary. Will Smith does a fine job.SPOILERS: The zombies aren't entirely stupid, and figure out where Neville lives. At night they break in, and corner Neville and Anna in the lab. He tells Anna and her son to hide in a safe corner, and to wait until daylight to travel. When the zombies finally break in, he sets off a high-power grenade which kills him but all the zombies also. But not before he draws a vial of blood from the captured zombie woman who finally was showing signs of reversing the illness. As the movie ends we see her and her son arriving at the safe location, and presumably the blood will help develop a vaccine that will eventually restore the world.",Null,0,1,24 April 2008
A Quiet Place," Pretty well done, dangerous monsters can hear but can't see.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip, she doesn't care for scary movies.John Krasinski wrote, directed, and has a lead role here as Lee Abbott. His real life wife, Emily Blunt, is his wife Evelyn Abbott. They also have a deaf daughter and two young sons.As the movie opens we see shadowy figures quietly moving through what appears to be an abandoned store. Then we see that the whole town appears dead, but this family has a home and small farm outside town. On the screen flashes brief messages, like '89 days' or '492 days', presumably since the alien monsters attacked and killed most people. These monsters are very fast and vicious, but they can't see, only detecting possible prey by hearing sounds. So everyone is very quiet, conversing mostly in sign language.Of course there wouldn't be much story if the people remained quiet and undetected, and if the monsters never were able to find them. So things do develop and as the movie ends it sets itself up for a possible sequel. The family does find the monster's 'Kryptonite', very high pitched sound.And in fact the IMDb has a listing for the sequel now in pre production. Suitably interesting movie.",Null,1,1,30 July 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Mostly a let-down, a pretty simple story attached to too many chases.
","It is a bit depressing, seems too many movies nowadays just substitute lots of chase scenes to compensate for lazy scripts. This one fills that bill. The actors are fine, there just isn't a lot to work with.To start with the definition, LEGACY - ' something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past ' . So, since this is a Bourne legacy, it must pertain to something Jason Bourne 'transmitted.' I suppose that makes sense, of a sort, after Bourne escaped in the last movie, a decision was made to eradicate the remaining 9 in the experimental operative program.In fact, as the writer/director explains in the extra on the DVD, the first part of this movie (in fictional time) overlaps with the last part of the last Bourne movie, that is why they had a short reference to Jason Bourne escaping.Jeremy Renner is the experimental operative, Aaron Cross, that this story focuses on. He is out in the Alaska snowy wilderness in a training exercise when he is being hunted down from Washington by use of a remotely controlled, weaponized drone. But he manages to figure out what is happening in time to escape unharmed. This just intensifies the chase. The chase is being led by Edward Norton as Retired Col. Eric Byer, USAF. Now I like Norton, but here I never found him believable in that role.Cross eventually crosses paths with Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing , a principal investigator in the experimental program. They forge a bond and together travel the world attempting to get him reverted to normal.As I said, there are too many long chase scenes trying to compensate for a mediocre story, and the biggest disappointment to me was the very last one. A super operative has been pressed into action to hunt down Cross, and he does, but they are involved in a motorcycle chase. I was looking forward to some sort of fantastic final hand-to-hand combat, but no ... the super operative simply crashes into a steel post and obliterates himself. It was a good result, for Cross, but a bit anticlimactic.",Null,0,2,20 January 2013
22 Jump Street," Mostly filmed in New Orleans, only about 10% of it is actually funny.
","OK, this is not the type of movie I enjoy, but my public library bought the BluRay so I felt compelled to see it, especially now that I am laid up for a couple of weeks from foot surgery. Come on, golf season!Anyway if you look at the IMDb votes distribution (I always do) you see that boys and girls under 18 give it the highest ratings. The movie is silly, goofy, the partners are a bumbling pair of police placed in college to help solve the drug-related murder of one of the coeds. What really ruins it for me is the pervasive filthy language and impolite sexual references. That is usually a sign of uninspired script writing, as is the case here.Jonah Hill as Schmidt and Channing Tatum as Jenko are the undercover cops. Both of them are actually pretty good actors in the right roles, but here it seems their only interest is collecting a paycheck. And it did pretty well world-wide returning much more than its cost.My favorites in the whole movie are Kenny and Keith, The Lucas Brothers, as Keith & Kenny Yang. They explain their dad is Asian and their mom is black. Identical twins they are just great together and all their parts are very funny. I had never heard of them before but they apparently have been in one or two TV series.My second favorite part is about the first 2/3 of the movie is shot in New Orleans, including the area of St Charles Avenue near Tulane University, and probably some campus shots there.And finally, the third favorite was the ending credits where Jump Streets 23, 24, 25, and on to Jump Street 2121 are depicted in various unusual placements for the two partners. The ending credits show way more humor than anything in the actual movie.A silly movie that seems to be what the youngest generations want these days, but not particularly entertaining for the more mature movie watchers.",Null,0,2,4 January 2015
School of Rock," Jack Black is a gifted comedic actor, 'The School of Rock' is a hoot!
","As we find out on the DVD 'extras', Mike White wrote this script for his friend, Jack Black, who is a rock music junkie, and who also sings in his own band. So Black is totally in his element here, more ways than one, and it shows with the ease that he carries this movie. He is probably playing himself before receiving big paychecks for major movie roles. In this movie, he is a struggling rock musician who gets a job as a substitute teacher to make a few bucks, then proceeds to teach rock music to the kids, his principal, played perfectly by Joan Cusack, oblivious to his daily routine. Of note is that hundreds of musical children aged 10 or 11, non-actors, were auditioned for the roles of the students, and they played their own instruments in the movie. As did Jack Black, who also has quite a good singing voice when he isn't acting too crazy. Good, entertaining movie. DVD has very interesting extras involving the selection of the kids and the making of the movie.SPOILERS ABOUND in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, you may want to quit reading NOW!! Black is kicked off the band he started, is freeloading on his friend (played by writer Mike White), whose girlfriend is encouraging him to evict Black. So he impersonates his friend to get a substitute teaching job paying $650 weekly. Not interested in teaching, he realizes some of the students can play music, so organizes them into a rock band for a $20,000 prize 'battle of the bands' competition. When a check from the school shows up for his roommate, the girlfriend gets wise and calls the cops, who meet Black in his classroom. Busted, he evades jail but is sent home, the day before the band battle. The kids convince a school bus driver to take them anyway, they pick up Black on the way there, onstage when the parents all arrive, kids perform, are the hit with the audience, are called for an encore, but Black's old band win the prize.",Null,0,1,13 November 2004
Cars 2," Watch it for the animation first, then enjoy the story.
","The first 'Cars' and 'Cars 2' bear little resemblance to each other. While the former was set in a small western town in the USA, and involved a car 'coming of age', this new one features a car that gets involved in auto racing all over the world. And it isn't just racing, there is intrigue. It involves a new, environmentally-friendly fuel and those who may want to see it fail.Larry the Cable Guy is arguably the star as the voice of Mater, as in 'Tow Mater', the country bumpkin tow truck that just seems out of place everywhere he goes, but in the end is the key to solving the mystery. I am not a big fan of the actor, Owen Wilson, but here as the voice of Lightning McQueen he is just perfect.The story is incidental, but it makes for several opportunities to feature road races in some very famous places, like Monte Carlo and London. The animation is what we watch this for and it is superb. A fun diversion.",Null,1,2,12 November 2011
The Game," A movie that looks good on the surface, but has a totally contrived ending that is shameful to the viewer.
","'The Game' was highly recommended to me.  I watched it, found myself caught up in the action and plot twists. Then, at the end, the movie literally insults the intelligence of the viewer with its contrived ending.  You end up feeling cheated for the time you spent watching it, plus, you have absolutely no feelings about the characters.  I gave it a '4', being generous, but I certainly can't recommend this for any mature viewer.  Maybe teenagers!",Null,8,17,10 March 2000
Kick-Ass," My reason to see it was Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl.
","Somewhere recently I was reading a column regarding Moretz in some movie, I believe 'Hugo', and the writer made a comment to the effect, by the time 'Hugo' hits the theaters many fans will already be familiar with her as the trained assassin in 'Kick-Ass'. That surprised me considering her more recent roles. Fortunately my public library stocks the Blu-Ray versions of both 'Kick-Ass' and 'Kick Ass 2' so I was able to view both of them within a few days. The BD extras are very interesting, showing how the movie was bridged quickly from the early success of the comic book 'Kick-Ass'. Moretz was still very young, 11 when she started the role, and much of the charm of the movie is this little girl dressed up in her costume and with purple wig, and having all the fighting skills. Moretz is very good in this role. The 'K.A. 2' was made 4 years later, according the the BD commentary, so at 14 to 15 she looks quite a bit more grown up and through that the second loses a lot of its charm.The basic premise is that Aaron Taylor (British actor sounding a lot like Toby Maguire) is Dave Lizewski, a mild-mannered teen with no particular physical skills. But with his geeky friends starts to wonder, with so many superhero comics and movies over the years why hasn't someone in real life actually come out to be one, to fight crime in New York City? So without telling his friends he orders a costume and decides he will become Kick-Ass. His first real encounter doesn't go well, he is beaten and stabbed almost to death but recovers, and damage to his nerve endings later help him endure pain.Nick Cage has a neat role as Mr Macready who with his Batman-like costume fights crime as 'Big Daddy.' His young daughter is Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl, or for her proper name, Mindy Macready. In essence her childhood has been stolen in her training but she is a very effective assassin. But only for the bad guys!I mostly enjoyed the movie for the three characters I mentioned. Especially Moretz as the Hit-Girl. But really, there is an awful lot of gory violence, and I understand that is faithful to the comic book, yet seeing real people (actors) portraying this is often a bit much. I know a lot of fans can't get enough of it but I find it a bit too much, plus the really offensive language many characters are required to use, including young Moretz. I'm glad I saw it, I enjoyed seeing young Moretz in this extreme role, but it is not the type of movie I'd own.",Null,0,0,12 September 2015
Unknown," A better than average thriller, Neeson is ideal for the role.
","While this is a totally different story, one has to be reminded of Neeson's role in 'Taken' where he has to solve a mystery as difficult as this one.Liam Neeson is Dr. Martin Harris traveling with his wife to Berlin to participate in a scientific conference. As they arrive it is cold and snowing at the Berlin airport and he rushes into the cab leaving the driver to load their luggage. We notice that the briefcase is left in the luggage carrier, and Martin only notices it when they get to the hotel.So, knowing this is a movie of mystery and intrigue, it is natural to wonder, 'Did the driver leave the briefcase behind for a reason?' Then, when Martin catches the first taxi back to locate his briefcase, and a traffic accident sends him into the river, we wonder, 'Is that cab driver in on a plot against him?' And this goes on throughout the movie, trying to figure out what is going on. Because, when he finally gets back to the hotel 4 days later, no one knows him. His wife included, who is with a different Dr Harris. Neeson's character is now 'Unknown.'This is a well-crafted movie and while it may have a few holes in the plot, overall is very entertaining. Diane Kruger is Gina, who happened to be driving the cab when it went into the river. She is a Bosnian refuge working extra jobs to save money to better her lot in life. January Jones is Martin's wife, Elizabeth Harris, who seems to not know her husband, while she claims that Aidan Quinn is the real Dr Harris. Other key roles are Bruno Ganz as investigator Ernst J√ºrgen and Frank Langella as the mysterious Rodney Cole.(As a side comment, Neeson at almost 60 is 25 to 30 years older than Kruger and Jones, but that doesn't make much difference in the movies!)SPOILER: When Martin wakes up in the hospital 4 days later, after a severe concussion and near death, he doesn't remember everything. This is key to the story because he really believes he is the scientist, Dr Harris. In fact he has no permanent identity, he is a professional assassin with multiple identities and multiple passports. Elizabeth is not his wife, they are part of a team to kill a scientist who has discovered a new corn hybrid that grows fast, is insect and drought resistant, and he plans to give this freely to the world, which will cut into certain company profits. When he goes missing the substitute 'Martin' is pressed into service. In a complex series of happenings, everyone but Neeson's and Kruger's characters die, the scientist is spared, and the surviving couple get to go off together and start new lives.",Null,0,1,22 July 2011
Coyote Ugly," Total fun movie, nice DVD 'extras', I give it a solid '7'.
","This film 'Coyote Ugly' gets it name from the bar where the girls work, apparently a real bar of the same name in NYC, but this film was shot on a set. The lead actress Piper Perabo was chosen from about 4000 girls, and she does a fine job, very believable as 'Violet'. In fact, her life leading up to this film paralleled the character very closely. She looks a little like both Jennifer Lopez and Sarah Jessica Parker, and delivers her lines much like Parker would have.Storyline - young Violet, mother dead, father (John Goodman) works as toll booth operator on the NJ Turnpike, she decides to move to NYC to realize her dream of being a successful songwriter, against dad's wishes. Meets all usual obstacles, rejection, apartment is robbed, broke, she quite accidentally finds about Coyote Ugly as one worker/dancer is leaving. Not 'her cup of tea', she perseveres anyway. Also meets a nice young man who also helps her get over her fear of performing on stage.Although it looks like Perabo does her own singing, as we learn on the DVD extras, Leann Rimes does all her singing, dubbing her voice to match Perabo's vocal style. Rimes also does an appearance near the end. Goodman is his usual good self as dad.The DVD has selectable sound in either DTS or Digital Dolby 5.1. I selected DTS and the surround track was fine. There were a couple of 'glitches' in the video, but overall was just fine. 'Extras' included a commentary track by the 'girls', which is fun to listen to, but not particularly helpful in understanding subtlties of the film. There are deleted scenes and short features on how some of the stars were selected. Anyway, the film is a nice story, has some fun barroom action and dancing, no violence nor bad language, and only subtle sex suggestions. A good, fun movie for young and old alike.",Null,1,2,24 January 2001
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood has done it again, a superb character study.
","In the 1970s Ford made a car model called the Gran Torino. The main character in this movie is Walt who, after serving in the Korean War in the 1950s worked for Ford in Detroit. In 1972 he was on the assembly line, and actually installed the steering column of the Gran Torino which resides in his detached garage and workshop in the rear of his modest home, still pristine and Walt's pride and joy.Clint Eastwood directed and stars as Walt Kowalski, and as the movie opens we are in the local Catholic church at the funeral for his long-time wife and partner. He sneers at the behavior of some of the younger in attendance, and in fact Walt sneers a lot. He sneers at the 'rice burner' car one of his sons drives. He sneers at the Asian families in his neighborhood. He seems to just want to be left alone. The parish priest is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, who informs Walt that on her deathbed he promised Walt's wife that he would look after him. Particularly she asked that he go to confession. Walt sneered at the priest and told him he didn't want to have any part of that, he only went to church to keep his wife happy.So that sets up Walt's character, by all indications he has no close ties with anyone now that his wife died, not even his two sons and the grandkids. He sits on his porch, drinks lots of beer, and his usual meal is beef jerky.But somehow he takes pity on the shy Asian teenager next door, and in Walt's own way berates him into being more outgoing and to assert himself. Bee Vang, in his first movie role, is Thao. When Thao is forced by his older and larger 'cousin' to accompany his gang, they tell him he must steal the Gran Torino to show he is worthy. But Walt catches him, and almost shoots him. The family requires that Thao make amends so he is given to Walt for a week or two to work for him. Walt puts him to good use cleaning up the neighborhood, fixing things in disrepair, and in the process teaches Thao some skills, which leads to a job. Walt sees value is trying to save this kid from the Asian gang.Thao's slightly older sister is Ahney Her as Sue, also in her first movie. She is the opposite of her brother, assertive, but this gets her into trouble with the gang members who want her to submit.The story is the transition of Walt from a grizzled, indifferent war veteran to one that has a purpose in life. He sees that these two nice, intelligent teenagers will not have a chance to develop their lives with the gang influence around, so he must help figure something out.SPOILERS: Walt even in his old age is strong and wily, and knows his way with guns and battle. But he has another struggle, lung cancer. He occasionally coughs and spits up blood but doesn't tell others the whole story. Faced with a hospitalization to try to cure him, he instead decides to protect the youngsters. The gang has to be caught in the act, with witnesses, to get them off the streets and into prison. So he shows up at their house one night and, reaching for his lighter, they all shoot, killing Walt. He was unarmed. He gave his life to save these kids, partly in reparation for his having killed any number of young Koreans in the 1950s. In his will, he gave the Gran Torino to Thao, with the provision that he wouldn't paint it or alter it to look like the abominations that many of the younger crowd were doing to their cars.",Null,3,9,21 June 2009
Hero," Absorbing Chinese martial arts movie.
","'Hero' is about heroes, in battle, each side has its own heroes. Set about 3000 years ago, most of this movie takes place at the palace of the King of Qin, as the warrior Nameless (Jet Li) approaches him to offer to fight for his kingdom, to conquer and rule the surrounding territories. The hope is that unity will be the final result. As Nameless tells his story, we see it in flashback form. Then, back to the two men in the palace, then the next segment of the story is seen in flashback form. Interestingly done in that one flashback may be mostly in reds and oranges, the next in all white, the next in light blue, the color schemes identifying the version of the story, each a bit different, until the truth is finally arrived at. DVD is superb, great sound and great scenes. I watched it in Mandarin with English subtitles.SPOILERS. Initially Nameless tells the King that he has developed a novel fighting technique and he has killed Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow, three of the most renowned fighters. (These are the kinds that fly or float above the water, as in Chinese lore.) But the King doesn't believe the story, and instead tells his own version, which points to Nameless being there actually to kill the King. He had developed a move that was guaranteed fatal from 10 paces, and that was how close he was now to the King. However, the King made him realize that killing him would hurt all the peoples, since he then would not be able to bring unity, so Nameless resisted and left him safe. Still, he had made a threat to the King, so outside all the Kings warriors shot arrows at Nameless against a far wall, he gave up his life for the people.",Null,6,9,8 March 2005
Shrek the Third," A Shrek take, on the King Arthur story.
","At least the three Shrek stories are each unique, and only build on characters developed in the earlier ones. I will still think, as I suppose most will, that the first one was the best.Here Shrek and Fiona visit her parents in Far, Far Away land, but dad, the King (as a frog) is ill and dying. Shrek and Fiona are made temporary King and Queen, but they just aren't cut out for the job, especially Shrek, as almost everything he gets involved in goes wrong.So most of the story is the search for the person who will become King. Prince Charming desperately wants to become King Charming, but the dying king had Arthur, or Artie, in mind. Analogous to the traditional King Arthur story, this Artie is young and small, and often picked on by others. This movie is a bit darker than the first two, in that both Fiona and Shrek become imprisoned separately, and there is talk of killing Shrek, and also of killing Artie. But Artie gives a speech to the bad guys about 'haven't you ever wanted to get out of your own way and become the person you really wanted to?'The animation is superb, and the characters that are supposed to be people, like Artie, look very life-like. As in traditional film making, where camera movement is used to add interest to a scene, the animation simulates all the various camera movements we have become used to.",Null,1,2,7 January 2008
The Hurt Locker," The bomb squad keeps very busy in the Iraq war.
","For whatever reasons I had not seen this movie until now. Maybe it was the title, 'Hurt Locker' doesn't exactly conjure images of an interesting movie. But it DID win a number of awards including the Oscar for Best Picture. With all that I suppose I was expecting more, it is a fine movie but I came away thinking it must have been a weak year for Best picture nominees.It focuses on a squad that gets alerted to possible bombs and is charged with defusing them or otherwise insuring the safety of the soldiers and surrounding community. As the movie opens we see one of these that goes bad, the soldier (Guy Pearce in a very brief role) doesn't make it. So the replacement expert comes in. By his own count he has defuses over 800 devices. That is Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James. He is a maverick, he often goes against the guidance of others but he always seems to succeed.His closest buddy is Anthony Mackie in a good role as Sergeant JT Sanborn. He is more of a 'by the book' soldier and gets frustrated with some of the antics of James.The third member of that close-knit group is Brian Geraghty as Specialist Owen Eldridge, who seems always fearful that he will get killed, that whatever assignment will be his last one. His growth is to overcome that. The Iraq war was, and I suppose still is, a terrible thing. This is a good movie to show presumably what one group goes through each day. As the movie starts they have 39 days left in their tour of duty, part of the suspense is if they will live to go home.SPOILERS: James does get back home to his small child and wife. He shops for cereal, he cleans leaves out of the gutter. His wife seems distant. As the movie ends we see him in military gear, stepping off a transport at the beginning of his 365 day tour. He just couldn't survive in dull civilian life, he needed the action.",Null,0,1,6 August 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," More Pirate madness and action, the filming and special effects shine here.
","My wife and I watched this at home on glorious BluRay from our public library. They seemingly spared no expense with sets and special effects, the sound and picture are great, and a reason to see the movie even if you don't care about the story.It is a continuation of the Jack Sparrow chronicles started 12 or 13 year earlier, although in the story the official lapse of time is 20 years. Many characters continue through the series of 5 movies, and even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return at the end for short cameos.Perhaps the most fun cameo is by Paul McCartney of the Beatles. He has one short scene where he is in prison as Uncle Jackie, awaiting execution. Depp and McCartney have been friends in real life for many years and he did the role as a favor to Depp.There is a story here, but really who cares? Jack Sparrow has to endure several near-death encounters before encountering the Trident of Poseidon, and allowing the un-dead captain and his crew to go to their final resting place. Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem is the un-dead Captain Salazar, and Geoffrey Rush back as Captain Barbossa. Each of them is great in his role.The fresh faces, who as teenagers grew up enjoying the earlier Pirate movies, are Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth who holds the key to locating the Trident. For any viewer who enjoys this type of movie it is a totally entertaining 2 hours. Frankly I enjoyed the 48-minutes of featurette in the BD extras, we see a lot about the making of the movie, probably as much as the movie itself.",Null,0,1,29 October 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," 'Sea trials will begin as scheduled. We deliver, or we drown.' ","A story about a submarine so flawed, during construction it was named 'the Widowmaker.' I was a teenager in 1961, the time period for this movie, 'K-19, Widowmaker.' I recall the cold war posturing by the USA and the Soviet Union, and this movie dramatizes the fate of the newest Soviet nuclear submarine. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson star as the Captain and his first mate, the former Captain. Ford plays a taskmaster who won't let up, won't quit having is new crew practice emergency drills, even when some of them become injured, because he suspects their fate will depend on how well the crew will respond when a crisis really arises. A bit slow in the middle, still, a good movie.SPOILERS follow, please read no further. After breaking through the Arctic ice, and a successful test missle launch, the sub and crew are assigned to patrol the Atlantic east of the NY and DC areas.  A leak develops in the nuclear reactor section, cooling is lost to one reactor, and if not arrested would heat to the point of destroying the sub, killing all aboard, and perhaps detonation of nuclear weapons aboard. A fix is planned, but requires entering the reactor chamber without proper radiation clothing, 10 minutes per person, radiation burns and sickness, vomiting, fix works but sub crippled, deadly radiation spreading aboard sub, mutiny is attempted, USA ship offers help, rejected, a Russian sub shows up, defied Moscow orders and get men off ship, court martial, aquitted, he and crew sworn to secrecy, until the 1989 fall of the Communistic regime in the USSR, when the whole crew gathered to honor the dead, and to toast the Captain.Good movie, especially for those of us who lived through the period.",Null,0,0,20 August 2003
Moulin Rouge!," 'The show must go on, Satine. We're creatures of the underworld. We can't afford to love.' (Zidler)
","May 2011 update: Watched it last night. Still entertaining after all these years!SPOILERS, but further down in this review. 'Moulin Rouge' caught me totally off guard. It is not a re-make of anything. It does not purport to tell any historically-accurate story. It is set in 1899 and 1900 Paris, at the Moulin Rouge 'entertainment' complex, owner and show-master Zidler (Jim Broadbent) was a real person. Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) was primarily a painter that visited brothels, and died in 1901. However, the main characters Satine (Nicole Kidman, 34) the courtesan and entertainer, Christian (Ewan McGregor, 30) the young writer, and the jealous Duke are all fictional.What caught me off-guard is the style. It is a dream-scape fairytale, it is whimsical, it is a comedy with some tragedy thrown in at the climax. It is two hours of exotic music videos with dialog thrown in to bridge the musical numbers. It is what a Salvadore Dali musical would look like, if he had been a director instead of artist. Everything is shot on a large inside set in Australia, and combined with models and CG effects, blended seamlessly to create an auditory and visual display rarely seen on film. In fact, the whole film reminds me more of an elaborate stage production with lots of set changes. I really enjoyed it, I watched it twice, on successive days. I rate it '9' of 10.Director and writer Luhrmann uses a simple and easy to follow story. Christian is idealistic, moves to Paris to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and especially LOVE. Even though he's never been in love. Lautrec and his cronies, 'bohemians', are struck with Christian's ability to write beautiful poetry, actually words from 20th century love songs from the likes of Beatles, Estevan, Parton, Elton John. They want him to write the new musical 'Spectacular Spectacular', he falls in love with Satine, the Duke agrees to finance renovations to the Moulin Rouge, but Zidler must promise him Satine or forfeit the deed to the place. Much of the middle of the film deals with Satine and Christian's trying to carry on a love affair while keeping it from the jealous Duke.Some viewers, not understanding the concept, objected to the use of modern lyrics in an 1899 Parisian setting. As Luhrmann explains, for the story to work, the 'poetry' that Christian writes must be by consensus some of the most beautiful of all time. The only way to do that is to use lyrics of songs that have, by popular acclaim, become the best. 'All You Need Is Love.' 'Silly Love Song.' And all the others. Since the whole film is a comedic dream-scape fantasy, it works!The film starts at the end, with Christian in 1900 writing his story of the past year. He tells us in the first scene that the woman he fell in love with is dead. So we don't have that suspense during the film, we know how it will end. The whole fun is letting our senses be taken in, and just enjoy watching the story unfold. Satine dies on stage, at the end of the opening performance of 'Spectacular Spectacular.' And, in the last scene, Christian is completing his story, on his typewriter, about the need for love in our lives.Neither Kidman nor McGregor had ever sung professionally before, in any capacity. For actors they did quite well, although it is very clear that they are not singers. In particular, McGregor's shouted out high notes, done without any vibrato, became pretty irritating after a while. Yet, with a little more training, he could be good enough to play Elton John, if someone wanted to film his life story. But the best singer overall was Jim Broadbent, with a very fine, resonant and lyrical voice. That was a pleasant surprise.Anyone watching 'Moulin Rouge' at home on videotape is missing about 75% of the fun. The DVD has great picture and sound, with either Dolby or DTS digital surround tracks selectable. The extra on the first disk puts a green 'fairy' at several points and if you press 'enter' on the player's remote, takes you to a couple of minutes of behind-the-scenes explanations, which I found very enjoyable on second viewing. The second disk has a lot more extras, showing about everything one wants to know about the making of this film. I like to study, not just watch, a good film, and this DVD has some of the best extras I've seen so far.And finally, it is refreshing to see a fine film with no nudity, no curse words, and no killing. My hat off to Luhrmann, I wish more directors and writers would realize how clean good movies can be.",Null,0,3,22 December 2001
X-Men: Apocalypse," Flashes back to the mutant from 3600 B.C.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife was in St Croix. I'm not sure who had the better time!The story here starts in 3600 B.C. in ancient Egypt. The mutant called Apocalypse is shown getting a power transfusion from another being, his goal - to live forever and be all-powerful. But something happens and the pyramid he was in came crashing down and he was hidden for over 5000 years.Closer to present time, in the 20th century, we encounter the X-Men and the university that is set up to teach young people. But when Apocalypse makes an appearance then everyone is pressed into service. The survival of humanity and the world as we know it are at stake.James McAvoy is back as Professor Charles Xavier and he has to enlist the help of his old friend and sometimes nemesis Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr, also called Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence is Raven, also known as Mystique. And several other X-Men regulars plus a few new faces.Maybe the most interesting is Oscar Isaac as En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse. Isaac was so good in 'Ex Machina' and good here, but completely unrecognizable made up as Apocalypse.We also see a brief turn of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, before he runs into the forest, not to be seen again.It is a good story with lots of action and an excellent sound track. If you have a powered subwoofer at home it gets a good workout.",Null,0,0,19 October 2016
Meet Joe Black," 'Easy, Bill, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.' ","This movie, 'Meet Joe Black, and a 1934 movie, 'Death Takes a Holiday', are both based on (or inspired by...) the stage play. The 'Ultimate' DVD set I got from my public library has two disks, one with the almost 3-hour 'Meet Joe Black' movie and the other with the barely 80 minutes 1934 'Death Takes A Holiday' movie.  So I didn't have to move very far from my home theater to see both of them. They are distinctly different, and end quite differently, but both are enjoyable. I will write a separate review of the 1934 movie. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt occupy the main roles, and Hopkins is especially effective as the business man about to turn 65 and visited by this unlikely guest. It is a bit slow in spots, spending too much time on intimate scenes between Forlani and Pitt, and also too much time getting through the final scenes, but overall a very watchable if overly long movie.SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS are contained in the remaining comments, don't read any further, OK??Bill (Hopkins)is almost 65 and is experiencing a heart attack, when 'death' (Brad Pitt) shows up, gets named 'Joe Black', wants a holiday, and asks Bill to be his guide of sorts. In return, Bill will not die until after he has turned 65, has a chance to really say farewell to all his family and friends, and prepare for his fate. 'Death' occupies the body of the young man that Bill's doctor daughter Susan (Forlani) had met briefly in a coffee shop, but who was killed right after she turned a corner, not seeing any of it. Joe is at Bill's side everywhere, to the consternation of Drew, the business hotshot that is trying to marry Susan, and at the same time engineer a merger which would enrich him personally but destroy the business that Bill had put together over the years. Things are complicated when Joe and Susan fall in love, she doesn't know who he really is, Bill knows this is not good for Susan. Drew convinces the board to fire Bill, but at Bill's birthday party he tricks Drew into admiting his plan to the board over a speaker phone, to set things right. Joe, posing as an IRS agent, tells Drew, 'death and taxes' as Drew is forced to resign to avoid prosecution, echoing a line Drew told to Joe early in the movie. As midnight approaches, Joe and Bill walk together over an arched walk, Bills time is up, Joe's holiday is ending. But Joe apparently comes back, but it isn't Joe anymore, it is the young man that Susan had met in the coffee shop. 'Death' decided it wasn't his time, so gave him back to Susan, as a gesture of his love for her, instead of taking Susan with him.",Null,2,4,22 January 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Another installment, mostly 'ho-hum' for me.
","I suppose I am too old, seeing all the various incarnations of Spiderman and wondering if they will ever let it rest. Not likely.I saw the 'Amazing Spider Man' almost 2 years ago and enjoyed it enough. Frankly I don't think Garfield's interpretation is as genuine as Toby Maguire's was. He's good enough in most ways but for some reason he seems too goofy at times. I didn't find it as fitting for the rest of the story.Yes, Andrew Garfield is back as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Also Emma Stone is back as Gwen Stacy, who in the movie preceding this learned of Spidey's identity. (As an aside Garfield and Stone became a couple during the making of the first film and are presumably still.) This episode introduces a new character, Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon, electrical engineer who, via an industrial accident, getting a high voltage then falling into a vat of electric eels, becomes Electro. At first he just wants to be helpful but is turned to the dark side and Spider Man has to figure out a way to defeat him.Lots and lots of CGI and the acting between Stone and Garfield is just so-so. While most of it is enjoyable and entertaining to watch, I consider it a second-rate Spider Man movie overall.",Null,0,3,24 August 2014
Ex Machina," Good 'A.I.' can be dangerous, great 'A.I.' can be deadly.
","Written by a Brit, shot in England and Norway, with all non-American actors playing Americans. Interesting approach, and Norway is beautiful.Domhnall Gleeson (using his best Jake Gyllenhaal accent) is hot-shot programmer Caleb, set some time in the near future, he works for the world's biggest internet-based company. There is a 'competition' of sorts and he wins a trip to the big boss's home, with no idea why.The big boss is Oscar Isaac as Nathan who wrote the original code when he was only 13, a real prodigy. But now he lives in a secluded place surrounded by mountains and valleys, in a house that is mostly underground. He welcomes Caleb but right away confronts him with a non-disclosure agreement to sign. Nathan is eccentric but smart and inventive, and his reason to summon Caleb was to give a final test of his secret creation, a robot with artificial intelligence. Her name is Ava and she is played by pretty Alicia Vikander.A note about the presentation of Ava. It was certainly filmed with 'blue screen' techniques, the robot has some opaque, human-like features, but most of her legs, arms, and the back of her head are transparent, showing wires and cables inside. It is a very artistic presentation, and it made the actress believable as a robot. So most of the movie centers on the interactions of these three characters, Caleb is never sure if Nathan is telling him everything, and Caleb finds out he didn't win a contest, he was chosen. At one point Ava tells Caleb that he can't trust Nathan. But can Ava be trusted?Good, thought-provoking movie.Edit: I watched it again April 2016, then again in October 2018, knowing the basic story made it an even more interesting movie, looking for the subtleties.SPOILERS: Nathan's biggest weakness is a tendency to over-imbibe and get falling-asleep drunk at times. One time when he does Caleb steals Nathan's pass to grant access to all areas of the compound. Caleb finds old video of prior tests of robots that didn't work out, and in the process finds that he is attracted to Ava as if she really were human. He thinks he has hatched a plan for him and Ava to leave and lock Nathan in the compound, but Ava and another servant robot kill Nathan, change the codes and, as Ava leaves to find a crowded intersection to experience people Caleb is left trapped in the house, unable to break the glass to get out. You just can't trust artificial intelligence!",Null,0,4,31 July 2015
Back to the Future Part III," One review covering a 3 BTTF movies, a great series 1985, 1989, 1990.
","As of this date, the 3 'Back to the Future' films have these IMDb ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes. #3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of 'time travel.' BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski ('flower child' spelled backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly 'defines' a role as few have been defined in films.The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is what really makes them 'believable' within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus, although all the 'science' in the 3 films is 'bad science', which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a 'science' explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think, 'Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France, drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country.' And you look around, you're back home to a totally different world.That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885, evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland, fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his 'parents.' The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for 'future' events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of 'discrepancies', but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",Null,0,2,9 June 2001
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," It was a bit of a letdown after the first one.
","I am NOT the target audience for the 'Twilight' stories and the series of films. And, I see that the next two installments are coming out, one is completed while the other is still in preproduction. Because of this the movie must end at a point where we expect the next one to take over. And this movie does end that way, with virtually everything unresolved. For hard-core fans that will titillate them, but for most of us looking for an entertaining story it comes across as 'ho-hum.'Kristen Stewart is back as Bella Swan. Even the name evokes innocence and beauty, a 'bella swan.' But she is in love, she doesn't want to be left behind, and this would require her to become a vampire too. Will she??Brit Robert Pattinson is back as Edward Cullen, and he cares so much for her that he wants to spare her, he does not want to see her become a vampire. But will he keep protecting his position? We'll have to wait and see. Taylor Lautner is back as Jacob Black, how fitting a last name. 'Black' evokes mystery and danger, and that is what you get when he and his kind turn into Werewolves, who of course are always at war with the vampires.I can't wait for the next one. Well, maybe I can.",Null,5,6,4 May 2010
The Illusionist," Eisenheim, the illusionist, sets out to get the girl.
","I enjoyed this movie a lot, from beginning to end. It has some of the best actors working today, and an intriguing story. However, it is a good movie, not great. Strip away the illusions performed by Eisenheim and the story itself isn't particularly novel. Boy (Norton) from a lower class and girl(Biel) from a higher class want each other, but the social customs won't allow it. Throw in a budding ruler (Sewell) obsessed with power and his puppet constable (Giamatti), and you have the four characters and enough ingredients for a romantic drama.Set in 1900 Vienna, Edward Norton is Eisenheim (a stage name) the illusionist, an extremely good illusionist. But 15 years earlier as an adolescent he became friends with young Sophie (Jessica Biel), who was taken away. They met again, during an Eisenheim performance, when she was the property of the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) who planned to marry her, and to become King, even if his father were not to die soon.Paul Giamatti has played a number of goofy roles, but here he is a totally different character, Inspector Uhl, who was a virtual puppet. When the Crown Prince took offense at an Eisenheim demonstration, he later told the Inspector, 'Shut him down.' So, much of the movie involves the Inspector and his men spying on Eisenheim and Sophie, and Eisenheim's attempts at freeing Sophie from the grips of the Crown Prince to allow the two of them to make a life together, the one that was denied them years earlier. What chance does one have, competing against a great illusionist? SPOILERS. After an argument, it appears that the Crown Prince stabs Sophie, who rides away on a horse and is later found, apparently dead, in a stream. Later, illusions appear to bring Sophie back from the dead and, as they are about to arrest Eisenheim on stage, he is also just an illusion. Meanwhile, caught in a power scandal, the Crown Prince kills himself, Eisenheim gets away, Sophie is indeed alive. A brief set of quick flashbacks show the various deceptions, only the inspector has a hint of what really happened.",Null,0,1,16 January 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," For what it is, a Marvel Comics movie, I enjoyed it.
","As a kid growing up I was a big comic book fan, not that I collected them or anything, but I just enjoyed the fantasy. Superman and Superboy were my favorites.This installment of 'The Fantastic Four' has the usual characters, but as the movie begins we see very strange happenings in far-off worlds, and some of those strange projectiles work their way to Earth. Along with them comes a non-human silver man on a silver surf board who travels in any direction, at any speed, and can shoot very energetic blasts at his target. Soon we find out that he and his board have been sent as a guide for a force which feeds on whole worlds, absorbing their energy to stay alive, leaving only barren, desolate former worlds behind.It falls to the Fantastic Four to figure out a way to do the seemingly impossible, stop all this or lose the whole Earth to this alien force.I like all the superheros, but my clear favorites are Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm, the stone man.Kerry Washington, looking almost like Alba's long-lost twin, has a role also but I never figured out what it was. But it was good seeing her, she is always good.Laurence Fishburne was the voice of The Silver Surfer but I did not recognize him, ever after seeing all the Matrix movies several times each.",Null,0,1,24 November 2007
Grudge Match," Rocky and the Raging Bull mix it up, 30 years later.
","This could have been just a trite clich√© but in a well-written script turns out to be quite an entertaining movie, if you simply take it for what it is. Both stars were in their 60s when this was filmed, former champion boxers, Sylvester Stallone is Henry 'Razor' Sharp and Robert De Niro is Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen. In this fictional story each had a stellar career with only one loss each, in different matches against each other. But 30 years ago, when they were supposed to fight for the deciding match Razor pulled out.Switch to modern times in Pittsburgh, an enterprising promoter finally persuades the two of them to get back in the ring ('it is square, why do that call it a ring?') to decide the overall victor, with a promise of a good payday, upwards of $100,000 each. A good portion of the middle of the movie involves their training to get back into some sort of shape. Billy meets his adult son and his grandson for the first time. An old flame shows up (Kim Basinger looking great at 60), her role in the feud is explained. It was fun to see the two stars, old and out of shape, putting themselves out there for these roles.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Unique story, done very nicely, and Brad Pitt is superb.
","When one looks at the several thousand movies each one of us is exposed to very few of them have really unique ideas in them. I can quickly think of 'Being John Malkovich', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Groundog Day', 'Pleasantville' ... all unique and fine movies.'Benjamin Button' falls in that category. This one unique individual, born in 1918, starts out with all the symptoms of old age, a very small person with a body about to wear out, and as time goes by he grows but ages backward. He gets younger and healthier as he gets older. Brad Pitt is Benjamin Button.Meanwhile Cate Blanchett as Daisy is in modern times on her deathbed, but she met Benjamin when she was maybe 6 and he was maybe 12. Daisy and Benjamin were always destined to be in each others' lives forever, but how would that really work? When she was a small girl he appeared to be an old man. When they were in their 40s they appeared to be at about the same points in their lives.The third key character is Julia Ormond as Caroline, Daisy's daughter at her bedside, in New Orleans, as hurricane Katrina was approaching.The movie is a bit long, at 2.5 hours, but it never gets boring and the time passes nicely.

Transformers," Transformers take on the universe, with Shia LaBouf helping out.
","First I want to state one thing I like a lot about how this movie treats the subject. At times there are explosions, planes shot down, guns shooting, so you know that people die. But it never is glorified, you don't actually see anyone depicted as getting killed, which is a welcome change from so many movies that give you slow motion, close-up shots of people getting killed.Second, I don't know anything about the 'transformer' toys or the transformer comics if there is such a thing. So I was only able to appreciate this movie on the 2 hours I spent with the subject.I think it is a cool movie. We have bad alien Transformers, and we have good alien Transformers. The goodness of the Universe is at stake, but the movie never takes its message too seriously. There are lots of laughs.Shia LaBeouf is a natural, as Sam Witwicky. Somehow his old grandfather made a discovery and somehow a code got etched on his old spectacles that Sam is trying to sell on Ebay. So the good and the bad Transformers compete to see who will get the code.Very cute Megan Fox, looking like a young Jennifer Connelly, is Mikaela Banes, a hot chick who never notices knerds like Sam, until they are forced into a situation together. Jon Voight is Defense Secretary John Keller. John Turturro provides lots of comic relief as Agent Simmons.Overall an enjoyable movie, with almost non-stop action the final 45 minutes. See it, to find out if the Universe will be saved.",Null,0,5,5 November 2007
Pawn Sacrifice," 'There are more 40-move games in Chess than there are stars in the galaxy.'
","Fine movie, very well produced and acted. For me it brought back fond memories of the summer of 1972 when so many of us were playing chess at lunch and following the progress of the historic match.Chess is a very complex game, as Father Lombardy says at one point, 'There are more 40-move games in Chess than there are stars in the galaxy.' Whether that is precisely accurate or not I don't know, but regardless it is such a complex game, and a good player has to be thinking a number of moves in advance, those who master the game must have a great intellect. At least for chess.Bobby Fischer was a complex and troubled man, for all his chess genius he had a hard time getting on in everyday life, and when it came time to play for the world chess championship had a number of demands otherwise he wouldn't play. In fact once the world championship match was on he simply failed to show up for game 2, making it a forfeit and gave Spassky a 2-0 lead.During this time in history Russians dominated world chess and it seems only Fischer thought he had a chance to win. While all grandmasters learn all the moves in all the best games of the past, and Fischer did too, his genius was in being able to invent new openings and novel strategies as a game progressed. Spassky could not cope with that, even though he was clearly the best Russian he simply did not have the imagination and creativeness of Fischer. After the 0-2 start Fischer went 12 1/2 to 6 1/2 to destroy Spassky to win the world title. Fischer's game 6 is widely considered as the best chess match ever played. Good biopic of a brilliant chess player who quickly went downhill afterwards and died in 2008 in a foreign country. Tobey Maguire , who also produced, is Bobby Fischer. Liev Schreiber is Boris Spassky.",Null,1,3,20 January 2016
Wimbledon," 'In tennis, 'love' means zero. When you 'love' you lose.' (Lizzy)
","Kirsten Dunst as American bad girl tennis pro Lizzie Bradbury and Paul Bettany as aging British tennis pro Peter Colt make this movie fun to watch, although in fairness it is quite a simple little romantic movie. In my mind I compare it to another American/Brit romantic comedy, 'Notting Hill', and 'Wimbledon' is not even in the same class in charm and wit. My wife and I enjoyed it, with fairly well done tennis matches, but is best rated at about '5' or '6' of 10.SPOILERS. Peter had already decided to retire from competitive tennis, and take a job as the club pro at a club for the rich and pampered. He once had been rated as high as 11 in 1996, but now was 119, and really had no hope at Wimbledon, which he entered as a wild card. He wasn't even the best British pro there, and this was to be his last tournament. Quite by accident, given the wrong room key at the hotel, he meets Lizzy when he finds her in the shower of the hotel room. A romantic encounter later and Peter finds that Lizzie has become his tennis 'muse.' With her in the stands, and in his mind, he plays better than he had in a long time. He wins matches and, with the help of an injured opponent, makes it to the Wimbledon final.He is losing the final badly when heavy rain delays the match. Aborting her trip back to the States after losing her match, she shows up in Peter's locker room, encourages him, and casually tells him how to 'read' his opponent's serve. Long story short, he wins Wimbledon. After he hugs his family in the stands, he finds Lizzy. The movie ends with a cut to a future time in New York, they have children, Peter coaches tennis, and Lizzie won both the US Open and Wimbledon before she retired. The DVD has a few interesting extras, the best showing how they filmed the tennis matches without a ball in play, and digitally added the ball in post production, a necessity to get realistic tennis action.",Null,0,2,22 February 2005
Magic Mike XXL," Yea, no doubt, this is a very poor movie.
","My wife and I saw the first one, 'Magic Mike', 2 or 3 years ago and pretty much enjoyed it. The story in that one is decent and as a red-blooded female she enjoyed seeing the guys partially dressed.So, when this follow-up came available on DVD from our local library we snagged it and settled in to view it on a Saturday night. Perhaps the best clue is that my wife dozed off several times during the almost 2 hours. It has a simple story line, Magic Mike is now running his own business in the Tampa, Florida area and when his girlfriend spurns him he decides to join the old gang of male strippers for one last fling. They travel to an all-female convention in Myrtle Beach, S.C. (All the movie was actually filmed in the Savannah, Ga area.) There they perform and the stage performances include lewd simulated sex with ladies taken from the audience.Channing Tatum is the star as 'Magic' Mike, a natural role for him as he worked as a male stripper in his younger days after college but before he hit it big. He is fine in this but overall the road trip to the convention, with a couple of side trips and an accident, is not particularly interesting or entertaining. The writers seem to think that all the characters using F-this and F-that constantly makes for a clever script. But it doesn't.Overall a big disappointment, it has a rather low IMDb rating that to me is even too high. One of the poorer movies I have seem in a good while.",Null,0,0,20 December 2015
Hidden Figures," Recalling the hidden story of the technical women who helped USA get to the moon.
","My wife and I first watched this at home on BluRay from our local library in May 2017. I just rewatched it in March 2020, mulling the eventual impacts of COVID-19 now upon us. The picture and sound are first-rate and the several 'making of' extras are interesting. Even with some inaccuracies and Hollywood liberties in story telling this is a must-see movie.Most of us in modern times think of small machines, maybe one sitting on our lap, when we hear the word 'Computer.' But in the 1960s as the USA geared up for space exploration electronic computers were not in wide use yet. 'Computers' were the people who were very good with math and who would use mechanical calculators and pencils to make the long, difficult calculations. This story is about several black women who took jobs as Computers at Langley in Virginia as the technical team, a group of white men in white shirts and dark ties, tried to figure out how to get a man into orbit and retrieve him. The mathematics for all that was yet undiscovered.Enter the main character, Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson, who as a young girl demonstrated a genius for mathematics. She began working as a Computer, the men viewed it as a clerical job beneath them. But Katherine was not satisfied with just doing as she was assigned, she was inquisitive, she eventually provided the ideas and the math approach to calculating how to do it all. She only died recently (Feb. 2020) at the age of 103. Perhaps, we don't really know, if she had not been part of that team we might not have won the race to the moon.The movie also deals with racial discrimination in general in the 1960s. My wife and I were both teenagers during the 1960s, we remember well such things as 'colored' bathrooms and 'colored' entrances to businesses, as my wife says today 'It is embarrassing to see how it was.'Two other key black characters are Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan who became the chief programmer for the new IBM that eventually put most of the human computers out of work. And Janelle Mon√É¬°e as Mary Jackson who successfully petitioned a judge to allow her to take night college classes at an all-white school so that she could get her Engineer certification and work as an Aeronautical Engineer for NASA.Also good is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison who is the overall director of the effort at Langley, Kirsten Dunst as the office supervisor Vivian Mitchell who answered certain questions with 'That's just the way it is.' Plus Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford, the lead mission scientist who seemed to resent Katherine's role of checking everyone's math work, even his, but he eventually gave her the respect she was due.Good movie of an important time and important activity in the long, gradual process to overcome the racial prejudice that seems indelibly ingrained in our society.",Null,0,2,17 March 2020
Coco," Award-winning animated movie of a young boy wanting to be a musician.
","My wife and I watched and enjoyed this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. The title is a reference to the great grandmother who, as a child, was sung to by her father. The father disappeared when she was a girl, maybe 90 years earlier, to pursue his own musical career. But, as we eventually find out, the story was a lot more complicated.Young Anthony Gonzalez, 11 when he was given the role, is featured as Miguel who wants to become a guitar player but has to hide it from his family, they never forgave the great, great grandfather for disappearing.The story plays heavily on Mexican family customs, where the matriarch usually has the last say in things. It also plays heavily on the belief that you must display photos of deceased family members to assure their remembrance in the afterlife.As my wife commented, it is similar to 'Monsters Inc' in that it has a really interesting story to go along with the great Pixar animation. It won the Oscar in 2018 for best feature animated movie.All in all a great little movie with good family messages.",Null,0,0,15 January 2019
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Superb animation and voice acting, but something disturbed me about this movie.
","What's not to like, with such nice voice actors as Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T, Lauren Graham, and Al Roker? Did I just type 'Al Roker', personality from NBC's Morning Show? Yes indeed.The animation is superb. The voice acting is superb. But the story? I suppose it strikes a chord with kids. But some some reason I found it disturbing.There is a small island, located on the map right under the 'A' in Atlantic. Their fame is sardines. But the world is getting tired of sardines, as are the residents of this small island.Bill Hader is Flint Lockwood, who from a very young age decided that he was special, and that he could invent great things. But it never happened. Rats with wings were, and still are, a disaster. His remote control TV had legs, so it could come to the viewer to let him to change channels.James Caan is Tim Lockwood, Flint's dad. He runs a bait and tackle shop and he just wants Flint to give up his folly and join him in the business as dad and son.But one day when Anna Faris as Sam Sparks, cub reporter is dispatched to their small island as a fill-in weather person, Flint's invention takes off, literally. It is a machine that can turn plain old water (or water vapor!) into any kind of food. Dial in the food, and soon it is raining ... cheeseburgers. Later pizza, or eggs and bacon, or whatever it is programmed.Soon the little island is celebrating its rebirth, and plan a big new opening where tourists can come and participate in the raining of food. And that is where the title originates, on the final day of this story it is cloudy, and soon begins to rain giant meatballs and giant spaghetti.A movie of this sort wouldn't be complete without a love interest, and Flint and Sam provide that. From an adult perspective, it is a silly movie with a few good, genuine laughs. From a kid's perspective, it is probably really fun.",Null,0,2,8 February 2010
Lincoln," Excellent portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the man and the 16th President.
","The USA is still a fairly young country, formed in 1776 by the Declaration of Independence. The very early Presidents, Washington, Adams, Jefferson were helping to form the young nation, most of them elected for multiple terms. But then there was a string of more ordinary Presidents, most serving only one term then being voted out.Then came Lincoln, taking office in 1861, the 'Civil War' President because his term, ending with his assassination in 1865, coincided very closely with the beginning and the end of what was officially known as War between the States, the North against the South.This movie, 'Lincoln', does not attempt to cover all of Lincoln's life, or even a large part of it. It is the approximate first 4 months of 1865, when Lincoln, newly-elected for a second term, had to deal with the long-running war, dissension in his Cabinet, and what would become his legacy, getting the 13th Amendment passed. It was ratified in December by the states, abolishing slavery for all time. Lincoln held firmly to the concept that every person at birth has equal rights under the law and did whatever needed to be done to achieve that legal equality.Daniel Day-Lewis is considered by many as the best working male actor today and he won the Oscar for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. He is shown as a gentle family man, a humorous man fond of telling stories to amplify on a point, but also a smart and tough President who knew what he wanted to accomplish and would not let any obstacles stop him. The 13th amendment had been passed by the Senate in 1864, but the House of Representatives were the roadblock. The movie shows how the 'back room dealing' might have been used to get the necessary votes.Yes, it can be a bit slow, but I didn't mind, as it gave time to develop the themes and see Abraham Lincoln, the man. Every time I see a Lincoln movie I hope the ending will be different, but he always experiences the same fate!",Null,5,9,22 June 2013
Sing Street," Dublin Ireland, 1985, and a boy decides to be a rock-N-roller.
","I came across this movie on Netflix streaming. It is set and filmed entirely in Ireland, the time is 1985 and jobs are getting scarce. Just as many Irish traveled to the USA earlier in the 20th century to find a job and a life, many in 1985 were traveling to London.A new actor, a teenager with the unusual name of Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is the main protagonist, Conor, who is 15. He is a nice boy who happens to be in a family about to split up, plus dad is having a tougher time getting enough work. To economize Conor is sent to a different school, run by priests.He encounters the usual bumps and bruises but catches a glimpse of a pretty girl standing in front of a building. She is pretty Lucy Boynton as 16-yr-old Raphina. Conor walks across the street to meet her, telling her he is in a band, the kid across the street was the manager. She says she is a model, but really she wants to be a model. So now that Conor has put himself out there he has to produce. Hastily he rounds up several school kids who might be able to write songs and/or play an instrument. They decide to make a music video and ask Raphina to be in it.This is basically a 'coming of age' story with a musical background. It is smartly written and well-acted. Nice smaller movie.SPOILERS: Conor's parents split up, dad has to sell the house, Conor and his brother basically have no good place to live. Raphina's parents are not in the picture so she and Conor decide to take a boat and head to England, to find their futures and their fortunes there.",Null,1,4,15 November 2016
Pi," An artsy B&W film that can appeal to only a narrow audience.
","My studies and career have been intimately entwined with mathematics and numbers. I like numbers, I understand numbers, they make sense to me. So with the many favorable comments on this movie, titled after that fundamental measure of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 'PI', I went into this eagerly. I found it on Netflix streaming movies.Overall it is a big disappointment for me. Sean Gullette is the central character Max Cohen, a New York non-religious Jew, who is also a mathematics genius. Graduated from college at 16, a PhD at 20. But as his voice-over tells us, as a young boy he was told not to stare at the sun, but he did anyway when he was 6. Some time later, as the bandages were removed he began slowly to see light again. And he also started having headaches. All this presumably contributed to his math genius and his borderline madness.The meat of the story comes when he is using his computer at home and it spits out a long string of numbers, perhaps 200 or so, maybe a bit more. Then in a chance meeting with a Hasidic Jew, learns that there is a rumor that a mysterious 216-digit number matched to symbols in the Torah spells out the name of God. So Max begins to wonder if somehow his computer had spit out that number, now on a paper he had discarded.So we follow Max as he gets confused, or angry, and yells at everyone around. Followed by a woman who wants his codes for predicting the stock market. All in all not a very satisfying viewing for me.One thing fun was seeing veteran actor Mark Margolis as Max's former graduate adviser Sol Robeson. Margolis had a key role in the TV series 'Breaking Bad' as the wheelchair bound and mute member of the Mexican drug lord family.",Null,8,11,4 March 2014
Empire Records," Slice of life in a music store.
","As one critic bluntly says, in one day everything that can possibly happen to the characters does, and everyone comes out better at the end. Truly this doesn't happen in real life, but in REEL life we call it entertainment. I enjoyed it as a quirky comedy. I probably would not have been so entertained if it didn't have some of my favorite stars, some before they hit it big -- Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Debi Mazar, and Anthony LaPaglia. I was not familiar with Rory Cochrane, but his character Lucas was one of the best here.So, what's the story? LaPaglia is the manager of this Eastern US record store, Empire Records which has been in business since 1959, the sign tells us. On this fateful day employee Lucas is asked to close the store at midnight, and count all the money, twice. He does, and also observes that plans are in place to sell the business and convert it into a rather dull record store. So, he does what any good employee would do. Instead of putting the $9Thousand in the safe, he gets on his motorcycle and heads to Atlantic City with it! That begins a rather hectic 24 hours, involving all the employees of Empire Records.Nothing Earth-shaking, just a fun movie to watch.May 2020 edit: I watched it again and came away with much the same opinions. I found it especially interesting to see Zellweger right before she started her climb with the role in Jerry Maguire a year later. And now she is a fresh Oscar winner, Best Actress as Judy Garland. You can see that she was always exceptional.",Null,2,4,7 January 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Superb movie.
","I haven't had the chance yet to see all of the 2004 best picture nominees, but now having seen 'Million Dollar Baby', I can understand why it was regarded highly enough to garner the Oscar for itself, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank. It is masterfully directed and acted, and tells a very powerful story. Clint Eastwood is Frankie Dunn, former prize fighter trainer and now owner of a ratty gym in the Los Angeles area. Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald shows up one day, Frankie doesn't take kindly to a 'girl' in his gym, but is hesitant to refund the 6 months fee she already paid. Morgan Freeman is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, former prize fighter and now Frankie's assistant, janitor, fix-it man with a cot in the back room. Maggie is hard-headed as they come, determined to be a fighter, and calls Frankie 'boss', at least until Frankie agrees to be her trainer. Maggie is trying to escape the trailer trash life she was born into, Frankie was trying to establish contact with his long estranged daughter.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Maggie works harder than everyone else, follows instructions, and when she finally gets fights has a knack for knocking out her opponent in the first round. Frankie eventually has to give other managers under-the-table money to get opponents for Maggie. She makes a tour of Europe and wins everything. Back home she gets a fight against the champion in Las Vegas, for a $Million split with the opponent (thus title 'Million Dollar Baby'), a dirty fighter and former prostitute in East Germany. But Maggie gets the upper hand, knocks the champion down, the bell rings, Maggie is headed back to her corner when an illegal punch knocks her down, onto the stool Frankie had just put in her corner, snapping her neck. Hospitalized with no chance of getting better, Maggie has no longer a reason to live.",Null,5,8,18 July 2005
Garden State," Small movie with a very nice story and interesting dialog.
","Zach Braff as Andrew Largeman wrote, directed, and starred in 'Garden State', a reference to New Jersey where most of it takes place. In a comment he makes in the very interesting 'making of' special on the DVD, about 80% of what is in the movie comes directly from things that have really happened, although not necessarily to him and his family. The filming had a budget of $2.5Million, which is very small for a feature length movie with real film and Dolby 5.1 sound. That it has already taken in almost $30Million before DVD sales is quite an accomplishment. This is a fine story of a young man and a young woman helping each other to find themselves.SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments. Largeman is an actor and waiter in LA, had one role playing a retarded quarterback, has been under voluntary sedation for years on prescription medicine that his psychiatrist dad (Ian Holm) has prescribed for him, when he gets a message that his mom drowned in the bath tub. After a flight to New Jersey for the funeral, and having left his medicine in LA, he begins to meet all his former friends again, the most interesting Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, the grave digger who incidentally takes the jewelry off women corpses after the burial services to supplement his income. He spends most of his spare time doing some sort of recreational drugs.Seeing his dad's doctor for one-second headaches he gets occasionally, Largeman meets Sam (Natalie Portman) who, it turns out, has had some epileptic seizures and has to wear a soft helmet to avoid being dropped from her employer's health insurance. She recognizes him for his 'retarded quarterback' role. 'I can't believe you're not really retarded, you were so good.' They go places in the motorcycle with sidecar that his grandfather had left him, but she won't ride in the sidecar. Largeman and Sam find they are soul mates, each has never found someone before that they connected with. Largeman explains that he has to fly back to LA and straighten some things back, Sam cries as he heads up the escalator, then a few minutes later he comes back and finds her in a phone booth, they embrace, he has decided staying there with Sam was more important.Important character observation. Largeman's mom had become paralyzed when he was 9, he had an argument, pushed mom, who tripped over the open dishwasher door which had a broken latch. That episode was what caused his dad to prescribe drugs, and later sent off to school. He remarked that the one little piece of broken plastic is what caused all the misery in his life so far. The idea that sometimes some little random thing at a particular moment can have such a big impact on our lives. In fact, his script uses the word 'random' in a number of situations.",Null,1,8,5 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well-crafted mystery, but Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this.
","My wife is a constant reader and she spoke highly of the trilogy of novels, the first being the book this movie was made from. So now we are in the process of watching all three, which were apparently all filmed in succession over about 18 months. We watched with the dubbed English sound track. The dubbing is done very well, fairly closely matching the mouth movements.Michael Nyqvist is Mikael Blomkvist, investigative journalist who writes an expose' but appears to have been set up. His source materials either disappear or appear to be fakes, and is ultimately convicted of slander and scheduled to spend several months in jail.Meanwhile Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, a very unusual 24-yr-old, short haircut, multiple piercings, and always in black, crosses Mikael's path. She is an expert computer hacker and insightful investigator on her own, and digs into his life. What she finds is that he in fact is innocent, an honest man. They eventually work together to solve a 40-yr-old mystery.The mystery is the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, only 16, and since then presumed murdered. This happened in the 1960s, but a body was never found. The elder Vanger patriarch wants Mikael to investigate and solve the mystery. He believes one of the Vanger family members, which includes several Nazi sympathizers, must be the guilty party.During this first movie we also get a glimpse of Lisbeth's past, which included a stay in a mental facility, and an overseer who abused her. We also see the video she made secretly, which is destined to show up again in the other movies.All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else. This DVD has a 12 minute interview with her, in English. I am glad I saw the movie first, because Rapace in real life looks and acts nothing like Lisbeth. She made quite a transformation for the role.Good movie, even though it is long at around 2 1/2 hours, I was always anxious for the next scene, the next development. Now I am interested in what the American remake will be, but I can't imagine that it will be as good as this one.November 2019 edit: I just rewatched it, much of it seemed very fresh, I enjoyed it as much after 8+ years dormancy. Don't read the last paragraph below if you want to avoid spoilers.SPOILERS follow, you may want to quit reading at this point: As the investigation into Harriet moved along, using old information and old negatives from the 1960s, plus notations in the back of Harriet's bible, Lisbeth figured out the notations referenced bible verses. This led to the realization that the murdered people were Jewish. Eventually this led to one of the Vanger men, and then figuring out that Harriet had fled before she too became a victim. They located her in Australia, brought her home for the reunion with her elderly uncle who was looking for closure before he died.",Null,3,4,18 May 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent historical sketch of perhaps the best newsman of the 20th century.
","I was a small boy in the rural south when Edward R. Murrow was doing his best TV work in the 1950s. I can't say that I really remember him, because we didn't have a TV during most of that time. But I do have a feel for that period and this movie, filmed in B&W, is an excellent representation of that period.Murrow made many important contributions to the art of journalism, but this movie focuses on one of them, the work to expose Joseph McCarthy for the mean-spirited person he really was, conducting Communism witch hunts and lying often to do so. The extent of Murrow's investigation and reporting resulted in McCarthy's censure, and he died, literally drinking himself to death, only a few years after the period represented in this movie.David Strathairn is good as Edward R. Murrow, and was nominated for Best Actor. Robert Downey Jr. was Joe Wershba, Patricia Clarkson was his wife, Shirley Wershba, although married couples were not supposed to be working together at CBS. Frank Langella was William Paley, Murrow's boss at CBS. Jeff Daniels was Sig Mickelson, and George Clooney, who also directed and co-wrote, was Murrow's key associate, Fred Friendly . The movie makes ample use of old footage showing McCarthy and some of the hearings in Washington.Good movie, and is a 'must see' for anyone wanting to understand more about the political and news climate of the 1950s.",Null,1,1,6 April 2006
Big Hero 6," Winner of the Oscar in 2015 for best animated feature.
","Not doing any research at all before viewing this movie, I assumed the title referred specifically to the big, white inflatable robot. But it doesn't. The robot is Baymax, it was invented by Hiro's brother as something to make instant medical assessments and then provide care. The title is a reference to Hiro and 5 of his friends banding together, each with a different 'power', to fight evil, so the six of them together form the 'Big Hero 6'.Younger brother is a prodigy, Hiro Hamada. He is entering college even though he is only 14. To get into a prestigious school for gifted inventors he comes up with a small 'mini-bot' that is controlled by a headband Hiro wears. But then he makes thousands of these identical mini-bots and by thought alone he can have them assemble into any shape or accomplish almost anything.There is a fire and explosion, Hiro thinks the mini-bots and his headband are destroyed, but they in fact were stolen by the evil scientist and the fire was a cover-up. Most of the movie is about Hiro and his friends, and the Baymax, discovering the identity of the thief and defeating him.The animation is of course superb and the animated characters are interesting. There is even a Stan Lee appearance, in animated form, in a short scene immediately after the credits finish.",Null,9,16,7 March 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," It failed to engage me after 20 minutes, and that is not good.
","I like all kinds of movies. In fact, I am somewhat enchanted just watching a movie and thinking about the process they used in making it. But 20 minutes is my critical time. If I am not 'engaged' by 20 minutes into the film, I don't end up keeping enough interest to like it.I got the DVD from my public library to see Milla Jovovich who is Alice. And, pretty Sienna Guillory who is Jill Valentine. Maybe I was hindered by not having seen the first 'Resident Evil' movie, because I had no idea what was going on in the first 20 minutes, and there wasn't much in the film to make it clear.So, this is not a particularly good review. There are a few monsters, some dead people who attack in a sort of trance and try to eat healthy people. Some people get shot and killed, but they don't give up on them. Sometimes they put them into a big tank of water with a scuba-type of breathing magpie's, and eventually they live! This is the movie that has the scene of a nude Milla in a tank, and when she is taken out you briefly see her extra long nipples, which look a bit funny on her extra flat chest. But that's just Milla, I still like her, and will always like her. It is just that some of her roles stink.",Null,0,2,28 July 2006
Mulholland Drive," It is fun to compare this movie to 'Jacob's Ladder.'
","Spoilers - The only difference between a dream and a hallucination is that in the latter we think we are awake. But are we, really? In David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' there are only two short moments of consciousness. Near the beginning, after the jitterbug montage, we see an out of focus image in a bedroom, the same bedroom where the film ends, Betty/Diane (Naomi Watts) has just shot herself to finally get away from her guilt and her drug-induced demons. Except for those two brief shots of reality, the whole film is a semi-conscious dream, part grotesque exaggeration and part seeing your life flash before you as you are dying. In that sense it is similar to 'Jacob's Ladder', where that whole movie is a dream during the few minutes they are trying to save the wounded soldier before he finally dies. I suspect that Lynch consciously borrowed this idea, and adapted it to the world he knows, Hollywood.I thoroughly enjoyed the film, my wife just got up and left when it was over. suspect she felt cheated. I think she was expecting more closure. I was happy with witnessing the craft displayed. My absolute favorite scene in 'Mulholland Drive', and one of my favorites in any movie, is when the director is told to meet the Cowboy in the corral. We know now it was a dream, but it shows how lucid Betty's subconscious was at times. 'If you pick the right girl for the part, you'll see me one more time. If you don't, you'll see me two more times.' It doesn't have to make sense, but it was a superb scene.For those viewers looking for a simple, straight line narrative, here it is. Betty/Diane is a small town girl who won a contest and goes to Hollywood to strike it big. It is more difficult than she thought, has to ultimately resort to prostitution to stay alive, but gets involved in drugs too. Her paranoia leads her to feel the system is conspiring against her, other actresses get jobs because they either know someone or charm the director. So she arranges a hit on her perceived nemesis, but as she turns to booze and drugs to try and forget her guilt results in her own suicide. All those dreams we see in the film are happening in her mind during the few minutes between the time she shoots herself and the time she dies. Tragic, but it happens all the time.The DVD is real funky. While I admire its having both DTS and Dolby Digital sound tracks, it has no meaningful extras. Plus, it is not organized in chapters, in essence it is one long 145 minute chapter. So you cannot, for example, jump to the middle of the film to re-watch a scene, your only choice is to start from the beginning and fast-forward to get to your desired spot. That is a terrible, terrible cheating trick to play on DVD owners. It negates one of the nice benefits of DVD.",Null,3,7,7 May 2005
Dumb and Dumber," Not a good movie, 'technically', but one of my all-time favorite comedies.
","I avoided 'Dumb and Dumber' at its theatrical release because I 'knew' a film of this name could not possibly be good. Boy was I wrong. I've seen it now 3 or 4 times, most recently last night, and for me it never gets old. In the vein of good farces like 'Happy Gilmore' or 'Something About Mary', this one manages to strike a good balance, carefully walking the line between belly laughs and actual gross-out.Like the scene where Lloyd (Jim Carrey) puts laxative in the coffee of Harry (Jeff Daniels)and, arriving at Mary's (Lauren Holly) house we start to hear abdominal gurgles. Frantic, Harry finds the bathroom, pulls down his pants, sits -- when we hear Mary say, 'Don't use the toilet, it doesn't flush.' Then we see Harry, pants down to his ankles, taking apart the back of the toilet to try and make it work.Or the scene where they are skiing and Harry, like a kid, touches his tongue to the frosty metal support. And later, as his tongue stretches, as mary pulls his head away. Or the last scene, where Lloyd and Harry direct the bus of bikini girls to the next town, instead of volunteering for the job of 'rubbing oil all over their bodies.'And, of course, the whole idea of trading their hound mobile for a small scooter because it 'makes 70 miles per gallon', then riding to Aspen, in the snow, over passes, and arriving with ice growing from their noses, as Lloyd gets off in Aspen, Harry is stuck to his back. Trying to throw Mary's briefcase into a lake, it opens, they see all the money, then spend it all on a $285,000 car, a hotel suite, fancy clothes, all the while leaving 'IOUs' in the suitcase so they could pay her back eventually.Lauren Holly is a fine actress, but also one of the most strikingly beautiful. Here she was about 30 during filming, and at the absolute height of her beauty. No wonder Carrey married her, unfortunately it didn't last. Jeff Daniels is, to me, an even better comic than Jim Carrey, who is mostly 'over the top' in his acting. Daniels is a more subtle, and funnier, comic. No message in this film, just good fun and laughs. The actual story doesn't matter. My wife cannot stand 'Dumb and Dumber'. I guess it helps to be a bit wacky too.Sept 2017 update: Still fresh after all these years.",Null,3,8,3 July 2001
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A young German boy's Nazi experience during the war.
","Unplanned but quite coincidentally I have seen three fine but different movies with a Nazi German theme the past couple of weeks. 'Valkyrie' is about one of the failed attempts to assassinate Hitler, 'The Reader' is about a former German SS guard, a lady being tried post-war for crimes. And now this one, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.' Unlike 'The Reader' where characters spoke in English but with a German accent, or 'Valkyrie' where the characters initially spoke German then faded to English, this one makes no pretenses. The cast is heavily British and they simply speak in a straightforward British accent. This threw me a little at the beginning, but then went with it with no problem.At the center of it all is young Asa Butterfield playing 8-year-old Bruno. They live in a usual neighborhood but his dad, a German officer, gets transferred. His new job is as the head of one of the concentration camps, one where Jews are killed then incinerated.Young Bruno doesn't understand any of this, and when he sees people in the distance, looking from his second-story bedroom window, thinks they are farmers. Especially because one of those 'farmers' works at their home, often peeling potatoes. When young Bruno falls and skins his knee the prisoner bandages him up, and tells Bruno that he is a doctor, which he was.Eventually young Bruno explores, and comes upon the barbed wire fence enclosing the compound. He sees a small boy, also 8, in a secluded corner basically hiding out, but when the whistle blows takes his wheelbarrow and goes to meet the others. The boy wears a prison uniform, and that is what Bruno takes for 'Striped Pajamas.' Good movie, of a very difficult subject. The message is rather surprising.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW: While Bruno is simply becoming friends with the imprisoned boy, and still not understanding the gravity of the situation, nor his father's job, he catches a glimpse of a propaganda film being shown to officers in his house. It was made at that very camp, and depicts the prisoners living well and having a somewhat enjoyable time. So Bruno decides he will join them and be able to play with his new friend. He digs under the fence, puts on a prisoner uniform and hat, and goes with the boy. As fate would have it, that was the day the boy and others in his dormitory were to be marched to the chamber, gassed, and then incinerated, to make room for new prisoners. Dad was too late, his own son died along with the prisoners. You reap what you sow.",Null,3,5,3 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Will Luke Skywalker be the last Jedi?
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It has no extras at all but picture and sound are first rate as you would expect from George Lucas.Fortunately all this occurs in a galaxy far, far away so no matter what happens our own Milky Way galaxy will not be threatened. I have seen all the Star Wars movies and even though characters come and go this one still has a sensibility of story and action that pays tribute to the originals.Mark Hamill is again Luke Skywalker, now hoping to live the rest of his life quietly on a tiny, very remote island on a very remote world. In spite of that Daisy Ridley as Rey seeks him out, she needs training to help the resistance effort to save the galaxy. We don't get much of Rey's origin story but we do see she had a special connection to The Force.This was Carrie Fisher's last role before her unexpected death, she is General 
Leia Organa, commander of resistance troops. She and Han Solo have a son, Ben Solo, who has turned to the dark side, and taken the name Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver .I see from the list of reviews many are being very brutal to this movie and giving it ratings of '1' or '2' which is totally bogus. This is an entertaining movie and the special effects are done very well. Its overall average IMDb rating is very appropriate.",Null,3,13,20 April 2018
Brave," Award-winning animated feature, a headstrong princess.
","The Oscars were just awarded this past weekend and this film, 'Brave', won for the best animated feature film. It is a story set in old Scotland, and the young princess Merida is coming of age. It is time to have the allies come with their sons, and a competition is to be staged to see which one wins the hand of the princess.Kelly Macdonald is a wonderful actress and she voices Merida, who has always had her own thoughts about things in life. While she studied proper manners growing up, what she really enjoyed was jumping on her horse and riding into the forest, and practicing her archery.Her dad is Billy Connolly as Fergus, infamous bear hunter who lost his left foot and now has a peg, but he also has the bear stuffed in his castle. And Emma Thompson voices hr mother, Elinor.This is a Disney movie so has a good message embedded. Basically it is that in figuring out our path in life we must not sever the bonds of family in doing so. Merida had done that in an argument with her mother, and in an encounter with a witch tried to mend it with a spell that backfired. But eventually she figures it all out and patches things up.The story, animation, and voice acting are all first-rate, a nicely entertaining 90 minutes. I really liked how they presented Merida, with bright red-orange curly hair.SPOILERS: Merida figured how to get out of marrying one of the boys, she got to pick the type of competition and chose archery. Then she jumped into the competition, shooting 3 bulls-eyes, the last one splitting another arrow, to win and choose herself. But the spell turns her mother into a bear, and after some altercations Merida has to apologize to her mother and tell her she loves her to break the spell and get her mother back.",Null,2,3,26 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Entertaining most of the time but an ultimately very forgettable movie.
","I'm not quite sure what this movie was trying to be but I watched it as a comedy. A Stan Lee comedy.It starts out in 1988 and a young boy's mother is dying, then he is outside and a giant alien spacecraft abducts him. Then the movie switches forward to present time, 26 or so years later, and the boy has grown to a 30-something Chris Pratt as Peter Quill on some planet far off in the galaxy. He has turned into some sort of mercenary who can retrieve things at the request of others.Zoe Saldana, all in green skin makeup is his nemesis Gamora, who eventually warms up to Peter after he saves her from certain death in the vacuum of space.There are a number of strange and dangerous characters, such as Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel voicing the tall, woody plant form known as Groot, Bradley Cooper voicing the short, raccoon-like creature known as Rocket, and a host of others.The action goes from one strange planet to another, all the while playing up dialog for laughs when it could. I'm not quite sure what to think of it, but one thing is certain, it gave my subwoofer a great work-out!",Null,6,11,24 December 2014
The Imitation Game," A trip to the PUB with friends just may let you solve the biggest problem of WW2.
","I was able to see this at home on DVD. Excellent movie, it deserves its nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting actress. I'd bet that many dramatic liberties were taken with deviations from the actual true story, but it is based on real people and real events.The focus is Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, Cambridge Maths prodigy of sorts who was one of the several hired in late 1930s England to try to break the coding, changed every 24 hours at midnight, of the German Enigma machines. Turing was particularly focused because he had written a paper 'The Imitation Game' and had great faith that it took a very capable machine to match and break the Enigma.Turing is also given much credit as the father of the modern digital computer, because the concept he used for the mechanical computer he built, which was successful, is essentially the concept followed in the 1940s and beyond to make all-electronic digital computers. The invention of the transistor and integrated circuits were just a few years too late to let Turing himself take advantage of their benefits of reliability and computing speed.As the story in this movie goes, Turing and his team were stuck, the machine worked but it was too slow. It needed to do 20 million man-years of computation in just a few hours until the codes were reset and it never could get there. But one fateful evening at the PUB with his associates, a female clerk speaks of a certain German always first mentioning his girlfriend, and that combined with the daily coded weather report got Turning to realize the machine could make far fewer computations, looking for words they knew would be there, once they cracked those the rest were straightforward and quick. It worked, they broke Enigma, and knew of all the Nazi German messages.This brought about a new problem, to act on every message would soon tell the Germans the code had been broken and they would go silent. So they had to use statistics to predict how much information they could use to assure defeating the Nazis but not reveal their code- breaking, and part of that was to leak false information of how they learned of certain attacks they foiled. It is estimated the work of Turing and his group ended the war 2 years sooner and saved millions of lives.Cumberbatch really does give an award-worthy performance, as does Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, a young single lady who became part of the team. When she turned 25 and was still single her parents wanted her home. Always the problem-solver Turning instead proposed to her, so she could stay working with them. Turning as fate would have it was a homosexual, still illegal in England in that time, he didn't marry Joan and in fact was eventually arrested and made to receive hormone treatment, but ended his own life shortly after.Really a fine movie, it tells the story very interestingly.",Null,1,2,3 April 2015
Caddyshack," Old enough to be a classic comedy.
","It's hard to believe that it took me 25 years to get around to seeing 'Caddyshack', and only because I am scheduled to caddy next week for the Spirit International amateur golf championships. I need to see how it is done!There are several stories going on. One is Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) who is the best golfer in the club but has dropped out of competitive golf and doesn't even keep score anymore. But ask his caddy, and he'll tell you Ty probably shot a 65 or 66 his last time out.Then there is the loud, obnoxious Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield in a great performance), a businessman who has the largest and heaviest golf bag in the sport, who doesn't shy away from talking loudly while someone is preparing to make a stroke, and who eggs others into a match for $$Thousands.Then there is the issue of the little critters that are digging up the golf course, and dim-witted maintenance guy Carl (Bill Murray) is given the order to get rid of them. His efforts end up virtually destroying the golf course.Overall a funny movie, but I would not put it up there with the best comedies of all time. More of a curiosity for the characters.",Null,0,2,8 October 2005
8 Mile," Almost an 'M/M' biopic, the rap scene in Detroit.
","Marshal Mathers is the popular 'Eminem', which I will abbreviate M/Mbecause it is easier. Against the odds he became a successful white rapper amongst an almost all-black rapping backdrop in Detroit. What is revealed in this movie, and it makes sense, just being able to make rhymes does not make one a good rapper. You also have to be very intelligent with a superior vocabulary. That is why he succeeded, not because of anything else. This movie was a revelation of sorts for me, because I have almost ZERO interest in rappers and rap recordings (I will not call them music, for they are not). What this movie did for me was open my eyes to an important cross-section of the rapper environment. It is a well-made semi-documentary on the rise of M/M. However, for content and entertainment value I give it a rather low IMDb rating. I was, however, impressed with the acting of M/M. Itwill be curious to see if he can handle a role that is not close to his own identity.Of interest was the recreation of 'freestyle' rap contests, one-on-one, where the participants, eyeball-to-eyeball, do impromptu raps aimed at the other's weaknesses. The winner goes forward in this staged elimination tournament, and is apparently the proving grounds for aspiring rappers. Like open mike night at comedy clubs. In the DVD extras M/M explains that the story parallels his life, but in fact the character is NOT him, which gave them the freedom to be creative. He hopes the message one gets from the movie is 'It's up to you, if you want to make something of yourself.'However, if a successful rapper doesn't nothing more with his fame than earn money, and not be a positive role model, then he has accomplished nothing.",Null,0,2,14 October 2004
The Piano," Mail-order brides are hard to exchange.
","SPOILERS:: Set in New Zealand in the 19th century, Ada (Holly Hunter) is mute since age 6, has a daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) out of wedlock, and is 'sold' by her Scottish father to Alisdair (Sam Neill) who is a decent man, a sort of pioneer landowner. In the entire movie, everyone gives away things they don't want.After Ada's father gave her away, Alisdair gave away her piano to George (Harvey Keitel)because it was too heavy to move through the forest and mud to her new home.  Later, George gave it back to Ada, after he became too frustrated with it. And, eventually Alisdair gave Ada and the piano back to George after it became clear that he could never do anything to make his new wife care about him.Early in the story, George was attracted to this new woman, Ada, and realized that he could get to her through the piano, which she loved to play. That was her voice. Eventually Ada also became attracted to George and professed her love for him.  Since she and Alisdair never consumated their marriage, I suppose it wasn't that scandalous.  However, Alisdair did not take it well at all. First he boarded Ada and Flora in the house. Later, chopped off Ada's right index finger, before he realized he couldn't force her to love him.In the end, George and Ada and Flora ended up on a boat, settled in a new area, George made Ada a metal forefinger, Ada began to make sounds again, practicing only alone, hoping to speak again. Holly Hunter, at age 34, gives a brilliant performance. Anna Paquin, at 10 and in her first film, is also remarkable. Keitel, 53, and Sam Neill also give fine performances. Not a mainstream film, requires thought and patience, but overall one of the better films. Incidentally, Hunter is an accomplished pianist and does all her own playing.",Null,7,13,13 July 2001
Shrek 2," A worthy follow-up to the first SHREK movie.
","I was a bit concerned about seeing this movie. After all, SHREK was such a novel and entertaining movie, I thought the second installment might just be a poor imitation. I am glad that I was wrong! It isn't right to actually compare the two -- this second one has to build on the first -- but SHREK 2 is a wonderful animated movie, every bit as good as the first, in many ways better. A few comments about the DVD. The animation is a marvel to see, and the DVD uses a video sampling rate as good as a 'superbit' DVD, so the images are the best I have ever seen. The DVD menu is also one of the best I've seen. The main menu has nine boxes, so you can go directly to anything from this main menu. There is also a 'help' box, useful for those less familiar with DVD, that helps understand how to navigate through all the features of the DVD. I didn't buy this one on release, but I think I will now, a very entertaining movie, and a beautiful DVD.SPOILERS FOLLOW, for my own recollection, please read no further, OK!? Shrek (Mike Myers) and his bride Fiona(Cameron Diaz) travel along with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to 'Far, Far Away Land' to see her parents. That land is a take-off on Hollywood, even with the large words on the hillside. John Cleese is her dad, the King and Julie Andrews is her mom the Queen. There are naturally upset to see their daughter as an Ogre, the King solicits the help of the Fairy Godmother who puts a spell that if Fiona kisses the Prince, her son, before midnight, Fiona will be his. But SHREK also steals a happiness formula which turns him into a handsome man, Fiona into a beautiful woman, and they barely get together right at midnight, a kiss will keep them that way, but Fiona says no, she married an Ogre and that's the way she wants to be happy. So they turn back to Ogres as the movie ends, with a big song and fireworks display. Antonio Banderas is also good as Puss In Boots, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, and Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother.",Null,0,1,17 December 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," ' ... to be continued.'
","I finally got to see, first hand, what all the 'Kill Bill' fuss is all about. Unfortunately, it is only half a movie, so I am required to give it a rating of '4', expecting that after I see the second part, I will have rated the entire movie as '8'. QT obviously set out to make a spoof of the martial arts movies of Asia, and did a good job. I really was entertained, and use of the exaggerated spurting of blood when a head or limb was cut off reminded me that the film is not to be taken seriously. Plus, the scene where 'The Bride' single-swordedly defeated a trained army of perhaps 30 or so martial arts experts was pure 'camp.'Thurman was a great choice to play 'The Bride'. She moves well and has a comedic timing that just works well. Lucy Liu is menacing as O-Ren Ishii. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and David Carradine as Bill complete the main cast. The whole story, which is secondary to the 'look' of the picture, is Bill having left 'The Bride' for dead at her wedding, and after recovery in a hospital, escapes and sets off the kill all those on her list. This first installment shows us how she gets rid of the first half of her list. I guess I will find out about the second half in due time. To be continued ...",Null,3,6,17 March 2005
Jerry Maguire," Formulaic, but one of the best of its genre.
","The first time I saw Jerry Maguire several years ago, I thought it was a film about sports and agents. When I re-watched it this week on DVD loaned from my local county library, I realized that it is really a story about people getting grips on who they are, and what really matters in life. Tom Cruise is always a very dependable actor, much like Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Patrick Swayze, but never 'great.'  In this film, Renee Zellweger is great, giving us another glimpse, after 'Whole Wide World', of how good she really is. And Cuba Gooding Jr., as the spoiled wide receiver, is 'great.' They are the two who lift 'Jerry Maguire' above the ordinary.Funny moment, for me, was about half-way when she and he are going to dinner together the first time, he is in the street in his shoes with lifts, while she comes walking out into the street carrying her high heel shoes, obviously to make sure Renee didn't look taller than Tom, even though she is only 5'-5'. some SPOILERS - One way this film breaks from most formula love stories is they get married just past the middle of the movie, instead of falling in love right at the end. This early marriage sets up conflicts which follow, including whether he really married her for love, which is the only way she can accept him, or if he simply felt sorry for her and her small son. This is resolved near the end when he comes back after a road trip, into the ongoing 'divorcee meetings' her sister has, looking for his wife. As he begins to tell her, tearfully, how he misses his wife, she soon says her famous line, 'Shut up, just shut up. You had me at 'hello.''",Null,3,9,14 March 2003
Clash of the Titans," Action-packed telling of the story of the ancient gods.
","I seem to remember that this is a remake of an older movie, but I don't recall seeing the older movie, so my enjoyment and comments here stand on their own.I never paid too much attention to the ancient gods, and we must assume they are fiction, mustn't we? So as a fictional story, it presents itself quite nicely.In a nutshell, Zeus who is the most powerful god has banished his brother, Hades, to the underworld. Where Zeus is served by the good in the world, Hades is served by the evil. We see them in their domain, which looks like a very fancy courtyard, but they are standing over a miniature world with mountains and clouds, representing the real world below them.But Zeus some 20-odd years ago fathered a son with the wife of a king, and in the move we see him as grown up Sam Worthington as Perseus, a demi-god. Hades has tricked Zeus and now threatens to destroy a city unless they offer up a young woman in sacrifice. So the task of Perseus is to lead a journey to defeat Hades and his minions to save both the virgin and the city. The route requires that he enter the lair of Medusa and defeat her, sever her head and bring it to battle.Liam Neeson is Zeus, Ralph Fiennes is Hades. How much 'acting' do you really need? The movie is enjoyable as action entertainment, but other than that mostly forgettable.",Null,1,1,3 September 2010
Jurassic World," Some 20 years after Jurassic Park, it has become an amusement park.
","I was able to see this movie on DVD in my own home theater. Well, that's what I call it, a couch and a flat screen TV. But I DO have a powered subwoofer which is needed to bring forth the deep bass that represents the footsteps of the largest dinosaurs.There are several stories going on here. We see a nice family sending their two sons off for a short vacation, their aunt will oversee them, but behind that happy facade we find out the parents are getting a divorce. They get mail from two different attorneys and the young son finds from a web search that they are divorce attorneys.The aunt, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire, works at the theme park, Jurassic World, on the same island where Jurassic Park was set some 20 years earlier. She meets them but seems very busy with park work and the boys sort of end up on their own. This becomes important later when the newest dinosaur, a genetic cross between a T-Rex and a raptor, gets away and is wreaking havoc, and the boys find themselves in danger.It is a tried and true formula, human interest stories interwoven with a catastrophe. Truly the stories are not that interesting and we know all the creation of new dinosaurs is purely science fiction. One might take away a deep moral from this but I doubt that was the intention for making the movie.No most of the fun is the action involving the wonderfully CG created dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals that populate the theme park, run much the way Disney's Epcot might be if they had animals and rides. I didn't think he would be so good but Chris Pratt as the engineer Owen, and trainer of four Velociraptors is really good in his role. Naturally he and Claire kindle a love interest before the movie ends. Irrfan Khan is also good as Masrani, the multi billionaire who owns Jurassic World and is pushing his team to develop new forms of attractions.Overall I enjoyed it as an entertaining diversion for one evening, I doubt that I would be interested in seeing it twice.",Null,0,4,5 December 2015
Paranormal Activity," Can scare many, but it was pretty much a big let-down for me and my wife.
","I admire this project for what we don't see in the film, the fact that it was made on a very low budget, even smaller than 'The Blair Witch Project', and yet has taken in over $100Million in theaters. Now untold $Millions more via DVD rentals and sales.This does not have the production values of major movies. It is a video camera owned by one of the characters, Micah (mee-kah). He and his girlfriend Katie share a home, he says 'we are engaged to be engaged', and they notice some strange sounds in the house. So Micah decides he will videotape their bedroom every night to see what might be going on.(As an aside, I wondered how he made the time each day to watch 6 to 8 hours of tape to see what went on. We also never saw him doing his day-trading job.) Katie Featherston plays Katie and Micah Sloat plays Micah. Whether they are a couple in real life we don't know. The only other key character is the Psychic who is consulted but he turns out not to be much help.In the process of the story Amber tells Micah that at various times in her life, since childhood, she has heard unusual things at times. She believes there is some sort of evil spirit that follows her around.As the nights and weeks go by the sounds and unexplained movement of doors get more frequent and greater in magnitude, as though the evil spirit knows a movie is being made and it has to help make a suitable build-up towards the end.Overall, an interesting movie but not a very good one. And the stuff that is supposed to shock you all comes during the very last couple of minutes, so you spend 80+ minutes watching the build-up.SPOILER, SPOILER: In the last night that we see, the spirit inhabits Amber, from downstairs she screams, Micah goes down to see what is wrong. After a pause Micah's dead body is thrown through the door, into the bedroom. Amber follows, looks at the camera with a sly grin, then reaches out to it and the video goes black.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I found it to be good entertainment.
","Not having seen the earlier 'Chocolate Factory' movie(s?) I of necessity took this one for its own merits. Done in a completely whimsical style, I found it to be good entertainment. I like Johnny Depp and the characters he creates. Here he is Willy Wonka, a grown man, reasonably old, but living in one big candy fantasy, mostly chocolate candy. After years of extreme secrecy about his giant candy factory, he mysteriously decides to allow 5 lucky children (and their chosen adults) to spend a whole day at the factory, showing them all the inner workings. Worldwide, 5 giant chocolate bars each have a golden foil ticket for the day.Young Freddie Highmore is good as Charlie Bucket, living in a slightly slanted and breezy shack with his mum and dad, plus both sets of grandparents, within sight of the Wonka factory. They are so poor he gets to buy only one Wonka bar a year, on his birthday. But Charlie luckily gets to be one of the 5 kids, accompanied by his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly)Once inside the 5 kids begin the tour but know they are in a competition of sorts, at the end of the day one of them will be given a prize beyond their wildest dreams. We see the usual whimsical treatment of chocolate factory workings but, only when Willy opens a small door do we see the real inner workings of the chocolate factory.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Opening the little door reveals a brightly colored fairyland of rivers of warm chocolate and chocolate falls, candy growing on trees, all tended by workers that Charlie had found years earlier in a distant forest. They are miniature people about 2 or 3 feet tall, called the Oompa Loompa. All dozens of them are played by the same actor, small person Deep Roy, through the magic of special effects. The Oompa Loompa love chocolate and work in his factory to make all the chocolate. Trained squirrels crack and clean the nuts. The other 4 kids are all rotten and selfish in different ways, each drops out of the tour as a result of misbehavior. This leaves Charlie to win the prize which was ... to be given the chocolate factory because Willy realized that he will need an heir. But Charlie refuses when it is clear that he would have to leave his family to do so. That is the 'moral' of this movie, family and good behavior are more important than worldly things. In the end all are happy as Willy moves the little shack and all family members inside the factory.(The young Robb actress was one to the kids. She was the girl with the dog in 'Because of Winn Dixie.')",Null,4,6,14 January 2006
Mission: Impossible II," A great film for 'action junkies', with very active surround sound.
","How you 'rate' M:i-2 depends totally on your expectations. If you are expecting a film fairly true to the original TV series, it is probably a '3'. If all you want is some of the finest action and special effects with an aggressive sound track, it is probably a '10'. In reality, the film is somewhere between those two extremes, plays more like a James Bond movie, pretty girl caught between the good and the bad guys, a simple story, of a deadly mutant virus designed to sell the 'cure', and the bad guys always lose in the end. I found it totally enjoyable, laughed often at the intended absurdity of much of it.Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott are fine as the rivals. With all the masks and identity-switching, it is hard to tell sometimes who is who. The DVD picture and sound are first-rate, the rear surround channels are used a lot, with a great impact. As is the subwoofer for the various explosions, and there are lots of them, typical of a John Woo film.The DVD 'extras' are mandatory. Avoid seeing 'M:i-2' on videotape if you can. There are 'making-of' sequences for 11 of the major stunt scenes, describing how they came about, how they were engineered, and how they were shot. In fact, I found that watching the 'making-of' before actually watching the movie added to my enjoyment on first viewing. Some of the more interesting 'extras' commentary describes how Tom Cruise ended up doing almost all of his stunt work, even though they had employed stunt men. Apparently Cruise loves the danger, and seems to be a natural stunt man, learning novel moves very quickly and well. The rock-climbing at Dead Horse Point, the motorcycle 'asphalt skiing', the dive from the helicopter into the office building, the hand-to-hand combat on the beach, the motorcycle jousting scene, and others.Another is a 6-minute MTV spoof, where Ben Stiller plays 'Tom Crooze', the long-time stand-in for Tom Cruise. It is cute and entertaining.I rate it a solid '8' of 10 for overall enjoyment.",Null,1,2,24 November 2000
The Adjustment Bureau," Novel and entertaining movie about destiny, and control of our lives.
","Matt Damon is David Norris. He seems destined for a long and productive political career. When he was only 24 he was elected as a Representative in New York, and now is favored to win a Senate seat. But as the movie opens things get derailed for him.As things are going bad, quite by accident he meets Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas. In fact she is in a stall in the men's room, hiding out, as David is there also, formulating his concession comments. They meet, they kiss, they separate, with no plans to meet again. But they are stuck in each-others' minds.The story is a modern-day fable, where a supreme organization is called the Adjustment Bureau and to avoid any religious references, the head guy is called the Chairman. In a religious terminology we might call this God and his angels. The grand plan has changed, David and Elise are no longer supposed to end up together, but since they do meet, in this city of 9 Million, the Adjustment Bureau is thrown into a panic mode to make things right.Clever story, not to be taken seriously, and very engaging. As are the main actors.SPOILERS: Even though David and Elise are perfect for each other, with David destined to be President of the US, Elise also can become a world-renowned dancer and then choreographer. But if she and David marry she will have to subvert her career. David learns this, even though he is not supposed to, and sets about defeating the 'fate' that the Bureau has for him, and to end up with Elise anyway. In a subordinate idea, it is explained to David, humans once had 'free will', but that resulted in 500 years of the Dark Ages, so the Adjustment Bureau was formed to get humanity back on track.",Null,0,1,16 July 2011
Black Snake Moan," Ricci is fantastic, but this movie may be hard for some to watch.
","Samuel L. Jackson is super as Lazarus, a God-fearing Blues musician. He learned to play a bit of guitar for the role, and does most of his own singing which is effective in a primitive sort of way. He grows vegetables on his home plot and sells it in the nearby small town in Tennessee.Christina Ricci is Rae, a small young woman who appears to be addicted to sex, with almost anyone at any time. A sort of 'blue night' flashback shows her playing football with a bunch of friends, wearing only white panties and shoulder pads. At one point she falls to the ground, one of the guys gets over her, and has a quickie. We wonder why she is like that, seemingly with no personal boundaries.Justin Timberlake is her boyfriend Ronnie who is in the military and being deployed. Right after he leaves, she contacts a large local provider of drugs for some hard, impersonal sex.The movie is rough in many places, has graphic sex depicted, and its share of rough language. However it is a good watch if only for the acting of Ricci and Jackson who inhabit their roles. We wonder, will she die or will she begin redemption before the movie ends?MAJOR SPOILERS. Rae's mother had become pregnant, considered an abortion, and now is sorry that she didn't. Her eventual boyfriend sexually abused Rae, and that is why she developed the sexual addiction. Ronnie returns home, being discharged for being too fearful to fight. Lazarus ends up helping Rae, first by chaining her in his house, and later just by becoming a good friend. As the movie ends we believe Rae and Ronnie will stay on the difficult road to personal redemption for both of them.",Null,1,3,20 July 2007
A Bug's Life," Probably the finest animated film so far, totally enjoyable, even on the 3rd or the 33rd viewing.
","I don't keep track, but I suppose last night with my sister Sylvia was my 6th or 7th viewing of 'A Bug's Life'. Each time it is fresh, and each time I notice new things. There is only one negative thing I can say, the 'extras' on the DVD are very spartan, which is a shame. Because there is a very rich 'making of' documentary just yelling to be included.The animation is truly incredible. The colors are very rich and varied, depending on whether it is a scene in sunlight, at dusk, in the insect 'lounge', inside the anthill, or during a rainstorm. During 'quiet' scenes, the background grass and twigs move almost imperceptably in the breeze, just like they would in real life.The story is simple but unique - bully grasshoppers, led by 'Hopper' (Kevin Spacey), expect the ants to harvest food for them each year. But this year, 'Flick' messes up, and then volunteers to go 'outside the colony' to find ferocious insects that will agree to protect the ants. Ultimately they realize their greatest strength is in numbers.Even with the best animation ever, the simple story would not hold your interest long were it not for the witty dialog. 'See this rock, pretend it is a seed...' or 'Don't panic, we are professionals, we'll just go around the leaf' or '(Flick to Hopper) Yep, that's just another fake bird.' The circus performers and their antics could be a whole movie by themselves.Among animated films this is definitely a '10', among all movies I've seen, I rate it a very strong '8' and destined to become a 'classic.' Last summer my 5-yr-old granddaughter was just mesmerized by 'A Bug's Life' and watched it several times.Edit: It is 2013 now and my granddaughter is now in college!",Null,1,5,24 November 2000
Prisoners," We all are 'prisoners' in one form or another.
","There are two incidents in this movie where people are taken as prisoners, the second resulting from the first, and that is certainly what the title refers to. But in a deeper level it plays on things inside us that we become prisoners of. It could be fear, or the need for revenge, or just how we look at others in the world. It is a deep and involving movie, but some parts are hard to watch.It starts with a typical suburban family walking a few houses down the street to visit another family. After a while the two small girls ask permission to go back and get something, but they don't return. Then a frantic search fails to find them.About the same time the teenagers had noticed an old RV parked on the street nearby, and now it was gone. Everyone suspected the person in the RV had taken the girls, so they search for him.Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover and Terrence Howard is the neighbor Franklin Birch. The two girls taken are their young daughters, and the two of them get involved in the search, at times a bit violently. The mothers are Viola Davis as Nancy Birch and Maria Bello as Grace Dover.The main investigator is Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He goes about systematically doing his job, but is badgered by Keller who thinks he should crack down on the RV driver.Paul Dano is good as the RV driver, Alex Jones.SPOILERS: When Alex is found at a rest stop, for some reason he panics and crashes into some trees and is caught. But questioning him turns up nothing and he is released. Keller doesn't take this well, convinced that Alex is guilty he abducts him and imprisons him in a dilapidated building Keller owns. He tortures him in an attempt to get him to reveal the location of the two girls. In the end they are found held captive by a woman who over the years had taken and eventually killed a number of children. As the movie ends Keller is seen in the building where Alex is still being held, but the cops arrive and we sense Keller will have to answer for his lawlessness.",Null,0,1,5 March 2014
Silence," The 17th century Japan, the purging of Christianity.
","I found this movie on DVD from my local public library, I watched it at home. My wife skipped.This is a very long movie by today's standards but it tells a fascinating story. It is based on a novel but is faithful to the real story, of the reversal of Christianity in 17th century Japan.In the 16th century the Roman Catholic Jesuits (Society of Jesus) spread the Gospel to Japan and at one time it is estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Japanese were converted to Christianity. That was the mission of the Church, to convert the whole world to Christianity.The story in this movie is a fictional account of two priests from Portugal traveling to Japan to search for Father Ferreira, a real historical priest who renounced his Christian faith to become a scholar and writer in Japan. The two younger priests who search for them are unprepared for the persecution and torture that await them, all in the general effort to get all Christians to renounce their faith.The movie is very hard to watch at times, the brutality of the Japanese and their ways of torture and killing. But it is a worthwhile movie in that it depicts the most extreme trials of one's beliefs and how one might react if you were in a similar situation. The younger priests are played by Andrew Garfield as Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Father Garupe. Liam Neeson is Ferreira.Importantly, the story does not completely resolve until the last 10 seconds of the movie, miss that and you have watched 2 hours and 40 minutes without any answer to one key question.",Null,0,1,17 February 2019
For Love of the Game," I really like this movie, for a sports fan, 8 of 10!
","This movie, 'For Love of the Game', spans one complete baseball game, Detroit at NY Yankees, last game of the regular season. In a series of flashbacks Costner's character, the aging all-star pitcher, reminisces over the past 5 years, particularly in his relationship with Kelly Preston's character. In the process, about 2/3 through the game he realizes that he has a perfect game going. In 120 years of baseball, only 18 perfect games have been pitched. So, the drama mounts as we see whether he will succeed, or, as he did in 'Tin Cup', hit it in the lake on #18.If you generally like Costner, like I do, then you will like this movie. The writing is very good, and unlike many modern 'action' movies, this one does a lot of character development. One memorable line - 'No matter what happens during the next 5 minutes, I want you to know my heart lept when you showed up at my door. My heart lept in my chest.'As you find out from the DVD 'extras', real professional baseball players and real major league umpires were used to film the game. For 30 days in Yankee Stadium, just after the season ended, they filmed the action. For that reason the ball play is very realistic, very game-like. Overall a very fine movie.",Null,0,1,13 September 2000
Logan," Lots of gore and violence but a good story to wrap up Wolverine.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. In an interesting addition it has a second disk, of the B&W version of the movie. I will add a note at the end of this after I have time to view it.I have always liked the Wolverine character in the X-Men movies, he is played with the right amount of superpower mixed with angst. This movie is set in the near future, 2029, and Hugh Jackman is back as Logan. (Later in the movie we also see him as a clone, X-24.) Patrick Stewart is back as Charles, aging and delicate, and Logan is caring for him, the X-Men days a distant memory. Until someone shows up looking for Charles and a new mutant.That mutant, one remnant of a series of illegal experiments to grow super soldiers, is little Dafne Keen as approximately 10-yr-old Laura. She has super strength and also the embedded knives in her hands. Before the story is over we find out Logan is in fact her biological father.The movie has a number of scenes with extreme violence and gore, and some vehicle chase scenes, those are virtually mandatory in modern movies. But the story itself is a nice one, the surviving young mutants need to get to a particular place in N. Dakota to seek safe refuge in Canada.I was particularly impressed with the young actress, her character was for me the highlight of the movie.Edit: I popped in the B&W version of this movie and viewed several scenes. I must say it is excellent, the lighting and appropriate contrast make it pop nicely gives it an air of mystery. If I had only watched the movie in B&W I would be totally happy with that. I know some prefer B&W as it gives them the 'cinema' look they enjoy but for me a well-filmed color movie is still better. Color is very important to our reality so why leave it out?",Null,3,5,3 November 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Ultron doesn't know the difference between saving the world and destroying it.
","This is a long movie, a bit over 2 hours and 10 minutes. I saw it at home on DVD. As we expect this has a very aggressive sound track when the scenes demand, with deep bass that rattled the pictures on the wall.This has all the superheroes and Tony Stark (Iron Man) is going out on a limb by himself to fuse his artificial intelligence with some more powerful AI. But it goes awry and Ulton appears, seemingly destined to destroy all of humanity, in his warped thought process he thinks a full extinction will benefit the Earth. As one characters explains 'Ultron doesn't know the difference between saving the world and destroying it.'There is a good mix of action scenes and slower scenes. The filming (digital) take us to such places as London, South Korea, South Africa, and Italy so much of it was filmed in real places. In the end Ultron's plan to destroy the Earth parallels what scientists believe caused mass extinctions in the past, by taking a whole Italian village, the size of a large asteroid, and lifting it so high that when it is dropped it will create the impact that destroys everything. Can the Avengers save the world?I enjoyed it, a fun movie not to be taken too seriously.",Null,1,6,26 October 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Very interesting and funny movie, once you get past the first half-hour.
","I know there are many anti-fans of Adam Sandler, but you got to give him credit, he is amazing as a voice actor in animated movies. Here he is Count Dracula, yes the real one. And as he explains over his long lifetime never has said 'blah, blah, blah' at the end of his phrases.Dracula and all the other monsters feel threatened by humans who always want to hunt them down and kill them. So many years ago he found a very secluded place in Transylvania and built the large, castle-like Hotel Transylvania, almost impossible to find, as a refuge for his family and all the monsters who want to visit there.Selena Gomez voices Dracula's daughter, Mavis, who is having her 'big' birthday, she is turning 118. Her mother had long been departed but had left a gift for Mavis, to be opened on her 118th birthday, it was a reflection on finding your true love.Dad didn't want his headstrong daughter to actually visit a real human city, as she desired, so he built a fake city not far from the Hotel. She visited it, was disappointed, and returned home. But Dracula's inept monsters playing humans set the fake city on fire, this attracted the American hiker, Andy Samberg voicing Jonathan. Dracula is mortified, much like the Monsters in 'Monsters Inc.' reacted when the little girl found her way back to their habitat.Anyway perhaps predictably Mavis and Jonathon fall for each other, Dracula wants to keep them apart, and the funniest part of the whole movie, near the end, is when Jonathon is on a jet liner, and Dracula has changed into a bat, and is hanging onto the jet liner window trying to communicate with Jonathon, while starting to smoke from the burning sun. You know, Vampires cannot be in the sun.Anyway, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie, used to establish the basis for the story, was somewhat tedious. But the last hour or so is totally entertaining.",Null,2,3,2 May 2013
Big Fish," Visually magnificent as we expect with a Tim Burton movie.
","I thoroughly enjoyed 'Big Fish' but find it a difficult movie to rate. Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, and Albert Finney as Edward in his twilight years, are both marvelous. The visuals are superb, and many times I found myself thinking of 'Moulin Rouge' in style, where McGregor played an idealistic songwriter.  The core of this story is Bloom's life of seemingly tall tales, and his son's (Billy Crudup) inability to feel close to his father because he could never get past those tall tales to discover his 'real' father that he was looking for. However, when the movie ends, much like 'Secondhand Lions', we wonder how tall the tales really were!SPOILERS follow -- please quit reading now. The father/son difficulties arise from their opposite personalities. Edward was always the upbeat kid, the one who wasn't afraid of anything, who was the natural athlete, running the winning touchdown, hitting the winning basketball goal at the buzzer, going to the witch's house to see her glass eye, escorting the giant out of town. His son grew up conservative, had a secure job in Paris, married to a pretty French lady, hadn't spoken to his father for over three years, until he gets the call, travels home to see his dying father. Visiting his father, most of his focus was to get his dad to tell him who he really was, to quit telling all the tall tales. But his father insisted, 'This is who I really am.' At the funeral, all sorts of strange characters show up, the giant, the twins, the circus performers. While his tales may have been exaggerated a bit, they all were real. And his son finally realizes who his father really was. The title comes from one of the tales, where Bloom used his gold wedding band to catch this big fish in the lake. In the end, son told his dad a fable of how dad would die, son would carry him to the water, and as he sank, turned into the big fish then swam away, immortal. As were his stories.",Null,1,2,22 June 2004
The Insider," A very well-done movie about the expose' of the dirty, cheating, lying tobacco industry.
","Although somewhat dramatized, 'Insider' is based on the real events and real people which resulted in the mid-90s expose' in the USA by TV's '60 Minutes' of the dirty, lying, money-grubbing tobacco industry. Since I am not a smoker, and have little regard for long-time smokers, I paid very little attention to the real events when they happened. However, this movie provides a fascinating insight into the TV news business, and the tactics of the dirty, lying, money-grubbing tobacco companies and their CEOs and their lawyers.Al Pacino as usual does a fine job as the '60 Minutes' producer. Interestingly, the insider, Jeff Wigand and the B&W CEO are both played by British actors, Russell Crowe and Michael Gambon, but they both do credible jobs with 'American' accents. Crowe, especially, is superb as Jeff Wigand.I saw this on DVD. Although it has a couple of interesting extras, including glimpses of some of the real characters, the DD 5.1 soundtrack is disappointing.  Except for a couple of early scenes, one in a cafeteria and one with rain, there is virtually no sound in the rear channels.  Not up to today's standards for 5.1 sound.Overall I rate this movie '9' of '10' and one that everyone should see.",Null,2,4,19 July 2000
The Dark Knight," Smashing follow-up to Batman Begins.
","I really like the first one in this current series, 'Batman Begins', because it takes us from Bruce Wayne's young years and then through his mystical training, and his beginnings to fight crime in Gotham City. This second installment is better in many ways, but for me doesn't quite have the charm of the first.Christian Bale of course is back as Bruce Wayne and Batman. But his childhood sweetheart and now District Attorney lawyer is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She does a fine job but is a definite step down from Katie Holmes.Most of the buzz has been, especially after his untimely death, Heath Ledger as The Joker. This Joker is quite different from the character Jack Nicholson played in the 1989 version, more sinister and more dangerous. He doesn't have any grand plan, he just enjoys wreaking havoc, and his mission here is to kill innocent people and cause destruction until he succeeds in having Batman's identity revealed. Ledger is chillingly good in this role.Aaron Eckhart is introduced as Harvey Dent who, after getting caught up in an explosion, becomes Two-Face. Michael Caine is back as Bruce Wayne's butler and father figure, Alfred Pennyworth, and plays the role just perfectly. As well as Gary Oldman, back as cop James Gordon. And Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, now head of the Wayne corporation and Bruce's personal scientific consultant.The new crime boss is Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni, and he is superb in the role. I have always been a fan of Roberts' and it is good to see him in a feature role as this.Overall a fine movie, both as a drama and as an action movie.",Null,0,6,16 December 2008
Everest," Tragic 1996 climb of Mt Everest.
","I managed to watch this on an HBO channel while hanging out in the Colorado Rockies for a few days. It is a pretty well filmed story of the tragedy on the Everest climb in May 1996. Several people died, including some experienced guides, when the weather turned mean. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the first half, showing the people and what it takes to train and pay for such an adventure. I remember it because Beck Weathers, a Dallas area physician, was one of the men in the expedition. He had some grave difficulties and was left for dead on the mountain. However he stumbled down the mountain in the morning, badly frostbitten, eventually losing part of his right arm plus all the fingers on his left hand, parts of both feet, and part of his nose. But he survived in what turned out to be a most expensive and life-changing experience.I believe I'll stay on my comfortable couch and watch it.",Null,0,0,12 July 2018
Friends with Benefits," Not as 'love-less' as I expected, in fact a pretty good story.
","I have a friend, a 50-ish lady, who not long ago described her relationship with a certain man as 'we are friends, with benefits.' Honestly I had never heard it described that way, but she explained it. Then this movie came out and I was leery. But then we saw it, and both my wife and I thought it is pretty good. The dialog is snappy and rings true, and the two leads are quite good and convincing.Justin Timberlake is Dylan Harper, a hot-shot West Coast editor on a web-based publication, and gets offered an interview trip to New York, for the job as editor for GQ Magazine. He says he is just going for the trip, but things develop.Mila Kunis is the headhunter, Jamie Rellis. She meets him at the airport, and when he balks at considering the job she tells him, 'I am not going to try to sell you on the job, I'm going to sell you on New York.' She succeeds, he moves to the City, the two of them are naturally relaxed and fun together, and become best friends.Then, just bantering one day one of them suggests, why go without sex while we are both between relationships, let's just do it, with no strings attached, and it will be like playing tennis. When it is over we shake hands and say see you around.Of course if that had worked then there wouldn't be much of a movie past that point. It gets romantically complicated when they both begin to have deeper feelings for each other and at the same time deny those feelings.Three other characters add greatly to the enjoyment of the movie. Patricia Clarkson is Jamie's wild and loose mother, who shows up without notice, and at least once Jamie and Dylan are in bed, naked when she walks in.Old reliable Richard Jenkins is Dylan's dad, with early onset of dementia. Sometimes he just takes off his pants, in public, because he gets tired of wearing them. But in the end he gives his son the key advice, if you think she even might be the one, go after her. Life is short.And Woody Harrelson is Tommy Bollinger, the openly gay sports editor. He plays the part perfectly.A fun, entertaining movie, but for adults.",Null,0,0,10 January 2012
The Greatest Game Ever Played," The match that changed the face of golf in America.
","Historically, the invention of golf is credited to the Scots, and many consider St. Andrews, Scotland as the cradle of golf. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, worldwide golf was dominated by the Brits and in America only a select few of the wealthy had the privilege to play the game. Young boys from working class families became caddies, the ones who carried the bags.This movie is based on a true story, and is taken from the book of the same name. It was 1913 and the Brit Harry Vardon was generally considered the best golfer of the era, sort of a modern day Tiger Woods. In addition, his legacy lives on even today as he is credited with the modern way of gripping the golf club and overall game. So, it was almost a formality that he would travel to the USA one more time and bring back the US Open trophy.Shia LaBeouf plays a young Francis Ouimet, working class boy, and former caddie at the country club across the street. That he even had the gall to try to play golf, a 'gentleman's game' (meaning a wealthy game), was met with ridicule. But, as history witnesses, he not only played in the 1913 US Open, at the end he was tied with the great Harry Vardon and another Brit, Ted Ray.Ouimet's play in that 1913 Open is widely credited with changing the face of golf in America. No longer was it considered a game only for the rich. In the next 10 years the number of people playing golf tripled. So, more than anything, young 20-year-old Francis Ouimet became the catalyst for making golf a popular game.Overall this is a well-done movie, and worthwhile mainly for the story it tells, an important one in the history of golf.SPOILERS. In case anyone doesn't know, Ouimet, Vardon, and Ray had an 18-hole playoff, and Ouimet beat Vardon by one stroke to win the 1913 US Open against professionals. One of the greatest victories in all of sport history.",Null,0,2,11 May 2006

","OK, look, I'm a 62-year-old grandpa, and long ago gave up keeping track of all the story lines in these movies. I enjoyed the first one most, because it introduced me to the characters and the fantasy world that they are in. So I no longer try to keep track of everything, I just sit back and enjoy what I see on the screen.Daniel Radcliffe as most of us have come to see is the embodiment of Harry Potter, the fictional character. He has matured and now has the opportunity to take a leadership role among the young wizards, to fight off the evils that seem to be invading Hogwarts school. Emma Watson is back as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. The two of them along with Potter make up what is most fun to watch. The rest of the characters, to me, are just there to allow the story to unfold and for Harry, Hermoine, and Ron to save the day. I enjoyed it, but I suspect only die-hard Potter fans can get the full benefit of the movies anymore.",Null,1,3,27 December 2007
Into the Wild," Based on a true story, a young man's journey to find himself by going into the wild.
","Emile Hirsch is Chris McCandless, just graduating from college. He is good-looking and bright, and clearly has a bright future. But he is put off by the 'demands' of society. Why should it be demanded that he further his education? An early sign in the movie was when his mom and dad offered to buy him a new car as a graduation gift. He didn't want it. 'My old car runs just fine, it should last several more years.' So Chris decided to go off on a personal trek to find out what his life should really be about. He doesn't tell his parents or his younger sister, he just disappears, donating a large chunk of money to charity. He gets rid of all personal identification, and even loses his car in an overnight flash flood in a low spot in the desert.He adopts a new name, Alex Supertramp, and moves about the country, working at odd jobs here and there, flipping burgers or driving a wheat harvesting machine. He makes many new friends but always moves along soon.His great quest is to spend time in the Alaska wild, and he makes it there, with a very few supplies and a rifle. His great find is an old bus that had been made into a camp with a stove and a mattress, and that becomes his home. It is difficult but he makes it.This is a good movie, but I probably don't rate it as highly as many others do. But it was an enjoyable 2+ hours.Marcia Gay Harden is his mother Billie McCandless and William Hurt is his father Walt McCandless.SPOILER FOLLOWS: Many who have not even seen the movie know that Chris did not survive his stay in Alaska, but it was an unusual death. Hungry, he used books to identify safe berries for human consumption. But one night he fell very ill and when he double-checked the identity it tuned out to be a berry that blocks nutrition absorption, and there was no cure. So he died of starvation.

"Girl, Interrupted"," A very good, and sometimes funny, mental health drama based on a true story.
","Until I actually rented the DVD I didn't realize 'Girl, Interrupted', is based on a real person, Susanna Kaysen, who based her book on experiences in 1967 and 1968 as a teenager in a mental institution. As with many, many teenagers, it turns out she is far from being 'crazy', just lazy about addressing her hang-ups, and resisting 'growing up.'I rate this movie a solid 8 of 10. The acting is uniformly good, including Caryn Elaine Johnson as nurse Valerie. Of course Angeline Jolie won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Winona Ryder, who also produced the movie, has the lead role of Susanna Kaysen, and she does her usual superb job. In a brief role as Dr. Wick, Vanessa Redgrave I feel gave perhaps the most believable performance of all. Many older movies involving mental institutions exaggerate the conditions and happenings in them. This one did not. The portrayals were very realistic, the 'inmates' as well as the staff. The film did a neat job of relating Dorothy's quest to get home in the 'Wizard of Oz' to Susanna's quest to get out of the hospital and live a normal life. This worked well for this movie.The DVD has some interesting features, including an interview with the real Susanna Kaysen who is now about 50. In photos of her at 17 she looks remarkably like Winona Ryder's characterization. However, she has not 'aged very gracefully', if you know what I mean!  :-) The deleted scenes were mostly to shorten the original cut of the film from over 3 hours to just over 2 hours. Parts of the film move a bit slowly and 3 hours would have been way too much. One of the deleted scenes relates the title of the movie to the painting, 'Girl, Interrupted.'Overall a good film, gets you thinking about life, and makes you glad you somehow survived your own teenage years.One more thing. Caryn Elaine Johnson is the real name of Whoopi Goldberg...",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," The evolution of mankind, according to Clarke and Kubrick.
","I was a young married man in 1968. My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. I remember it well, as it ended we looked at each other, and one of us said, 'We must have missed something.' So we sat there, didn't move out of our seats, and watched it a second time. We still didn't 'get it.' I suspect a lot of theater-goers in 1968/1969 didn't 'get' this movie.Now I was able to see it again, thanks to the recently-released 10 DVD set of Kubrick films. I have the set on loan from my public library. Maybe just because I am older, have lived a lot, it all seems much clearer now.The movie starts in prehistoric times when the most intelligent animals are black, hairy, and ape-like. They are meek, huddle together for comfort, and forage for food. One day they awake to find a black monolith in their midst, they crowd around it, they touch it, and soon after they 'evolve', they learn to use bones as tools and clubs, they fight, they eat what they kill. These apes have become early man, by virtue of their encounter with the black monolith.Is it a supreme being, God? Or is it a far advanced race of intelligent life that provided the monolith and its spark of evolution? I suppose the answer depends on whether one is a theist or an atheist.Then, what many call the longest 'fast-forward' in the history of film, the story advances to about the year 1999, and we join a space plane on its trip to a base on the moon. It seems modern instruments have detected an unusual magnetic field and they find buried 40 feet below the surface a black monolith, apparently just like the one the apes encountered millions of years earlier. The monolith is sending a strong signal towards the planet Jupiter.So this 1999 encounter with a monolith must be considered to spark the next evolutionary step, and 18 months later we join a mission to Jupiter, five astronauts, three in a 'hibernation' mode. They are led by Keir Dullea as Dr. Dave Bowman and with a state of the art, thinking and reasoning computer, the HAL 9000. There isn't much dialog in the whole movie and the most memorable is between Dave and HAL.Finally, as Dave is the only survivor of the mission, there is yet another monolith, in orbit around Jupiter. Dave's encounter with it results in a 10-minute light and special effects show on film, representing his encounter, where he is placed into an environment designed to mimic home, much like we humans capture zoo animals and put them in a habitat that mimics their natural environment. After some accelerated aging, Dave is re-born as a type of star child that represents the next evolution of mankind, and as the movie ends is being sent back to Earth, ostensibly to preserve it from destruction by Earth's own inhabitants.The DVD has an interesting special feature which is commentary by the two main actors, and their insights are very interesting. One thing they mention, it was filmed in 1965 and 1966.Good movie. Even though many scenes are slow and very drawn out, in all it didn't seem as long as its running time would suggest.",Null,5,12,4 April 2013

","It was 1999 and civil war was raging in the small western Africa country of Sierra Leone. One of the ways to make money to buy weapons was smuggling raw diamonds to a different country where they were sold as their own production.Leonardo DiCaprio is South African Danny Archer who has no apparent concern for others and is one of those in the business. We see him making a deal with a rebel, then getting caught trying to smuggle diamonds stitched into a cut on the back of a sheep, for which he ended up in jail. There he became aware of Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy, a native who had been taken into diamond mining slavery, and who it was thought had hidden a big, pink diamond somewhere near the mine.Jennifer Connelly is Maddy Bowen, an American reporter who goes into various countries looking for stories.

The theme is that big countries, the USA in this story, easily take on the role as savior of other countries, believing they can go in, full battle uniform and weapons, and bring peace to an area that is in the midst of an often long-running war. Hubris.The main character here is Brad Pitt as Gen. Glen McMahon, West Point graduate, highly intelligent, and just off dealing with issues in Iraq. Glen is guilty himself of hubris. He thinks his organizational skills and determination will 'win the war' in Afghanistan. He is brought in, as the movie starts, to replace the general who failed to get it done.His main right-hand man is burly Anthony Michael Hall as General Greg Pulver. His main task seems to be to keep reassuring McMahon that he is great, he is on the right track, perseverance will get it done.Overall it is a tragic tale, it seems to mostly be pointing to the folly of thinking that a country can address the centuries old attitudes and practices and bring a democracy to what appears to be a heathen nation. This movie isn't for everyone but I am glad I took the time, it has to make one think. And Pitt is really good as the General with hubris.",Null,1,2,19 June 2017
Midsommar," 'You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave!' (Hotel California)
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library, not my wife's type of movie.This was made by the same writer/director that brought us 'Hereditary' a year earlier, I like this one much more. It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours.",Null,1,2,4 December 2019
Pride & Prejudice," A nicely watchable adaptation of the Jane Austen novel.
","It has been well-established that a 2-hour movie can contain only a small fraction of the novel it is based on, so I suspect the various versions of 'Pride and Prejudice' over the years have different significantly in their 'focus', all the while attempting to be true to the spirit of the novel. I am not a great fan of this genre, but wanted to see it for the acclaim received by its star, Keira Knightley. In real life she seems to be quite a sharp wit, so this was a perfect role for her, the sharp-witted and independent Elizabeth Bennet. I enjoyed the movie very much. The basic story involves a family with 5 daughters, and the mother (Brenda Blethyn in one of her patented roles) is eager to marry them off to men of at least some wealth. Four of the daughters are fairly compliant, but Liz is too independent and strong-willed to marry someone she doesn't love, a concept which amuses her father (Donald Sutherland). While mum tries to facilitate the union between her daughter Jane (pretty blonde Rosamund Pike) and the wealthy suitor, Liz happens to meet sullen Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) and they hit it off badly from the very beginning. Liz finds out other things which make her even less eager to ever see Mr Darcy again. So the rest of the movie has all the main characters visiting here and there, the mysteries of courtship in the middle of it all. It seems that the whole preoccupation of the young ladies is finding a husband and living that life. I suspect it was back then.The SPOILERS FOLLOW. Liz eventually and gradually finds out that much of what she first learned about Mr Darcy were exaggerations or lies and that, in fact, he is a very generous person. Also he is shy and, after he knows someone, breaks out quite a bit. Add to that, he has fallen deeply in love with Liz. As she also falls for him, we see the mechanics of their working it out and the movie ends with them married and sharing small talk.",Null,0,4,18 March 2006
Singin' in the Rain," Most likely the best musical ever filmed, although I sure like 'Cats' and 'A Chorus Line' too!.
","'Singing In The Rain' is unique in that the song actually inspired the movie. It is set in Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Gene Kelly, 39 when it was made, stars as Don Lockwood, silent film star. Donald O'Connor was 26, played Cosmo Brown, Lockwood's long-time sidekick. And 19-yr-old Debbie Reynolds, in already her 6th film, plays Kathy Seldon, aspiring legitimate (stage) actress set on going to NYC. Lockwood met her initially when he was escaping overzealous fans and leaped into her car from a streetcar top. Also, they later met again when she jumped out of a cake at a party. She obviously needed work!However, the character who really makes the whole story possible, and the movie fantastic, is Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Lockwood's silent screen co-star, who also happens to be a totally self-absorbed person with the most irritating voice possible. Hagen is absolutely perfect in this role, and I understand she received an Oscar nomination for it.   In 1927, the first 'talkie', 'The Jazz Singer' with Al Jolson, changed movies forever. Suddenly the 'talkies' were making all the money and the Lockwood/Lamont team had to follow or close down. No amount of diction coaching could get Lamont to sound good, and the audience could only laugh at the test screening just 6 weeks before scheduled opening. Cosmo had a great idea - Kathy would dub in her voice over Lina's. Also, the serious 'Dueling Cavaliers' would become a musical, 'The Dancing Cavaliers.'
The new musical is a big hit, Lina gets coerced by the live audience to sing a song, but it was Kathy singing behind the curtain. Midway through it, they raised the curtain to expose the truth, Lina was put in her place, and the new team of Lockwood and Selden was a hit, on and off the big screen.Except for an extended surreal dance scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, which seemed to break the continuity of the story, the movie is almost perfect. I rate it '9' of 10. Of course Kelly was choreographer, and co-director, so I suppose he just wanted that number in. The several energetic dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor are simply great, as are the two individual solo numbers, 'Singing in the Rain' by Kelly, right after Don leaves Kathy's apartment, realizing he is in love with her, and 'Make 'Em Laugh' by O'Connor, which includes his running up two different inclining walls and back-flipping off them. Who knew Debbie Reynolds could dance so well, and hold her own with Kelly and O'Connor??  Well, she couldn't until she was cast for the part, and she literally worked herself to bleeding feet in rehearsing for the production numbers, and all her hard work shows. She became a dancer for this role.I love music, and I love good dancing. I cannot watch a film like this without mentally comparing the two great dancers of 1950s film, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. I suppose Astaire was the greater 'pure dancer' of the two, with always perfect positions and movements that would just glide over the floor.  Kelly, however, is my overall favorite of the two. Not only is he a superb dancer, his more athletic build and dancing style, combined with good looks and singing voice, make him more believable in the musical film roles they both starred in.",Null,6,10,28 May 2001
Puss in Boots," Very impressive and entertaining animated story.
","Puss in Boots as a fairy tale character has been around for a long time but its popularity has been renewed as one of the characters in the 'Shrek' animated movies. Now we have his own story that tells us how he got his start.Antonio Banderas is of course the voice of Puss in Boots We learn that he was an orphaned kitten and grew up in an old Mexico orphanage. One of his close friends, that he considered as a brother, was Humpty Alexander Dumpty. They had parted ways but meet again with bad blood between them. However they cooperate to steal the magic beans from Mr and Mrs Jack and Jill, so that they can get to the land of the giant and the goose that lays the golden eggs.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A different type of love story, Jim Carrey's third serious movie.
","Jim Carrey's first two serious movies were 'The Truman Show' and 'The Majestic'. Now, he has made a third, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', the title apparently taken from a quote from Alexander Pope, spoken by the Kirsten Dunst character. I like this movie and also liked 'Being John Malkovich'. Both of them require the viewer to accept that we are able to visualize what is going on inside someone's mind. If you can't accept that premise, then the movie is not for you. Carrey is good as Joel Barish, but Kate Winslet is even better as his kookie American romantic interest, Clementine Kruczynski. Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Howard Mierzwiak who has developed the medical technique featured in the movie. But before you watch this movie, take out your map and locate Montauk, which is the most eastern community on Long Island, NY. SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading if you have not yet seen the movie. Seriously!!The first scene in the movie is also the last scene. We see Joel mysteriously running from his normal work-bound platform to take the train to Montauk, and he isn't certain why. He walks the beach, talks to himself, is shy, but sees Clementine there. They ride the same train back, she is gregarious and initiates conversation. This is their second time to 'discover' each other, but neither realizes that. In between the movie's beginning and end, we see them getting closer together, only to have issues appear, and she impulsively takes a new treatment where the doctor and his staff 'map' the brain activity of what a person wants to forget, then erases all those specific memories overnight with a contraption on the patient's head. She forgets Joel. Hurt, Joel does the same, but during his procedure has second thoughts, realizes he doesn't really want to forget her, unable to wake up he tries to hide his memories of her in places not mapped by the doctor. We view all this going on in his mind. As a last resort he whispers 'Montauk', and both of them end up there, re-discover each other, and we see them trying again. Point being, if you were attracted to each other before, even though your memories are gone, you will be attracted again.",Null,2,5,14 October 2004
Elysium," We were entertained, but the movie overall was a bit disjointed.
","OK, here's a story set in the mid-22nd century, a recurring theme in many modern movies, humanity has not been good stewards of the Earth's natural resources, buildings are crumbling, and now only the less fortunate remain living and working there.The really wealthy live in Elysium, a giant ring-like space colony that appears to be in a synchronous Earth orbit, which would make it roughly 22,000 miles away. Traveling to such a space colony would be a bit more difficult, and take a lot longer, than is depicted here. The very wealthy who control Elysium have rules, and a defense system to back up the rules, so that undesirables are not allowed to travel there. But a man has traveled to Earth, he has some sort of computer code in his brain, and if they can steal it maybe the Earthlings can gain access to Elysium.All this of course reminds me of real world situations today, examples are Mexicans or Cubans trying to get into the USA however they can. Swim the Rio Grande. Float by small boat. Face capture and deportation. Was this movie, 'Elysium', just made as a social commentary? Or is it just using that theme because it has been so true for all of recorded history? The 'haves' wanting to keep the 'have-nots' suppressed? Like we see in the 'Hunger Games.' Matt Damon is the main character, Max, a lowly ex-criminal and now production worker on Earth. Resulting from a job incident, where he is accidentally exposed to debilitating radiation, and only has a week to live, he has great incentive to get to Elysium where modern medicine can cure him. Plus a few others.So, if you take away the futuristic premise, the story just becomes another 'us against them' battle, and there are lots of battles in the movie. In fact a bit too much hand-to-hand fighting instead of more interesting story-telling.Jodie Foster has an interesting role, as basically bad Delacourt who doesn't mind killing a few people if it will keep the Earthlings out of Elysium. Very cute Alice Braga, about 30 but aging very well, is Frey who has a daughter who needs care.We enjoyed it as a diversion, entertainment by Blu-Ray on a Saturday night after dinner. But other than the novelty of a dying Earth and a fancy space colony, there isn't too much of an interesting story here.",Null,0,1,12 January 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," Epic telling of a NY gangster's whole life from about 13.
","I watched this at home on DVD, 2 discs, 229 minute version, from my public library. I recently was looking at the IMDb top 250 list and one of the movies I had never seen was this one, currently residing at #68 on the list. So this viewing satisfied my curiosity. Of note it is the last feature film of the noted director Sergio Leone.The movie is long but that never becomes a factor in watching it, because every scene is so interesting. The late and great critic Ebert wrote of it, 'Is the film too long? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that it takes real concentration to understand Leone's story construction, in which everything may or may not be an opium dream, a nightmare, a memory, or a flashback, and that we have to keep track of characters and relationships over fifty years. No, in the sense that the movie is compulsively and continuously watchable and that the audience did not stir or grow restless as the epic unfolded.'It is a story about a group of Jewish teenagers in New York and how their lives developed and played out over 60+ years. The earlier scenes are during early 1920s when Prohibition was in full force, other scenes are during 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, some in the 1960s, and the latest ones in the early 1980s, the period this movie was actually filmed.Robert De Niro, around 40, is David 'Noodles' Aaronson and his bestie is James Woods, around 35, as Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz. They become the two most influential members of the group that got rich on a number of illegal activities.In many places the story is hard to follow because few clues are given as to when exactly some things are taking place. You have to guess based on the vehicles you see, the age certain characters look, what kind of music is playing, etc. So when it is all over you are not really sure what all you saw and what exactly the stories are. Still it is easy to see why this movie is highly rated. I enjoyed every minute of it but it is not the type of movie I'd watch multiple times.",Null,0,6,16 August 2016
Taken," This is my kind of movie, California dad goes after the crooks who kidnapped his young daughter in Paris.
","Luc Besson writes the kinds of movies I enjoy watching. Not all of his, but movies like 'Nikita', 'Messenger', and 'Leon' are some of my favorites. He co-wrote this movie, 'Taken', and it is a good one. Not surprisingly it goes back to a city he knows well, Paris.Liam Neeson is a mostly retired Bryan Mills. We don't exactly know what he did before retirement, but in conversations with his 3 buddies, and when we see him defend a young singer when he is hired for one gig as a bodyguard, we know he has skills most 50-ish men don't have.We also find out that he has been mostly absent in the growing-up years of his 17-year-old daughter, but he has moved to Southern California to be close enough to be in her life.Famke Janssen is Bryan's ex-wife Lenore. She is now married to a wealthy man who has made life easy for her and the daughter.With that as background, the story starts when the daughter requests to go to Paris to stay with a friend's relatives, and spend a lot of time visiting Paris museums and libraries. But because she is a minor both parents have to approve of her traveling out of the country. Bryan is very reluctant, he has seen enough to know it is dangerous for naive teen girls to be traveling alone. Add to that a deception ... the girls really had a multi-city European trip planned to follow around their favorite rock group in a musical tour. Lenore knew this but withheld that from Bryan.After a scene Bryan, with grave reservations, agreed to let his daughter go, but only if she would call him as soon as she arrived, and each day to assure him she was OK. As soon as the two girls got to Paris things started to go bad, and Bryan had to press himself into action.I like this movie because it is a classic matching of wits of a determined good guy, Bryan, against the criminal element. Plus it is long enough at 90 minutes to tell the story but still short enough to never get boring. I highly recommend it.SPOILERS FOLLOW: There is an Albanian criminal element operating in Paris to nab pretty, young girls and sell them into sexual slavery. They employ young men to attract the attention of targets by offering to share a cab ride from the airport. This lets them know where the girls are staying so that a trained team can come in and kidnap the girls. Which is what happens here, made easier by the adult relatives being in Spain, details they share with the young man. But Bryan is on the phone with his daughter when the kidnappers arrive, and he is able via tape recording to get important clues, plus a brief conversation where he tells the kidnapper that if he doesn't release the teens right away he would be tracked down and killed. 'Good luck' says the crook, and these two words enable Bryan to know when he met him face-to-face. Bryan is very good at what he does, he finds the girls, kills all the crooks eventually, and even in the process exposes some police payola activity which ends up giving him his free pass to leave France.",Null,0,0,16 July 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," Unique film, a Christopher Guest showcase, somewhat overrated.
","SPOILERS - My first exposure to Chris Guest was his 'Best in Show'. I rented 'This Is Spinal Tap' to see what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed it, but think it is somewhat overrated, much as 'Best In Show', by the relatively few people who see these movies. I think it is a legitimate '7' of 10.
This is a parody of both documentaries and of the British rock bands. This band is pretty hapless, as are its members. It is done in the form of a series of interviews by Rob Reiner's character, with some good performances sprinkled in.  A few genuine funny scenes, like the 'Stonehenge' set that is built to the specification of 18 inches, instead of the desired 18 feet, because the 'Tap member who drew the rough sketch didn't know the difference between the inch and feet symbols. As most Guest films, this one is just over 80 minutes. The DVD is very sharp and the sound quite good, plus the extras have lots of deleted scenes. The DVD is a 'must own' for Chris Guest or 'Spinal Tap' fans.",Null,3,7,1 November 2001
Alice in Wonderland," Very interesting take on the Alice in Wonderland story.
","I've been around a long time, I have read lots of fiction, and I have seen lots of movies. But I must count myself among those who was only vaguely familiar with the story here, 'Alice in Wonderland.' I knew it had to do with falling into a hole, and encountering some unusual creatures, but not much else.This movie starts with Alice as a young girl, and discussing imagination with her father who always told her you can't do the impossible until you believe that it is possible.The main of this movie however is of Alice in her late teen years, and as she is proposed to by a geeky red-haired guy, she runs off to think. And that is when she accidentally falls down a hole at the base of a large tree. This is evidently her second time down the hole, the first when she was much younger. Seems everyone in that strange land is waiting for her. Because she must help defeat the large-headed red queen, in favor of the nicer white queen.Johnny Depp has top billing as the Mad (as in 'crazy') Hatter. Young Australian actress Mia Wasikowska is teenage Alice. Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is the White Queen. And Alan Rickman voices the animated Blue Caterpillar.Visually the film is excellent. It is not all fun and happiness, in fact it is a fairly 'dark' film. But I am glad I finally saw 'Alice in Wonderland.'",Null,1,1,30 June 2010
The Mummy Returns," Very formulaic adventure flick but one with enough action to hold your attention.
","I thought 'The Mummy' was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. However, 'The Mummy Returns' is a quite different and more exciting film that kept my attention all the way. Lots of action, and a very aggressive sound track with good use of the rear surround channels. The DVD picture is also uniformly good all the way.I like Brendan Frasier and I like Rachel Weisz, and they seem very appropriate as parents with a young son. The story line was a bit hard to follow at times, with the mummy coming back and the Scorpion King coming back, but it involved an ancient bracelet that their son put on his arm, which protected him as long as he wore it, and all the bad guys trying to get it. The bracelet gave the boy visions of where to follow the get to a particular pyramid. As you would expect, the good guys prevailed in the end, after many chase scenes and sword fight and gun fights. 
OK film, easily forgettable, but with superb action and special effects. Another film greatly influenced by 'Indiana Jones' films. Plus great to watch Rachel Weisz and Brendan Frasier.",Null,2,5,13 January 2003
The World's Fastest Indian," The (mostly) true story of Burt Munro and his fastest Indian motorcycle.
","Burt Munro was a real New Zealander born in 1899, and grew up liking motorcycles and racing them successfully. In 1921 he bought a new Indian motorcycle, a 600 cc bike with rather basic technology that had a top speed of maybe 55 mph. But Burt loved to tinker, and over the years he owned it he kept making changes to give the bike a higher top speed. While still running in New Zealand in the 1950s had gotten up into the 130s. By the time he went over 200 miles per hour at Utah Salt Flats during Speed Week, the little 600 cc engine with side valves had grown to almost 1000 cc with modern overhead cams and state of the art innards.This movie, starring Anthony Hopkins as Burt Munro, expands on one particular slice of Munro's life - 1962 when he first packaged up his Indian and worked his way to California as a cook on a cargo ship. Totally unprepared for what faced him in the USA, the film shows how he used his charm and ingenuity to get a car, build a trailer, and haul his Indian to Utah. But he neglected a minor detail -- you had to pre-register to make a speed run. For Burt Munro, just another minor obstacle to work around.The movie takes license with chronology. In the movie he goes over 200 miles per hour on his very first trip when, in fact, he didn't get that fast until several years and several trips later. I suspect other facts were combined or compressed to allow an interesting movie in under 2 hours.But overall it is a superb movie, more about Burt Munro the man than about the Indian and how fast it could go. Anthony Hopkins was of similar age as Burt Munro in the 1960s, and does a super job in this movie. The DVD has some interesting extras including quite a bit of footage of the real Burt Munro in his 60s or 70s.Sept 2012 edit: Just watched it again after 6 years, I enjoyed it as much the second time. Very good movie.",Null,1,1,1 August 2006
Avatar," See it for the cutting edge animation that looks more realistic than anything ever has.
","James Cameron has done it again. He surely knows how to make a movie that captures the fancy of viewers of all ages and from all walks of life. While the actual story is good, its only novelty is that it is based on the distant planet Pandora, and visitors must be put into a cryo-cooled state for the long journey, then awakened upon arrival. Other than that it is a standard story of peoples from different backgrounds with an unlikely love story interwoven. Think Pilgrims and Natives, John Smith and Pocohontas, Romeo and Juliet.The 'hook' in this movie is the creation of the hybrid Avatar, which has both Earthling DNA and Pandorian DNA, so the resulting being, grown in large pods that simulate development in a womb, emerges fully grown, and is very tall and blue. But this Avatar can't function on its own, it must be controlled by its Earthling, the one whose DNA was used. The Earthling enters a special compartment, and via special electrodes is able to see through the Avatar's eyes, speak through it, run, fight, and everything else through it. But when the Earthling is disconnected the Avatar falls into a deep sleep and remains that way until the Earthling activates it again. This can be tricky! So why are they doing all this? One, to study the Pandorian race, whose atmosphere will not support Earthling life without a special breather. So the Avatar solves that problem. But there is also a rare metal, Unobtanium (I chuckled at their choice of that name!), which is desperately needed on Earth, but the richest deposits are in the ground under and around the Tree of Life where the Pandorians have made their main home. The peace-loving scientists want to gain Pandorian cooperation to have them move, but their religious connections make that unlikely. The competing group are military and their motto is, if they won't move peacefully then lest blast them out of there, let's incinerate them.The main character is a crippled man, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully. His identical twin brother was to control the Avatar Jake, but unfortunately was killed so Jake, having the same DNa, made him a match. But he had missed the special training. His love interest is the Pandorian, Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is the site scientific leader, Dr. Grace Augustine, and she has her own Avatar.The militant leader is Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch. And the commercial leader, pushing for something to be done is Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge.The animation is superb, the motion-capture technology, which was NOT part of the DVD extras, must have been exotic to enable them to make such realistic looking characters. You really forget you are looking at animation. I didn't care for the extreme fighting and military action in the last act, but overall a very good movie.SPOILERS: It looked like the militant Earthlings were going to be successful in destroying the Pandorians and their society. But Jake, getting to know them, turned his talents to help the Pandorians who ultimately prevailed. Then, at the end, a way was found where Jake would fully inhabit his Avatar, and the old Earthling Jake would die. he ended up as a Pandorian himself.",Null,4,7,11 May 2010
Toy Story 2," 'Life is only worth living with the love of a boy', says Buzz Lightyear to Woody.
","And that quote in my summary, above, is the whole essence of 'Toy Story 2'. This happens during an encounter in the toy store where Woody has to decide whether to go to Japan with his 'sidekicks' and be admired through plexiglass by millions, or stay with Andy as he grows up and eventually discards his toys. Woody has decided to go to Japan.The story starts with Andy going to camp and Woody being left behind because of a rip in his right shoulder stitching. Mom throws a yard sale, and picks the penguin to sell. As Woody rescues him, with the help of the family pup, Woody falls off and is stolen by a dishonest local toy store owner who had been looking for an original 'Woody' to complete his set. Including Jessie (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and the horse. Jessie does a nice song, voiced by Sarah Maclaughlin.This is a very fun movie, the allure being the various 'chase scenes' and narrow escapes - the toys commandeering a vehicle, crossing the busy intersction under hazard cones, the elevator sequence, the airport baggage sequence, the daring runway escape from the jetliner baggage compartment. Animation and dialog are great all the way through. The central message is good, that cooperation, loyalty, and 'family' are important to happiness. However, that theme and exciting action and escape sequences are now the central ingredient in all successful animated films of late.Still, my favorite 'animated' film is Disney's 'Tarzan', followed by 'A Bug's Life' and the clay-mation 'Chicken Run', then 'Toy Story 2.'  All of them are great, and a 'favorite' comes down to personal preference. I rate 'Toy Story 2' an '8' of 10, and I certainly don't think it deserves #30 all-time, which is where it currently sits on the Imdb.",Null,0,3,25 November 2000
Drag Me to Hell," This is a good, scary horror movie with a little touch of comedy at just the right places.
","I don't usually watch horror movies and, when I do, they seldom are actually surprising or scary to me. But 'Drag Me To hELL' is the real deal, it gave me shivers a number of times, and while I thought I had the wrap-up figured out 30 minutes before it ended, it kept surprising me all the way to the end. Neat movie.However, as cute as she is, and as good as she was in 'Matchstick Men', I don't believe Alison Lohman is a very good actress. Or maybe this wasn't a good part for her. She is Christine Brown, working as a Loan Officer in a L.A. area bank, and aspiring to promotion to the vacancy that exists at the branch, Assistant VP. She is good-hearted, but she really wants that promotion and makes a decision that haunts her through the whole movie.Justin Long is perfect as Clay Dalton, her boyfriend, soon to become fianc√©e, and working as a Professor of Psychology. He mostly represents the sense of reason in this story, often commenting the way one of us audience members might comment about what is going on. But he loves Christine and supports her in her efforts to escape what appears to be a curse.Lorna Raver is really good, in very effective makeup, as Mrs. Ganush, the lady who comes to the bank to see if she can get an extension on her loan repayment, and not face eviction. Christine has the power to either grant her an extension or not. But taking a tough stance might look better to her boss, and get her a promotion.The movie actually opens with a scene, in a house, where a boy is taken by the evil character. In this scene we see the floor open up and the boy is dragged down, in flames, to hELL, then the floor heals. The main reason for this short scene is to establish that everything else we see is not some sort of hoax or scheme directed at Christine, but a genuine threat, that she might get dragged to hELL also.SPOILERS FOLLOW: (For my recollection only) In a scary encounter in the parking garage with Ganush, Christine's coat button is ripped off. Ganush puts a spell on it and gives it back to Christine, and following that she experiences all kinds of disturbing things. After consultation with spiritualists and trying to figure out how to escape the curse, they realize that Christine must give the button to someone else, to transfer the curse. Ganush had died, Christine went to her gravesite, dug up the casket, ripped it open, in a very good scene (the DVD extras show how they shot it). She stuffs the envelope containing the button into Ganush's mouth, so it was now a gift to her, and she would be dragged to hELL. But the next day at the train station meeting Clay for a short vacation, one where he was going to give her the engagement ring, he gives Christine the button, it had gotten mixed up in the car, she actually put an envelope containing an old coin in Ganush's mouth. Then, right there on the train tracks, as a train approached at speed, the train bed opened up and Christine was dragged down into the flames.",Null,0,2,27 October 2009
Selma," A milestone in the USA history of equal rights.
","I watched this on DVD from my public library. In 1964 and 1965, when this story takes place, I was a college student in Louisiana. Today 50 years later I don't recall anything specific about the march from Selma to the capitol about 50 miles away. But I do recall there being some racial tensions in some parts. Where I lived there were none that I was aware of. However it was accepted that blacks had separate entrances to businesses, separate rest rooms, and such things as seating in a designated section in movie houses. It was terrible discrimination but we grew up with it and didn't realize it was a wrong that needed to be righted. The main issue was voting rights in the movie 'Selma'. Even though blacks were freed and slavery abolished long before, their ability to vote was being negated in Alabama because they were not allowed to freely register to vote. If you can't vote then you are not represented and the parties in power can treat you badly because they know you can't vote them out. Plus the governor of Alabama, racist George Wallace, tolerated this illegal treatment.In what I consider an award-quality performance David Oyelowo becomes Dr. Martin Luther King, JR. He was a young man (in his 30s) with wisdom and a vision, and he advocated non-violent protest. He also appealed directly to the president, Lyndon Johnson of Texas, who had his hands full with the Viet Nam war. But King was persistent, finally forcing Johnson's hand when national news footage of the beatings made the whole world take note.It is of historical record that Johnson then upped his priority, pushed through a voting rights act, and it was the beginning of a new era for blacks' influence, and a black (well, half black) president was elected in 2008 then reelected in 2012. We certainly would not have made such progress had King not been there to lead the effort.Good movie. Hard to watch in some scenes, but a good movie.",Null,0,0,8 July 2015
The Artist," Way over-hyped, but enjoyable for what it is.
","The film industry has its own way of going way overboard on occasion and this is a recent example. The movie won many awards, including five Oscars, one being Best Picture, and was nominated for five others. So with that hype and anticipation my wife and I saw it this week.It is a very entertaining movie in many ways, and also mediocre in many ways. The novelty of making a silent film about the silent film industry of the late 1920s is novel, but the story itself is ordinary. It borrows heavily from ideas in the superb 'Singing In The Rain', which also was about the transition from silent films to 'talkies' and how those who resisted got left behind.The movie is very well made, and the characters and dancing numbers evoked stars of old, like Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Debbie Reynolds, and others. Jean Dujardin is the silent film star, George Valentin (Shades of Rudolph Valentino?). When 'talkies' start to become popular he figures fans come to see him so he continues to make silent films. Meanwhile B√©r√©nice Bejo as Peppy Miller (shades of Ann Miller?), given her big break by Valentin, goes on to make 'talkies' and soon becomes a star. With the fading popularity of silent film and the onset of the great depression, Valentin soon is bankrupt and no longer popular.Miller eventually helps Valentin recover his dignity, and that becomes the running story. Good movie, but in my mind not as good as all the hype made it out to be.",Null,0,2,15 August 2012
There's Something About Mary," A little raunchy, but overall a very funny movie.
","The backdrop for this story is high school, pretty and ditzy Mary (Cameron Diaz) has a date with insecure and clutzy Ted (Ben Stiller). One of Ted's friends instructs him, to avoid possible embarrassment sexually, he should masturbate before the date. Which he does, but in his own way botches that up, something gets caught in the zipper, and Mary finds a new and improved 'hair gel', all of which creates some slapstick humor for those not bothered by bodily functions.The main of the story is some years later, when Ted finds out that Mary is still single and living in Miami. he hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) as a private eye to check things out and, being of questionable character falls for Mary himself, and gives Ted a false report. However, Ted eventually gets things right and the battle for Mary's affections begins.Even though she was very well received for her role with Jim Carrey in Mask, for me this was the performance that got Cameron Diaz on my radar screen as an unusually talented actress. She has done other good roles, like the almost unrecognizable character she plays in 'Being John Malkovich', and I really liked her in a much earlier role, in 'Feeling Minnesota', but has not done much of substance recently.",Null,1,2,13 February 2005
Invictus," Inspirational account of Mandela's first few years as President of South Africa.
","The title of the movie is 'Invictus' and it only become clear somewhere in the middle that it is a reference to a 4-stanza poem from the 19th century, and its last stanza is:It matters not how strait the gait, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.That was written by a young man who had to have his foot amputated, and Nelson Mandella favored it and used it for inspiration and hope while he was imprisoned. The movie covers roughly 1991 when Mandela was released from prison through the 1995 Wold Cup Rugby matches hosted by South Africa. When Mandela won the election the country was fragmented, with a strong black vs white mentality. Even though Mandela was one of those persecuted, now as president he knew his biggest challenge was to unite the country. This movie uses Rugby as the vehicle for this unification effort. With only one black on the national; rugby team, the sport was considered mostly a white man sport. But Mandela threw his support, even learning the names of each player, and addressing them personally when he visited them. He especially befriended the captain, and shared with him the 'Invictus' poem as a way to deal with life.The South African Rugby team was mediocre at best, but they wanted to make a good showing as host for the World Cup. So much of the movie deals with Mandela's developing government along side the Rugby Team's development as a challenge on the world stage of rugby.This is a Clint Eastwood film. Morgan Freeman is perfect as Nelson Mandela. And Matt Damon is perfect as Fran√ßois Pienaar, the captain of the rugby team. Damon even wears a nose prosthetic that results in his looking very much like the real player.I give this movie my highest rating, it is a lesson in how good leadership can turn around a country and a sports program.",Null,0,0,19 June 2010
Mission: Impossible," Inspired by the 1960s M.I. TV series.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. I somehow missed this 22 years ago when it came out, I was inspired to look it up after seeing the most recent M.I. movie last week in 3D IMAX version. This is a good movie, with more of the feel of the missions that the old TV series featured. It uses what might be considered a MacGuffin, the theft of a secret list of undercover agents and their real names. But we never learn the fate of the list and whether or not it is really that critical.Instead the focus of the story is a mission gone wrong, and all the team except Ethan Hunt are killed. It is clear there is an inside 'mole' and the rest of the movie is identifying that mole and neutralizing him or her.The was Tom Cruise's first M.I. movie in the lead role of Ethan Hunt. In a connection to the old TV series, Jon Voight is in the role of Jim Phelps.",Null,1,2,3 August 2018
La La Land," Hollywood musical story of budding romance and career choices.
","Disclaimer: I like musicals, of all kinds, so I was predisposed to like this one. Plus I like both main actors.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. It is a beautiful movie visually, with the use of mostly saturated primary colors for the costumes, and the sound design is first-rate. It evokes the glory days of 1940s and 1950s musicals.Ryan Gosling is Sebastian, a pianist and music lover, with a focus on jazz. His ambition is to own his own place in L.A. but has to make a living and plays piano gigs, getting fired regularly for too often going off on a tangent and playing experimental music.(Of note, Gosling does all his own piano playing, preparing for the role by studying piano for three months before filming.)Emma Stone is Mia, aspiring actress. To make ends meet she is a barista at a coffee bar inside the movie studio backlot.The movie sets its style early with an elaborate musical number of occupants of cars all stuck in L.A. freeway traffic. Then, Sebastian honks at Mia when she fails to move quickly enough, they shoot each other the bird, which in movie plot language means they are destined to get together.Most of the movie deals with their relationship and their individual attempts to develop their chosen careers. The two leads are easy to watch and even though the movie runs right at 2 hours it never got boring for us. SPOILERS: As the story develops each of them are successful, she gets a big acting break and a few years later she is a big star, married to someone else, and with a young child. She and her husband go for a night out to a club to hear music and it turns out to be 'Seb's', he is running his own club. There is a fantasy dream sequence where Mia and Sebastian marry and have a family, but the end is back to reality, they did not end up together.",Null,0,4,29 May 2017
Saw," Works as a parody of the genre, but not as a legitimate thriller.
","Thanks to my public library, I was able to see 'Saw' on DVD and, while I am glad I saw it, I could not recommend it to any of my friends. The plot is simple -- people are abducted and placed in a position of grave danger where they have a very limited time to do something drastic to avoid their own death. The 'something drastic' may involve killing someone else. The main of the story deals with two men who awake and find they are chained on opposite sides of a very dirty room with the dirtiest toilet in North America, and have a few hours to do something about it. Clues are given and the men discover two hack saws hidden in the toilet tank, the saws that give the movie its name. Little of the movie is terrifying, the visuals are mostly disgusting. After it was over, and I thought about it, the only reason to see this movie is to experience the agony of the various characters. There are no sympathetic characters so I didn't care that much what happened to them.SPOILERS. At the end we find that the real fiend has been lying in a bloody mess in the room imprisoning the two chained men, witnessing their grief first hand. He was a cancer patient (we see him briefly initially) of the doctor (Cary Elwes) and this was his revenge, to have the doctor saw off his foot to escape from the chains and save his own life and his wife and child who had been held captive. The plot is a bit more complex than that, but twists were added simply to keep the viewers guessing. This quote from the critic Ebert's review is telling, 'A movie that conceals the identity of a killer is of a lower order, in general, than one that actually deals with him as a character.

Mama," I'm not a horror fan, but I quite liked this movie.
","There is a 2008 film short, only 3 minutes long, of the same name, 'Mama'. It inspired this movie after del Toro saw it and bargained with the author for a script for the feature-length version. The short film is included as an 'extra' on the DVD, it too is an interesting watch.This movie has a rather simple premise but details are introduced gradually so as to build the suspense. We see an early scene with a father and his two young children driving perhaps too fast on a remote road while it is snowing, and distracted by the older daughter saying 'Please slow down daddy' they slid and crashed down an embankment. They find a creepy-looking cabin in the forest and seek shelter there.The story then switches to five years later, and the man's brother is still spending most of his spare time and spare money looking for the missing man and his daughters. The man and his brother, perhaps twins, are both played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Lucas (the alive brother) and Jeffrey (who disappeared 5 years earlier). The nominal star of the movie is Jessica Chastain as Annabel, a 30-something who acts more like a teenager and playing bass guitar in a rock band, but married to Lucas. She certainly is not prepared to be a mother.Let's just say the girls are found but their dad isn't, and Lucas and Annabel are pressed into service trying to re-normalize these two girls, 8 and 6, who have been in the wild for 5 years. Not much goes as planned! The two girls are played by Megan Charpentier as 8-yr-old Victoria and French Canadian Isabelle N√©lisse, who spoke no English before being cast, as 6-yr-old Lilly.Most horror movies I have seen, not a favorite genre of mine, are more boring than horrific. But this one genuinely gave me chills several times, I found it very effective and good entertainment.SPOILERS: The story goes way back to the 1800s when a woman escaped from a mental ward with a tiny baby, ultimately hunted by a mob. She jumped off a cliff towards water below, but she hit a large branch sticking out, breaking most of her body parts, and she floated dead in the water. But the baby in its wrappings was snagged by the branch and recovered. The dead woman's ghost became the 'Mama' of this movie, she forever haunted one place or the other looking to replace her lost baby. She actually watched over the two girls during that 5-year period. But now she had followed them to their new house, almost killed Lucas, spooked Annabel, and overall was a constant source of havoc in their lives. So they were able to get rid of her only after reuniting her with the remains of her baby, long stored in a box in a government building. But she also took Lilly with her, as Victoria stayed with her new parents, her aunt and uncle.",Null,1,2,2 June 2013
Super 8," Set in 1979, two movies in one.
","The subject of this movie is dear to my own heart, making Super 8 home movies. I had my own Super 8 camera in the 1970s and did a bit of filming. However most of our real movies, with acting and dialog, were made in the early 1980s with an early portable camera and VHS recorder.JJ Abrams wrote and directed, and much of the inspiration came from his own youth. The core story are a bunch of 'little rascals', 12-ish boys and girl making a movie, complete with costumes and makeup, filmed with a Super 8 camera and sound recorded to later splice in.One night while filming at a train station they happen to witness a train crash, a horrific mess with cars thrown everywhere. They observe hundreds of silver knobby cubes strewn about. One of the boys brings one home with him. They manage to leave right as the military are responding to the situation.Several days later when they got their movie film developed, they found an inadvertent recording of a very strange creature escaping from one of the cars. That represents the other movie within the movie.The critic Ebert has a good complete review. Much like he did, I found myself much more taken with the story of the kids making the movie than I did with the strange creature and its affect on the community. Not all of the happenings, especially in the second half, came together to make a coherent story. Still, we enjoyed it.As the end credits roll in the right half of the screen, the home-made movie that the kids shot is rolling in the left half. That was actually the most fun to watch.SPOILERS: Back in the 1950s or 1960s some sort of fast, ugly, and powerful alien was captured and the strange silver knobby cubes somehow fit together to form its space ship. The US government had been keeping it captive while studying the cubes, and that night of the train wreck it escaped from one of the cars. That was what the kids captured on their Super 8 film. It was now trying to assimilate something to 'go home' and in the end it does.",Null,0,1,27 December 2011
The Last Samurai," Excellent Samurai movie that never seems long.
","Students of film invariably turn to the older 'Seven Samurai' as one of the better movies of all time, but to me this movie, 'The Last Samurai' is much better for viewing by most of us modern movie-goers. That is not to say that 'technically' it is a better movie, because that doesn't matter for most of us. What matters is whether we can become emotionally immersed in the story, and this one allows that. While there are a number of good actors, only two carry the story -- Ken Watanabe, superb as Katsumoto, the leader in a remote village of last remaining Samurai in 1876 Japan, and Tom Cruise, equally superb as Nathan Algren, a battle-scarred  American soldier who is in Japan, along with others, to help them come into the modern world, and part of that is to develop an effective force of soldiers. While historically significant, and based on the real transition Japan was going through in the late 19th century, the story here is fiction. The Japanese government in pushing its modernization was also bringing an end to the feudal system and the role of the Samurai. Carrying the sword became illegal. The bands of Samurai rebelled against this and the lead character, Katsumoto, both swore allegiance to the young king, and at the same time fought to keep the Samurai tradition. The finale features a defining battle between the village of Samurai and the newly-trained and weaponed Japanese troops. The title, 'Last Samurai', refers to the group of Samurai, the last ones in Japan. The word is either singular or plural, depending on its context.Overall a very worthwhile story and movie. The DVD is superb, and the extras are worthwhile.",Null,4,11,30 July 2004
Up," A good animated movie needs a very good story, and this has one.
","Saw it on DVD, great sound and great picture.From PIXAR, the same group that gave us one of my favorites, 'Monsters, Inc'. Although the two movies are quite different, one might even say totally different, I will compare them. Each has a very compelling story to tell, and the superb animation and voice acting are present to support the story. Many of the animated movies in recent years have looked superb, but suffered from very marginal stories.In 'UP' we see what can best be described as a love story. Two kids meet quite randomly, and long before they know what 'love' is really all about, but they turn out perfect for each other. They get married, make plans for the adventures they want in live, grow old together, and find that somehow 'real life' has gotten in the way of their dreams.All this we see in the first few minutes of the movie. It sets up the fantasy, that an old man just living out his life can attach enough helium-filled balloons through the chimney of his little house to not only float up into the air, but also float to South America to a spot that he has dreamed about since he was a small boy. Our logic says this can't really happen, just as our logic tells us children don't really have power-generating Monsters in their closets at night. But this movie is not about logic, it is a fantasy.This is an interesting, exciting movie with superb animation. But the real pay-off is in the love story, which isn't totally wrapped up until the very final image we see.SPOILERS: As the young couple were growing up, they had an image, a hand-drawn picture which they placed on a photograph of the cliffs and waterfall in South America. The hand-drawn image was of their little house they dreamed of building on that site some day. That day never came. But through his perseverance and as the helium in the balloons finally lost their ability to keep the little house off the ground, it settled down to that very spot they had imagined all those years. He had finally given his wife, now deceased, the little house on the cliff.",Null,0,2,12 November 2009
Snowden," What is actually 'legal' during times of war, or prevention of war?
","We watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The case of Snowden is still relatively fresh in our minds, having been fodder for news and debate just a few years ago.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really good as Edward Snowden, the bright hacker that was discharged from the Army after badly breaking his leg in training. Easy with computers he managed to get jobs in government agencies, or with contractors to the government.Here he is portrayed as a very bright but rather naive man who loved his country but over the course of several years became disillusioned. He saw remote drone operators kill families with only the reaction 'It is only a job.' He discovered that agencies were hacking into the phone and email records of private citizens without proper warrants. Things like that eventually got him to steal many documents to expose what he considered crimes by the government.Why didn't he just go to the authorities and be an internal whistle- blower? Because what he saw told him it would not work and in fact he would be punished instead. So he fled his country and now is holed up in Russia. The movie raises many questions that have no easy answers. We do know for a fact that after the revelations then POTUS Obama ordered many changes in the way the USA agencies collect data. But it will be an ongoing issue, for the whole world, for many countries, what is acceptable in cyber-hacking?Good movie.",Null,1,2,18 March 2017
The Hurricane," Detective Della Pesca was Rubin Hurricane Carter's 'Javert' (see Les Miserables).
","This film, 'The Hurricane' is one example where the 'hype' was not overdone. Denzel Washington did a masterful job here, both in preparation for the role, and then execution of it.  When you see interviews with the real Hurricane on the DVD 'extras' you realize how well Washington captured this role.  I wish I could rate it 8.5, but settled for '8' of 10, but a very strong 8. This is based on a true story, however some charcaters are created or consolidated, and in truth the 'real killers' were never found, and some stilll believe Carter murdered the three people he went to prison for.I didn't particularly like the style of the editing where the film jumped from far past, to present, to near past, to present, etc - it detracted from the story because you had to think 'OK, where did this happen.' However, the story is fairly simple - two gunmen kill 3 people in a bar at 2:30AM and the evil and PREJUDICED detective Della Pesca, who had a history with Carter since he was a young boy in trouble, conspires to falsely convict Carter of the crimes. CAUTION - POSSIBLE SPOILERS... Della Pesca in a real sense is the Javert of 'Les Miserables' who relentlessly hunts down Valjean even after he becomes a good and exemplary citizen. Carter, when he was first arrested, had just come out of the Army where he had been a paratrooper and as a fighter became all-Army welterweight champ. But Della Pesca said, 'you still owe me time' for having escaped from the state home for boys and joined the Army, two years before he was to be released at 21. It was the 8 years at the reform school, from age 11 to 19, that Carter says 'I learned how to maime, butcher, and fight for my survival.' After that second prison time, Carter is falsly, according to the film, arrested for the 3 murders, framed by Della Pesca. Carter fails to get a fair trial in NJ, witnesses disappear, relevant evidence is not admitted, he gets 3 life terms, and his several appeals fail.  In prison, he writes a book, 'The 16th Round', which he views as his only way to get the 'true' story out to the public.  A young, struggling black student, Lesra, comes upon a used copy of the book, bought it for 25 cents, used it to sharpen his reading skills, wrote a letter to Carter, then spoke with him by phone, then visited him. He and his 3 Canadian 'tutors' eventually move to NJ and vow 'to stay here until we take you with us', they told Carter.So, the real 'meat' of the drama is twofold.  First, how Carter builds the inner strength to endure 22+ years of prison and not play by the rules of the prison. And second, how these 4 Canadians investigate and succeed where many lawyers before them had failed. In the end, in 1985, after 22 years in prison for the murders, they take a very risky path with an appeal to federal court, bypassing NJ courts. It works, the judge ordered Carter freed. Prosecution appeals failed, Carter moved to Canada where he resides today. His young friend Lazra, who also is included in the DVD extras, in an attorney.I like well-made films based on important historical events, and this one qualifies. As other reviewers commented, this film is a bit unbalanced, of course focusing more on Carter's POV, and ignoring some important development of other characters.  Still, I rate it a high '8' for overall impact, and an important film to recall how some past injustices so greatly affected the lives of others.",Null,3,10,11 December 2000
A Clockwork Orange," A very dark comedy from the mind of Kubrick.
","I saw this movie in the theater a long time ago, probably in the 1970s not long after its release. I didn't remember too much about it, just the general theme. I saw it again, on Netflix streaming video.Malcolm McDowell is Alex, the defacto leader of a group of 4 thugs in near future England. His is a charming and deceiving fellow, who sleeps all day and misses school because, he tells his parents, his head hurts. But during the night he and his fellow thugs look for trouble and items that can be fenced for easy cash. And sometimes for more fun, a brawl with competitive thugs.During one break-in a lady fights back, wounds Alex by hitting him on the head with a heavy piece of artwork, a small statue, and in anger he smashes something into her face. She had been suspicious and called the police a bit earlier, and Alex was arrested when they showed up. The injured lady died in the hospital, so he was convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years.After two years he heard about an experimental rehabilitation treatment, and through his cunning got picked for the project. He would receive the intensive psychological treatment, forced to view violence on film, and after 14 days (a fortnight) be cured and released to society.Back with his freedom it wasn't easy. He met up with old friends and old enemies and was given back bad treatment each time. He even tried to kill himself, but only ended up badly injured, in the hospital. And, as the movie ends, we see a flash of what is in his mind, and it looks like he may be back to his old way of thinking, always looking for sex or violence, and maybe both at the same time.This movie might also have been a commentary of British government and British society back in 1970, I don't know.Edit: April 2013, saw it again on DVD, the newly released Kubrick 9-movie set from my public library.

Woman in Gold," Recovery of art stolen by Nazis, Mirren and Reynolds shine in this fact-based drama.
","Watched it on DVD from my public library.This is predominantly a true story with perhaps some events and dialog created for dramatic effect. In the 1930s when the Nazis were inhabiting Austria, and leading up to the atrocities of WW2, Jews in Vienna were being harassed and their valuable furnishings and art objects were being confiscated.One particularly personal art object, and now (1998) valued at over $100 Million, is the Klimt painting called 'Woman in Gold' because it used actual gold foil. The subject of the painting was the now deceased aunt of Helen Mirren (actually 69-ish) as 80-ish Maria Altmann living in Los Angeles since she was a young woman, having fled Austria.By this time, the late 1990s, Austria had initiated a system of reparations for those crimes and now Maria wanted to see if she could recover some of her family's stolen treasure, particularly the golden portrait of her aunt. She approached the family friend and young lawyer, mid-30ish Ryan Reynolds as Randy Schoenberg, whose grandfather was a well-known Austrian composer.Randy was reluctant to take it on, as he had failed to make his own law practice work and now had just taken a new job with a big firm. But his interest was piqued when a quick web search indicated it great value. His lawyer instincts (go after the big money) kicked in and his quest was on.This all of course was not a smooth trip. They had to go to court, even up to the US Supreme Court, but eventually they arrived at a 3- person arbitration to hear their case. The Austrians over the years had adopted the Woman in Gold as their own Mona Lisa and had no desire to see it leave their country. Maria tried to make a deal with them, if they would admit that they had obtained it illegally and apologize, and compensate her reasonably, she would let it stay in the Austrian museum. But they flatly refused so she snubbed them after the arbitration decision and the work of art now resides in a USA museum.All-in-all a very good story, well-told and well-acted, worthwhile for both its historical significance and the entertainment value of the movie itself.",Null,5,5,14 August 2015

","On successive nights we saw two recent animated movies, 'Rango' and 'Rio.' Both have excellent voice acting and stunningly good animation. Rio is brighter, more colorful, my wife enjoyed it more. While I enjoyed both of them, my preference tips a bit towards 'Rango.' But I really enjoyed RIO. It starts in Brazil when animal smugglers are illegally trapping various species of wildlife.

The Legend of 1900," Wonderful and thought-provoking fable of a man whose life was spent aboard a ship.
","'The Legend of 1900' is unique in many ways, the first being that it is an Italian film with English-speaking characters. Tim Roth who has been cast as a villian most of his career does a remarkable job as the adult '1900', the simple man, a gifted piano player, who had a his own particular take on life. The story begins as a ship worker is crawling around the ballroom floor, looking for valuables lost by the wealthy guests, but instead finds a baby. It is the New Year 1900, thus the baby's name. He is raised in the bowels of the ship until at about age 8 or 10 he is noticed playing the piano. He eventually becomes the ship's piano player, and his reputation spreads until Jelly Roll Morton takes a voyage and challenges '1900.'  In the end, he lit his cigarette on the hot piano strings!some SPOILERS - The film actually starts in more modern times as the trumpet player friend of 1900's is selling his horn and telling the 'Legend of 1900' after the shopkeeper shows him a patched-together record of the piano composition that was lost years earlier, parts hidden in the piano. He tells the story in a series of flashbacks, and at the end finds out the old ship has been stripped of all valuables and is to be sunk the next day by dynamite. But he just knows '1900' must still be aboard the ship, because he knew he never could leave. So he borrows the record and a player and goes to every different part of the dilapidated ship, playing the song, hoping to lure out '1900'. Earlier in the film '1900' said, 'My music will never go anywhere without me' and that is why the master disk never left the ship until the piano, with the broken recods hidden in it, ended up in the shop also.more SPOILERS - '1900' almost left the ship once, he was going to visit NYC and a pretty girl he met, was half-way down the gangplank, suitcase in hand, well-wishers waving goodby, he paused a long time, threw his hat into the water, and went back on the ship. Only years later, as he and his friend spoke in the bowels of the old ship did he explain, 'I looked at the city and could not see an 'end.' A piano has 88 keys, you know where it starts and where it ends. But the city alone has hundreds of miles of streets, how do you know which one to take, which girl to love, which house to buy? I could not see an 'end' so I had to stay on the ship.' And he did, he had become so accustomed to the small, contained world of the ship that he could not cope with the greater world. Even though it is a movie, one second we are seeing '1900' with a smile, musing about heaven, and the next moment a horrific blast. It is hard to not get jolted by the image.At 120 minutes this film requires some patience, and the desire to see good character studies over non-stop action. It is impossible to describe in words how good Tim Roth is in this role. We always knew he could play the bad guy, this film crystallizes his overall talent as one of the best in the business. A remarkable story, a legend, with a remarkable character. A superb film.",Null,6,9,13 October 2002

This movie clarifies who he was, and gives us a gripping thriller to boot. As we are told in the DVD extras, it remains a mystery as to who exactly he was, or why he killed a number of women during that period in the late 1880s and the early 1890s London, but the story here is based on one of the possibilities. The title comes from an actual note believed to be written by the killer, and signed 'from hell.'Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Fred Abberline, who has a habit of smoking drugs and drinking absinthe, but also a reputation for solving crimes with very scarce clues. He is depicted as one who often dreams of the solution and can foreshadow crimes. Heather Graham adopts a mostly believable Irish accent and plays Mary Kelly, a woman of the street. Ian Holm is superb as Sir William Gull, a former surgeon, and who becomes a key player in solving the mystery presented in this story. Also good is Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley who often assists Abberline.A movie about gory murders must contain some gore, but the directors keep it to a minimum so that the gore supports the story and never seems gratuitous. SPOILERS FOLLOW. It turns out that Gull was the ripper, assisted by his carriage driver. Turns out the heir to the throne in England had secretly married a Catholic, they had a baby, and the only way for the Freemasons (represented by Gull) to save the integrity of the throne was to get rid of the heir and his mother. But there were witnesses, a group of prostitutes who had to be murdered also, and that was his motive. But they weren't just killings, but ritual murders, that is why victims were also disemboweled. Mary Kelly was to be the final murder, but Abberline gets to the scene just in time to save her and defeat Jack The Ripper. Fiction, but a good story.",Null,1,4,22 November 2005
Invincible," Really fine movie based on Vince Papale's entry into pro football.
","I am about Vince Papale's age. I very vaguely remember in 1976 when he began to play pro football for the Eagles. I invariably enjoy movies based on real people, and this is no exception to that rule. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look much like Papale at 30, and is a bit too old, but his working class background helped him become Papale for this movie. A very worthwhile viewing for anyone who likes a nice personal triumph. There is a very interesting 25-minute extra on the DVD which features the real Papale as they were making the movie.Vince Papale was a part-time teacher and part-time bar tender. He and his buddies were rabid Eagles fans, when the Eagles had lost the magic of their former glory days. They spent a portion of their leisure time playing sandlot football in street clothes. Papale seemed to clearly the be the best of them, even though he never played college ball, and only one year of high school football.Greg Kinnear is Dick Vermeil, successful West Coast college coach hired to turn the Eagles around. To gain support of the local crowd he held open tryouts, not really expecting anyone to stand out. But Papale did, and he was given a chance at training camp, much to his own surprise.Spoilers. At each cut point Papale expected to be called to turn in his playbook. Each time he was retained, and coach Vermeil went out on a thin limb to keep him on the roster at the final cut, against the advice of his coaches. Even though they lost all of their preseason games, Papale became a 'crazy man' on special teams, getting downfield quickly on kickoffs to pulverize the ball carrier. And in the first game, causing a fumbled punt which he recovered and carried in for an insurance touchdown. He gained the respect of the veterans, thrilled the home crowd, and had 3 very successful seasons. Plus, the Eagles turned it around and became winners again.Very pretty Elizabeth Banks is Janet Cantrell, whom Papale met as a fellow bar tender, right after his own wife up and moved out without warning. Janet and Vince married and, as current film clips show, have a nice family with two small children.",Null,1,1,31 December 2006
Groundhog Day," Among the most novel and entertaining of movies, a genuine modern classic.
","'Groundhog Day' is Bill Murray's serious movie. Along with Andie McDowell they make great chemistry. 'Phil' is the wise-cracking weatherman who thinks he is too good for everyone else. He is in PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa to do a newscast, and wishes he were just about anywhere else. They get snowed in, have to spend the night, and the next morning at 6AM the fun begins.It is groundhog day again! He goes out, sees all the same people, doing and saying all the same things. To everyone else, this is the only time they have lived this particular day. But for Phil, it is the second time. In fact, every morning thereafter he awakes at 6AM to exactly the same music, the same day, it looks like it will be for eternity.January 2007: Just watched it yet again, it never gets old. (pun)Feb, 2, 2009 - Groundhog Day - I just watched it again. Never gets old!!Feb 4, 2010 - Two days late. But never better, I even saw some things that escaped me the first several times. CAUTION--SPOILERS--At first, Phil takes the 'repeat' days to deal in funny, or cruel, ways with others he knows he will meet. He knows everything will be wiped clean and he can start fresh the next day. No one but he will remember what happened the prior day. After a while, he gets depressed at the thought of being sentenced to an eternity of living the same day, so he tries to kill himself. Jumping off a building, taking a bath with a toaster, driving a car off a cliff, getting into the path of a truck. He succeeds each time, however when 6AM comes the next day, he's back in his bed, Groundhog Day again, and his daily cycle starts again. And eventually he decides to go ahead and try to make good use of his situation.So he takes on new hobbies. He becomes expert at ice sculpture, medicine, piano-playing, poetry, and a number of others. He comes to know all the people in town, not only their names but also intimate details of their lives. The film never hints at how many times he re-lives the same day. However, to gain all the proficiencies he did, it must have been several hundred. Perhaps even in the thousands. But that detail doesn't matter.As he becomes more and more charming, he decides to try and seduce his producer, played by McDowell. Each day he gets a bit farther, only to show off as the real jerk that he is, then is slapped and snubbed. But each day, since he is the only one who remembers, he gets a bit further. However, he is destined to never get the girl, unless he really changes, and he doesn't realize this.In the last 1/4 of the film, he has become a truly changed man. He helps people because it is the right thing to do. He is humble about his successes, and it is this change that ultimately attracts the woman of his dreams, and which gets him out of the seemingly endless cycle of re-playing Groundhog Day.And that, in a nutshell, is what the film is all about. In a unique way - the re-play of a day - it is a commentary on the need to be true and pure in our intentions to be able to get out of our rut and make any meaningful contribution to this world. I rate it '10', and is one of my favorite movies of all time.",Null,30,54,1 January 2001
National Treasure," Not to be taken seriously, a moderately interesting discovery caper.
","'National Treasure' is a fictional story of an enormously valuable treasure that Colonial Americans hid from the British for safe keeping. (Anyone who has been through the British Museum in London knows how the ancient Brits enjoyed plundering and bringing treasure back home, so the premise is plausible.) Problem is, no one person in the group of men back in the 1700s knew exactly where the treasure was hidden, but there existed a series of 'clues'. Ever since he was a small boy and he heard the story from his grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Gates, just called Ben (Nicolas Cage), was obsessed with finding the treasure. His dad (Jon Voight) had apparently spent lots of energy in his younger days searching for clues, and didn't believe the treasure existed. he considered it a ruse to distract the British. Besides, the Gates family now had a reputation for being a bit kookie! I enjoyed the movie, and I generally like Nic Cage, but when it was over there was nothing particularly lasting about the viewing experience. The veterans Voight and Sean Bean (as Ian, the bad guy, naturally) were good. The eventual love interest was played by German Diane Kruger who was there for her pretty face, but her acting is very ordinary. Good picture and sound on the DVD.SPOILERS. The movie opens with a search party, led by Ben and including Ian, following a 'Charlotte' clue, find the long lost ship 'Charlotte' in the Arctic Circle under ice, which they hope have the treasure. It doesn't only gun powder and an elaborate carved smoking pipe. In it is a clue, which they deduct leads to the Declaration of Independence. Ian turns on them, and an explosion on the ship leads him to believe Ben has been killed. Ben knows Ian will steal the Declaration, so he must steal it first, to protect it. Ian uses brute force, Ben uses cunning, and Ben gets to it first. The chase begins, Ian eventually gets it, an invisible map and some codes lead them to Manhattan and Wall Street, then a church, then a burial vault, then a very deep underground cavern (impossible under Manhattan??) Meanwhile Ian is misdirected to Boston, while Ben finds the treasure behind yet another wall. Ian is arrested, the wealth is divided up among all the peoples, Ben and Abigail get a grand new home.",Null,1,3,22 May 2005
Love & Mercy," The creative madness of Brian Wilson.
","The title comes from one of his songs. I saw this in 2015 on DVD from the Redbox rental kiosk and then again in 2020 on Amazon Prime streaming. Often depressing, it is a really fine movie showing his struggles through the years.Brian Williams is only 3 years older than I am, all of us who were teens and young adults back in the 1960s were exposed to Beach Boys songs, whether we were big fans or not. The sound is unique and this movie shows us why.When we listen to a song we don't usually give any thought to what all went into it. I believe most of us figure, someone wrote it, a few musicians got together, and with the singers in the recording studio make 3 or 4 takes, pick the best one, and record it. And maybe some happen just like that.But the really brilliant ones, like Brian Wilson in his 1960s prime, have a sound in their heads. They assemble just the right set of musicians, work with each to get exactly the right sound, maybe bring in some farm animals or police sirens. Whatever it takes to get that sound onto the recording. This movie shows us how he worked to get that.The life of Brian Wilson is mostly tragic. He was emotionally and physically abused by his father, his brothers began to doubt his musical direction, he had a failed marriage, he was held captive by an unscrupulous physician. But he survived and even though he was 53 when he found his second wife he now has been married 20 years and has 5 more children. Brian Wilson has survived!A thoroughly enjoyable move for those of us who like this type of movie. The director chose to use two different actors for the Brian role, John Cusack for his later years, mostly the 1980s, and Paul Dano for his 1960s years. Each does a fine job. Elizabeth Banks is good as Melinda Ledbetter, the Cadillac sales person who became Brian's wife in 1995, and who was instrumental in rescuing him from Dr. Landy.Paul Giamatti is always reliable and he is good as the unscrupulous Dr. Landy.

The Wind that Shakes the Barley," The history of Ireland's resistance of British rule.
","It was the 1920s and England had a military presence in the mostly peaceful Ireland. Early in the movie we see rogue British troops treating woman and children badly, and burning homes, sometimes killing innocent people.This ignited the pride of the people and really put the 'ire' in Ireland. Bans of loosely organized Irish, who began to can themselves Republicans, were the genesis to the IRA, the Irish Republican Army.At one of the wakes for a killed Irishman, an old lady was singing a folk song, and one line contained the works 'Wind that Shakes the Barley.' I don't know if the title has any other meaning, regarding the uprising against the British.Cillian Murphy is in the lead role as Damien. As history tells us, Ireland has remained a free republic, and only Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain.Very good movie. Doesn't paint a very flattering picture of the British.",Null,0,7,5 November 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," A really nice movie, great animation and an entertaining story.
","There are lots of common elements of a good story here, a sweet but smallish boy who wants to be more like his larger than life dad, other kids not respecting him, finding a lost and injured creature, the two of them bond and help out the rest. We have seen it with lost horses, lost dogs, just about any kind of animal. But a dragon?? That basic storyline is applied here to a fantasy world in an undefined time. The village has been there for a very long time, but all the buildings are new. We are puzzled by this brain teaser but soon realize why. The area is populated by a variety of dragons, which periodically raid their town, carry away animals, and burn the buildings with the fire from their mouths. So the main occupation in this town is dragon fighters. And builders.There the dragon fighters look like Vikings, and sail, but they speak like Scots. Gerard Butler is the leader of the dragon fighters, as Stoick. His teenage son is Jay Baruchel (bah-roo-shell) as the small and weak Hiccup. Fellow Scot Craig Ferguson is his right hand man, Gobber. And America Ferrera is the cute girl, Astrid, who wants to be a dragon fighter also.This is a highly entertaining, animated fantasy movie.SPOILERS: There is a particular kind of dragon that is a deadly shot, but comes only at night and no one has seen one. But Hiccup designs a kind of catapult, and he shoots one down. Finding it the next day, it is injured, missing part of its tail guidance system and can't fly right. It is a beautiful dragon, sleek and black, much like a stealth fighter. Hiccup becomes friends with it, brings it fish for food, and fabricates a replacement part for its tail, which Hiccup has to control himself, thus he flies it. He goes back to the village and becomes the one who learns how to train dragons, and in the end they become useful friends in the village, after the super giant dragon hiding in the mountain is destroyed and the other dragons no longer needed to raid food to feed the giant dragon.",Null,0,0,24 October 2010
The Great Raid," Compelling movie, especially for those of us who didn't experience WW II ourselves.
","At a bit over 2 hours, my only 'complaint' is that parts of it moved very slowly, which is actually nice if you want a leisurely afternoon watching everything unfold. The planning and back stories of all the characters took most of the first 90 minutes. But I found myself wishing for a bit crisper editing at times. Otherwise, it is a superb movie.This is based on a real rescue in January 1945, at a Japanese prison camp in the Phillipines. These American prisoners had been all but forgotten, and many of them were resigned to dying there. But an elite corps of men planned and carried out a rescue at dusk of over 500 men, with very few friendly casualties. There is a 7-minute extra on the DVD where many of the survivors talk about their experiences, plus Captain prince who planned and led the rescue. So I suspect the movie presents a quite accurate picture of what really went on.Benjamin Bratt is Lt. Colonel Mucci and the officer who planned the rescue was Captain Prince (James Franco), trained in R.O.T.C. There is a love interest, a nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), the wife of a deceased soldier, but she and one of the prisoners Major Gibson (Brit Joseph Fiennes, with a fine American accent) kept in contact via secret messages, and hoped to meet up after the war. She also smuggled medicine into the prison camp.The Japanese army is depicted as very brutal, killing prisoners for any reason. It makes you wonder why they kept any of them alive at all. Based on first-hand accounts, it appears that this depiction is accurate.I think we all need to see a movie like this now and again, just to remind us how evil war is.",Null,1,2,12 June 2006
Total Recall," Mostly Martian cheese, and shameless product placement.
","'Total Recall', which I bought for just over $5 for the remastered special widescreen edition DVD, is a good example of what is happening to movies just 10 to 15 years old. First, they are usually not quite as good as we remember them, and second, the DVD price is getting dirt cheap. Who could have imagined just 20 years ago that for a mere five bucks or so, you could own a copy of a feature-length movie, with a crisp and detailed picture, surround sound, and all kinds of extras?? You get all that in 'Total Recall', although it is more cheese than you can swallow in one sitting. I enjoyed it enough, again, after all these years. California's Governor, Arnold, does a respectable job. And here we see Sharon Stone before she hit it big with 'Basic Instinct.' But the story, while inventive, has a screenplay which falls flat very often. Some SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further. Just one example of how the story goes into the absurd. Quaid comes home after some guys try to kill him, he turns out the lights and tells his 'wife' (Stone) to get down. Then, she starts shooting at him, they fight, he throws her, they fight more violently, he gets the upper hand, then they calmly sit down and start talking about how she isn't (she says) really his wife, his memories were manipulated and she was planted as part of a bigger scheme. Just couldn't happen that way. More SPOILERS ... Anyway, we think Quaid ends up on Mars later, but then something happens to make us wonder if it is part of his 'Rekall' dream implanting. But in the end, when some of the Earthlings inhabiting the Mars settlement start to suffer oxygen deprivement, Quaid listens to the alien sticking out of another man's belly, starts the big ancient generators, and everyone gets saved by the resultant outflowing of oxygen. The pink skies become blue, clouds form, and pretty soon Mars looks just like Earth. Billions of pounds of cheese.",Null,2,12,1 December 2004
Limitless," Something quite different, making your brain work to 100% of its capacity.
","When you have seen thousands of movies, as I have, you delight in something almost completely new, a concept that has not been explored before. This movie has that and I delighted in watching where it went.Bradley Cooper is Eddie Morra, a writer who can't quite seem to write anything, almost a slacker with his disheveled look. His live-in girlfriend, Abbie Cornish as Lindy, packs up and leaves early in this story, tired of Eddie's lack of focus and achievement.It is a good time to mention also that Eddie had actually been married, for a very short time, to Anna Friel as Melissa. This becomes important as it relates to what happens next.Eddie quite by accident happens to run into his ex-wife's brother, whom he has not seen in a few years. They talk over a drink and Eddie is given a small, clear pill, told to try it, he will be amazed. When he does, back in his apartment, he really is amazed, he suddenly sees everything clearly, is able to write an interesting first chapter in just a few minutes, and quickly cleans up his apartment. He is a changed man. The little pill wakes up all of his brainpower, he has goals and ambition, and can make analyses that no others can. He can pick up girls, sway others in arguments, quickly learn music and foreign languages, remember details from his past, and quickly become wealthy in the stock market, even though he had no prior training.So what is a man to do in this situation? Say, 'That was fun, now back to my usual drab life?' Not likely, and that really is what the rest of the movie is about.Another key character is Robert De Niro as Carl Van Loon, a wealthy business man that Eddie gets involved with.Good, interesting movie. My wife and I enjoyed it, just long enough at 1 hour and 40 minutes. We saw the 'alternate ending' on the DVD and actually liked it a bit better.SPOILERS: Eddie has to have more of the mysterious drug. When he goes to visit the ex-brother'n law, then goes out to fetch lunch and dry cleaning, he returns to find the man dead and the apartment ransacked. Eddie calls the police, and before they arrive he finds what the crooks couldn't, the stash of pills and quite a chunk of $$ money. So Eddie takes that for himself just before the cops get there. With the stash of pills Eddie goes on a roll, successful as he never had dreamed. But he soon finds it comes with a great price, it will eventually kill him as it has others. But in the end, he promises that with the 100% brain power he will use it to perfect the drug so that it will have the benefits without the dangers.

Don't Breathe," Set in Detroit, three 20-somethings get more than they bargained for.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped.I was drawn to it mainly for Jane Levy, mostly a TV actress in such series as 'Suburgatory' starting in 2011 and more recently in 'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist' starting recently and now running. In 'Don't Breathe' she was about 26 during its production.I also found out she is a former soccer player so in a scene where she is required to run full-speed out of a house and down the street her running looks quite authentic.Anyway these three Detroit 20-something friends, two guys and a girl, are petty criminals, they break into homes and steal whatever they can fence. Detroit is not what it used to be, the girl has a terrible mom and wants to get away, to California maybe, and take her little sister with her for a better life.They find out about a man who lives alone, a military veteran, he was blinded, and in a case some years back was awarded a big settlement, 'six figures.' So the three decide, without any evidence, that the man must keep his loot inside his house in a dilapidated area of the city and they will go at night to steal it all.So these three are not very good young people, plus they are not very smart. What could go wrong when the man also has a vicious Rottweiler with him at all times? So it plays out at night with some interesting scenes and an interesting development with the blind man, but overall it is just a mediocre movie. And it ends with the girl and her little sister headed to California, seemingly with no consequences for all the carnage we witness.Still I am glad I took the time, Jane Levy is cute and is a capable actress.",Null,0,2,4 March 2020
Eyes Wide Shut," A sophisticated film, not for the casual watcher who just wants to be entertained.
","There's no way around the fact that smack in the middle of this fine movie is a very bizarre, graphic 'sex party', and that quite understandably will completely turn off a lot of viewers. However, it, or something very similar, is essential to telling the overall story of a couple's marital trials and ultimate strengthening of their bond. This is not a movie that you can casually watch for an evening of light enjoyment.On the other hand, if you trust the director, and commit to watch the whole movie, overall it is a fine film with a rewarding story. I give it 8 of 10. It is telling that 'men under 29' gave this movie its highest ratings and preponderance of '10s'. Heck, when I was that age any movie with frontal nudity would get my '10' even if there were no story. I viewed the DVD version. While it is sharp, beautiful, with good sound, there is nothing remarkable comparing this movie to others on DVD. The extras are limited, but include interviews of Kidman, Cruise, and Spielberg on the life of director Kubrick.

Beauty and the Beast," Cast brings to life the old favorite animated version.

It is a very elaborate production, a musical mostly, filled with some of the best actors, most of whom sing very well. The several 'extras' on the disk are very interesting.Emma Watson, a fan of 'Beauty/Beast' story since she was a little girl, plays the female lead, Belle. Dan Stevens, of recent 'Downton Abbey' fame, is the Prince who gets turned into the Beast. As the story goes his kingdom goes dark and cold, he takes the form of a beast, his staff and servants are turned into a variety of talking household goods, and the spell can only be broken if he learns to love, and has a beautiful woman fall in love with him.The main antagonist is stage musical veteran Luke Evans as Gaston, determined to marry Belle some day. His right-hand loyalist is Josh Gad as LeFou. Kevin Kline is good as Belle's dad, Maurice. (The story is set in France, most of the characters speak British, but not all.)The movie is a bit long at just over 2 hours but is very interesting and entertaining.

Sicario," A Mexican hit man is a 'sicario.' Drug action on the Texas border.
","This is a tight thriller and all the actors/characters are interesting. A 'sicario' is Spanish for 'hit man' and in a fashion the whole movie is about one hit man who is doing it all for himself.Emily Blunt is FBI agent Kate Macer and in the open scene we see her and her team discovering a cache of bodies behind walls, then an explosion as her men open a chamber in the ground. Back in the office she is concerned she may face discipline but instead she is asked if she would be willing to accompany a team searching for tunnels and illegal drug movement across the US-Mexico border.The whole operation seems mysterious, to us the viewers and to Kate. She isn't told much, she is told to 'observe and learn', while a larger group gets their orders for a mysterious trek into Juarez to bring back a prisoner. They really only wanted her to be present, as a way to make it legal for them to cross the border. They had no intent that she actually participate.Josh Brolin as agent Matt Graver is the team leader and he always seems to be too relaxed for what is going on. The real protagonist- antagonist is Benicio Del Toro in a super performance as Alejandro. He had been an attorney in Colombia but one particular Mexican drug lord had killed and beheaded his wife, then killed his daughter, and he was bent on revenge. He became his own personal 'sicario.'The movie is very well made with a number of tense scenes.

They set up a nighttime sting and Alejandro held hostage a dirty Mexican police officer, together they tracked down one of the drug lord's men, then forced him to take Alejandro to the man's house, where he systematically killed each guard then confronted the family at dinner.

Departures," Totally delightful and meaningful Japanese movie, subtitles are easy to follow.
","I believe this movie won the Oscar for best foreign film, and it is easy to see why. The main character is Daigo, a young man who grew up playing the cello, and finally has a job with an orchestra. But it is quickly dissolved and Diago decides that he really isn't good enough to pursue a well-paying professional career. So he and his young wife move back to the smaller community he was raised in.He needs a job, and finds an advertisement for 'departures', which he interprets as some sort of travel booking service. He interviews and 'Boss' offers him a job, on the spot. We find out later it was because Boss had a hunch about Daigo.But the ad was incorrect, Boss says it is for 'the departed', a job to prepare dead bodies for the coffin. We see, in Japanese culture, this involves a process that is performed in the home, with friends and family looking on. It involves ceremonial washing of the body, all in an elaborate choreography to keep the body itself from being exposed.Daigo gets off to a rough start, he isn't sure he wants to deal with bodies, and the stench at one home, where the person had been dead for a few days, really gets to him. Besides, he didn't even admit to his wife, Mika, what he actually did. But Diago is a natural, once he gets over the initial hurdles. He has a natural empathy for family members and a reverence for the dead. Friends and then his wife try to get him to quit, but Daigo sees his profession as something good, as it contributes to the happiness of survivors. Eventually, when a close friend dies, and Daigo performs the ceremony, everyone realizes this too and Diago's profession is finally appreciated for what it is.Masahiro Motoki as Daigo Kobayashi Tsutomu Yamazaki as The Boss Ry√¥ko Hirosue as Mika Kobayashi",Null,0,0,15 April 2011
Some Like It Hot," 'Water polo, isn't that dangerous?' 'I'll say, I had two ponies drown under me!' ","Many consider 'Some Like It Hot' to be the finest comedy ever. I don't. I enjoyed it, but there are many more modern comedies that I think are better. It is a shame that this one was not shot in glorious color, because black and white does not do it justice. Curtis, Lemon, and especially Marilyn Monroe, are all great here, but the comedy sense is a bit too screwball to work well for the entire 120 minutes. However I especially liked Marilyn, including her singing, and the Cary Grant accent that Curtis uses when assuming the identity of 'Shell Oil, Junior', rich yachtsman courting Monroe's 'Honey.' The movie gets its title from a reference midway, when several were discussing a musical style, 'jazzing' things up, because of the music 'some like it hot.'  The DVD was from my public library.SPOILERS follow, please read no further, OK!!Lemmon and Curtis are band members in Chicago, going to a garage to borrow a car for a gig in Urbana, witness a mob execution, go on the run, dress up as women to get a Florida gig in all-woman orchestra, train trip, party in sleeper car, arrive at hotel, Joe Brown character falls for Lemmon, Curtis is hot for Monroe character, romances her on yacht while owner, Brown is onshore dancing with Lemmon, mobsters show up for 'Italian Opera Lovers' convention at hotel, Lemmon and Curtis on the run again, headed to yacht, Monroe forgives Curtis for his deception, Lemmon takes off his wig, tells Brown that he is a man, can't get married, Brown closes the movie with 'Nobody's perfect.'",Null,1,2,19 December 2003
Inside Man," 'The further you run from your sins, the more exhausted you are when they catch up with you.'
","Refreshing to view a movie that actually lives up to its hype, and more. This is a bank heist movie that isn't anything that it seems to be. The movie starts with Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) in a very small place, a cell of sorts, but we don't really know if he is in prison or not, because in a long flashback from that opening scene we see that he and a few accomplices enter a bank dressed as painters, and proceed to hold all customers and bank employees hostage.Denzel Washington is Detective Keith Frazier who assumes the role of negotiator, trying to get the crooks to give themselves up. The interactions of Frazier and Russell, by phone and face to face plays an important part in the story.Jodie Foster has an interesting role, as Madeline White, a 'facilitator' of sorts for the very rich, able to have the right connections to get things done. To do that job you have to be very pliant with your morals. She is hired by the bank president Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) who, it is revealed, has something in the bank that would be very costly if the crooks stole it. So she has to be allowed to go into the bank to negotiate off the record with Russell. Willem Dafoe has an interesting, low key role as Captain John Darius in charge of the police force that surrounds the bank.This movie takes a very novel approach and builds to a very interesting ending. The acting, directing (Spike Lee) and editing are first rate. One of the better of its genre.SPOILERS - SPOILERS. We don't learn how he knows, but Russell is after Arthur Case's personal deposit box, which contains papers, expensive cut diamonds, and a valuable ring. We learn that Case made money by dealing with the Nazis 60 years earlier (approx 1945) while Jews were being exterminated. This was his sin, and he had spent the rest of his life doing philanthropic deeds as a way of making amends. But, as Russell says in a deleted scene (on DVD), 'the further you run from your sins,the more exhausted you are when they catch up with you.' Russell's goal was two-fold, to steal the diamonds for him and his crew, and to expose Case's Nazi connections. He does the latter by leaving the ring in the deposit box, with a note 'follow the ring' which Frazier then could use to trace down and expose Case. The crooks never wanted to steal money, their demands for a 747 and two buses was only intended to give them time to build a small room behind storage shelves, where Russell would spend 7 days, then walk out of the bank with the diamonds and papers. Leaving the bank, as Frazier walks in, they bump, later that night Frazier finds a cut diamond in his suit pocket. In the bank he and Russell had had a very brief conversation about Frazier getting engaged but was broke, so Russell made it a point to get him a diamond. Since they had been purchased by illegal means, it classifies as a sort of 'victimless crime.'",Null,1,3,20 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," Love it or hate it, but I give it '5' of 10 for style!
","Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about 'content' of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for 'interweaving 3 different stories.' Ever watch the TV series 'Northern Exposure?' Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various 'philosophical discussions', like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as 'Longitude', 'Nixon', 'Apollo Thirteen', 'Amistad' - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'The Matrix'. Or thought-provoking ones such as 'Shawshank Redemption', 'American History X', 'Lone Star', or 'Good Will Hunting'.I give low ratings to such films as 'The Game', 'The Usual Suspects' - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think 'Pulp Fiction' exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do.",Null,9,21,15 November 2000
Jack Reacher," Good entertaining diversion, Jack Reacher has a wide reach!
","DVD from my local library. I don't have any affection for Tom Cruise, the man and his politics, but I find that he makes really interesting action movies, like this one.Here Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher , we gradually find out he was a highly trained military man and expert marksman, but over the past few years has dropped off the grid. When 5 people are apparently randomly shot and killed sniper-like from long range in Pittsburgh, a quick investigation points to a man who had gone berserk and killed 5 while still in the military. But the only 'confession' he writes is 'get Jack Reacher.' Before they even have a chance to look for him, he shows up. Rosamund Pike is attorney Helen who volunteers to try to get the man's life spared, partly because she knows her dad, Richard Jenkins as District Attorney Rodin , usually wins his cases. But Reacher sizes up the situation and comes to his own alternate conclusion, the arrested man was framed, he was not a good enough marksman to pull it off, plus clues seemed to be left simply to implicate him.As viewers we can see in the opening scenes who the real shooter was, and it indeed was NOT the man arrested, but we don't know why he is being framed. That part of the story is revealed very gradually up until the end.I happen to like movies, like 'Taken' where a man with superior skills hunts down and gets all the bad guys. This is that kind of movie.SPOILERS: In fact the 5 killings were not random, but made to look that way. Four were random, but one was targeted, a woman who upon the death of her husband decided NOT to sell their business as planned. The foreign business entity that stood to lose from this decision was responsible for her execution, and the collateral deaths. A dirty cop was involved in the ruse.",Null,1,4,7 June 2013
"McFarland, USA"," Inspiring true story of a coach who gets Mexican immigrant sons to run cross country.
","This is definitely not a 'republican' movie, where the focus is more often 'how can we keep Mexicans out of the USA?' This is about Mexican immigrant families working hard in the fields of California, harvesting the current crop, be it tomatoes or oranges or cabbage. They get paid by the field so long hours and picking efficiency has its reward. It is a job for all male family members with little time for fun.But Kevin Costner as Jim White has just been fired from a coaching job because he became angry at a player's attitude and threw a shoe at him, cutting the boy's face, in the locker room at halftime. So as a last resort, to support his family of wife and two daughters, he lands in Mcfarland, California, a heavily Mexican community in the center of the state north of Los Angeles, in 1987. He assists with football, but the team is poor. However he notices that many of the boys seemingly can run forever. As one explains, he doesn't have a car so he needs to get places.Somewhere in all this coach White gets permission to start a cross country team. No one at the school even knew what all cross country entailed. None of the boys went into it eagerly. But gradually they managed to form a team with the mandatory 7 boys.Costner is really good and the script is very interesting. The DVD has an extra which includes shots of the original boys, now in their 40s, running with the boys in the cast. Apparently former cross country members routinely return to visit and run with the boys in training just for the team-building factor. It is a matter of record that Mcfarland won 9 state cross country championships over a 14- year period starting in 1987.Good movie, shows how one person can make a lasting difference through perseverance, even if coach White's initial ambition was just to find a job away from Mcfarland. His attitude changed and he remained there.",Null,0,1,28 June 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," If you like off-the-wall British movies, you'll love this one.
","The DVD version is very well done, sharp video transfer and good soundtrack, but you need a system with a subwoofer to get the full benefit from 'mood' music.This is *not* a movie for those looking for a nice story and a message.  The characters are all crooks.  They beat and shoot each other. They plot to steal each others' money and guns. They use drugs.  They have no morals. My wife walked out half-way, but she doesn't usually like British movies. 
However, if you can get past all that, there is lots of funny stuff in this movie.  You find out from the extra DVD information that some of the crooks really are crooks with some acting experience, and it comes across that way.Imagine Trainspotting  meets Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and you'll have the gist of this flick.  I give it a 6 of 10.  But then, I thought The Waterboy was about the funniest movie ever!",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
Les Mis√©rables," Wonderful movie, brought tears to my eyes.
","Before I sat down to see this one I had seen an earlier filmed version, and I knew the basic story. But I have never seen a stage version of it, nor am I a Les Mis 'fanboy.' I took it for its own merits with no preconceived notions. Well maybe one, I had heard that Russell Crowe was an abomination. I was very happy to find that not only to be untrue, he actually did very well. He is not the lyrical singer that, say, Jackman is, but Crowe always sings on-pitch, and his somewhat unrefined voice actually fits the character he plays.Hugh Jackman, of course trained and successful song and dance man, is Jean Valjean. And his nemesis for life is played by Russell Crowe as Javert . What makes this story so remarkable is that Valjean and Javert are more alike than different. Both of them want to be honorable men, but with different approaches.My favorite scene is when Anne Hathaway, as Fantine , sings the famous 'I Dreamed a Dream.' It has been well publicized, the songs were not recorded in a studio but actually sung by the actors live, as the scene was being acted and filmed. There have been many beautifully sung renditions, but Hathaway's version is more acting with good singing thrown in, and it really touched me. The only poor singer in my opinion is Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Now I like Seyfried, as an actress, but as she demonstrated in 'Mamma Mia' and now in 'Les Mis', she desperately needs training to learn how to control her voice and sing well. She has a natural, rapid, shallow vibrato that makes anything she sings cringe-worthy. Also Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Samantha Barks as √âponine were revelations to me. I had seen Redmayne in several movies and knew he had acting chops, but he is a wonderful singer, and Barks, in her big break, is so much better than Seyfried that she actually made Seyfried sound even worse than she is. I know it is a very long movie, a bit over 2 1/2 hours, but I didn't really want it to end, I was enjoying it so much.",Null,1,4,12 June 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Sequel, Peter Quill finds his father.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. My wife skipped it. Almost three years ago I watched the first one, and in part I wrote ' A Stan Lee comedy... action goes from one strange planet to another, all the while playing up dialog for laughs when it could. 'This sequel pretty much takes the same approach. The added theme here is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his band of alien guardians encounter Ego (Kurt Russell) on his own planet, also named Ego. Pretty quickly Peter finds out that 34 years earlier in Missouri Ego had a fling with Peter's mother and in fact is Peter's biological dad. But it is much bigger than that, Ego is an immortal, as he explains it a 'god' with a lowercase 'g', already alive for millions of years. He wanted to father a child that would also have his powers. When it turns out Ego's intentions aren't pure that sparks a battle to neutralize him.While the story is interesting it is just a 'popcorn' story, the entertainment for me came with all the humor and action scenes and it contains a lot, most of it very inventive. Also I love a movie with a soundtrack that gives my powered subwoofer a workout and this one definitely does. Overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.",Null,1,3,20 September 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Moderately interesting work of fiction regarding religious beliefs.
","This movie received lots of 'hype' before its introduction, and that often signals 'mediocre.' Although it has an all-star cast and a competent director, the controversy surrounding it turns out to be more interesting than the movie itself.Tom Hanks is Dr. Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor specializing in symbols. In Paris a murder is committed in the Louvre, and his name is scribbled in blood by the victim. So that puts him directly on the suspect list, even though we know someone else is responsible.Audrey Tautou (of Amelie) shows up quickly as Agent Sophie Neveu. Their chief pursuer is Frenchman Jean Reno as Captain Bezu Fache. The trouble is many of these characters belong to a fictitious secret society to protect the faith. At issue is whether an old code left by da Vinci leads to the location of the Holy Grail. The movie is done in a style where the protagonists are being chased by the cops and each time they barely escape via a ruse right before getting caught. Plus, there are many slow-moving parts where characters talk and explain what is going on. Often it reminded me of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the way arcane clues are pieced together to lead them to the next set of clues in a different city or country.Other key characters are Paul Bettany as the ghostly Silas and Alfred Molina as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa. My wife and I watched it on DVD, free from the library. She had read the book and said it was a faithful adaptation. Both of us thought it interesting, neither of us thought it was a particularly good thriller.SPOILERS. Although the ending leaves everything open, as to what is real, it hints that the 'grail' is really a female descendant of Jesus who married Mary Magdalene, and further that Agent Sophie Neveu is the last living descendant.",Null,0,3,18 December 2006
Titanic," Even better the second, third, and fourth times around.
","This is a May 2020 update, as I have watched this maybe 5 or 6 times over the years, most recently last night. Yes, it is long, and they probably spend too much time showing the carnage during the actual sinking, but after I start watching it and become immersed yet again the time figuratively flies.For a movie that was made almost 25 years ago it holds up extremely well in picture and sound. Dicaprio and Winslet are of course marvelous in their roles but for me Billy Zane is the best here, the way he plays the demanding rich American taking his British teenage fiancee back home, only to be interrupted by the carefree Jack who presents a completely different outlook on life.Say what you want about James Cameron, the person, but he did a masterful job of weaving together several different stories, including the elderly modern day Rose telling her story after Jack's charcoal drawing is recovered from the wreckage 2 1/2 miles under the surface of the Atlantic. Even just the modern day images of the real Titanic wreckage add immeasurably to the impact of the whole movie.This will remain a classic for many decades to come, well deserving of its various awards.",Null,5,18,7 September 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Yes, I believe it deserves all the 8, 9, and 10 votes it has gotten.
","First let me say I have not read any Harry Potter books, and I think that is an advantage to enjoying these Harry Potter films. Second, let me say I am a Christian and a grandfather, and I found the witchcraft not one bit troubling.  It's a movie, after all, and in the end 'love' is the main quality Harry Potter is credited with.Even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours long, it never seems too long. Perhaps that's because each step in the development of the characters is so interesting. The various stars are just perfect for their roles. I especially enjoyed Emma Watson as the precocious Hermoine. She is a good young actress and I enjoy her typically British facial contortions when making certain word sounds.For the young, or simply young at heart, the various depictions of 'magic' are so much fun to watch. Hermoine read her assignments, memorized useful spells, and was always ready when the need arose. The broom flying lessons on the playground. The selection of the perfect magic wand in the wand store. Catching the train to Hogwarts on platform 9 3/4.  All highly entertaining. I can understand why the Harry Potter books are so popular, the author has a great imagination.When the film finally got around to action and excitement during its latter stages, it had a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' feel to it, falling in a pit of wiggly things, making narrow escapes. And the one character that at first seemed meek, mild and handicapped, later turned out to be a villian, had a 'Usual Suspects' feel to it. Just part of film evolution, every good thing influences things that come later.The DVD picture is remarkably sharp and colors realistic. The 5.1 surround sound and John Williams score complements the film very well. For collectors of good movies, a fine DVD to own. I'm happy that I have my own! :-)",Null,2,8,1 June 2002

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Another fun, visually stunning Harry Potter movie.
","Even though we are grandparents, sometimes we just like to be like kids again, and that's what watching a Harry Potter movie does for us. As always the trio are Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. As with all Harry Potter stories this one gets a bit complex, and being an American I don't always catch the references made in the script, but none of that really matters. You just pop in the DVD, crank up the subwoofer, and enjoy.The 'Goblet of Fire' reference is to a magical goblet of fire. A tri-wizard competition is to be held, and the potential participants are warned that it is dangerous, even life-threatening. Also, you have to be 17 or older to enter. Two other schools of wizards are brought to Hogwarts, where the selections are to be made. As the 'goblet of fire' magically spits out partially burned pieces of paper with names, finally three are chosen, one from each school. But lo and behold, a 4th paper is spit out, with the name Harry Potter. All are surprised because Potter is only 14 (Radcliffe was actually 16) and was not supposed to be entered. Potter claimed that he DIDN'T enter his name.Regardless of all that the tri-wizard competition is held, with 4 participants. One involves snatching a golden egg from a fire-breathing dragon, that also flies! Another is retrieving a personal object from deep in the sea within one hour. Another is a giant maze of hedges, but it comes alive! In the end, no surprise, Harry Potter gets to the bottom of things and the dastardly deeds of others are revealed.

In Time," For a few to be immortal the others must die.
","It is a time in the future when genetic refinements have allowed human bodies to age to 25 and no further. However as you reach exactly 25, your timer kicks in and, unless you earn more time, you have exactly one year, only 52 weeks, to live. However if you can earn (or beg or steal or borrow) more time then you can potentially live forever. Your own time is cleverly displayed in yellow-green glowing numbers on your left arm, constantly counting down the seconds. This can get very dramatic, and several times does, as the few remaining seconds count down to zero.To me this is an allegory using time instead of money to comment on our social issues. Where the powerful may have thousands or millions of years, while the ordinary citizens live from day-to-day. Instead of wondering where their next meal is coming from they wonder where their next 24 hours of time will come from.Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a 'time keeper'. He has been doing it for 50 years and it is not at all clear how old he actually is, but it certainly is at least 75. But he looks 25. He chases down those suspected of gaining time by criminal activity.Justin Timberlake is arguably in the lead role as Will Salas. He lives in Time Zone 12 which is their ghetto. When he comes upon a man who is over 100 years old (he looks 25) and with over 100 years of 'time', and just tired of living any longer, when they both fall asleep gives Will all his time except 5 minutes, which allows him to walk across the street to a bridge over the Los Angeles River and when his time counts down to zero he falls dead into the river. This leads authorities to a manhunt and a convenient street camera identifies Will as a suspect.The movie is novel and entertaining, we enjoyed it. As I watched fictional characters trying to figure out how they would get their next time increment, I naturally thought of all those people in our real world not knowing for sure how they would get money for next month's rent or for food. It really is an issue, the small % of very wealthy people having more than they will ever need while so many are starving and homeless.Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, the daughter of a time-wealthy man who owns a number of businesses. She and Will become unlikely fugitives and eventually love interests.SPOILERS: After overcoming the time-keeper's hunt, and almost running out of time, Will and Sylvia bond emotionally and become a team. A sort of Bonnie and Clyde, destined to knock off all the big time-keeping banks and redistribute time to those who don't have much left.",Null,0,2,29 February 2012
Thor," Entertaining to watch, mostly for the novelty of an ancient god being ejected into modern day life.
","After I see a movie I usually read a few professional reviews, to see what they saw vs what I got out of the viewing experience. I was particularly struck by the very poor review the critic Ebert wrote. While I don't always agree with him, I find his reviews are usually fair and balanced.So I thought more about it, and eventually came closer to his points. There really isn't much of a story here. The god Odin is getting up in years and Thor is his natural successor. But Thor is arrogant, and seems to want to fight instead of seeking peace. (Did George Bush the Younger model his behavior after Thor?) So Odin jettisons Thor to Earth, were he is discovered by a small group of scientists studying extraterrestrial phenomena. But Thor's hammer, which makes him mighty, was sent down nearby, and is now in a crater but nobody, even Thor, can dislodge it. Because he has to become humble first. This he will do by falling in love with the pretty, young scientist.I enjoyed the movie, it was fun to see how Thor coped with his new environment. But in the end it is not that great of a movie, just a fun one to watch.Chris Hemsworth is in fine form as Thor. The young scientist is Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Thor's brother, with some secrets, is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Their dad is Anthony Hopkins as Odin. But my favorite is Idris Elba as Heimdall, the Gatekeeper, who allows or restricts passage to the different realms.",Null,0,1,28 September 2011
The Happening," Overall a pretty poor movie. Interesting concept, poorly executed.
","Night Shyamalan struck gold with 'The Sixth Sense' and perhaps because of its success he believes he has the Midas touch in film. But once again he clearly proves that he doesn't. To me the concept of this movie was interesting and unique, but Shyamalan is proving to be a rather poor script writer. The dialog often is silly, and there is no smooth flow to the whole movie.The two main characters are Mark Wahlberg as Elliot Moore and Zooey Deschanel as his wife Alma Moore. They do fine, especially Whalberg, but Shyamalan didn't give them much to work with.Suddenly something very strange happens, in New York's Central Park. Whole groups of people stop in their tracks, then one might walk backwards for a short distance, and then do something totally out of character to kill himself or herself. This is to portray their normal senses being short-circuited.Through the news media panic starts to grip the east coast then eventually the nation and the rest of the world. Is it terrorist activity? Is it government testing gone awry? Prophetically, in the high school class that Elliot teaches he makes the point that sometimes bad things happen in nature for which there is no explanation. He used bees mysteriously dying as an example. Later a farmer used a different example, where a tobacco plant can sent out signals to a particular insect to help the plant protect itself. The implication throughout the movie is that plants all around us perceive a threat from groups of people and are sending out a trace chemical that causes our brains to be short-circuited.Interesting concept, but a poorly executed movie.",Null,1,3,28 November 2008
The Shape of Water," Modern fable, a different type of beauty and beast.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. Much anticipated as it won a number of Oscars recently.I was not particularly thrilled with the movie during most of its first half, I didn't really know where it was going and the military guys wanting to kill the creature from the Amazons in S. America seemed to brutal. But as the story developed and more appreciated the acting and cinematography I found it better and better.Sally Hawkins is great as the mute cleaning lady, Elisa Esposito, working in a secret government lab. When they bring in the mysterious amphibious creature and store it in a water tank she is fascinated. Set in the early 1960s, in the Baltimore area, there is a competition with the Russians to see who could learn the secrets of this creature.The villain is Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland, very gruff and chauvinistic, with a mission to accomplish. He is played partly as a mild caricature which works well and leads to some funny moments. Even though he didn't win any awards to me his performance was the best in this movie.Richard Jenkins is always good and here he is Giles, a commercial artist, who shares living space with Elisa. And, although we never see his real self, Doug Jones Doug is really effective as the Amphibian Man.The title of the movie derives partly from the idea that love is all around us and the theme is water here, it is all around us and takes the shape that it needs to take. I enjoyed the movie, it certainly isn't for all tastes but it is quite different from most modern movies. The DVD extras are also very interesting, explaining concepts and showing some of how the movie was made.SPOILERS follow, do not read further if you haven't seen the movie. Elisa plans and executes a daring heist, sneaking the Amphibian out of the lab and into her apartment just before it was to be killed and vivisected. She has fallen in love with it, they actually have sex. In the end, needing to get him back into salty water Strickland finds them and shoots both of them.

The Matrix Reloaded," Fine second chapter to the Matrix series, in some ways better that the first.
","'In some ways better than the first.'  The problem with 2nd and further installments is the novelty is gone, and 'novelty' counts for a lot in this type of Sci-Fi movie. The original Matrix introduced us to that unique world, the travel between the real world and the matrix, the idea of Neo being a savior of sorts, the inventive photography, like 'bullet time', that has influenced a whole generation of movies and TV commercials. So, in 'The Matrix - Reloaded' we don't have to benefit of discovering all those things, instead we see the deeper development of the story, and a fine story it is.
My only real complaint is that some of the fight scenes went on for too long. While I enjoyed them, after a short time they essentially keep repeating and I wanted for the story to move forward. But that is a relatively minor complaint for what as a whole is a superb movie. However, I rate the first installment above it, for the reasons I state at the beginning of my review. Much as the first 'Back To The Future' and the first 'Indiana Jones' movies were the best of their series.I own the DVD, and will buy the DVD of the 3rd installment, even though it has received some harsh criticism from some quarters.

The Disaster Artist," Film about Tommy Wiseau, the artist who made a disaster.
","This movie and the acting received some acclaim during the most recent awards season. My wife chose to skip it but I watched it at home on DVD from our local public library. James Franco produced and plays the lead role of Tommy Wiseau, who says he is from New Orleans but appears to be a naturalized US citizen originally from Poland.Wiseau famously made 'The Room' in 2003, a movie with an average IMDb rating of 3.6 with highly skewed voting, 23% '10' votes and 37% '1' votes, and is widely considered a disaster. Or as some say 'the best worst movie ever made.' Wiseau spent $6Million of his own money which itself is unexplained.So this movie is mostly about that, how Wiseau decided to use his own funds to make the movie he wrote, starring himself. The writing is poor, the acting is poor, but it was made with great sincerity. Clips of many scenes are easily available in online videos. James Franco is really superb as Tommy, as well as his brother Dave Franco as Tommy's friend and fellow actor, Greg. It is a very oddball movie but also excellent, I enjoyed it thoroughly. As an big bonus, after the credits start there are a series of scenes showing the original side-by-side with the same scenes in this movie.",Null,0,0,11 June 2018
The Fountain," Surreal movie about a physician's quest to defeat death and save his wife.
","This is a movie where the numerical rating does not do much to help one decide if they want to see it. For those who like fairly clear, mostly linear stories, they will probably see this one and at the end say, 'That was a pretty weird movie.' For those who like to expand their viewing experience and occasionally see something totally different, this is a good one. I enjoyed it, but only after viewing some of the extras on the DVD. The visuals are stunning, he acting first-rate. The title of the movie, which is the title of Izzy's book, is a reference to the Fountain of Youth, or the biblical Tree of Life.The core of the story is in present time, Hugh Jackman is Dr. Tom Creo, experimenting with tumors in primates, trying to find a cure for cancer. He is very close to the subject because Rachel Weisz as his wife Izzi (Isabel) is dying. Every day he is torn between spending more time with her, and spending time in the laboratory.Izzy decides to write a book titled 'The Fountain.' Part of the movie is set in 1500 Spain with Izzy as Queen Isabella, the same one that commissioned the 1492 expedition of Columbus, and Tom as conquistador Thomas. It is the acting out of her book. She never finishes it and asks Tom to finish it for her.The other part of the movie is set 500 years in the future and I consider it Tom's dreams, his own personal quest for immortality, the Tree of Life, whose sap will heal any wound and give one eternal life. We see him in a giant bubble with a tree, and apparently floating through space. Ever so often Izzy visits him there.Other than that, there is no easy and clear way to describe the movie. At its core is a man's love for his wife and his desire to short-circuit death. In a sense the ending says that we cannot do that, we must be content to look forward to an afterlife.",Null,4,7,24 May 2007
Mystic River," The efficiency of a tough judge and a small jury.
","'Mystic River' is a movie not to be missed because of the performances of the lead actors, namely Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and to a lesser degree Kevin Bacon. The ladies are also good, but their roles are supporting and not critical. I thought Linney handled her role with much more subtlety and believability than did Harden. My main reaction to the movie overall is 'atmospheric'. The viewer is always aware of the mood, and it is filmed almost without color. Black, whites, muted grays, blues, and browns predominate. I don't recall seeing any bright colors at all, except maybe for a store sign or two. The story involves a murder and the investigation to solve it. Here the 'process' has much more impact than the final result. The movie has lots of realistic but foul language, but no nudity and very little violence. The tough decisions we have to make!SPOILERS FOLLOW, please proceed with caution. The story begins in an Irish Boston neighborhood, maybe 25 years earlier, three 11-year-old friends are playing street hockey and, led by Jimmy, begin to write their names in fresh concrete. Two men posing as cops show up, talk Dave into getting in their car, he is held captive in a cellar for four days, molested by the men, until he escapes but is never the same. As grown men with families, Sean (Bacon) has become the police investigator, Jimmy (Penn) as an ex-con runs a corner store, Dave (Robbins) is a handyman and his brooding demeanor is certainly a tie to his molestation as a young boy of 11. Jimmy's daughter Katie turns up murdered, Jimmy gets his own thug friends to help 'investigate', while Sean and his partner, Whitey, set out to solve the crime. Dave becomes a suspect because he comes home late the same night, cut and bloody, claiming to have been in an altercation with a mugger. In the end we see Jimmy getting a tip from Dave's wife, she thinks he is the killer, Jimmy as the judge and his two thugs as the jury, knife and shoot Dave at the Mystic riverbank and dump his body. 'A king has to do whatever it takes to protect his family.' But the next day he finds that the murder was caused by two kids playing with a gun, accidentally shooting Katie, then chasing and killing her to silence her.",Null,0,3,7 December 2004
Zombieland," You just can't trust anyone. First time I let a girl into my life she tries to eat me.
","The introduction welcomes the viewers to 'The United States of Zombieland.' It never is clear is this affliction is just the USA, or all of the world. However I do know that a 'Zombieland 2' is in the works, IMDb tells me so.As we learn during the movie, the 20th century 'mad cow disease' becomes the plague of the 21st century. It becomes 'mad person disease', which eventually leads to 'mad zombies.' So we meet up with Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee and Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus. To try to stay impersonal and increase their chances for individual survival they refer to themselves as their cities of origin. The journey begins in Texas, Austin to be exact, and along the way mentions Waco, but all the town and road scenes not in L.A. were actually filmed in Georgia.These two encounter Emma Stone as Wichita and Abigail Breslin as her 12-year-old sister Little Rock. At first they are at odds with each other but end up banding together to survive as a group.They travel west because the girls want to visit an amusement park in L.A. But tired, they first look for a place to sleep and Tallahassee brings them to Bill Murray's mansion, thinking it to be empty. But they find Bill Murray there, playing Himself.Each time the group of 4 get somewhere they encounter anywhere from a few to a large band of zombies, all trying to catch and eat them. There are some very gruesome and graphic scenes of zombies eating uninfected humans, or zombies being killed.There is a running theme of Tallahassee craving and stopping at places to get some Twinkies. And eventually Columbus begins to get sweet on Wichita. But for the most part the movie is 'over the top' comic situations, with Tallahassee relishing his expertise as a 'zombie killer.' (In an earlier role he was a 'Natural Born Killer.') I enjoyed it as light, mindless entertainment, but it is nothing more than that.",Null,0,0,2 February 2010
Enemy at the Gates," German invasion of Russia in 1942/43, snipers and lovers via for screen time.
","SPOILERS - 'Enemy At The Gates' is a good movie, I rate it '8' of 10. Like 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor', it is a historically significant time and place, with a couple of very interesting human stories for the movie.  Jude Law is a farm boy who is naturally talented with a rifle. In an early invasion scene, he quickly picks off 7 German officers, each bullet through the head. In fact, every sniper in this film shot every victim through the head. They used 'head seeking' bullets. He gets so good, and is demoralizing the Germans who have to quickly promote more officers each day, they send their best sniper, played by Ed Harris, specifically to get Law. Meanwhile, Law and the Rachel Weitz character develop an attraction which develops into a love affair. Sex among the other soldiers at night. Well done, I might add, almost had me in a sweat too. Each day, Law and Harris try to figure where the other will be to get the jump.  They both use a boy as an informant, but his loyalty is with the Russians.  He pays for it.Weitz gets wounded with schrapnel, is taken to a hospital for possible recovery. Law and Harris face down a final time, Harris gets his bullet through the head in the middle of a rail yard, in broad daylight, after he had been so stealthy for so long. That part didn't seem consistent. I would have preferred both of them in hiding, scanning through their respective scopes, suddenly each sees the other for a split second, then Harris getting shot through his own scope, like we saw in Saving Private Ryan.And lastly, Law finds Weitz in the hospital, she will be ok, and we know Germany did not capture Stalingrad. The DVD was very good, both in picture and the Dolby 5.1 sound track. There are some extras but I did not watch any of them. Good movie, interesting historical perspective, good acting by all, a little slow in some middle spots, but better than the average movie.",Null,1,2,6 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Wonderful and classy film, a must-see on DVD, in my book a '10'.
","First I want to comment on some of the unworthy criticism regarding the 'accuracy' of this film. The writer and director state plainly that this is a semi-fictional story using the essential 'architecture' of mathematician John Nash's life, namely his genius, his schizophrenia, his relationship with Alicia, and his winning the Nobel prize. It was NOT intended to be a complete biographical sketch. Plus, since much of Nash's work with the government was top-secret, all that had to be fabricated for the film. As were many of the characters, the delusions, the code-breaking simulations, the speech upon receiving the award. They sought to take a very captivation story of a genius who overcame a debilitating illness, with the help of a special companion, to survive and win a most high honor, and they have done it very well. It deserves 'Best Picture' and Opie (I mean, Ron Howard) deserves 'Best Director.' Second, I want to comment about the acting. Russell Crowe, as difficult as he may be at times in public, is THE consummate actor working today. Just to see what he does with this role of John Nash, to see how he captures the character, how he evolves as the film unfolds, is worth a viewing all on its own. Without getting into the politics of The Academy, nor criticizing anyone else's performance, Russell Crow deserves 'Best Actor' for his role in 'A Beautiful Mind.' As well as he is regarded, I still think his work is under-appreciated by most. I found myself forgetting that I was seeing an actor, that's how good he is, and that seldom happens with me. All the others are good in this film, but Crowe is the sole reason for its greatness.And third, anyone still watching movies like this at home on VHS are missing so much. This DVD, two disks actually, is one of the very best I have seen. Not only are the sound and picture just perfect, disk one allows you to play the film with either the director's or the writer's commentary. Both are among the most interesting of any commentaries, adding real value to understanding some of the finer points of the film. After I saw the whole film, I went back and re-played certain scenes with each commentary turned on, and essentially doubled my enjoyment of the whole movie.Disk one also has some production notes and deleted scenes which are interesting. But disk two has a wealth of extras for those who like to study the whole creative process of movie-making. Included are the choice of the writer, a taped interview with John Nash where he tries to explain his prize-winning theory to Ron Howard. Scoring, special effects, etc, the whole process. I own the DVD.",Null,1,6,26 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Good second installment in the Harry Potter series.
","Interestingly, most professional critics and many 'users' say this second Harry Potter movie is better than the first. However, as of this date both of them have identical IMDb ratings of 7.3.  I actually like the first one more, maybe because in it everything is new, and I especially enjoyed seeing how Harry began to recognize his powers, and the introductions of all the main characters and Hogwarts.  Secondly, each character, and actor, is a year older which doesn't always improve them. Like Hermoine, I thought she was much cuter when she was a year younger. Ditto with Harry.Inspite of all that, I enjoyed the film, and my 8-year-old granddaughter especially liked it, so much in fact that she wanted to watch it again right away.  I resisted, maybe we will watch it again tonight.  A bright spot in all this, the studio made a great decision to avoid over-pricing the DVD. I bought it for $15, now I own the first two, and I expect to buy each of the next as they come out.  Although I'm not really a collector at heart, I figure my grandchildren would appreciate having the full set eventually.As one would expect, the DVD is very sharp, and the 5.1 surround sound is used very well. Although I have not watched any extras yet, the listing appears interesting and the menu is much more easy to use than was the first one. Overall a clear winner for Harry Potter fans. (Additional thoughts. Thinking back to various action/fantasy movies which resulted in a series of films, e.g. Back To The Future, Superman, Batman, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Romancing the Stone, are examples that immediately come to mind, I always found the first one to be the best. Is that because the first movie reveals most of the new secrets of the story, and we find that most interesting? The second, third, etc. in many cases just continue various stories around what we discovered in the first movie? Or do we just quickly become bored with a concept?  Several sequels of superb movies are currently in the make, The Matrix, X-Men, Spiderman, Charlie's Angels come to mind. It will be interesting to see how they do. 'Mission Impossible 2' is one that I actually like a lot better than the first one.)",Null,1,3,19 April 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," We were mostly disappointed.
","We like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I can't think of one movie either of them made where I was disappointed with either of their performances. I was not disappointed here, in either performance. However, the movie as a whole was a disappointment. It was directed in a style that emphasized elaborate fights, with lots of gunfire and lots of people getting killed. It also emphasized elaborate vehicle chase scenes that defied all sense of plausibility. Not that any of the plot is plausible, but for my tastes more wise trickery and less brute force would have been 'more' in the long run. A wasted opportunity.Brad Pitt is John Smith and Angelina Jolie is Jane Smith, surely not their real names. Because they are both professional assassins. But each hides their true profession from the other. The movie starts with them in counseling because, it seems, they think their marriage is getting stale. Yet, they both rate it 8 of 10, which is better than most couples can claim. We see a brief flashback to 5 or 6 years earlier, and how they met quite by coincidence in Bogata, fell madly in lust, and have been married ever since.So, the story is really about their relationship, and how they will rejuvenate their marriage. But nothing simple happens along the way and, since both a professional assassins, we wonder if they will end up killing themselves. A fine movie to examine the 'chemistry' between Pitt and Jolie, who now appear to be an unofficial couple in real life, but for me not a very satisfying movie overall. (Vince Vaughn plays John's associate, Eddie, and now in real life Vaughn appears to be attached to Pitt's real life 'ex', Jennifer Anniston!!) SPOILERS. Things heat up when both John and Jane are sent secretly to a remote location near the Mexican border to intercept someone, but in reality are sent so that they can inadvertently take each other out. Turns out they are working for rival assassin groups and having them married is not good for business. That sets their pursuits in motion, several fights and chase scenes, in the end John and Jane prevail over all the others, none of the bullets hit them in the arms, legs, or head, only in their bullet-proof vests, by surviving they make their relationship stronger, and we last see them in the therapist's office, happier than ever before!",Null,0,1,9 December 2005
The Departed," All-star cast and a truly captivating story.
","Set in Boston, it is a story about cops who may not really be cops and crooks that may not really be crooks, all compounding to confuse undercover investigations of a crime boss, Francis 'Frank' Costello, played expertly by Jack Nicholson.Leonardo DiCaprio is Ofcr. William M. 'Billy' Costigan Jr., but he wants to do undercover work. So he is set up, imprisoned for a while, given a non-traceable ID, then works his way into the group that works with Costello.Matt Damon is Det. SSgt. Colin Sullivan who, when he was but a young boy was given some advice and small jobs by Costello. An altar boy, Sullivan saw a different way for his life, and became a cop so that he could be an inside informant to Costello, to help keep his crime operations running smoothly.Mark Wahlberg is the tough as nails Det. SSgt. Dignam who, along with Martin Sheen as Det. Capt. Oliver Queenan run the undercover work. Only they know who Costigan really is.Ray Winstone, the fine British actor, is Mr. French, Costello's right-hand man.Much of the movie is a cat-and-mouse game to see if Costigan can get enough goods on Costello to convict him and put him away, while Sullivan is trying to expose and get killed the undercover guy, who happens to be Costigan.The only part of the movie that disappointed me was the end scenes, where several were shot point-blank in the head, executed, and the scenes were especially graphic. It seemed to coarse for the fine story-telling in the rest of the movie. Still, an above-average drama.",Null,3,5,16 November 2007
Glory Road," Superb! Simply superb basketball movie, and it happens to be true.
","I was a college junior in 1965, at a deep southern university. We had an outstanding basketball team, and one star was Elvin Ivory, a tall black player. The only black player on our team. There was no controversy, probably because the team remained mostly white. That is fact, not judgement.This movie, 'Glory Road', begins in 1965, where the new coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) inherits an all-white basketball team that expects to lose most games in this El Paso college, and do. But Haskins loves basketball and loves winning, and refuses to stand still. He and his assistants go nationwide, as far as inner city New York, to find capable black players who are mostly neglected by major schools which are typically still all white, as was Kentucky for example. It wasn't that Haskins was trying to make a statement, because he wasn't. He just couldn't get white players interested in his 'loser' school, and his only hope was to recruit the black players.What makes this movie so good is the genuine and fantastic true story, one that could not have been believed, had it been fabricated. Plus, the basketball scenes are very well shot and edited, showing what each coach may have been telling players during the brief time outs when strategy was set.SPOILERS FOLLOW, although history records what happened. Coach Haskins was a tough taskmaster, insisted that his players play HIS way. But while his way worked with a championship girls team the year before, had them losing their first game badly. With nothing to lose, he let his players do it THEIR way, they came from behind and won, to everyone's surprise. In fact they reached a record of 17-0 that season and were ranked in the national top 10 of major colleges before they lost a game. Regrouping they made it to the NCAA final four, and ultimately played multi-champion Kentucky, coached by famous Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight), for the championship. Coach Haskins started 5 black players, unheard of!! And they won in double overtime, for the completion of perhaps the biggest surprise season ever, going from traditional losers to the best team in the NCAA. The ending credits has a nice touch, snippets of interview from the real Haskins and many of the players who were on that team, plus Pat Riley who played for Kentucky in 1966 and became one of the better NBA coaches.",Null,0,2,17 July 2006
Die Hard," Whoa! Where did all those high ratings come from??
","I finally got around to seeing Bruce Willis' 'Die Hard', and for sure it is not a very good movie.  Sure, it has lots of shoot-em-up action, but a very thin thread of a story about foreign thugs holding captive a big business celebration party at the top of a high-rise in L.A. to try and steal the $450 million of certificates in the safe. It is predominantly Willis as the N.Y. cop, coming to visit his L.A. businesswoman wife, and his outsmarting the bad guys. It even ends in a neat little package with him and his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) walking out arm-in-arm.  It's high rating on the Imdb, currently #129, is disrespectful to all those fine movies rated below it. The best I could rate 'Die Hard' is 5 or 6 on the 10-point scale.",Null,6,24,8 August 2001

You may not like the story - a pretty young woman steals $40,000 from a client and is murdered just as she decides to return the money - but you gotta like the ensuing drama and detective work.

American Made," Mostly accurate tale of the drug smuggler from Baton Rouge.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We have loose connections in that my wife worked in Baton Rouge when she first graduated from LSU, and Mena Arkansas was a favorite motorcycle destination for us back in the 1990s. Tom Cruise is excellent as Barry Seal, Baton Rouge native, who learned to fly very young and in his 20s became the youngest pilot for TWA, flying a route to/from Europe. But when he was tempted to get involved in a clandestine drug smuggling operation to/from central America he couldn't resist the big salary. He became involved with some of the biggest drug operations of the 1980s amd in the process moved his operation to Mena, ArkansesThis is a good movie of a basically true story. Many liberties were taken with some characters, some timelines, and some events. But the overall story in the movie is faithful to the overall Barry Seal story.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," When you read all the reviews, if you believe them, you wonder why this movie was made.
","I am not really the 'target audience' for this movie. I quit playing with toys before Transformers ever made the scene. I don't remember if my sons played with them.Anyway, if I were a professional movie reviewer, and I were to give this movie a review, I would say that it has lots of action, some of which makes sense, and you have Earth-friendly Transformers fighting Earth-enemy Transformers. The existence of the Earth is at stake.I like to watch the young actor Shia LaBeouf who is back as Sam Witwicky. He has a very cool car, a yellow Camaro, which is actually one of the Earth-friendly Transformers. The biggest and most powerful Earth-friendly Transformer gets disabled and Sam has to help figure out how to get the elusive Transformer 'mojo' that will bring him back to functionality.Even more I like to watch the brilliant actress Megan Fox back as Mikaela Banes. She is brilliant because she is so gorgeous. I hope all her parts are natural, not man-made, otherwise she would just be another type of Transformer!The movie runs a bit too long, maybe even a lot too long, but on the whole I enjoyed watching it. Not a very good movie, as good movies go, but entertaining. Especially watching Megan Fox.",Null,1,18,23 November 2009
Jersey Boys," The stage musical brought to film, an interesting portrait of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons .
","I first watched this movie in 2014 and now again almost 5 years later, I enjoyed it just as much the second time. I really love this movie and it brings back great memories.I grew up with the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, I was in high school and college in the 1960s when they released many of their greatest hits. But like most other fans really knew nothing about them. That many of them had criminal records was always kept a secret back then, the public probably would not have been so kind if that had been known.John Lloyd Young, a small man and good singing imitator of Valli plays him. Valli was a very small man, even at 30 he was 5'-5' and 116 pounds, according to his mug shot for skipping out on a hotel bill in Ohio the prior year.Director Clint Eastwood was wise to have all the singing done by the actors, many of the original stage production, and recorded live with additional musicians off-camera. As a result and without lip-sync all the singing is fresh and realistic. Young has a very good voice for the Valli songs, but at a couple of places when original Valli songs are part of the soundtrack we can hear how really exceptional Valli's voice was in his prime.The story we see in the movie is pretty close to what happened in real life, although a few things have been questioned. Nevertheless it is a pretty interesting look at an important singing group from that period.It was also nice having Christopher Walken in the movie, playing mob figure Gyp DeCarlo who Valli says was almost like a father to him.",Null,0,0,24 November 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," Old favorite never gets old.
","I saw 'When Harry Met Sally' in the theater upon release back in 1989. I remember it well, I was single, had a date with a school teacher from Kingwood, nice lady but we just weren't right for each other. The orgasm scene was a bit embarrassing with someone I hardly knew.Anyway, I bought the DVD after it was recently released, and watched it again this week. Much of it was fresh as the first viewing 13 years ago, but of course I knew that eventually, after years of meeting and parting, they would get together. Billy Crystal was asked recently about a sequel and he replied, 'It would be interesting to do a film about Harry and Sally 15 years after the first one ended.' Maybe Meg Ryan will get the word and they will.I give the film a high rating. The story is simple, and in many cases trite, but Crystal's goofiness and Ryan's perfect portrayal of Sally, 'a high maintenance woman who thinks she is low maintenance, the worse kind', is I think her best product so far. Their interplay is what makes the move hold your interest for the duration. Plus, there's some clever writing hidden in there too.",Null,2,4,8 June 2002

","Cameron Diaz is Amanda, wealthy LA area owner of a business that edits film to make movie trailers, and she is apparently the best in the business.

Zero Dark Thirty," The ten years from '9/11' to the flushing out of Bin Laden.
","This is a long movie at almost 2 1/2 hours, but it didn't seem long to me, all of it was interesting. It starts with a hint of remembrance of the 9/11 attacks, which started the hunt for Bin Laden. It ends with the raid that resulted in the death of Bin Laden. That is the title reference, 'Zero Dark Thirty' literally means 30 minutes after midnight, but can also be a general reference to doing a mission in the dead of night.The script and ultimate movie is an interesting story in itself. It started out being one thing, because after so many years it did not look like Bin Laden would be found and caught. But when he was, the last part of the script had to be re-written, to reflect a whole different arc.There are many fine actors involved, and I don't want to diminish any of them, but the critical role is Jessica Chastain as Maya , who had been hired on out of high school and her first assignment, which lasted 12 years, was the hunt for Bin Laden. There wasn't a real Maya, but in fact she was a composite of several female agents who were mainly responsible for finding Bin Laden.Ex-CIA Director Michael Hayden revealed that the top bin Laden hunter in the movie appropriately symbolizes a 'band of sisters' responsible for finding the terrorist, clearly the character in the movie is a composite. 'Most of the people who briefed me on Osama bin Laden were women officers of the CIA. But Maya is a composite.' He added: 'I think it does a masterful job at suggesting that in the real world, there are no right angles and there are no easy answers to very difficult situations. And that to me was a great service.' Most of the first 2 hours' running time is the build-up to the capture. It shows interrogation techniques, use of foreign intelligence contacts, tapping of phones, tracing and tracking down the messenger, because for security there were no electronic connections from the Bin Laden compound to the rest of the world. But with persistence and good detective work they tracked him down.The raid and its aftermath, including the identification by Maya that the body indeed was that of Bin Laden back at the base took only about 25 minutes of the movie's running time. That raid sequence was done very realistically, in a set that was built to duplicate, as accurately as they knew how, Bin Laden's compound.All in all an excellent movie. And the BD has a set of interesting extras on different facets of the 'making of' the movie.",Null,1,4,26 April 2013
Steve Jobs," Examines the complicated man we knew as Steve Jobs.
","I found this on DVD from my local library. Good movie, does not follow a typical 'biographical sketch' technique.This is the latest in a series of movies about Steve Jobs, in the years following his death in 2011 at the age of 56. During the 1980s when he and his company, Apple, were making their big splash in the computer industry I was working for a large company and using PCs so only had a peripheral idea of what was going on. I know a lot more about Jobs now than I did when he was alive.The filmmaker is Danny Boyle and in the extras explains that he set out to make a movie quite different from the prior movies on Steve Jobs and his life. The script writer interviewed many people still alive who knew Jobs and identified what he termed five significant conflicts in Job's life and incorporated those in the story. One of them was his daughter Lisa, he had denied paternity for many years before finally reconciling with her. As depicted in this movie she went to Harvard and now has a successful career in journalism.So overall the story here is factual but told in a non-linear manner. Most or all the events really took place, in some form, but didn't necessarily take place the way they are depicted here. Michael Fassbender is super good as Steve Jobs and Kate Winslet is super good as his long-time confidant Joanna Hoffman. It is stated that she so wanted the role she had herself made up to look just like the real person as her form of auditioning for the role. I don't always like Seth Rogen but here he is good as Steve Wozniak. And of course old reliable s Jeff Daniels is good as John Sculley.Good movie of a very complex character, Steve Jobs.",Null,0,0,24 May 2016
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges channels a washed-up, alcoholic country singer.
","Jeff Bridges is Bad Blake, once the hottest thing around in country music, largely for his song-writing skills, but as we pick up the story he is barely hanging on, always almost broke, and traveling all over in his suburban to play gigs in such places as bowling alleys. People who remember his glory still want to see him, and hear him sing his popular songs, but the businessmen who run the record labels and pay the big money don't want to touch him. He has not written anything in years and his act, including his drunkenness, has long become stale.At one of his traveling gigs his keyboard player introduces Bad to his niece, an aspiring writer. He asks Bad if he will grant her an interview, he does so reluctantly, answering as little as he can, then standing up and cutting off the conversation when asked if he has any children. It clearly is not something he is comfortable talking about.Maggie Gyllenhaal is the writer, Jane Craddock, a single mom with a 4-year-old son. Against the odds she falls for Bad, and he falls for the kid, but he cannot do without his booze. A related incident when they were in Houston has Jane leave immediately and go back to New Mexico where she lives.So the movie is really about this struggling 57-year-old country singer that has lost his way among the booze and easy women he meets on the road. Can he salvage his life, and can he begin to write again? Good movie, and Bridges does his own singing, and very well too. Even Colin Farrell, who has a relatively small amount of screen time, does his own singing.SPOILERS: After Jane rejects him, tells him she and her son never want to see him again, he has his life-changing moment. He asks his old friend (Robert Duvall) to help him, he enters alcohol rehab, and starts to write again. He starts to made a decent living again. He tries to get her back but she has moved on. She realizes that she and her son can never overcome, with him, the incident where Bad lost track of the boy while stopping at a bar for a drink, after Jane told him never to drink in front of the boy.

War of the Worlds," Considering the hype and cost, just an OK remake.
","As we all tend to do when a movie is built up for months, even years, through advertising, press releases, and TV spots, I have been eagerly anticipating 'War of the Worlds' for a long time. Last night, Christmas Eve, the family watched it at home on DVD with a THX sound system, replete with powered subwoofer and widescreen HDTV. It was a fun movie. But somehow, overall, it seemed a bit silly. The most intriguing part was when Cruise, Fanning, and Robbins (well, their respective characters) were in the dark, wet basement trying to figure out how to elude the aliens.Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, blue collar worker, divorced, taking his two kids from mom for a long weekend. The daughter (Fanning) is normal, the teenage son, of course, is rebellious and calls his dad 'Ray'. Then all hell breaks loose as a strange storm with lightning arrives, then giant machines, apparently buried all over perhaps millions of years earlier, are activated. It seems all they want to do is exterminate humans from the Earth, and claim it for their own. But who are these people?? (As I think about this movie, I also recall older Sci-Fi movies, like 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', where we experience terror by the thought of what might happen. Today's blockbuster, like 'War of the Worlds', attempts to instill that fear via giant monsters and heavy CGI action, but it simply doesn't work as well, maybe because we the audience fully realize we are seeing big, artificial monsters.) SPOILERS. The giant machines are tripod robots, and strange tripod aliens are inside them, operating them. (They had come down on the bolts of lightning to occupy the hidden machines.) We see several of them explore the dark basement, very well designed and executed. And as happens all the time, all over, Mother Nature ends up winning the battle. A few days after the aliens come to Earth, they begin dying and machines begin crashing to the ground everywhere, amid the destruction. The human species had become resistant to all the microorganisms all over the Earth, but the aliens of course were not, and they soon all died off.

Love Actually," Love Actually ... IS ... all around.
","EDIT: November 2018, my wife and I watched it again after 14 years and while it was all 'familiar' once we got into each scene it also was fresh again. We really enjoyed it again.This is one of the most delightful romantic comedies I have seen in quite a while. It is 4 weeks before Christmas in London, Hugh Grant is the newly-elected and single Prime Minister. There are several couples very loosely connected and this 2-hour movie which follows the development of each attempt at romance. Grant begins the movie with a voice-over, and showing various anonymous people in public showing affection for each other. And the movie ends the same way. I was going to watch only 20 minutes or so to see if I really wanted to see it all later, but could not stop watching. A great ensemble cast and fine British humor in the vein of 'Notting Hill' and 'Four Weddings'. Nudity and blue language make it for the over-21 crowd.
SPOILERS follow, for my recollection only, please read no further -- One of the 'couples' was Colin Firth, a writer, and his Portugese housekeeper. He spoke no Portugese, she no English. With subtitles, we see that often they are saying the same thing without knowing it. Near the end he looks her up at her waitress job back home, he has learned Portugese, and she has learned a little English. He proposes, she accepts. A scene set up very well.Another humorous scene was Billy Bob Thornton as the USA President (POTUS) visiting Grant. POTUS has an eye for Natalie, the cute assistant of the Prime Minister, and as soon as he gets her alone, he makes a move for her. Obviously a spoof of a real POTUS, from Arkansas. The assistant gets moved to a different job, but she sends Grant a nice Christmas card, he looks her up, they end up together.There is a side story of a washed-up musician making a Christmas record, which becomes number one, and leaves a party on Christmas eve to return to his chubby manager, telling him 'you're the one I really loved all these years.' Then the funny story of the Brit who can't ever score with women, decides to go to America to pick up chicks, his friend laughs at him, he goes to Milwaukee, goes into the nearest bar, orders a Budweiser, is soon surrounded by three gorgeous girls, and he eventually brings two sisters back with him to the UK.Another story is the 10-year-old boy who has a crush on a cute singer at school, and eludes guards at the airport to tell her goodbye before she leaves for the States. Another are the two movie stand-ins who have to do semi-nude scenes for blocking, they eventually end up together.",Null,4,11,10 June 2004
12 Years a Slave," Based on a true story of a man wrongly enslaved for 12 years.
","It was 1841 and black slavery was still going strong in the USA, particularly in the South. Much of the story here is set in Southern Louisiana and was actually filmed there, including in New Orleans proper. A street was even blocked off and dirt brought in to simulate an old upstate New York town in one scene. Several of the old plantation homes in surrounding areas were used for filming.Chiwetel Ejiofor, who received an Oscar nomination for his role, is Solomon Northup, a free black man with a wife and two small children in upstate New York. He plays violin and during one period when his wife was gone away for a few weeks to work as a cook, he is befriended by two men who say they are with a traveling troupe, a circus of sorts, and Solomon can make good money with his violin playing. He goes with them and, after a night of too much drinking, awakes to find himself shackled. He had been kidnapped and then put on a boat down to New Orleans. He ended up having to work as a slave, and also to conceal his true identity, for black men who could read and write were a threat and would likely be hanged to their death.This is based on a true story of the real Solomon Northup who was forced into illegal slavery for 12 years. It is a good story, it shows probably very accurately what slavery was like. I do have objections, many scenes move very slowly, and scenes of beatings or near hangings dwell on the horror of it a bit too long. We know it was evil and wrong, we don't need to see so much graphic gore.But overall it is a well-told story, and of course it won the Oscar for best picture. To me the best actor here was Brit Michael Fassbender as the cruel slave owner.SPOILERS: After 12 years Solomon was working on a project when he came across an abolitionist from Canada (Brad Pitt), and told him his story, asking him to contact people he knew in New York. Later someone came for him with law enforcement, Solomon was able to return to his home and family in New York. Historically, it isn't totally clear what his fate was after that.",Null,0,2,12 June 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Unusual but good and entertaining movie set in NYC.
","First I have to start with the premise of the movie. High school kids in New Jersey, wanna-be band members themselves, embark on a weekend night hunt for 'Fluffy', the name of a band they all adore. Hints are given by the media but finding where Fluffy is performing is some sort of treasure hunt.Enter the characters. Michael Cera is 'Jerk-Offs' guitarist Nick, who it seems has been recently rejected by his girlfriend, Alexis Dziena as Tris. She is a manipulator, she won't answer his calls, she cheats on him, but she gets jealous if some other girl shows an interest. Nick has been making music CDs for her, great mixes in hopes of getting her to come back. But Tris just discards them.But one of Tris' school friends is Kat Dennings as Norah, who intercepts the discarded CDs, and enjoys them, even though she has no clue who Nick is.Then, out in NYC by sheer coincidence Norah goes up to Nick and kisses him, because she has told Tris that she has a new date. That sparks all the rest of the events of that long night into the pre-dawn hours.The script is very smart and very funny, and all the actors do a good job and resist the urge to make this just a gross-out movie. Although my wife could not watch the bathroom scene, especially after the drunk girl vomited into the toilet then she reached in to retrieve both her cell phone and her gum! Norah, as it turns out, is the daughter of a famous music producer and owner of a recording studio. Plus Nick and Norah seem perfect for each other, after they got to know each other.",Null,0,0,23 March 2009
Sausage Party," An utterly disgraceful movie, no redeeming qualities at all.
","I had resisted watching this movie, based on the title and knowing who had hands in making it I figured it would not be worth my time.However I recently found it on one of our streaming movie channels, already paid for, and all I needed to invest was some time.This is yet another example of foul-minded filmmakers making a foul- mouthed movie just because they can and get away with it. There is absolutely no redeeming virtue here. I find myself wondering what kinds of movie fans actually enjoy this type of foul movie, but I cannot understand it. I don't get what is interesting or funny about animated characters using sexual references and foul language. It must take a really juvenile mind.Can you tell I am sorry I invested even a bit of time?",Null,0,5,14 March 2017
Wedding Crashers," Mostly missed opportunities to be funny.
","As one professional critic aptly wrote (Ebert) this movie is all runway and no takeoff. It apparently is right now the most popular DVD rental, and many viewers really like it, but I found it mostly odd rather than funny. It is as if the writer and director didn't really know how to make funny situations actually funny. As the movie opens we see the real professions of Owen Wilson (John) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy) -- they are divorce mediators. But their real passion is the wedding season each year, where they become clever wedding crashers to pick up young attractive women who are easy prey because the wedding atmosphere softens them up. They have their approach down pat and some of their schtick is really funny.Most of the movie focuses on their big challenge, crashing the party of Christopher Walken who plays the powerful Washington DC Secretary William Cleary. They do, and end up at his home, a retreat on the water. But things go wrong when (1) the younger, pretty, redhead daughter falls for Jeremy (she is described as a stage 5 clinger) and he can't shake her, then (2) John falls for the prettiest daughter Claire (very pretty Rachel McAdams). They are supposed to hit and run, but this particular situation forbids that. I felt that Jane Seymour was wasted as the wife of the Secretary, always horny and mildly chasing John. Also Will Ferrell had a small role which was particularly unfunny and ruined the rest of the movie for me.SPOILERS. John and Jeremy end up falling in love with the two sisters, ending their wedding crasher hobbies.",Null,5,9,26 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," Epic movie, the oil boom, and Day-Lewis shows why he may the best ever.
","The story begins in the late 1800s and continues into the 20th century. It starts out about mining for gold, but quickly shifts to the oil boom.Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, prospecting alone, finding small amounts of gold, but his big break, serendipitous for sure, comes when a heavy metal cylinder of ore falls to the bottom of his vertical mine shaft and breaks open the ground to expose oozing oil. Plainview is smart and ruthless and quickly changes his focus to the 'black gold', oil, which he knows will make him richer quicker.As his drilling technique and wells start to pay out, unfortunate accidents result in deaths. One of them orphans a young boy, which Plainview begins to call his son and takes along with him. At first we think he is just kind-hearted but we eventually find out is was just part of his approach to get the cooperation of others and to help him buy up cheap land that appears to have oil reserves under it.The second major character is Paul Dano as Paul Sunday who approaches Plainview with information, for a price, that will yield much oil. It turns out that 'Paul' is really Eli Sunday, local preacher, who wants the money for his church. (It isn't clear if Paul and Eli are identical twins, or Paul is an alter-ego of Eli, but it doesn't matter for the story.) So the long movie, almost 3 hours, traces the life of these two strong-willed men, who have a number of very dramatic encounters.Plainview is ruthless, he does whatever it takes to get at the oil he wants. He also has an anti-social, confrontational streak that shows itself often. Yet when he wants something, land and oil, he can be most charming. Day-Lewis was awarded 'Best Actor' for this role and it was well-deserved. He is the main reason to see this movie.",Null,4,7,17 May 2008
Ice Age," A time in history when animals could talk, but humans couldn't yet!
","In what amounts to a throw-back to the early, manually-animated cartoons, 'Ice Age' chooses a very simple story around which is wrapped clever and exciting animation. Highly intelligent sabre-tooth tigers want to get revenge for the killing of one of their pack, so plot to steal the baby son of the human tribe leader. A goofy sloth (Lugiezamo) and a kind wooly mammoth (Ray Romano) rescue the child and attempt to find his parents, joined by a sly tiger (Denis Leary) who at first is planning to lead all of them into a corner so his tiger friends can help get the child back and eat the mammoth. But a series of events, and the tiger's being saved by the mammoth, causes all of them to 'bond'. The DVD is flawless. The Dolby surround sound is remarkably good, truly surrounding you with sound. The direct digital to DVD video transfer is as good, colorful, and sharp as the other recent ones like 'Toy Story 2', 'Shrek', and 'Monsters Inc.'  There is a whole second disk of 'extras' which take you through the whole animated film-making process. Also a short animated film 'Bunny' which won an oscar in 1998. Plus another 'short' which shows the little squirrel, 20,000 years later, in an ice block drifting onto a deserted island, and his pounding of a coconut into the ground triggering the continental drift which resulted in the present day continents!  Very inventive and funny.Watching 'Ice Age', my wife and I noticed that much of the action and pratfalls reminded us of the old 'Roadrunner' cartoons. In the DVD extras the director mentions that those old cartoons of Chuck Jones were the insriration of many of the scenes. Yes, a throw-back to the old manually-animated cartoons, and a worthy tribute.",Null,37,46,4 January 2003
Burlesque," Small town girl from Iowa goes to L.A. to make her show business dreams come true.
","Cher gets first billing, for her status in the industry, but the story is built around Aguilera's character, Ali (short for Alice), a small town Iowa girl working in a greasy spoon and getting bored very fast. Fed up with the hole she appears to be in she takes what she can scrape up and heads to Los Angeles.When there she does the usual search in the classifieds, trying to find a job, when she happens upon the nightspot called 'Burlesque', run by Cher as Tess. They are not hiring so she picks up a tray and starts waiting tables, without an invitation. She eventually gets a chance to show what she can do, which especially is powerful singing, and this forces Tess to reevaluate how she runs her show.For a singer, I suppose inexperienced as an actress, Aguilera does a fine, believable job as Ali. Cher is of course fine, but the real actor among the cast is Stanley Tucci as Sean, gay jack of all backstage trades and Tess's right hand man. Eric Dane is fine as the bartender, songwriter, Marcus who also gives Ali a place to stay, destined to become Ali's love interest. Dianna Agron is Natalie, the absent fianc√©e of Marcus, and we only see her once when she returns to find Ali in her place. which is a loss for the movie, as Agron is very good.The story isn't particularly novel or deep, but it is fun watching the actors and see how the story unfolds.

To Kill a Mockingbird," A great classic by most measures.
","'Kill/Mockingbird' is in black and white, has a simple story, and it does not turn out as one would hope. So, why is it so highly regarded? I asked that question on the IMDb classics board. While I received a variety of responses, the two most telling were ... (1) It is a movie that follows the book very closely. (2) It tells a story of a level-headed man who stays calm and does the right thing during a time when racial and other prejudices were in full form.The title comes from a conversation where Atticus tells his kids that it is OK to shoot Bluejays, but not a Mockingbird because they don't harm anything and just sing nice songs. This can also be applied to the black man who is being tried for rape, and to Boo Radley who is shy but helpful.SPOILERS follow - Atticus Finch is a lawyer in the small, poor southern town, and is asked to defend the black man accused of rape of a white girl. He carefully builds his case, proves to everyone that the man was innocent, and the girl was in fact likely a victim of abuse from her rotten dad. But in the racially-charged atmosphere the jury convicts him anyway, and he is 'accidently' killed as he is taken to prison. Justice is soon served when the rotten dad dies in an altercation. The bulk of the movie examines relationships between Atticus and his children, and the other townspeople.",Null,1,5,12 December 2003
A Hard Day's Night," The Beatles when they were still kids. Approximately.
","I watched this on the HULU channel via my ROKU stick. Great fun to see the Beatles in their very early days.I was a teenager in 1963 to 1965, the years when the Beatles made their big splash here in the States. I remember their splash very well although I never became a big fan. Their music is pleasant with nice harmonies but nothing I ever got excited over. This was likely filmed in 1963, or maybe very early 1964, when Lennon was maybe 22, McCartney was maybe 21, Harrison was maybe 20, and Starr was maybe 23. When you see them in this movie they look quite young indeed and they act like kids. It is very refreshing to see them before they were as big as they ultimately became.They are all from Liverpool and, except for Lennon, from Merseyside. I recall back then hearing 'Ferry Cross the Mersey' by Gerry and the Pacemakers and I had no idea what it was about. Now I know it is about the River Mersey, the lifeblood of Liverpool. In a similar manner Lennon's 'Strawberry Fields Forever', my personal favorite Beatles recording, was inspired by Lennon's memories of playing in the garden of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army children's home near where he grew up in Liverpool. Point being as a kid growing up in the States I heard the lyrics but had no idea what their connections were, later in life and with great use of Google searches I know a lot more!This little movie is a contrived, humorous story about their journey by train from Liverpool to London for a recording session and a performance. There are lots of hijinks but magically everyone arrives just in the nick of time. Nice little movie to understand how much fun these kids were able to have on the cusp of turning into an international sensation.The Beatles are John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.",Null,0,1,7 May 2016
Man on Fire," 'Forgiveness is between them and God. It is my job to arrange the meeting.'
","Denzel Washington is a sometimes sober, former assassin 'Creasy' living in Mexico City. One of the big businesses there is kidnapping of family members of wealthy families for ransom. A graphic says that 70% of those kidnapped do not survive. I don't know if that is a real figure, or one made up for the movie's story. Creasy's friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) convinces him to take a job as bodyguard of 9 year old Pita (Dakota Fanning), hoping it will help Creasy find some meaning in life. Creasy takes it, but makes it clear 'it is just a job' and doesn't want to warm up to Pita when she tries to be friendly. So, as bodyguard he drives her to and from a gated private school and generally sees to it she is safe. However, all does not go as planned about mid-way into the 2+ hour movie and that is where the story turns. This becomes a revenge movie and, for those who enjoy revenge, a pretty good one.Marc Anthony is fine as Samuel, Pita's father, but his role turns out to be minor. Radha Mitchell is even better as Lisa, Pita's mom. Even Mickey Rourke has a brief but important part as the family lawyer Jordan.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Creasy and Pita are ambushed with the help of crooked off-duty cops, Creasy is shot and almost dead, Pita is kidnapped. When the $10Million is transferred other rogue cops intercept it and in the aftermath all assume Pita has been killed. Creasy had in fact warmed up to Pita, and became a 'man on fire' with revenge for her death, systematically searching down and killing those in the network. But he finds out Pita is in fact alive, and that her own dad was behind her kidnapping, along with his lawyer, as a way to collect on the kidnapping insurance and pay off debts. Dad ends up shooting himself when the plot is exposed, many bad cops get killed, and in the end Creasy has to trade himself for Pita, and he dies from wounds anyway.",Null,0,2,3 August 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Just saw it again on DVD, a classic!
","I saw 'Cuckoo' many years ago, probably in the theater. It is strange how we remember certain things vividly, but others not at all. Nurse Ratched is truly a demon, you get to feeling all the inmates should be free, if just to get away from her. In a sense she is worse than the warden in 'Shawshank Redemption'. She kills not with guns, but with emotional torture. Nicholson's performance is inspired but the ending is depressing and uplifting at the same time. It will never be remembered as one of my favorites, but I will always remember 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'",Null,1,3,21 November 2003
Edge of Tomorrow," Live. Die. Repeat.
","This movie borrows a key element from the great 'Groundhog Day', namely the main protagonist must die and repeat his day until he gets it right. That is why its tag-line is 'Live. Die. Repeat.' Tom Cruise usually plays a gallant, suave character who always has a way to do the right thing. This role is a departure, at least for most of the first half of the movie. He is a military officer who has not been trained for combat, in fact he is afraid of combat, when he is told he will be fit with equipment for the planned raid he freaks out and tries to talk his way out of it. To no avail.The story is about a type of alien that has invaded the Earth. These are fierce fighters, plus when they begin the raid it is clear the aliens were expecting it and all the Earthling fighters are doomed to die.Cruise is Cage, and he in fact does die when he picks up an explosive device that kills one of the aliens, but also Cage himself, but in the process he is splattered with fluid from the alien. This has a particular effect of making him re-live that last day.So, each time he awakes in the same place, on tarmac, handcuffed as a deserter, and told he will be in the raid. This is repeated each time he dies, and at some point he realizes he must convince others what is happening so that they can take different actions and defeat the aliens.Emily Blunt is Rita, a well-known hero from a former battle, she and Cage are in the raid, she too gets killed. But each time Cage is transported back before all that happened and she and the others are alive as they should be.As other reviewers have said, this is not a movie to be analyzed too closely, just check your brain and sit back to enjoy the action and the story. It is very entertaining. Plus it has an excellent sound track. The opening 30 seconds of the movie (on DVD) has some of the deepest bass I have experienced, rattling glasses in the mini-bar and the pictures on the wall. SPOILERS: Cage and Rita have to figure out that there is one controlling alien and if they can get to it and destroy it, all the aliens will fall dead and thus be defeated. That is the most interesting part of the last 30 minutes of the story, to see how they figure this out and where it is, finally succeeding.",Null,0,2,19 November 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," 'An overweight girl hanging from the ceiling! Who hasn't had that dream?'
","It was just over 18 months ago that we saw 'Pitch Perfect', a movie I enjoyed on several levels. I like good a capella singing, I myself sang in Barbershop chorus and quartets. And much of the movie was filmed in Baton Rouge and the LSU campus, places my wife and I got to know very well during the 1960s and 1970s. Likewise this installment, 'Pitch Perfect 2.' This one is different because the college girls group had won 3 national championships, and at the start of this movie they get in trouble because that overweight girl (Fat Amy) hanging in silks from the ceiling during a performance for the President of the US has her pants split open as she is upside down and, not wearing underwear gives a sight to the world that no one really wanted to see.So this movie has them trying to recuperate from that indignity, and being suspended from competition in the US colleges, by deciding to prepare for the international competition in Denmark.Anna Kendrick is back as Beca and Rebel Wilson, who was my favorite in the first one, is back as Fat Amy. She is just perfect for this role. The new girl is Hailee Steinfeld, who was so good as a 13 year old in 'True Grit' is the Emily, 'legacy' freshman who wants to follow in her mom's footsteps. Also back is Brittany Snow as Chloe, plus a host of other I will not attempt to list.Let's be frank, this is not a high-quality movie. It has rude humor, some toilet humor, and some very silly situations. But none of that keeps it from being a totally fun movie for those who like this genre. Plus there are a few really good singing production numbers.I enjoyed every minute of it!!",Null,1,5,9 October 2015
Downfall," Leave Berlin? I'd rather blow my brains out. (Hitler, 1945)
","On DVD, loan from my public library. I came across this title recently in a list of 'must-see' movies. I agree, it is a 'must-see' movie. German with English subtitles, and includes footage of the real Frau Junge, Hitler's personal secretary. Bruno Ganz is just really good as Adolf Hitler, sometimes warm and friendly, other times seemingly crazed. In 1942 he needed a new secretary and several young women went to meet him. The one chosen was Traudl, who later married one of Hitler's men, and she then became Frau Junge. Actress Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge, from whom much of the material for the book, and thus this film, came in interviews in the late 1990s. As the author explains, she wasn't hard to find, she was listed in the phone book. Since she had been a young woman and not even a member of the Nazi party, only a secretary, she wasn't subject to post-war prosecution. In her own words, back in 1942 Hitler was sort of like a modern day 'rock star', she took the job because it seemed so interesting. Only later in her life did she realize the extent of Hitler's murdering ways.The film covers mainly the few weeks of 1945 when Hitler turns 56 and then when it appears that allied troops, particularly the Russians, were invariably going to take Berlin, as part of the total defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler became more and more agitated, more and more irrational, as the noose tightened. Interestingly Hitler and his Nazi commanders blamed the German population, for it was them that chose Hitler and to follow him. As the end was near Hitler showed no sympathy for the German people, he figured they were weak and the weak needed to be destroyed anyway.I feel a special connection with this movie for two reasons. First, I was born just a few months after all this happened and second, I studied German in college, became fluent in the language, traveled in Germany in the 1980s, all without a clear realization of what had transpired in 1945. Now I understand. A 'must-see' movie.",Null,1,3,6 February 2014
Whiplash," Best Picture nominee, features a young college drummer with ambitions of greatness.
","The movie starts with a drummer in action in a band room at the end of a long, dark hallway. It is the first encounter between student Miles Teller as Andrew and teacher J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Andrew is a student of great drummers, in a pizza joint with a girl he names the 1930s song playing and the drummer in the band. Attending this prestigious private music school in NYC is to be his springboard to greatness.But while he knew of Fletcher he didn't know what a wild man Fletcher was. Seemingly out of control in his over-the-top criticism of musicians who may be off just a little. And using ethnic and gender slurs to berate them. Such behavior probably would never be tolerated in a real school but it is necessary for the resolution of this story.Paul Reiser is good as the dad, Jim Neimann and cute Melissa Benoist (of Glee and the next Supergirl on TV) is Nicole, a girl Andrew starts dating but stops because he says it will not be compatible with his drive to be the best.JK Simmons won the Oscar for Best Supporting actor and the movie itself was in the running for Best Picture. Many fans think it should have won over 'Birdman.' The movie is hard to watch at times but it all pays off in the final couple of scenes. SPOILERS: After weeks of on-again, off-again verbal abuse Andrew snaps after failing to perform well after an automobile accident right before the performance. He rushes Fletcher on stage, tackles him, both are bloody, Andrew is kicked out of school. But a family representative of a former student who hanged himself convinced Andrew to witness to Fletcher's behavior, and he was terminated. But in an accidental meeting Fletcher asks Andrew to play drums for a gig, actually setting him up for failure by opening with a number Andrew did not know and didn't have the music for. However next Andrew began to play a hot number, stood up to Fletcher, had the other musicians come in, maybe Fletcher finally had his star.",Null,4,7,29 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A very well made movie of a terrible group of stock traders.
","There are many noteworthy days in the history of Wall Street and the stock market, and the one featured here is 'Black Monday', October 19, 1987, when the market dropped about 1/3rd. Jordan Belfort was a young man of about 25, had just started a new job on Wall Street, and this event put him out of work. It turned out to be the catalyst for the subject of this movie.Belfort found a job as a trader with a motley band of guys who focused on so-called 'penny stocks', very small mostly unknown companies selling for generally less than one dollar per share, often for only a few cents. He was puzzled, why worry about these. Because, he learned, the commission was great, 50% of the sales total and getting a few investors to buy $5000 to $10,000 worth would generate a very handsome income. Plus the operation of such trading was scarcely regulated, if at all in the 1980s.So filled with the euphoria of big profits Belfort rented a garage and started his own trading company with his own motley crew and trained them well. But what they did was illegal, where a large number of traders each buy parcels of a penny stock to drive up the price, then dumping them. They get the profits from both hefty commission and artificially inflated stock prices, while the investors get taken. This and other irregularities resulted in Belfort being convicted and sent to prison, but his term was shortened by his cooperation with the FBI. So this movie is about those 6 or 7 years where he was expanding his trading operation making himself and his traders wealthy by playing very loose with the rules. And living immersed deeply in the drug and sex culture. It mostly comes across as a dark comedy.Belfort himself says the drugs and sex shown in the movie, including sex parties at work or on the yacht, and the pervasive foul language, are not exaggerated at all. Maybe so, but to me it was way overdone for what turns out to be a mainstream movie with an A-list director. I am all for accuracy but it would have been a much better movie if they had moderated the filth quite a bit. That part disappointed me, that Hollywood continues to get so raw and less entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio is really good as Jordan Belfort, arguably his best performance so far, and to me he deserved the Oscar for best actor. Also superb is Jonah Hill as his foul buddy, Donnie Azoff. Margot Robbie is lovely as his second wife, Naomi. And also superb is the actual Oscar winner, in another movie, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Belfort's early boss who explains to him what the trading business is really all about, they don't care about the clients, and whether they make money on investments. The traders get commission, their job is to keep the buying and selling going.Although this is based on a real person and his own story, many of the characters and events are fictional.",Null,9,15,4 May 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Easy to see why Forest Whitaker won the Oscar for best actor. Good movie.
","I was an adult in the 1970s, raising my own family, when Idi Amin was in power. Although I was never deep into world affairs, I distinctly recall the controversy in Uganda until he was overthrown in 1979.Forest Whitaker is General Idi Amin Dada, and does a remarkable job creating this character. I have been a Forest Whitaker fan for a number of years, and he is sufficient reason to see this movie. In my mind it must go down as one of the best ever dramatic performances in film.As the DVD extras clearly tell us, the story is fictional, set during a real period. Scotsman James McAvoy plays the fictional character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, a young doctor wanting to get away from home and go somewhere to make a difference. Spinning the world globe, his second attempt, his finger lands on Uganda.Dr. Garrigan quite by accident comes to the aid of Amin, taping up his sprained hand. But by dubious fortune, Amin takes a great liking to him, and makes him his personal physician, and eventually adviser. When Garrigan seeks a way out of this, he finds that it appears to be impossible and sill stay alive.In the script a telling exchange, after Amin had exiled Asians from Uganda and received bad press from around the world. Amin: 'Why didn't you tell me not to send the Asians away?' Garrigan: 'But I did tell you that.' Amin: 'Yes, Nicholas, but you did not persuade me.' As the story unfolds we increasingly see the two sides of Amin, the gentle and the irrational.SPOILERS. Garrigan has an affair with one of Amin's three wives, the pretty and younger one, and she gets pregnant.

August Rush," Superb modern fairy tale, one of the better movies I have seen in a while.
","A couple of young musicians meet quite accidentally in New York, hit it off immediately, and have a one-night affair. He knew her name, but the next morning her dad whisked her off to the next concert. She was a cellist. Her lover never knew she became pregnant, and at birth her dad simply said 'I'm sorry, he is gone.' She thought he died, but he was simply 'gone' so that she could continue her classical music career unimpeded.Switch to 12 years later and we see Brit Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor in a home for orphaned boys in rural New York. Evan is not your usual kid, he seems to be drawn to the sounds outside, the source of all 'music.' He firmly believes some day his mother and dad will find him and 'music' will be the way it happens. Keri Russell is cellist Lyla Novacek, who has turned to teaching. She lives in Chicago. Irish Jonathan Rhys Meyers is rocker and singer Louis Connelly, living in San Francisco and working, but no longer singing.On his deathbed, Lyla's dad confesses what actually happened and told her she has a son somewhere, so the rest of the movie has her looking for him. One person who helps is Terrence Howard as social worker Richard Jeffries, able to help track down her son from records and provide a photo of him.Meanwhile Evan has discovered New York, and befriends a young street musician. He finds shelter in an old abandoned theater, along with dozens of other children. They are all working for their 'music pimp' Robin Williams as Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace. He has sort of a protector role, but expects each one to go to different parts of NY to entertain and bring back 'family money.' Meanwhile young Evan discovers he has an innate ability to understand music, and to play such instruments as the guitar and the old pipe organ in the church. Wizard has him change his name, and as they see a rolling advertisement pass by 'August Rush for the Beach' young Evan is given the stage name 'August Rush', thus the movie's title.Then young Evan/August is further recognized for his ability, and is taken in at Julliard. Much like Mozart did, young Evan hears complete compositions in his head then writes them down. He writes 'August Rhapsody' and it is chosen to be performed by the Philharmonic in concert in Central Park. All the while being searched for as a missing person.Logic tells us that all of this is pretty much improbable, better yet pretty much impossible. But taken as a modern day fable, it works very well. Young Highmore is just perfect in his role. Russell and Meyers are equally effective as the young musicians who later search for each other and for their son.SPOILERS FOLLOW: At the concert, Lyla plays as guest cellist, then is walking away as she hears the playing of 'August Rhapsody', and is somehow drawn to the sounds. She goes back and recognizes that it is her son. Meanwhile Louis is in a car and sees the banner for Lyla and gets out of the car to follow the music. The movie ends with Lyla and Louis holding hands while watching their son conduct the orchestra, smiling because he knew he had found his family.",Null,0,1,17 March 2008
It Chapter Two," Pervasive filthy language is a put-off but otherwise an interesting sequel.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. It is disheartening that script writers choose to add so much filthy language, not just occasionally but all the way through the movie. It is at best a distraction, at worst ruins the viewing experience for many people. It is unnecessary and just represents lazy writing.I watched the first movie, 'It', almost two years ago. It was set in 1989 and the kids were generally around 13 during filming. They used the same kids for this movie, filmed two years later, so they were generally around 15-ish.In this story it is 27 years later, 2016, and Pennywise has made his appearance again. The kids are all grown up now, all 40-ish, and scattered around the country, mostly not keeping in touch. Until Mike, who still lives in Derry (fictional Maine town), contacts them and tells each they must return. They had made a pact back in 1989, if Pennywise indeed did show up again the only way to eradicate him would be the participation of all of them.I actually enjoyed the dual time period and the dual sets of actors. At appropriate times the story switches to 1989, at other times to 2016 and is done in an interesting way. Rather than dwell on the horror that the movie includes, and there is lots of it, I mostly focused on the relationships between the old pals and at times the townspeople, comparing what was going on among them in 1989 vs 2016. Even Stephen King himself has a role, as a shopkeeper of old items, one of the grown boys finds his old bike there and buys it.Yes it is long at almost 3 hours, but except for the pervasive and unnecessary filthy language, I enjoyed the movie.",Null,0,1,26 January 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," It is the 1950s and Edward Mannix is the Head of Physical Production for Capitol Studios.
","My wife and I saw this on DVD from our public library. I actually saw it twice, on consecutive days, because I found it a bit difficult to focus on a particular theme, it seemed simply a bunch of unrelated vignettes. However the second time I focused on the main character, Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, whose office door has the designation 'Head of Physical Production.' It is his job to keep everything together, running smoothly, trying to keep actors, directors, and gossip columnists happy. It is a humorous look at the studio system of movie-making in the 1950s.Mannix is a genuine guy, in the opening scene we see him going to confession, it had only been 24 hours since his last confession. His big sin, smoking 2 or 3 cigarettes and telling his wife he had quit. But all the other characters are quite different from what they seem to be in their on- screen roles.George Clooney is Baird Whitlock, the studio's biggest star, finishing up filming of the Roman epic 'Hail, Caesar.' But Whitlock is a misfit, a drunkard, and a womanizer. One day his wine on-set is drugged, he is kidnapped, and when he wakes up he is in the presence of a group of Hollywood Communists. Instead of being offended he is curious and quickly begins to see merit in their way of thinking. Mannix has to find Whitlock, they can't finish the movie without him and costs are escalating.Alden Ehrenreich is Hobie Doyle, himself a star in the western genre, he can ride and rope but he had never actually acted with spoken lines. The studio pulls him to fill in another role where he has to dress and speak in a more formal setting but try as he might just wasn't a right fit.Scarlett Johansson is DeeAnna Moran who stars in Esther Williams types of indoor water extravaganzas. But off the set she is a rough talker and finds herself pregnant. That would be bad publicity so Mannix has a great idea, why doesn't she just have the baby quietly and then adopt her own child?Maybe the best performance is by Tilda Swinton in two parts, twin sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker, competing gossip columnists. Then there is Channing Tatum as Burt Gurney, currently starring in a Gene Kelly type of US Navy movie where he sings and dances.The writer-director's wife, Frances McDormand who is married to Joel Coen, has a brief part as film editor C.C. Calhoun, apparently for the one sight gag where she almost chokes when her scarf gets caught in the film editing machine while she is showing Mannix a film clip. He is able to rescue her by reversing the film machine.The movie can be enjoyed as light entertainment in a throwback look at movie-making in the 1950s. However some have analyzed it as having much deeper themes. It isn't my favorite of the Coen brothers movies but in total it is very worthwhile.",Null,1,2,26 July 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not so funny movie appeals mainly to males under 30.
","Many critics gave 'Anchorman' good marks, but we watched it last night on DVD and couldn't believe how bad it is. It is clearly aimed at broad comedy but most of the situations, dialog and acting simply were embarrassing to watch. Will Ferrell who plays the fictional 1970s title character, anchorman Ron Burgundy, has been funny in many skits I have seen him in, especially on SNL, where other people wrote for him. As I watched him here, I had the feeling he was trying to be another Steve Martin, but just came across as foolish, and not funny.One of the worst was the conversation he was having in the newsroom with Christina Applegate who plays the new reporter Veronica Corningstone. We see something poking out inside his pants, and Veronica mentions to him that he has a very large erection, and he promptly parades around the newsroom with this 'erection' prominently displayed. That MIGHT have seemed funny on paper, and high school boys watching the movie MIGHT have laughed at it, but the three of us watching the movie just though it was stupid. There are many other scenes that shot for a comedic reaction but just didn't work for us.Fred Willard playing the boss Ed Harken was the only ray of light here. Willard is always funny, and he underplays his role quite appropriately. He is bringing in the dreaded 'woman' on the news team, and the guys don't like it one bit. Burgundy feels threatened, but is immediately smitten when he meets Victoria. Against all reason, she also falls for the dopey and incompetent Burgundy, and they have what seems to be an attempt at a comedic bedroom scene but just seemed absurd to us. When Burgundy has an altercation on the freeway and is then late for the evening news broadcast, Veronica steps in and does great, fulfilling her dream to become an on-air anchor.Later there is a very silly scene at the zoo, covering the birth of a new Panda, when various news team members end up in a bear pit. There is a silly scene of four rival news teams fighting in an alley, 'West Side Story' style, but one man played by Luke Wilson in a 'cameo' gets his arm cut off and we see the nub but he just looks at it and shrugs. Later, at the zoo, his other arm is cut off.The very best rating I can give this movie is a '3', and only because I have seen some even worse movies I rate '1' or '2'. I cannot imagine how well-known critics can give it a favorable rating. I don't really care about Will Farrell, but I love Christina Applegate as an actress. Her role here was a waste of her talent. I hope she picks better projects in the future.Can you tell I was totally disappointed in this movie??",Null,18,35,16 January 2005
Ice Age: Continental Drift," The Ice Age animals are at it again, for family fun.
","Scrat has always been a favorite of mine in his short cameos in the other 'Ice Age' movies, it is a nice touch that they made him an ongoing part of the story here. He starts everything off with his obsession for acorns, which first results in the Earth splitting open, and he falls all the way to the rotating core of the Earth. Somehow he manages to reverse the rotation and that results in splitting off of all the continents, 'a long, long time ago.'All this causes plate tectonics to shift large sections of the Earth, splitting off families from each other, and most of the story is having them try to find each other again. A new character is introduced, a gnarly old chimp who is a pirate.All in all a fun story with great voice acting. DVD from my local public library.",Null,2,2,25 December 2012
American Gangster," Epic movie that reveals how a NY drug lord went up and then came down.
","An internet search reveals much about the two main characters in this film. They were, and still are, real people whose lives are portrayed fairly accurately in 'American Gangster.' In one interview Lucas says the movie is about 75% accurate regarding his life. Likewise, Richey Roberts in a different interview cites some discrepancies, but overall the characterizations are correct.The movie tells the stories of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts using parallel story lines. Lucas wanting to get rich, and seeing street drugs as the way to do it. Circumventing traditional routes and middlemen, he went directly to SE Asia and bought very pure drugs at the source, and used American servicemen to help him smuggle the drugs into the USA, using special made coffins with concealed bottoms.While Lucas was developing his business model, Roberts was studying law at night while working as a Detective in New Jersey. Based on his good work he was eventually given the task of heading up a drug squad with the mandate to go only after the big guys. Fate would eventually bring Lucas to Roberts.This is an extremely good movie. Even though the theatrical version on DVD is about 2 and 1/2 hours long, it never seems long. Denzel Washington a few years ago beat out Crowe for the Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day', an award many thought he did not deserve over Crowe's role in 'A Beautiful Mind.' But here Washington redeems himself as Frank Lucas. And, that same Russell Crowe is here as Det. Richie Roberts. Both of them are superb.SPOILERS: The movie follows the historical account pretty well, as Roberts and a squad of police raid Lucas' home and his drug operation, and seize his assets. Lucas went to prison but his sentence was cut short because he cooperated to identify a very large number of men on the NYC police force who were dirty. Roberts became a defense attorney and ironically later defended Frank Lucas in court. He also became the godfather of one of Lucas' sons.",Null,0,1,27 April 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Very well done romantic comedy.
","I often find Will Ferrell hard to watch, because I get tired of his comic schtick very quickly. But his role here as Harold Crick is totally different, and I found him very enjoyable. Much as Jim Carrey or Robin Williams playing serious roles. Crick is an IRS auditor and a person who lives alone in a very sparse apartment. In fact, it looks like a motel room. He does everything with a purpose, a certain number of tooth brush strokes, a certain number of steps to get to the bus stop without wasting any time.One morning he hears a voice narrating his activities, as if it were being read from a book. Every detail. The voice is Emma Thompson's as famous novelist Karen Eiffel, but only he can hear it. She is writing a book with a main character named Harold Crick, and is stuck, not sure how to end it, not certain how to kill Harold Crick.Dustin Hoffman is Professor Jules Hilbert who tries to help Crick sort things out, in often very funny ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal is bakery owner Ana Pascal who is being audited by Crick, and of whom Crick begins to take a liking. So he brings her a dozen flours (not flowers). Queen Latifah is good as Penny Escher, the assistant that the publisher sends to Eiffel to help her meet the deadline.The whole movie is good strange in the same way that 'Being John Malkovich' is good strange. You know this can't really happen, but it is fun to think 'what if.' The whole movie is about whether Crick can survive his being killed by the author, whose narration appears to be accurately describing everything about Crick and his life. Also, whether Crick and Pascal can make romantic sparks.SPOILERS. There is a scenario written where Crick will be killed by a bus as he tried to rescue a young boy who darts out into the street on his bike. But after Eiffel meets Crick, and now has a real person in her thoughts, she cannot kill him as she would a genuinely fictional character. So she re-writes the end, he saves the boy and only gets injured badly, and he and Pascal become a couple.",Null,0,1,24 March 2007
The Green Mile," Marvelous movie, 3+ hours, deserves all the praise it has received.
","I saw 'The Green Mile' on DVD and the extras, although brief, are interesting. I hadn't realized this was an adaptation of a Stephen King book. King himself said the screenplay was as 'perfectly written' as he had ever seen.Made by the same ones who gave us the 'Shawshank Redemption', this movie also set in a prison is very realistic. In fact, the several execution by electric chair scenes had me tense up each time. The several stories are carefully interwoven, characters are developed wonderfully, and it is all brought together in the final 30 minutes. Tom Hanks is perfect as the death row 'supervisor'.",Null,1,2,2 July 2000
The Reader," Winslet's Oscar-winning performance.
","Quite by coincidence I watched two Nazi-themed movies back-to-back, this one and 'Valkyrie.' While they are quite different movies, together they offer some very interesting insights into Nazi Germany in the 1940s and following years as war criminals went to trial.This one is edited in such a way that it jumps back and forth in time, but the early part is in 1958 when David Kross as the Young Michael Berg is seen very sick, at what turns out to be scarlet fever, and is helped by a stranger. The stranger happens to be Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz, a basic, sturdy German woman who works as a ticket taker and change maker on the city transportation line.We are also introduced early to Ralph Fiennes as the adult Michael Berg in modern times. He is a lawyer and as the movie unfolds we learn his back-story. We see the young Michael in law school, and later by chance encountering Hanna again in the 1960s in a courtroom.This is a fictional story, but is a plausible one. Winslet is just perfect as the German woman. There is considerable nudity in this film but all in done in context with the characters and is not offensive. The critic Ebert has an excellent review of the story and its meaning, regarding taking responsibility for what we see and participate in.SPOILERS FOLLOW: When young Michael returns in 1958 months later to Hanna's apartment, now well, all he wanted to do was thank her for having helped him and cleaned him up before he went home that day. But Hanna is lonely and takes the opportunity to start a torrid sex affair with this 15-year-old boy (the actor was actually 18). This lasted the summer, and Michael went off to Hanna's at any chance he could. The result was always the same, but soon Hanna made him read to her each time before they got into bed. We find out Hanna never learned to read and write, and in the 1940s took a job with the Nazi SS as a guard, and in 1966 she and 5 other women were at trial for murder. That she participated in choosing imprisoned Jews for execution was lost on her, it was just her job. Michael as a law student witnessed the trial, and during Hanna's 20-odd years in prison sent her tapes he made, reading books for her, but never visited her. Through this she learned to read and write, but could not face getting out of prison and working in the real world as a 70-something woman. She hung herself the day she was to get out.",Null,1,2,27 May 2009
Jaws," A landmark film that loses much of its impact in modern times.
","I can't tell you why I waited almost 30 years to see 'Jaws', but I saw it today, celebrating both my and Spielberg's birthday. I'm just a bit older than he is! 'Jaws' is a fine movie, but I can't see why it has received so many votes of '9' and '10'. It is the 4th of July celebration coming up on Amity Island ( fictional beach community was actually Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts) and someone thinks they may have seen a shark. Local businessmen don't want to scare away the vacation crowd and all their money, so attempt to underplay it. But the shark is real, and the threesome of Roy Scheider (Police Chief, Martin Brody), the boat captain, Quint, played by Robert Shaw, and a young Richard Dreyfuss who plays Matt Hooper, a shark expert sent to help out band together to neutralize the beast. The most that this movie can claim, in retrospect, is that it will make you think a couple more times before you go swimming in an ocean. It is the movie that gave Spielberg his jump-start, as well as composer John Williams.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW, you may want to quit reading. The movie starts with an overnight beach party, and two teens head for the water for a swim as the sun is poised for rising. The girl goes in, the boy is too drunk and falls asleep, the next day they find her mangled body washed up. It isn't clear why the hungry shark didn't just eat all of her. In a day or two, when lots of people are swimming, a young boy on a raft gets eaten. The first half of the movie establishes the risk, with the struggle between those who want to shut down the beach and protect the people, and those who don't want to lose business. The second half is the hunt, the three men in the fishing boat, to harpoon and kill a very persistent and strong Great White shark. The old captain gets eaten, but the Scheider and Dreyfuss characters survive. The old shark is finally done in by an air tank in his mouth, and a gun shot breaks off the valve, exploding the shark.",Null,1,8,18 December 2004
The Wrestler," Superb drama about the life of a washed-up pro wrestler.
","It has not been a mystery for a long time, 'pro wrestling' is just a big show. This movie dares to take us behind the scenes and show us the tricks they use to make it look like they really are on the verge of killing each other. But what does a pro wrestler do when he gets old, and has no career to turn to? This movie, 'The Wrestler', takes us there. Mickey Rourke is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, who 20 years ago was at the top of his game, but now picks up a few bucks here and there in small venues. Most of the fans seem like 'tribute fans', remembering the old days and having fun watching these 50-something wrestlers recreate their moves of old.But 'the Ram' is struggling. He drops $60 at a strip joint just to talk to his favorite girl who performs a lap dance while they speak, clearly old friends of sorts. Yet when he goes back to his trailer finds that he is locked out and has to sleep in his car. His landlord says he will get back in when he catches up on the rent. At one point he works as a clerk in the deli to try to make ends meet, but eventually his frustration gets the best of him.Marisa Tomei is his stripper friend, Cassidy. Evan Rachel Wood is his estranged daughter, Stephanie . He tries to re-establish a connection with his daughter but that seems like an impossible task.Mickey Rourke was nominated as 'Best Actor' for his role, and in other years he probably would have won, he is that good. But he had heavy competition. He really is good as The Ram, and it is hard sometimes to remember what a pretty-faced young man he was in his earlier acting days.A very good movie, character study of an old wrestler with no place to go.MAJOR SPOILERS: After one match he collapses and wakes up in a hospital after coronary bypass. On discharge his doctor tells him to live a more sensible life, including giving up wrestling. He tries, but can't cope. He eventually goes back to recreate a match from 20 years earlier. In his final move, already getting about with difficulty, he jumps upon his opponent from the top of a ring post, and the picture goes dark.

Dark Shadows," The 'Adams Family' would be proud of the Collins Family.
","I had missed this movie when it came out a few years ago and recently found it on DVD at my public library. I like most of the actors here, particularly Depp who may be controversial at times but always creates interesting and entertaining characters. His vampire character here isn't too far removed from his Captain Jack Sparrow roles.Johnny Depp is Barnabas Collins who in the late 1700s comes to America with is family. They settle on the coast of Maine, develop a canning industry and they are responsible for the town of Collinsport springing up. As a young adult Barnabas is in love with a pretty young lady who from a spell lets herself go over an oceanside cliff to her death on the rocks below. Barnabas follows her but he also has a spell cast by a witch and now he is a vampire, so he survives. But then he is trapped and put into a spell that results in his being imprisoned and buried deep in a coffin. He stays there for over 200 years.Near present time during excavation for a construction project they hit an object, it is the long-buried coffin with Barnabas bored, hungry, and waiting to get out. Of course he also has to see all the men are dead otherwise his identity would be obvious.The movie doesn't take itself seriously. Barnabas finds the witch is alive and in the community, determined to finish him off. He meets a new young lady, the new governess, who appears to be the reincarnation of his lady that died all those years ago over the cliff. The movie has a great cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter (doing her barely passable American accent), Eva Green (letting her French accent show often), Jackie Earle Haley (one of my favorites), Jonny Lee Miller ( doing a good American accent), and Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard who we find out is a Werewolf.Just fun entertainment, not a serious movie at all.

Hancock," Will Smith as the reluctant Superhero Hancock.
","I will admit that I didn't like the way this movie got started, but after I realized where it was going then I was able to relax and enjoy it for what it is, a very unconventional love story.Will Smith is John Hancock, with most of the powers we usually associate with Superman. But he is a social misfit, seemingly with no direction in his life. He is a loner, living in a trailer near the ocean, and seems to spend most of his spare time with a bottle of booze to his mouth. As a result, when the cops seek him out to help, he flies erratically, shearing off parts of buildings in the process, tends to tear up the road with his landings, and destroys cars, trucks, and trains that happen to be nearby. As a result the public has a love/hate feeling about Hancock, and lately mostly hate.Hancock doesn't know his history. Eighty years earlier he woke up in a Miami hospital and didn't know who he was. When it was time to release him he was asked to 'put your John Hancock here' and assumed his name was John Hancock! Because of his superpowers he doesn't age as a normal person would.Into the picture comes Jason Bateman as P.R. expert Ray Embrey. Ray sees an opportunity to polish Hancock's image, to make him more valuable to society and turn him into a gentleman. Part of that was for Hancock to submit to prison time for all the things he had destroyed, and in the process learn to quit drinking.The third key character is Charlize Theron as Ray's wife, Mary Embrey. We notice that she is very hesitant when she first meets Hancock at her home, but we don't know why. But it becomes an important part of the story.So here we have 3 very good actors in Smith, Bateman, and Theron. They create very interesting characters and the movie is very entertaining. While it starts out looking more like a broad comedy, it in fact ends up having a nice dramatic story embedded.MAJOR SPOILERS: About mid-way into the movie we find out that Mary and Hancock are alike, but in fact she is more powerful than he is. Both of them have lived for thousands of years and in fact are married. But the tragedy of their kind is that the closer they get to each other, the less effective are their powers, to the point that they can die. That is what had happened 80 years earlier in Miami. Now, that almost happens again, when an escaped crook comes for revenge, and both Hancock and Mary are shot. However Hancock has just enough power left that he is able to escape and get further away and, just as we think Mary is dead, she begins to regain her strength. So they both continue in their immortal lives, but are destined to stay away from each other.",Null,1,4,23 December 2008

They needed an elite team to go in, meet up with friendly Afghanistan militia, use coordinates to direct some bombing from B52 planes flying out of sight above.This mission was classified for years so few knew about it. As we now know the war in Afghanistan is still an issue but this mission showed how the spirit and cooperation of an elite team could accomplish so much.

Kong: Skull Island," Not exactly a 'remake', but contains much of the premise of finding Kong.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, and of course the picture and sound are flawless. Not only the direct sound and the ample surround sounds, but also great use of a deep bass subwoofer track. Saw it again October 2018 and enjoyed it as much the second time.This Kong movie deviates quite far from the 1933 'King Kong' which culminates in Manhattan with Kong climbing the Empire State building. In this version modern (1973) satellite images discover a previously unknown island, they called it Skull Island. A small group of explorers convince a Senator to fund a trip so that a competing country doesn't get there before a USA expedition.The mission includes military men and Army helicopters and their first encounter with this giant of an ape doesn't go very well. With all helicopters downed and many killed, those on the ground must find a way to get to a prearranged rescue spot on the north side of the island.Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad was recruited for his fighting skills. Samuel L. Jackson is the hard-nosed officer Preston Packard. Pretty Brie Larson is in the movie as eye candy, as experienced correspondent photographer Mason Weaver. She was using an authentic period Leica camera and really was taking photos during filming.As they are moving through the forest of the island they encounter John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow, a soldier who had been on the island for 28 years, since WW2, and knew nothing about the outside world but became their key to escape the island.There are many battles with giant prehistoric beasts of various sorts that have survived on the island, Kong actually is the one who keeps them in check, keeps them from overcoming the world. It was filmed in some really exotic, beautiful areas of Vietnam.An interesting and entertaining take on the Kong story.",Null,1,1,30 July 2017
Hitch," Enjoyable only for the actors, nothing profound in the story.
","Will Smith is Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens, the 'hitch' a play on his occupation as a date doctor, his results are getting two people hitched up. The story is very predictable but is entertaining for Will Smith and the other actors occupying the major roles.Eva Mendes was my favorite as Sara who becomes the seemingly unattainable object of Hitch's passion. You would think this would be a 'slam dunk' for a guy who makes his living hitching people, but it doesn't work out that way. Hitch seems right at home giving advice to others, but very clumsy at helping himself. Maybe because there was more at stake??Kevin James is perfect as (almost fat) Albert, the really nice guy who seems destined to finish last. But he is deeply in love with high-powered Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Most of the movie involves Hitch's work with Albert to shape him up into something that Allegra desires. In the end, it is Albert's own approach, not Hitch's, that makes the difference. (This is the movie with the famous scene, shown in trailers, where Hitch eats seafood and has a very bad allergic reaction that makes his face swell up into something grotesque.)",Null,9,15,23 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A worthy final episode, but really number 3 which leads to the first. Confusing? Maybe.
","As I was watching this movie tonight on DVD I found myself wondering what it would have been like had all 6 movies been made in the correct sequence, instead of 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, and finally 3. But that brought me to another thought, namely that maybe 6 movies on the same theme is just too much. Oh! I enjoyed this one, a bit more than episodes 1 and 2 (which were really the 4th and 5th made), and at the end it ties up all loose ends to lead into what we know as the original Star Wars, which is now known as episode 4 but one that most saw initially over 20 years ago. The actors are good. I had harsh criticism for Natalie Portman in Episode 2, for wooden acting, but she was much better here. I always like Ewan McGregor. But I can never find Hayden Christensen as a credible Anakin Skywalker. Still, overall a very nice final installment but episode 3, and with good light saber fights.SPOILERS.

Ray," If you have been a Ray Charles fan, a definite '10'.
","As a teenager in the early 1960s, I clearly remember two of the Ray Charles hits at that time, 'Born To Lose' and 'I Can't Stop Loving You.' If I recall correctly, they were released together on sides A and B of the same 45 rpm record, something as rare as hen's teeth. I wish I still had my copy. Listening to those songs, and singing them as I went about my chores at home, forever cemented Ray Charles Robinson as a favorite of mine. I of course knew nothing of the man, other than his blindness, and had no idea that his lyrics were such a reflection of what was going on in his life.Watching 'Ray' on DVD last night, the 'extended version', it is clear to see why Jamie Foxx has received an Oscar nomination for his role as Ray Charles, the singer who dropped the 'Robinson' because there already was a famous Ray Robinson, 'Sugar Ray' the world champion prize fighter. It is hard to imagine someone doing a better job of becoming Ray. The movie through flashbacks shows us Ray's difficult childhood in poverty with his single mom and little brother, and how he became blind, but it is mainly the story of Ray the pianist and singer from the early 1950s through about 1965. It shows us a very determined and smart businessman, and tough boss, who had much difficulty controlling his passion for pretty women and the needle in his arm. All this while he was trying to be a happily married husband and father, with family back in first Houston, then Los Angeles.Kerry Washington is superb as the understanding and long suffering mother and wife, Della Bea Robinson. As are the rest of the supporting cast. While Foxx does some of the singing, we mostly hear the voice of Ray Charles from his hit recordings. But Foxx is so good we have to remind ourselves that it isn't really him performing them live.I give this movie my highest rating. In general I like films based on real lives, and since I have also been a fan of Ray Charles, this is one of the best I have seen.",Null,2,5,3 February 2005
The Lion King," Great cast and beautiful animation, plus the 'circle of life' story make this a winner.
","My comments may contain some SPOILERS. I believe everyone knows the story already, but please take note, you may not want to read further if you have not seen 'The Lion King.'The Lion King follows a formula similar to other Disney animated movies, like Tarzan and Dinosaur. An orphaned baby is raised by a strange species, the baby eventually grows up to figure out what his real role is, then fights and beats an erstwhile 'leader' to claim the 'leader of the pack.' In this movie, Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is next in line for king, after his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). But evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) wants to be king, cooperates with hyenas, causes a stampede forcing Mufasa to rescue young cub Simba, Mufasa dies at the paws of his brother Scar, who then tells Simba to run, assuming the hyenas will eat him. The cub eludes the hyenas through a brier patch, but almost dies in the desert, buzzards surround him, when a weasel and his warthog come along, the warthog butts the birds out of the way, yelling 'bowling for buzzards!'So, the unlikely pair befriend young Simba, and he grows up into a magnificent young lion, spitting image of his dad. (The young Dinosaur had been raised by lemurs, the young Tarzan by apes, similar themes.) Meanwhile Scar as king causes all the animals but hyenas to leave, their home becomes a desolate wasteland. Simba is lured back by his 'duty' after seeing an image of dad in the clouds, challenges Scar, mates with his cub hood girlfriend, and a new cub is presented. 'The circle of life.' Symbolically, the moment Scar is chased away, rains begin, their homeland will become restored to its former glory, with Simba as king!",Null,1,4,7 September 2004
Bring It On," I really, really wanted to like this movie, but the best I can give it is '4' of 10.
","This is one rare example where Imdb 'user reviews' led me to seeing a film that, to me, is mostly a waste of 90 minutes.  No where as good as such 'teen' films as 'Dick', 'Election', 'Rushmore', '10 Things I hate About You', or '8 Days a Week.' Where do I start??I saw 'Bring It On' on DVD, and the picture and sound are fine.  The 'extras' add a lot in terms of explanation. The writer, director, and actors all come across as nice, well-intentioned people, and the story's premise has pretty good potential - the new head cheerleader (Dunst) finds out that all their award-winning routines were stolen via videotape from a better but financially-poor team from L.A., and on short notice they are forced to come up with a new routine for nationals in three weeks.The nice lady who wrote this had no prior movie experience and it shows. The dialog is mostly unrealistic. The script is intended to be mostly comedy, but most often I was simply embarassed for the film.  There were very few times I actually chuckled because of something funny. The script is full of genuinely juvenile stuff like 'giving the finger', 'farting', complex lines like 'whatever', very silly sexual references, those sorts of things. Or the hackneyed cliche' of the young black girl displaying 'attitude', talking as her head is going back and forth? Old, old, old... A well-written script could have dragged this film all the way up to a '7' on my rating scale.The second problem is the director. In many sections the film did not flow smoothly. One very poor scene involved one cheerleader paying a surprise visit, bringing money, in the form of a check, to help another team get to nationals. Although in total the resolution was correct, it was exceedingly poorly done. The girl walks in virtually with her hand extended, no normal greeting, no build-up, and the other girl's actions were equally abrupt. There are other examples where it seemed that the writer and director were so focused on the outcome of scenes that they forgot to ask themselves, 'does this seem real?', and most of the time it doesn't.  When you witness a really good script, and study it a bit, it is a marvel of correct choice of words, and timing.  In this film, it is most often just the opposite.I appreciate very good films, and feel cheated when a poor one like this is put out. It was obvious on the DVD interviews that all involved thought they were making a pretty good film, but to me it all came across as a pretty amateur effort, when put up against all the fine films being produced these days. The director went so far as putting his wife in as a character even though she is not an actor, 'just so family and friends could see her in a movie.'  That in itself is not bad, Ron Howard does it all the time, but in this production just illustrates part of their amateur approach.",Null,2,4,15 February 2001
Inception," Totally novel story, I found that it took me several viewings to gain a good grasp of it.
","Not all of us viewers are alike, in what we enjoy. Many like to see a movie once, maybe take a few calls or texts during its running time, and never feel like they miss anything. And, when it is over, they are happy with the experience. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that type of movie-watching.However, that type will not do well with 'Inception.' This movie is more for those of us who like to watch every bit of every scene, hear every word of dialog, and try to piece together a fairly complex story. Some can watch 'Inception' through just once and get everything, and I applaud them for that. But I needed to see it maybe four times, over an almost two year period, to appreciate fully how good it is. Leonardo DiCaprio is in the lead role as Cobb, he has become an expert in 'extraction', the surely illegal activity of going into dreams with others and in the process extract some secret or other information. A good use for such a talent is industrial and business espionage.But Cobb has a new client that approaches him for the opposite task, the insertion of an idea into the target's mind, and in this case make the subject think it was his own idea. That is the process they call 'Inception.' The idea for the story and resultant film was an approximate 10-year process for the writer/director Nolan. Much of the details are derived from his own dream experiences, such as what may seem like a day or week in a dream might be just a fraction of a minute in real time, and a familiar sound or loss of equilibrium might bring you out of your dream. The client that hires Cobb is Ken Watanabe as Saito. The subject is Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer, whose industrialist father is about to die, and if the company is not forced to break into smaller units they will monopolize their market. The task is to, through inception, convince Robert that breaking the now his company into smaller units is his idea. To do that is a very complex task, and requires meticulous planning and several levels of dreams. All does not go as planned, unexpected assassins tail them, and all this provides for the drama and action.Another layer of intrigue is added by Cobb's situation, where his wife had died some time before but he was blamed, and as a result he has not been able to travel back to his home and children in the USA. He still sees her, in dreams, often when he doesn't really want to, while she tries to convince him they are not really in a dream, but real.Cobb's team members include Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Ellen Page as Ariadne, Tom Hardy as Eames, and Dileep Rao as the chemist for the sedative drugs, Yusuf.His wife is Marion Cotillard as Mal.I like this movie a lot, there is so much in it that I see many 'new' things each time. I look forward to seeing it again several times, maybe 6 to 12 months between viewings. I have it on Blu-ray and the video and audio are just state-of-the-art. A real joy to watch this movie.",Null,3,16,20 August 2012
Murder on the Orient Express," Remake of famous Agatha Christie story.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. In truth a highlight for me was in the VD 'extras', old clips of Agatha Christie herself explaining her writing and where inspirations came from.This is a sort of vanity project for Kenneth Branagh, directing and also starring as Hercule Poirot, a fictional character who is the best detective in the world. He sounds French but he is from Belgium where, near the French border, they speak French.The term 'Orient' has not meant the same thing in all historical times. Derived from the Latin it vaguely refers to places East of Europe. The Orient Express in this story is carrying mostly Brits and Europeans from Turkey to Calais for an eventual leg to England or Germany.So Poirot and others board the train and at night a notorious man is found murdered. Poirot's task is to use all his detective skill to solve the murder. It is eventually solved but the real entertainment are the characters themselves. Agatha Christie stories aren't anymore what I suppose they were 70 or 80 years ago. Still the movie is appropriately entertaining.",Null,1,2,16 March 2018
Defiance," Based on real brothers saving Jews in Nazi Germany.
","The Bielski brothers were real, Jews in Germany, who defied the Nazi regime to live in the forest for several years during WW2 and developing a community that continually grew. There is a good DVD extra which shows some of the modern day ancestors of these survivors.We enjoyed the movie, it is a worthwhile story and the acting is superb. It DOES require lots of patience at times with its running time of over 2 hours.Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski who becomes the leader of the forest community. Liev Schreiber plays his brother Zus Bielski, and initially they are at odds with each other. Zus is more militant, wants to hunt down and kill all the Germans he can, while Tuvia is more of a peace maker. So Zus and several others actually go away to join the fighting with a Russian band.Jamie Bell is good as the younger, third brother, Asael Bielski. Alexa Davalos is good as Lilka Ticktin who eventually becomes bonded with Tuvia.There are no big surprises here, just a solid movie about the hunted Jews building a forest community and surviving in the forest during the war. If they had been in concentration camps instead they likely would all have been killed.",Null,1,3,26 June 2009
Lord of War," Not quite sure how to describe this movie.
","The title comes from one interaction with one of his good customers, the dictator of Liberia, who has a habit of reversing common sayings. So 'blood bath' rolls off his tongue as 'bath of blood.' When he is referred to as a war lord, he says 'It is you who are the Lord of War.' Nicolas Cage is the Lord of War, Yuri Orlov, raised in the USA and now an international weapons dealer. He will sell to anyone at any time, because he has rationalized that he only sells weapons, he has no control over what the buyers do with them. He further rationalizes that they will get them from someone, so even if he didn't sell them, there would be no impact. But, as he describes later in the movie, he doesn't do it strictly for the money, he does it because he is GOOD at it. Plus, the profit margin on honest work is not very good, because there is so much competition.This movie seems to work best as a very dark comedy. There are lots of funny things, not the least of which is how Nic Cage plays his character. And how he gets the girl. Former model Bridget Moynahan is Ava Fontaine, and her picture is on billboards all over. Yuri has admired her from afar for a long time, but finally takes action by contracting her for a fake photo shoot on the French coast, and also buys out the hotel so that they are the only two there. They meet on the beach, she laments that the next flight out is in several days, so he offers her a ride on the private plane he chartered, with his name ORLOV painted on the side. he just about went broke doing all that, but he charmed the girl and they were married. During their life together Ava always suspected that Yuri was into a different business but she didn't ask any questions.This is a very unconventional movie, and may in fact be a commentary on gun sales everywhere. A footnote at the end says that the 5 countries which are on the UN Security Council are also the 5 biggest sellers of weapons worldwide. As usual Cage creates a fascinating character.SPOILERS. When Ava asked him to quit, after she finally found out his real occupation, he did for 6 months, getting into legitimate business. But the Liberian dictator showed up, shoved a very large diamond into Yuri's hand, and said he needed him. Unable to resist he asked his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) to help. But at the site of the exchange Vitaly saw what was going on, he tried to stop it by blowing up the two trucks of weapons, only destroyed one and was killed by machine gun fire. Back in the States Yuri was arrested and questioned, but predicted he would not spend even one day in court. He correctly predicted that in a minute, a man would knock on the door of the interrogation room, tell the detective (Ethan Hawke) to release Yuri. The last we see in Yure getting a briefcase of payoff, and realize that he is being protected by the countries that have the most to lose if he exposes everything.",Null,0,2,28 March 2006
Sherlock Holmes," I enjoyed it, but not as much as I was hoping to.
","Since it is a Guy Richie film I was expecting it to be wild and different, and there I wasn't disappointed. Much in the way I was not disappointed with 'Snatch.' But there is something about this film, it is hard to put my finger on it, that didn't gel right with me. Maybe it came across as a bit too cartoonish, over the top.Still, Robert Downey Jr. is good as the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Although I found that he tried a bit too hard to sound authentic British and some of his mumbling was difficult to understand.Jude Law was his faithful assistant Dr. John Watson, and their partnership on screen worked well, I thought.Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, thief and love interest of Holmes', was a nice addition.Mark Strong is an actor that I am not particularly familiar with, although I now realize I have seen some movies he was in, but here he is excellent as Lord Blackwood, who it seems is using ancient magic to gain power. His ambition is high, to eventually re-take that colony, now known as the USA.The story devolves into Holmes and Watson figuring out how to defeat Blackwood and to stem the tide of killings Blackwood is responsible for.The film used an editing technique that really added something. Holmes was, among other things, an expert at fighting. So a couple of times when he was about to pull some fast-action fighting moves we saw in very slow motion what he was about to do, as it was described in his own voice, then we saw the actual moves in fast motion. I like that technique.",Null,0,2,4 May 2010
The Waterboy," Good comedic farce, expertly done by Adam Sandler.
","This 50s grandpa must be a teenager at heart, because I thoroughly enjoyed Sandler's 'Waterboy', originally in the theater, and now at home on network TV. It is just a comedic farce, and much better than a more recent comedic farce, 'Best In Show.'  Here the writing and the sight gags are just so much better.Sandler is the college football team waterboy, who can get enraged by certain things. He gets put on the down-and-out SCLSU team, and by visualizing someone who bothers him, gets so enraged that he can break any block, and wreak havoc with any defense. Cathy Bates is his overprotective mother, Henry Winlker is his nice coach, and Jerry Reed is the dastardly opposing coach. His girlfriend, in and out of trouble, is played by Fairuza Balk.It has the mandatory 'hero saves team and wins big game on last play with no time remaining' scene, but here it works, because of the total absurdity of the whole premise. Maybe having grown up in south Louisiana helps me appreciate the humor. While I also appreciate the fine films at the top of the Imdb list, a good farce is hard to beat for pure entertainment.FWIW, I also really like Sandler's 'Happy Gilmore' which is a golf spoof and total farce too.",Null,2,3,17 June 2001
The Secret Life of Pets," This movie never engaged us.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. We like the premise, a humorous take on what pets might do when the owners are away during the day. The thing with a movie like this, or really any movie, it has to engage the viewer by the first 10 to 15 minutes otherwise it will be lost, no matter how good the last parts may be.This animated movie never engaged us. What we viewed was mainly disjointed sight gags, within a loose story of a small dog suddenly having to share his home and existence with a much larger dog.It may be good for children, it has some funny stuff in it, but not for us, we did not find it worth our time.",Null,5,9,15 February 2017
WALL¬∑E," Much, much better than I thought it would be, a superb animated story.
","The movie begins with a 'fly-over' shot of a large metropolis with tall buildings, but right away we notice something strange about some of them. They have a rather rough form, and eventually we realize that they are very neat piles of compacted rubbish. Each little cube is carefully place to eventually create a tall, tapering building with a flat track spiraling up it.Then we notice a solitary dual-track, solar-powered machine traveling quickly among the buildings and the rubbish. The front of the machine has the inscription 'WALL-E' which is an acronym relating to waste management, Earth version. We can also see, among the rubble, that there once were many WALL-E machines in operation but this is the only one still functioning. We wonder what happened.This little WALL-E is not just a diligent worker, but he has excellent intelligence. He probably made his compacted trash cubes into tall buildings by mimicking what he observed around him. At the end of the day, he retires to the safety of a larger machine which we observe is his home, stocked with interesting things he has pulled out of the rubbish, and spare parts salvaged from broken down machines.He also has a non-talking sidekick, a curious Cockroach that interacts with WALL-E playfully. But there isn't much else alive in this future version of Earth, where our over-use of consumables has made our world uninhabitable.The set-up is done so well that during the first few minutes we view WALL-E not so much as a curious machine, but an interesting character with a unique personality. So in everything that transpires afterward we find ourselves pulling for WALL-E. How did our world get this way, and what is going to happen?State-of-the-art digital animation and a killer surround track, this DVD is not only fun to watch, it is a superb, interesting 90-minute movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time.Edit: Dec 2016 - Watched it again, the first and final segments on Earth are the best, all the stuff on the Mothership is not as interesting.SPOILERS: When we piece together all we see, including some select flashbacks, we learn that it is the year 2775. About 700 years earlier, around 2075, a very large space 'cruise ship' left on a 5-year cruise of the universe, but was told not to return, the Earth was not inhabitable. So presumably WALL-E has been compacting trash and building tall structures for about 700 years, initially with others like him, but now alone. The cruise ship, now commanded by an ancestor of the original commander, sends survey pods out periodically to measure if Earth is safe to return to. One pod is EVE, and 'she' and WALL-E make friends. They are watching 'Hello Dolly' together on an old VHS tape and sort of fall in love. But when EVE finds the small green plant that WALL-E brought home, she confiscated it and went into electronic hibernation, eventually picked up by an explorer craft and brought back to the large mothership. WALL-E, being a machine and unhurt, hitched a ride on the outside. The green plant was a sign they could return to Earth, but the ship's computer did not want to allow it. So the rest of the story is the struggle to take back the ship and get it back to Earth. And of course for EVE and WALL-E to remain together.",Null,0,2,28 November 2008
The Good Shepherd," Long movie, the early days of the CIA. Matt Damon shines.
","This is one of those movies that is very hard to summarize. It moves backwards and forwards between the 1930s and the 1960s, with the 'present day' focus being the botched Bay of Pigs invasion into Cuba. Someone 'inside' must have tipped off the Cuban rebels and throughout the movie we see the main characters trying to unravel the mystery, gathering clues from a grainy photo of a room somewhere in the world, and a partially obscured sound track of a tape with a female voice in a slight French accent.Matt Damon is the main character as Edward Bell Wilson, apparently a composite of real early CIA operatives. A humble college poetry student who, because of his intelligence and his careful demeanor, virtually gets sucked into a world he never imagined joining. He is superb in the role. His wife is played by Angelina Jolie as 'Clover' (Margaret) Ann Russell.Other key characters are Alec Baldwin as Sam Murach and Billy Crudup as Brit Arch Cummings. Robert De Niro, who directed, also has a role as General Bill Sullivan. Michael Gambon is poetry professor Dr. Fredericks. William Hurt is Philip Allen. Timothy Hutton is Edward's father, Thomas Wilson.Some might call the movie 'slow'. It certainly has very little action, but there is good character development. A very good movie about an interesting and important time.MAJOR SPOILER. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE. When all the clues are put together near the end of the movie, it was Edward's own son who had unwittingly alerted the Cuban rebels. He had overheard a conversation at home, and had repeated part of it to a woman he had fallen in love with. She, of course, was a spy and was snuffed, pushed out of an airplane as she was flying to their wedding. In he end Edward decided to leave the CIA and begin to live his own life.",Null,1,2,3 May 2007
Finding Dory," A sequel to the 2003 'Finding Nemo.'

This is mostly a sequel to the early 'Finding Nemo' where Dory, a blue fish with the inability to form new short-term memories, becomes the key to tracking down Nemo, caught and taken away by novelty fish hunters. In that story part of Dory's skill is the ability to talk to whales.While this movie is mostly a sequel, when an older Dory begins to remember she had a mom and dad, it actually begins when Dory was a new hatchling and depicts how she wandered away in the first place.While 'Finding Dory' is a rather pleasant 90 minutes it doesn't have the invention and charm of the earlier movie. Dory does work her way over to the facility on the California Coast, uses her ability to talk to whales, and has to use the help of a very inventive Septopus (he lost one tentacle), to eventually join her family again.Just so-so entertainment.",Null,0,1,15 February 2017
Arrival," 'Life's a journey, not a destination.'
","We watched this at home on DVD from our public library. This movie is a distinct departure from most Sci-Fi movies. There is very little action, it moves rather slowly most of the time, and is mostly a study of relationships in the broadest term. With no fanfare and no warning 12 mysterious, elongated vessels appear around the world, one of them in remote Montana. They are said to be about 1500 feet tall and hover a few feet above the ground, with no detectable energy or waste. Certainly alien craft, what are they here for?Each country approaches each of the 12 independently, trying to figure out how to communicate with them, yet eventually they cease to cooperate, to share their progress. For the one in Montana Amy Adams as linguistics professor Louise Banks is recruited to help. As well as Jeremy Renner as Mathematician Ian Donnelly. The military official in charge of the approach and investigate operation is old reliable Forest Whitaker as taskmaster Colonel Weber.The mysterious vessel apparently opens a door at a certain time each day, allowing a team dressed in full biosafe gear to enter into an anti-gravity chamber. They bring along a Canary, as long as it tweets then they are assured they are safe. They try to communicate with the Heptapods, separated from their hazy enclosure by some sort of transparent, glass-like barrier.So what the story is about concerns how we communicate with each other and try to communicate with others, in this extreme case aliens who draw circles with features. Eventually it is interpreted that they are here to share a gift, and that involves overcoming the barriers of time. In a sense the overriding theme of the story is 'Life's a journey, not a destination.' Throughout we witness Louise's flashbacks, of a husband, a young daughter, but in the end we realize that it was a preview of what was to happen. Her thoughts transcending time.So, did we enjoy the movie? Yes, we did, as always Amy Adams is great and the story is interesting. We don't view it with the high reverence that many do, while it uses rather creative ideas in the end it is all fiction and has no lasting implication, except maybe to be more diligent in respecting others and communicating well. But most of us already perceive that without seeing it in a movie.",Null,1,3,4 May 2017
The Terminal," A master class in 'product placement', also has a rather nice movie embedded.
","Up front I want to state that I really like 'The Terminal'. Tom Hanks is very good as the Eastern European temporarily without a country, forced by 'the rules' to live for some time in the NY airport terminal while things got sorted out. Reminiscent of another movie where he played a stranded man, 'Cast Away.' But foremost, it became obvious that this was a Spielberg 'master class' in product placement.I will not further the cause by mentioning any of the products and merchants featured, but it is clear from the framing of shots, the props within scenes not contributing to the story, and the camera trailing the character to linger on a business name or logo that 'product placement' was a main consideration by Spielberg in making the movie. Film students would do well to study 'The Terminal' from this point of view to see what can be done.SPOILERS FOLLOW. While he was flying to NY, Viktor's (Tom Hanks) country became involved in a civil war which lasted over a year. Since this invalidated his passport, and he could not go home, the International Lounge was the only place he could go, he figured for one or two days at the most. When you piece together all the dates, it eventually becomes over a year, September 2003 to December 2004.His nemesis was the security head Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who at first tried to encourage Viktor to escape the terminal so that he could call the NY police, effectively giving the problem to someone else. When wily Viktor figured this out (security cameras tracking him) he decided he would just wait. He learned that he could make money for food by returning rented carts for the 25 cents 'reward', until mean Frank put a stop to that. However as luck would often favor Viktor, a food worker Enrique enlisted his help to woo a pretty young officer, and in return Viktor got all the airline food he wanted. Viktor also turned out to be an excellent craftsman and was hired for $19 an hour, cash under the table, helping to complete terminal remodeling.Viktor falls in love with pretty flight attendant Amelia (Cathy Z-Jones), she likes him, thinks he is just a frequent traveler too, but in the end she is attracted to the wrong kind of guy. We find out near the end that Viktor's whole reason for going to NY was to get the autograph of one last Jazz musician, who played in the music lounge of a certain hotel. When his friend Gupta, the janitor, delays the flight back home using his mop, Viktor has just enough time to get the autograph, hear one song live, and return home with his peanut can now filled with autographs from all of his deceased dad's favorite Jazz musicians. Why did he do it? 'Because I believe he would have done it for me.' I don't know if it was sloppy filming, or a fluke of final editing, but the dates on the immigration stamps did not always make sense in the time line. And, at one point when Viktor had been there for 13 months, Amelia mentions 'you didn't tell me you have been here for 9 months.' Surprising for a Spielberg film, still a very good story and a very enjoyable movie. I saw it twice on successive days.",Null,1,3,24 February 2005
The Blind Side," Uplifting story of a future NFL lineman adopted by a Memphis sports family.
","Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress in her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy who became 'mom' to this extra large boy without a family or home.The movie begins with film clips of the 1995 incident where linebacker Lawrence Taylor puts quarterback Joe Thiesman out of commission, for good, hitting him from his 'BLIND SIDE', and thus making the left tackle (for right handed QBs) the most important lineman. This movie is the story of a lost oversize boy who became a left tackle.Quinton Aaron, a young 6-8 actor from the Bronx, is Michael Oher, a gentle giant of a boy whose mother and father were always in trouble and he finds himself homeless. The Tuohy family notices that he attends school basketball games and stays to pick up food, uneaten popcorn etc so that he can survive. Leigh Ann is a generous person and, with two school children already, decides to give Michael a couch for the night, then eventually a shopping trip for clothes and his own bedroom. The Tuohys eventually also become his legal guardian.Factually Michael became an all-star high school football tackle, and played at Ole Miss, the alma mater of the Tuohys. And now he has become a first-round pick in the NFL draft. But the story isn't about football, it is about how much can be done when we allow ourselves to look beyond ethnic, racial, and economic differences to actually help others and make a difference.Tim McGraw is very effective as the dad, Sean Tuohy, former star Ole Miss basketball player and now the owner of a large number of fast-food outlets. His son SJ is Jae Head. Brit Lily Collins (daughter of singer Phil Collins) is good as the daughter Collins Tuohy.Part of the story is the task of getting Michael's grades up to a 2.5 average so that he would be eligible for division 1 sports, and Kathy Bates is excellent in the role of Miss Sue who the Tuohys hire to be Michael's personal tutor.Excellent, touching story.",Null,0,0,23 April 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Why it is ranked so highly.
","Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why 'The Shawshank Redemption' was ranked so high, and many 'wished' that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several 'hot' buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better. This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where 'Shawshank Redemption' should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a '10', and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has a different opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less.",Null,19,41,12 November 2001
Parasite," Korean movie, winner of the Oscar for Best Picture.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like 'Parasite', but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task.",Null,0,3,29 February 2020
Rango," Cute animated wild-west tale with little creatures of the desert.
","Absolutely the best things about this movie are the superb animation, and the superb voice acting by the main actors. The story itself is just OK, it is a parody of sorts of old time western movies.Johnny Depp is really amazingly good as the voice of Rango. He isn't Rango from the very beginning, in fact I suppose he has no name. But in the dusty town of DIRT, when pressed by the locals for a name, he sees 'Durango' on the side of a container and takes the last 5 letters as his own, 'Rango'. The very beginning of the story looks out of place, we have this very imaginative, theatrical chameleon interacting with small plastic play figures. Soon we realize he is in a terrarium, and then quickly he finds himself outside, on the road, in the scorching desert, a place this chameleon never wanted to be. But he meets an armadillo that has just been run over, and he 'follows his shadow' in the search for water.Rango's acting talents pay off when he gets to the town of 'Dirt', in desperate need of a new sheriff, he convinces everyone he is a dangerous lizard and a hero. Pretty Isla Fisher voices Beans, a different type of desert lizard. I like to try to identify voices and I really thought it was Reese Witherspoon, and Fisher is really good in her characterization. Similarly, Ned Beatty voices the Mayor, an old turtle, and I really thought it was Harve Presnell, who was the wealthy father-in-law in Fargo. Towards the end of the movie, Rango encounters a human figure, that was remarkable in its facial details, and my wife and I immediately said 'Clint Eastwood'. But it was Timothy Olyphant as the voice of the Spirit of the West. So my guessing wasn't very good for this movie, and the vocal acting was uniformly superb.Anyway, this is a cute and entertaining animated movie, the theme being that whoever controls the water, in the desert, controls everything. Rango has to figure this out, and along with a band of Dirt residents find the way to get water back to Dirt.",Null,1,1,12 August 2011
Music and Lyrics," A very enjoyable romantic comedy about songwriting.
","I like both main actors, I enjoy their style and generally like any movie they are in. I like this movie very much. It is predictable in one way, but very unpredictable the way it gets to where you know it must be going. Very clever script writing.Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher, 1980s singing 'has been' living in New York. He earns a living by playing nostalgia gigs almost anywhere his agent friend can get them. In this movie he is entertaining a bunch of his fans at a 20 year class reunion for the class of 1987 when he had been at the peak of his popularity. Alex is a gifted musician, but never could write lyrics. He gets a break when hot pop star 'Cora' (real newcomer Haley Bennett) needs a new song and he is asked to write one in two days.Drew Barrymore is Sophie Fisher, formerly aspiring novelist who now helps her sister and this day is filling in as a plant waterer in Alex's apartment. As Alex struggles with lyrics, she absentmindedly voices an interesting line. Alex is excited, thinks she is a natural, tries to get her to work with him but she wants no part of it, and we learn why later. It has to do with an old, bad writing experience.We learn from the DVD extra that neither Grant nor Barrymore are singers, but for this movie they did all their own singing, and Grant even sings harmony with 'Cora' at one point. He has a very pleasant singing voice, and even learned a bit of piano playing for the role.",Null,0,0,18 May 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 2015 Best Picture winner, it is a comical and critical look at the shallowness of movies.
","I had initially decided to NOT see this movie based on the negative things I had heard about it. But how can I be a real movie fan if I refuse to see a Best Picture winner? I can't so I did. On DVD from my public library.At its core this movie is critical of the success of meaningless action blockbuster movies, successful because that is what audiences want to see. That is what sells tickets. And to put my 'viewer hat' on for a second, often that is why we see movies, to get away from reality and be entertained. But what about more legitimate actors and legitimate stage plays? Why can't audiences enjoy those just as much? At the center of this fictional story is Michael Keaton as Riggan. Some 20 years earlier as a man of 40 he was 'Birdman', a type of superhero. (Maybe spoofing 'Ironman'?) Now having turned 60 he is looking for something meaningful and also to dispel the constant nagging that maybe he never was any good anyway, just an actor with the right franchise at the right time.So he writes, directs, and stars in an adaptation from a short story. I have been in plays and have worked behind the scenes and the movie fairly well depicts what goes on there. The rehearsals, the insecure actor, the disruptive actor. So by the time final rehearsals are at hand and opening night on Broadway looms, Riggan is about broke and can't sleep much. But the play must go on.There is a lot of whimsy in the movie, often it isn't possible to tell when we are seeing reality or when we are seeing Riggan's visions, as when he is actually floating in the air. No matter it all comes together and seems to be a worthy Best Picture winner. Although I must say this was not the best year for Best Picture candidates. Of the nominees I probably would go with 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', even more whimsical and more entertaining.",Null,0,2,17 September 2015
The Big Short," Dramatization of predicting the real estate bond market collapse in 2008.
","We watched this on DVD from our public library. Even though my wife had a career in Finance, and had executive positions in banks and mortgage companies, even she had difficulty keeping up with the loan instruments discussed here. I would suspect most viewers would also have difficulty.So let's just discuss the broad points. The players in the real estate game make an assumption that real estate values will always go higher, and keep going higher. Part of the outfall of that was to use the risky subprime instruments, which would never be a problem if everything kept going higher. But it can't, and it didn't, and part of the result we saw in 2008 when the stock market itself dropped about 50% in what now is being called 'the great recession.' My wife and I are retired, we were among those who were scared as we saw our retirement investment drop and drop. But we took the position that in time things would go back up so we held all our positions, remained diversified, didn't sell any equity positions, and in a few years everything was back to normal.Many, many were not so fortunate. Some made the rash decision to sell their equities when they were low, they had a hard time recovering. Many lost their pensions, or their homes, or both.I would think many younger viewers would have a harder time appreciating this movie, but those of us who are older can more easily identify with the themes. There are many characters here, but I will mention only one, Christian Bale as Doctor Michael Burry. Yes, he was a medical doctor who left his residency to start a hedge fund. He is featured prominently as perhaps the first one to dig deeply into the subprime market. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly forecasted the real estate bubble would collapse as early as 2007. Though he suffered an investor revolt before his predictions came true, Burry earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million.The sad part of all this is the corruption that became apparent during the whole crisis, and in effect the rich got richer while the poor lost their homes and retirement savings.",Null,0,0,12 May 2016
Prometheus," Examines the possible alien origins of life on Earth.
","There is a 1970 film 'Chariots of the Gods', based on the Erich von D√§niken book. It examines the theory and possibility that centuries ago some alien form from another world visited Earth and was responsible for the origin of the human race.This movie, 'Prometheus', is aligned with that theme. Instead of examining supposed evidence, it branches off into an entirely fictional treatment. As the movie opens we see a strange life form, that looks in many ways like Earthlings, open a container and consume its contents, presumably on an ancient Earth, falls into a waterfall, is spontaneously broken apart, and its DNA begin to form new life. This is meant to represent a type of beginning of life here.Cut to modern times, actually almost 80 years into the future, and scientists exploring a region of Scotland, the Isle of Skye, find ancient drawings, perhaps 35,000 years old, that has style links to other ancient drawings found in different parts of the world. Too similar to be coincidence they theorize all of them were references to a far-away world. And they use the patterns of celestial references to figure out where it is.A few years later a deep space mission, in a ship called 'Prometheus', complete with an android and suspended animation chambers, travels to the location suspected to be the 'origin of life.' When they get there they find a number of things they never bargained for.The cast are all good actors, including Noomi Rapace (the scientist), Michael Fassbender ( the android), Charlize Theron as the space ship's captain, Idris Elba (the pilot) Guy Pearce in very heavy makeup as the dying old man financing the mission.We enjoyed it, two hours did not seem long because the story was so interesting. It appears a sequel is in the works, as the movie ends with a survivor headed away in a space ship with questions still unanswered.",Null,4,10,9 November 2012
The Water Diviner," Australian man travels to Turkey to find his three missing sons after 1915's Battle of Gallipoli.
","This is a good movie 'inspired by real events.' The closing credits have the common disclaimer that none of the incidents and characters are intended to represent real persons so we must assume it is primarily a fictional story. The other thing, viewers outside Australia and New Zealand are not as familiar with the Turkish battle of Gallipoli so some additional information is useful. The opening has a scene where ships are sailing away and a caption tells us that the ANZAC troops are leaving. I had to look it up, 'ANZAC' is for 'Australian and New Zealand Army Corps' recruited and fighting on behalf of the British. They were formed in Egypt in 1915 and disbanded in 1916 following the Allied evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula.Russell Crowe, who also directs, stars as Connor, an Australian farmer who had this three young adult sons join the ANZAC and fight in the battle of Gallipoli. When they didn't come home he assumed they were all killed in combat. So many were killed that they were thrown into makeshift graves with no identification. So going over 4 years later to find them would be quite a task, but Connor, after his wife dies of grief, goes over, quite unprepared for what faced him.It is a bit slow in parts, there is some fighting and action in other parts, but overall a nicely worthwhile movie to see.SPOILERS: Connor is a water diviner back home, we see one instance where he used two rods to find a new well for his livestock and crops. When he gets to Turkey he must befriend some locals, a difficult task because many believed they were still at war with the Allies, but he makes it unofficially to the battle field where, under the supervision of British and Australian officers, were looking for buried dead with the intent to identify as many as they could by the dog tags still buried with them. Connor mills around, has visions, and 'divines' the location of his sons, they dig, they find two of them but not the third. Connor eventually hunts him down and finds out why he never went home. He was supposed to protect his brothers, instead as they lay mortally wounded he shot his brother in the head to end his misery and that guilt had prevented him returning home. As it ends Connor and his son are being chased by militant Greeks and they manage to escape via a hidden passage to a river.",Null,1,3,13 September 2015
Wonder Woman," Good movie, highly entertaining.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. I like soundtracks with deep bass and this one has scenes with such deep bass that my whole body was vibrating at times. In addition to being very entertaining it would be a good choice to demonstrate a good subwoofer.The story starts on the secluded island, masked to keep intruders away, where the Amazons live without men. A young Diana grows up trained to be a warrior. Now she is an adult played by Gal Gadot. When a plane crashes in the water near the island she is pressed into service to rescue the downed pilot, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, American spy posing as a Nazi.So from there the basic story evolves, Diana insists on going to the front lines of WW1 to help bring peace. She believes it is all caused by the god of war and she is determined to snuff him out.Gadot is very good as Diana, becoming Wonder Woman. A highly entertaining movie.",Null,2,8,20 October 2017
Despicable Me," Nicely original story with a fine script and great voice acting from Carell.
","Sometimes in the past while watching animated movies of all sorts, I've lulled myself into thinking most characters are interchangeable, in that it didn't matter who voiced the character, as long as they did it competently. Now, after seeing and enjoying 'Despicable Me' I'll never have those thoughts again. With absolute certainty I will say, Steve Carell voicing the main character Gru is what makes this movie rise above ordinary. He is just made for this kind of stuff and could make the rest of his career on it, never appearing on screen himself.Steve Carell's character, Gru, views himself as the most despicable person ever, anywhere. But suddenly he is upstaged by a young man, Vector, who steals the shrinking machine. We see this early on when tourists find out the great pyramid is an inflatable prop, because Vector shrunk the real one and stole it.So Gru decides to steal the shrinking machine from Vector, and to pull the most audacious theft in history, will build a rocket to take him to the moon, shrink the moon, and bring it back with him. Pretty ambitious stuff! But he needs help to get into Vector's fortress and, when he notices three orphan girls get in easily, decides to adopt the girls and use them in his scheme. Somewhere along the path to his crimes Gru, the most despicable person on Earth, begins to care about the three girls, and that is the humanity of the story. But all in all it is just a silly cartoon story, fun to watch, but Steve Carell with his superb vocal acting makes it worth seeing.I was fascinated by the extras on the DVD. This movie was made by a large number of people scattered all over the world, never all at the same place. They used modern communications and linking technology to operate as one big team, rather than being physically together.",Null,0,1,6 January 2011
Back to the Future Part II," One review for all 3 BTTF films, a great trilogy, 1985, 1989, 1990.
","As of this date, the 3 'Back to the Future' films have these IMDb ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes. #3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of 'time travel.' BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski ('flower child' spelled backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly 'defines' a role as few have been defined in films.The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is what really makes them 'believable' within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus, although all the 'science' in the 3 films is 'bad science', which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a 'science' explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think, 'Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France, drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country.' And you look around, you're back home to a totally different world.That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885, evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland, fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his 'parents.' The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for 'future' events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of 'discrepancies', but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",Null,1,3,9 June 2001
Carrie," 'Breasts, momma. They're called 'breasts' and every woman has them.' (Carrie, dressing for prom)
","A movie doesn't have to be great to be a classic. 'Carrie' is not great, but it IS a classic, a film from Stephen King's first novel, and the break-out performance by Sissy Spacek. The newest DVD release has a very impressive 16:9 anamorphic video transfer for an old film, and a pretty decent 5.1 pseudo surround sound. It also has several nice extras, the most interesting being the clips and interviews with most main cast members. John Travolta was still fresh in TV's 'Kotter', and two years before his hit films. William Katt was TV's 'Greatest American Hero.' And Amy Irving is about the cutest actress who never went anywhere with her career. Jack Fisk, art director, had been married to Sissy for two years. Sissy was 27 in 'Carrie', although she really did look 16. The girl from little Quitman, Texas still looks good today at age 53. 'Carrie' is about a high school girl who is 'different', and all the others make fun of her. The best of the worst starts when she unexpectedly starts her period during an after-practice shower and all the girls taunt her. ((The locker room scene, in slow motion with flute and piano music, and naked young bodies in and out of the cover of steam is very sensual.)) Trouble for all the others is that Carrie has telekinetic powers that she is just beginning to realize. She is walking home and a kid on a bike taunts her, and she promptly throws him to the ground, without ever touching him. In the library she is reading a book 'Secret Science Behind Miracles.'some SPOILERS - Carrie is caught between two extremes and there is no escaping. Her mother is a religious fanatic who thinks Carrie's father was a possession of the devil. At one point she says, ' I should have given you to God when you were just a baby.' She now thinks Carrie is possessed. At the other extreme are the insensitive students who plot to embarrass her by rigging the King and Queen contest at the prom, having Carrie and Tommy win, only to dump a bucket of pig's blood onto her as she stands on stage.Carrie's telekinesis takes over, doors are locked, fire hose begins to spray, a fire is started, only Carrie walks out after Amy Irving's character also escapes. On her way home, bloody, a car tries to run her over but she sends it tumbling, and exploding. Back home, all she wants after her bath is a hug from mom, but mom stabs her with a large knife. But telekinesis sends several implements into mom, who dies, and finally Carrie sends her whole house down, burning, on both of them. Irving has dreams that a bloody arm is pulling her down to hell.Stephen King admits that 'Carrie' was not his best work. It was actually inspired by several disconnected experiences, but the catalyst was cleaning a girls locker room as a janitor and encountering a dispenser of feminine products. In total I cannot see this film as a great work, probably not even as a very good one. But it is a very interesting one, especially for the careers that received a kick-start with film.",Null,3,6,30 August 2002
The Queen," How Diana's death changed the Monarchy.
","Most of the movie takes place during the week Princess Diana died and what followed. Diana was divorced from Prince Charles, and the Royal Family had emotionally divorced her, even though she was the mother of a future King of England. When her unfortunate accidental death in Paris occurred, the Royal Family simply wanted it treated as a private matter by Diana's family. But England and the world would have none of that.Tony Blair was the popular, young, recently elected Prime Minister. In early scenes we are clearly shown that he serves at the pleasure of the Queen, even though he was elected by the people. In a brief meeting with the Queen in her quarters, she must request that he serve as Prime Minister. However, during the week of Diana's death and funeral, Blair is the one who shows wisdom, who ends up telling the Queen what she must do to avoid a rebellion of sorts. While the movie focuses alternately on Diana, Tony Blair, and Queen Elizabeth, the title of the movie is 'The Queen' and that is its main focus, how the Queen changed as a result of that fateful week. And realized how the world had changed.Helen Mirren won a well-deserved Oscar for her role as The Queen. Michael Sheen was equally effective as Tony Blair. James Cromwell does a competent turn as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, who apparently sympathized more with the people than with his mother.Good movie!! SPOILERS. There is an episode regarding a majestic, 14-point buck on the 40,000 acre property of the Royal Family. The Queen's vehicle breaks down crossing a river bed, and the buck appears. Later the buck is killed and she visits the corpse hanging for dressing. She is told how it had been wounded, and eventually chased hunted it down and finished it off.

Raging Bull," Jake Lamotta has had a hard life, mostly of his own making.
","Even though this movie came out over 30 years ago I only got around to seeing it currently, the recently released Blu-Ray copy from my public library. And as we would expect the picture and sound are perfect. De Niro won the Oscar for Best Actor and it is easy to understand why.How this movie came about is just as interesting as the movie itself. De Niro is a boxing fan and after reading Lamotta's book figured it would make a good movie. Scorsese was NOT a boxing fan and resisted. But Scorsese was also having personal issues, with drugs, and Di Niro's visit to him in the hospital in 1978, urging him to get himself clean, and also to make the movie. Scorsese did and credits Di Niro with saving his life. Also, in preparation for the role Di Niro trained as a boxer and actually won 2 of the 3 boxing matches he participated in. And for the later life of Lamotta gained a reported 60 pounds. Since the movie is based on Lamotta's book, and Scorsese works hard to make accurate movies based on real people, the story we see, of a paranoid and jealous Lamotta, is probably very accurate. But upon seeing the movie and Lamotta asking his former wife if he was really like that, her response was 'You were worse.'he got the name 'Raging Bull' for his fighting style, just getting low and barging in and beating up opponents. But as we see the story of his life there always was a 'rage' inside of him. Because of his paranoia and jealousy he had no good relationships, both his wife and his brother had to leave him to escape his wrath.Robert De Niro of course is Jake La Motta and the story starts in 1941 when he was a young fighter just about 20. He meets his eventual second wife, Cathy Moriarty who plays Vickie La Motta, when she was just 15 and they married a year later. It was a bit disconcerting because Moriarty looked much older even though she in fact was still a teenager when filming.And Joe Pesci, still a relative unknown, is remarkably good as the brother and business manager, Joey Lamotta, until Jake's rage drove him to estrangement.The fight scenes are recreated very believably, and in the late 1950s after his boxing career came to an end Lamotta became an entertainer of sorts, usually a comedian in night spots and bars. His life was hard, and he spend some time in jail, but it was all of his own making.",Null,1,1,22 October 2014

Taken 2," Entertaining, but a bit of a let-down for me.
","I really like 'Taken', I have seen it several times. But 'Taken 2' is a bit of a disappointment for me. For one, it re-hashes in a sort of way everything Mills does in the first movie, using his superior training and experience to find the unfindable and to defeat any number of antagonists. And second, perhaps I am over-thinking this, but if his daughter already had been kidnapped in a foreign country, wouldn't he be more wary of taking her and mom to another foreign country, and take extra pains to assure their safety?Anyway, Liam Neeson is back as Bryan Mills, his daughter has not yet passed her driving test, and that is an issue. Also the new boyfriend that Bryan has not been told about. But that aside, and his ex-wife is having some difficulties with her current husband, the daughter and mom get invited to join him in Istanbul. Just for some fun.Maggie Grace is back as the daughter, Kim. And Famke Janssen as the mom, Lenore . Of course there would be no movie if everything went smoothly. Instead the Serb father of one of the men Bryan had killed, the kidnapping mastermind, was following Bryan and his family to Istanbul, with the intention of kidnapping all three of them, then murdering them. But the story relied on Bryan's inventiveness to get free, then have his daughter explode some grenades so he could hear the sound delay and triangulation to have her find them. Anyway it is all implausible but the 'good guys' managed to come out on top. And Kim got plenty of driving practice in the stolen cab, evading police cars, so that when she got back to California she made a perfect score on her driving test.",Null,0,0,23 February 2013
Step Up," From different sides of the track, will dancing bring them together?
","In a theme that has been done many times in movies, a take-off of Romeo and Juliet, a boy and girl are attracted to each other via their common interest in dance. Hers is classical, including ballet, his is hip-hop street dancing. She is a serious student with a structured home life, with life goals,he is a screw up who lives in a foster home and 'borrows' cars for joy rides along with his foster brothers. His goal is to wake up out of jail tomorrow.Channing Tatum (an accomplished athlete in high school) is Tyler Gage, and one night an opportunity via a broken window gets him and his buddies into a school auditorium, where they proceed to goof off and do lots of damage. Security manages to capture Tyler, who is then given (lucky for the plot of the movie) 200 hours community service as a janitor at the school of arts.Pretty Jenna Dewan, a dancer, is Nora Clark, dancing student at the school. She is preparing for an end of year show, and hopes to get a dancing contract, but her partner is injured. She auditions every able bodied boy at her school, but none of them are any good. Tyler steps up, offers to help, Nora is surprised to see he has potential.The rest of the movie involves encouragement, then discouragement, miscommunication, anger, breaking of commitment, re-commitment, all the types of things to move the plot along. So as we watch, we wonder, 'Will Nora and Tyler end up together?' Most of us can guess.The lead actors are good, and nice to watch. My wife really enjoyed this movie a lot, I enjoyed it, but at a somewhat lower level. But overall fairly well done, for its type.",Null,0,1,8 January 2007
The Woman in Black," Young lawyer seeks to keep his job but lands in a haunted house.
","My public library bought this DVD so I just had to see it, as I do with most movies they obtain. It was good to see Radcliffe in a role past his 'Harry Potter' days but horror movies are not my favorite genre.Daniel Radcliffe is young London lawyer Arthur Kipps , whose young wife had died, leaving him with a young son and lots of grief. So much grief that he didn't function too well and was in danger of losing his job with the firm. He was given this assignment that he had to do well.It involved an estate, the Eel Marsh House, on an island of sorts accessible by a road during low tide only, with a marsh on each side of the road. The old widow had died and the law firm was to execute her will but there were lots and lots of papers at the old house and Kipps needed to go through 'every last one' to make sure the will was the most current. Kipps travels there by train and found all the locals in fear over the property.The first and last parts of the movie are very interesting, the middle not so much as it moves slowly and relies on many close-up views of distressed faces and many loud noises to surprise the viewer. All-in-all a pretty entertaining movie. Especially since it cost me nothing! SPOILERS: Kipps eventually deduced that a woman (in black) was haunting the grounds and the house. Her young son had been 'taken away', adopted, then he drowned in the marsh but his body was never recovered. She hanged herself and there would be trouble, other people's kids dying, as long as she and her boy were not united. Kipps managed to dive into the marsh to find the boy's body, and opened the woman's grave to place the boy with her. He figured that set things straight, but when his own son with the nanny showed up at the train station, the boy wandered off onto the tracks, Kipps jumped down to save him, both were killed by the train, then they saw their dead wife/mother on the tracks, they were all reunited in death.",Null,1,1,27 June 2012
Mary and Max," Claymation fantasy, long distance pen pals.
","I don't recall why I looked up this particular movie, it is now 10 years old, but I found the DVD at my public library. My wife and I watched it at home.It is a fantasy story told with claymation. It is 1976 and a little girl in Australia named Mary is depressed and has no friends. One day she is in a library and decides to look into a phone book from the USA, as her mother pulls her away she accidentally tears off a section of one page. Later she notices one name in particular and in her 8-yr-old way writes him a letter.The man who gets the letter is 40-something Max, he too has no friends. He is obese, loves chocolate bar hot dogs, and sometimes little things upset him greatly. Eventually it becomes clear he has Aspergers and seldom knows how to interact with others. But he gets to his old typewriter and writes back to little Mary.Toni Collette voices the growing up Mary Daisy Dinkle and now deceased Philip Seymour Hoffman voices Max Jerry Horovitz. Both are very good, particularly so Hoffman. The story continues for at least 15 to 20 years for Mary to grow up, go to college, write a thesis on Max's affliction, and publish a book.The movie is not all fun, in fact it has some dark aspects to it, but in the end is a statement on relationships and how two strangers can often reach out to each other and something good can come of it.I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.",Null,0,0,22 January 2019
Shrek," 'A talking donkey? That's the easy part, getting him to shut up is what's hard.' (Shrek)
","'Shrek' is a great little fun movie, with sharp,eye-popping computer animation and a knock-out Dolby Digital surround sound track. We have watched it a number of times since 2001.It is a story of a kind-hearted Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) who just wants to be left alone in his swamp. A very animated talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) just wants to be friends with Shrek. Throw in a princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz) and a would-be king (voiced by John Lithgow) and the film takes fun to a new level. In what amounts to a very scrambled collection of famous cartoon characters (Three Pigs, Big Bad Wolf, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc) and techniques borrowed from movies like 'Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger', the animation shows slow motion, martial artist suspended in air for a moment, etc.The script has a few slow parts, but overall is excellent, and we found ourselves either snickering or laughing out loud often. The film even has 'message' with the creative ending, but 95% of it is just good, funny stuff. Many of the 'jokes' will be missed by some of the younger generation, and on first viewing even many of the older crowd will miss some of the subtle references.Disk one of this 2-disk set has the movie plus a very interesting 'making-of' special. Disk 2 has more stuff that I will get around to seeing one cold, rainy winter day. In my personal rating system, an animated film can get no higher than a '9' of 10. I rate 'Shrek' a solid '8', which for me puts it in the same category as 'Toy Story 2', 'A Bug's Life', 'Chicken Run', and 'Monsters, Inc.' All of them are marvelous, fun movies that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages.",Null,3,4,22 April 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," This is 'Buffalo Bill's' story, why is he a serial killer?
","SPOILERS - The movie's title comes from a reference to an experience Clarice (Jodie Foster) had when she was 10, living with relatives on a sheep ranch in Montana, after her policeman father was killed. She awoke to some terrible screaming and in the barn found they were slaughtering lambs. Afterward she had dreams, and Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) wonders aloud if catching the serial killer, Buffalo Bill, will 'Silence the Lambs' in her dreams.Clarice is a student assigned to try and get Lecter to help figure out who the killer is, after he kidnaps a politician's daughter. Lecter likes Clarice, ends up giving her clues which allow her to find 'Bill' and in a thrilling dance of death in the dark, she shoots him. Lecter had escaped as a result of police bungling, and in the last scene we see him talking by phone to Clarice, saying he's 'having an old friend for dinner', then we see him following the dastardly Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald). I haven't seen the sequel yet.Heald is now the unpopular assistant principal in the fine TV series 'Boston Public', playing essentially the same character he did in this movie. Daniel von Bargen, that fine character actor, played one of the cops looking for Lecter right after his escape.Right now 'Silence of the Lambs' has an average Imdb rating of 8.5, and is listed as the #19 film of all time. It IS a pretty good thriller, and Foster and Hopkins are at their bests in this film.",Null,1,3,8 October 2001
Vanilla Sky," Make my sky 'Vanilla' anytime, it's much nicer than the gray skies of winter!
","'Vanilla Sky' is one of those movies that can easily polarize audiences. It is easy to see how some think it is one of the best they've seen, and it is equally easy to see how some hate it. Other recent films like 'Magnolia', 'Mulholland Drive', 'Fight Club', 'Memento', and Donnie Darko' have the same effect on viewers. Regardless of one's leanings, there is no question you have to watch this whole film intently, grasp every nuance, understand every conversation to be able to even discuss it intelligently. I like to view films like this, it is a good mental exercise that most films just don't provide.  On the opposite end of the spectrum is a film like 'Dumb and Dumber', which happens to be one of my favorites, but one which you can watch very leisurely and just enjoy, like a good piece of creamy fudge!! :-)CAUTION * SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further if you have not yet seen 'Vanilla Sky', which gets its title from a painting.David (Tom Cruise) is a 30-something rich guy who seized 51% control of his corporation when both parents died in an accident, loves the ladies and shies away from commitment. During the film he is involved, apparently, with two women, a brunette (Penny Cruz) and a blonde (Cammy Diaz). He also has lucid dreams, sometimes starts having sex with one and finishes with the other. As he awakes his CD radio whispers 'wake up', sometimes in the voice of one, sometimes the other. It gets to where we, the audience, as well as David, cannot tell which is dream and which is reality.
Another layer in the story is the psychologist (Kurt Russell) visiting David in his jail cell, David with mask on, the psychologist trying to find out what really happened, was there really a murder. Is the psychologist real, or just part of the dream? We see a crash that apparently kills the blonde and disfigures David. We see him arguing with a panel of surgeons about doing something to stop the headaches.  We see him meet a stranger, we find out David had signed up for a 'Life Extension' program where they freeze your body and bring back your mind into lucid dreams. The audience can tell by the vanilla-colored sky when David is supposed to be in these dreams.At the climax, David is given a choice when he calls for 'tech support'. He has been dreaming lucidly for 150 years, he can continue or he can come out of that state and into reality. He has control, it will become what he imagines (shades of 'What Dreams May Come'), so he jumps off the tall building he is on, as he lands we only see one eye open, and hear 'wake up, David' and the film ends.I may watch it again before I return it to my library, but upon one viewing I find it impossible to precisely reconstruct a narrative. On the one hand, we could assume everything up to David waking up on the street, sleeping off a drinking binge, with the first 'vanilla sky' we see, is real, and everything after is a lucid dream. Or, maybe everything between the first, early 'wake up' and the last one, is a dream. Or some other combination. While I generally like for films to make sense, and feel that I am able to connect all the points, I don't feel that necessity here. The film was so very well done, just the entertainment of watching the story unfold and the pleasure of thinking about it afterward is worth it. The DVD is fine, although unspectacular. The 'extras' I didn't find particularly interesting, unless you really like to see Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise 'behind the scenes' and during the world premiere in Japan, with all the young Japanese girls acting like 1960 American teenagers seeing the Beetles for the first time.  'Vanilla Sky' - a thinking person's film.",Null,5,8,1 January 2003
X-Men: First Class," The early origins of the X-Men, set in 1962.
","It is interesting how this movie came about, as the other X-Men movies were being made th writer/director/actors often had to make a reference to what might have happened in earlier years, in the time when the characters were younger. Thus 'X-Men Origins' was made. There is a good explanation of the process in the DVD extras.While this story actually begins in the 1940s during the Nazi suppression of the Jews, most of it takes place in 1962 when the characters would have been in their 20s. In fact, to take advantage of real historical elements, the climax of this movie is the October 1962 Cuban Missle crisis, and the young X-Men have a role in its outcome.James McAvoy is Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender is Erik Lehnsherr, who becomes known as Magneto. This story shows how they were friends, and started out on the same side of justice. It also shows what contributed to their going in different directions, and how Xavier ended up wheelchair bound. The most evil character is Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, intent on facilitating a Third World War. Jennifer Lawrence of most recently 'Hunger Games' fame as Katniss, is Raven here, eventually becoming known as Mystique. We see how she showed up at Xavier's home as a 10-year-old and was befriended by him.All in all a good movie, with incredible and incredulous action in the final scenes.",Null,0,0,26 August 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not that sexy and not that interesting.
","I had decided long ago that I had no interest in seeing this movie. But recently I noticed that my public library had bought several BluRay copies and I could get one with no wait. So I figured, 'What the heck' and now I know what all the fuss is about.I have no idea how well it translated from the book(s) but I imagine that the target audience is mostly romantic women. It is about a simple woman quite accidentally meeting a very handsome, wealthy and self-assured young man who takes an interest in her. What woman wouldn't like that fantasy?The main problem I have with the movie is it asks lots of questions but provides no answers. The handsome and wealthy man loves kinky sex but keeps any woman he likes at arm's length. On a couple of occasions it seems like they will address that but don't. And then it ends with what can only be interpreted as setting it up for the first sequel. The young woman, just finishing college, goes to an interview assignment in the place of her roommate who is feeling bad. Dakota Johnson, daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, plays that role as Anastasia Steele. By all indications she is a regular hard- working girl with normal morals. She is taken aback by the attention but learns to enjoy it. But she is not sure she wants to sign the contract he requires.The wealthy young man, raised as an orphan, is driven to be the best in what he does, and loves to dominate. Jamie Dornan plays this role as Christian Grey. He flies his own helicopter, he is generous with gifts, he runs a foundation, but he is trapped within the demons we never find out about.Then, as the movie ends right after he tells Ana goodbye, he gets up abruptly from a board meeting, we figure he wants to pursue her but it fades to the credits. Somewhat entertaining but overall a movie that cheats to get your attention. I don't plan to see the sequels.",Null,5,8,20 May 2015
The Wolverine," My wife and I really enjoyed it, good follow-up to X-Men movies.
","I enjoyed all the X-Men movies, and of course one of the best characters was Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman. In this movie, 'The Wolverine', set some time after the X-Men movies, Logan (the Wolverine) has dropped out of sight, he has a full beard, he is intent on avoiding conflict. Until, in Japan, he is forced to get involved again.Some of the story is told in flashback, including a scene in Nagasaki years earlier where Logan saves the life of a Japanese man by pushing him into a deep well as protection from a nuclear blast. Now in present times, when Logan still looks the same age but the Japanese man is very old, and about to die, the man's granddaughter becomes the focus.The granddaughter is Tao Okamoto as Mariko, who we find has been designated to inherit the industrial empire, but the old man is not ready to give up yet. He is looking for immortality and Logan becomes his target.It is all Sci-Fi and fantasy but done very well. We enjoyed it and still are amazed that this talented song-and-dance man, Jackman, can play such an authentic Wolverine.",Null,1,1,27 January 2014
Win Win," Very nice 'family' drama, with a wrestling theme. A cut above most recent movies.
","Set in New Jersey, Paul Giamatti is Mike Flaherty, lawyer and family man, and also serves as the wrestling coach at the local high school. The team isn't very good, they never won a match, sometimes even struggle to get a point. Amy Ryan is his wife Jackie Flaherty.Mike is a sincere guy, but business is slow, and we also get the feeling he isn't such a high-powered lawyer. He is having trouble making ends meet and has to do what he can to survive. In the midst of all this, after he gains a $1500 a month guardianship of an older man in early stages of dementia, and puts him into a home, a young boy shows up on the doorstep of the older man's home.The young boy is Alex Shaffer as Kyle, 17, and has basically run away from home in Ohio to be with his grandfather in New Jersey. His mom is a mess, in and out of abuse clinics, and he wants a better life. As luck would have it, Kyle also happens to be a star wrestler, and is eager to join the high school team.(In real life, Shaffer really is a star wrestler and won the NJ state high school title in his weight class. This is his first movie.) There is some wrestling, of course, but the story is really about family dynamics, between Kyle and his grandpa, Kyle and his mother, and Kyle with the new adopted family, the Flahertys. Good movie, and Giamatti is great as always.",Null,0,0,14 October 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight rises after 8 years, and we get a preview of Robin.
","I always watch a movie like this with mixed emotions. It is made very well, with a good story, but it contains quite a bit of violence, with characters like Bane who just want to destroy a city. We know just a few months ago a young man entered a theater in Colorado at an opening night showing of this movie, and opened fire killing several theater-goers. We have no hard evidence that violence in games and movies influence nut-jobs to kill like this, but it has to make you wonder.So it was with that in mind that I watched this movie. (My wife chose not to watch it.) And I was somewhat surprised that it was better than I thought it would be. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman has been in seclusion for about 8 years, still injured and using a cane to help with his walking. Gotham City seems calm and safe.However Tom Hardy as Bane, with an unusual mask that is always across his head and face, muffling his speech, ostensibly mitigating the pain from a former procedure, vowing to restore order for the poor and downtrodden, to put the wealthy and powerful in their place. With the help of a cat-like woman gets what he needs to steal a device from Wayne Enterprises, a new device that can be re-configured to turn into a fusion bomb, with the ability to destroy Gotham.Rusty, Batman is no match for Bane, who is of the League of Shadows, and Batman ends up in a terrible prison from which there is almost no hope for escape. But escape he must, for he and his contraptions are the only hope to defeat Bane.Anne Hathaway is Selina, the cat-like thief and expert fighter. She has been in and out of trouble and prison since she was 16, but now Batman must trust her to help the cause.I abhor the violence and terrorism, but overall a pretty good movie.MAJOR SPOILERS: Bruce Wayne does manage to get out of the prison and back to his former fighting skills. With the help of a flying contraption manages to snag the bomb and fly it out to sea where it exploded harmlessly. Before that Selina with the Bat motorcycle managed to blast Bane to smithereens. Presumed dead also a funeral was held for Bruce Wayne, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt as officer Robin Blake is given a note with GPS coordinates which leads him to the Bat Cave, entering he finds Wayne. This sets up a sequel where Robin becomes Batman's partner.",Null,1,4,15 December 2012
The Croods," Like an extended cartoon, we were entertained and laughed often.
","When I watch an animated movie like this one I try to identify the voices without knowing the cast. It took me a while, discarding Tom Hanks and Owen Wilson, finally recognizing the distinctive voice of Nicolas Cage. He is arguably the main character, the over-protective dad, Grug, in this animated movie about a prehistoric family. They apparently stay in their cave, with a boulder protecting the entrance. Only Grug is strong enough to move it.All this doesn't sit well with the strong-willed daughter, Emma Stone as Eep, who often goes off by herself, and sometimes explores high cliffs without dad's permission.One day she is stumped when she encounters a boy, Ryan Reynolds as Guy. But they eventually manage to become friends but when the rest of the family meets him they go a bit crazy. They are afraid of anything new or different. So much of the story is that theme, learning to accept new things, and to explore a bit instead of being so afraid that you stay in your cave until you are so hungry that you have to get out to find food.But Guy also brings news that the world they all know is about to be destroyed, and they will have to find a new land. Other interesting characters are Catherine Keener as the mom, Ugga. Cloris Leachman as the old grandmother, Gran.It is just a cool animated movie. There is a bare thread of a 'message' about getting out of your cave, your safety zone, to live life instead of just waiting to die. But few of us look to animated movies like this for direction in our lives.We enjoyed it, a good 90 minutes of entertainment.",Null,0,0,22 October 2013

","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline.",Null,0,1,15 July 2018
Any Given Sunday," Good 'football' film that ends up missing the mark a bit.
","Oliver Stone is a good director. He did one of my favorites, 'Nixon'. However, in this film he gets too caught up with 'football for football's sake' which ends up turning a pretty good film into a mediocre one.  A few examples - too many gratuitous shots of himself acting as a reporter, obvious use of former football stars, Johnny Unitas, Dick Butkus, Warren Moon, Barry Switzer, Y.A. Tittle as opposing coaches, or a cameo by Charleton Heston against a backdrop of Heston's Gladiator movie used in the film.  Each one of these is 'cute', but so many of them takes attention from what should have been a more serious treatment of his subject. Still, for the good football action plus a decent story, I rate it '7' of 10. The DD 5.1 surround sound on DVD is very good, and it makes you feel like you are on the field during action scenes, with player grunts and equipment sounds all around you. There is also a good 'making of' feature on the DVD.CAUTION - SPOILERS - my narration of events follows... The film starts with a quote from Lomardi, about the 'field of battle'. Then cut to a game in progress. The Miami Sharks had lost the last 3 but were leading. Their qb (Quaide) is injured, the 2nd qb is injured on his first play, and the 3rd qb (Jaime Foxx) didn't even know the playbook yet. Coach (Pacino) plays it safe and loses the game. Qb vomits each game when he goes in!Next game, brash and confident qb Foxx ignores coaches, calls his own plays, wins game.  Overconfident, and not a team player, he alienates his girlfriend, the coach, and all players and becomes ineffective.  Only the owner (Cameron Diaz) likes him, because he is exciting and brings in money!Meanwhile, Diaz is planning secretly to transfer the team to L.A., or to sell it. Very harshly evaluates coach Pacino. Several long speeches about 'teamwork', and seeing the injured qb back in action, inspires qb Foxx making him realize what a heel he had been, apologises to his teammates, everyone pulls together, his qb sneak wins big playoff game aainst Dallas.As credits roll, coach Pacino announces he will not be Miami coach next year, which pleases Diaz, however announces he will coach expansion Arizona team, and further, will take prize qb Foxx with him.  Team owner Diaz not happy.During the film there is ample nudity. Coach with prostitute. Owner Diaz walking into locker room while men are showering, including frontal male nudity. Lots of R-rated language in the film.  In leisure time, football players behave like animals. I hope the real professional players, that we are paying $millions, are better humans than that.",Null,0,0,28 November 2000
Iron Man," Stan Lee must have a big grin on his face, seeing his Iron Man on the big screen.
","A really, really good comic book action movie. The snappy dialog, good acting, and good directing make all the difference.I've always enjoyed Robert Downey Jr., even in his TV roles, and here he carries the movie as Tony Stark, boy genius and inventor who after his father's death gains control of the biggest corporation making missiles and other machines of war. Tony continues what his father had built, and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard, and here he is long time friend of Tony's, and a military officer, Rhodey.Tony's right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony's trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. She is not only a loyal employee but also a sort of 'pal' to Tony, yet it seems that she wishes there were more between them.The story centers on an incident where Tony had travels to a war zone to demonstrate to the US military their newest weapon. But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned, with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new, a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him, as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit, one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds, and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah, who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger, more powerful iron man suit, and he and Tony battle. With Pepper's help he overcomes Obadiah, and in a conference reveals that he, Tony, is indeed the Iron Man.",Null,4,7,29 October 2008
Mother!," Aronofsky takes us on a wild journey with the house as the world allegory.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped. I was eager to see this, I had heard so much about it. Writer/director Aronofsky has always said he makes a movie to leave an impression, he has to make viewers think and react. He has no desire to make a middle of the road, nice movie.'Mother' starts off like a pretty ordinary movie, the wife wakes up, her husband is not in bed, she finds him downstairs. He is a somewhat successful author, a poet, and they live alone in a big house surrounded by a big field. We see at the very beginning the house had been almost destroyed by a fire but the Mother (as played by Jennifer Lawrence) has worked diligently to bring it back to its original condition. Not much out of the ordinary there. Her husband is Javier Bardem simply as Him.However as the story progresses things get stranger and stranger, starting with a man, then joined by his wife, they break something valuable, their adult sons show up, they fight over jealousy, one kills the other. Adam, Eve, Abel, and Cain immediately come to mind.As the story progresses we see more and more that Mother and the house itself represent Nature and the world, people come into it, become careless, personal pleasure trumps responsibility. Aronofsky has called himself 'Godless' so he has to create his own kinds of God and he does it in his movies. This one is perhaps his clearest example so far. Not a movie for everyone, as many of the '1' votes and unflattering reviews show, but taken as a novel viewing experience it in fact is a very interesting take on humanity. I say enjoy it for the movie-making craft if for nothing else. Don't read past the spoilers following.SPOILERS: As the house is getting overrun with more and more we realize it strays further from a possible reality, it begins to represent all the bad things that have happened in the world. Finally disgusted with the whole thing Mother causes a furnace oil spill in the basement, ignites it, and explodes the whole house and everyone in it. She burns to a crisp but Him, representing the Creator, is unharmed. He reaches in and grabs the crystal from Mother's body, and it becomes the spark for a new beginning. We see the house re-forming and a scene identical to the opening scene where a new Mother wakes up in bed. We see her face, it is not the same one as before.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," NOT a good movie. No good reason to have superheros battle each other.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library.I am a long time fan of the fantasy of superheros. I read the comics when I was a boy growing up and I have enjoyed most of the superhero movies over the years. When I first heard they were making this movie my thought was, without knowing anything about the story, this can't be good. Batman and Superman would never try to kill each other.So, with the movie now on DVD i satisfied my curiosity. To give proper credit, the acting and cinematography are very good, as well as the production design and sound. To me the choices of Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and Batman, and Henry Cavill as Clark Kent and Superman, were very good. But the story sucks. Batman (and others) get concerned that Superman, being an alien, is ultimately dangerous and bad for the world, so assisted by an evil Lex Luthor and some long-hidden Kryptonite they set out to get him.No, it isn't a very good movie at all because it isn't a worthwhile story.",Null,1,7,15 August 2016
Tombstone," Good western film, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer carry it.
","Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. Both are superb in this 1993 film 'Tombstone.' Earp has retired and just wants to make his wealth in Tombstone, while Holliday say 'Not me, I'm at the top of my form.' The 'Cowboys', the 100 or so outlaws who identify their 'gang' by wearing bright red scarves tied to their belts, cause recurring havoc in towns like Tombstone. After they kill the sheriff, and then kill one of Wyatt's brothers, he is forced to 'come out of retirement' and, with the help of some reformed, former Cowboys, clean the slate. You have to like 'shoot-em-up' westerns to enjoy this film. For its genre it is well done. The DVD and its surround sound track are well done, and the wide western vistas look really good on a widescreen HDTV.Billy Bob Thornton has a small role, but in a very important early scene that sets the tone for Wyatt's stay in Tombstone. Wyatt walks into a bar known for trouble and finds Thornton at a gambling table, giving all kinds of grief to the others, being an obnoxious bully. Wyatt walks up and says 'You're sitting in my place.' Incredulous, Thornton's tough guy gets up, face-to-face with Wyatt, and gets slapped. Not knowing what to do, he gets slapped harder, not realizing yet who was doing the slapping. But he sensed that he might be in over his head. Finally, Wyatt says, 'Pull your gun. Go ahead, pull it, or do you plan to stand there and bleed all over the floor.' Thornton wipes blood from his mount, backs down, and leaves, still dazed over the quick sequence of events.

The Emperor's New Groove," Good fun, a throwback to Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote type of animated physical comedy.
","The most irritating thing about watching 'The Emperor's New Groove' on CBS is that they showed a 78-minute film in 2 hours, which means for every 8 to 10 minutes of movie, they interrupted with 5 minutes of commercials, so I could not get into the rhythm, or 'the groove', of this movie.
Spoiled, self-centered brat of a King (David Spade) is turned into a Llama as his assistant (Eartha Kitt) tries to kill him. He is accidentally found by a peasant (John Goodman) who helps him get back to his castle, avoiding cliffs, waterfalls, scorpions, bats, leopards, canyons, but they never get even a scratch, just like Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. During his journey back, he develops a sensitivity he didn't have before, and after he finds the potion to become a man again, he is destined to become a good king, with a 'New Groove'.The scenes are very inventive, the dialog very witty, and I found myself laughing spontaneously often. Spade and Goodman were especially a good comic team. But my favorite character was Kronk, the not-too-smart giant of a bad guy who acted like a little kid every chance he got. Tom Jones, the singer, provides some of the background music.However, this is not really a movie for small children. Several times the characters say they 'want to kill' and at least once use the word 'hate' to express an ill feeling.  Small children do not need unnecessary exposure to that.  Overall I rate it '7' of 10 for good entertainment fluff.  Maybe a '6' would be better. Not as good as recent animated movies like 'Tarzan', 'A Bug's Life', 'Prince of Egypt', and the two 'Toy Story' films.",Null,1,2,14 October 2001
Blade Runner," A good but somewhat overrated sci-fi movie.
","Harrison Ford and the other actors do a fine job in this darkly-filmed sci-fi movie but the storyline is quite simple and the search for'replicants' fairly predictable.  Compared to other 1980s movies like Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc, this one just does not hold up to those standards. And modern sci-fi movies like 'The Matrix' simply blow it away.When I read all the comments so far by 'Blade Runner' fans, it sounds to me like they are talking about a '7' or '8' movie, but they give it a '10'.  I think '7' or '8' is about correct.The DVD version has great sound and a sharp picture. It is an enjoyable movie, worth seeing, but just don't have your expectations too high.",Null,1,3,18 March 2000
Bruce Almighty," Only a few laughs in what could have been a much better movie.
","I like Jim Carrey, my favorite roles of his are in Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, The Truman Show, The Majestic, and Man On The Moon. His problem, when he has one, is when TOO MUCH Jim Carrey comes out, a similar problem with certain Robin Williams roles. And that is the problem I have with 'Bruce Almighty.'  Little of what Carrey did in this movie was enjoyable to me. The funniest scene was where he, playing God in the studio background, makes his rival the news anchor make funny faces and babble incoherently while on the air. But it wasn't Carrey that was funny. Overall not a very satisfying movie. The critic Ebert has his usual complete review, however I don't rate it as highly as he does.",Null,3,6,26 February 2004
The Greatest Showman," Insanely good musical tribute to the life of P.T. Barnum.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The music, the choreography, the singing, the story, all in all one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. It isn't a documentary, it is a musical inspired by P.T. Barnum's early life and start as great showman.It is strange that many of us first encountered Hugh Jackman, the actor, as Wolverine. That got him known but in fact he is one of the best modern song-and-dance performers. In fact when he was host of a TV awards program a few years back, in recognition of his 'great showmanship' the idea of a 'Greatest Showman' movie musical with him playing thre lead role was conceived.Most of the story here takes place in the mid 1800s as P.T. Barnum (Jackman), a natural showman, first developed his Manhattan museum of oddities, then eventually 'The Greatest Show On Earth' with his circus.Michelle Williams plays his wife Charity Barnum and to my pleasant surprise she is an excellent singer. The only major character that did not do her own singing was Rebecca Ferguson as the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind.Lots of good performances, too many to mention in a brief review, but for anyone who enjoys a good musical this one is a real winner. I plan to watch it again before I return the DVD.January 2019: I watched it a second time on BluRay, I came away with an even better impression. Plus the 'extras' on how this movie came to be and how the songs were written are among the best I have seen for any movie.",Null,3,6,22 April 2018
Monsters University," The prequel to 'Monsters, Inc', when Mike and Sully met.
","Of course the 'monsters' and their society live in an alternate universe, one that can step into ours only through the magic doors that lead to bedrooms. So we can't really discuss their existence in the same terms we understand in our own world. But if you tried, I suppose it would be accurate to say this story takes place when the little monsters are out of high school and entering college.This is not your normal college, although it and its campus look like almost any other American college. (The animation is superb, my wife commented particularly on how real the bus looked.) This college is called 'Monsters University' and among other curricula is to be trained as a scary monster, one who could eventually work as a monster visiting the bedrooms of children at night, to scare them and generate power to run their society, as we saw them doing in 'Monsters, Inc'.But Mike just isn't very scary-looking, and try as he might, he has a hard time acting scary. Sully doesn't have that problem, but he is a slacker, he doesn't want to stick with the curriculum, he thinks he has it made and can cruise by. So both Mike and Sully, for different reasons, are on the verge of being kicked out, their only salvation is to win the 'scare games' with a motley band of rejects. If they can win the series of competitions then they can stay.Of course we know their fate, because they did become very successful 'scarers', but this movie shows us how they got to that point. Two of the best in the business, Billy Crystal is back as the voice of Mike and John Goodman as the voice of Sully. Plus many other fine, experienced actors for most of the other voices. Overall a very entertaining animated movie.",Null,0,0,5 December 2013
Ben-Hur," The epic Heston classic, Judah Ben-Hur.
","While it is possible that I actually saw Ben Hur over the years, I don't believe I ever did. Perhaps some of the great chariot race scenes, but nothing else. So I watched it today, on DVD, a restored version with Dolby sound. At over 3 hours running time it takes a bit of patience. The DVD has a great picture, with realistic colors, neither mute nor vivid. It also includes the 6-minute musical interlude at the beginning plus a 4-minute one after intermission.The DVD has a host of valuable extras, including a profile of the military man who wrote the source novel in the 1800s, plus excerpts from various stage versions and the 1925 silent film version. Also very interesting is Heston's selectable commentary on the film.The story spans the 33 years from the birth of Christ to his crucifixion. Against this background is a fictional story of two men who had been best friends as boys, and who now as early 30s adults find themselves on opposite sides of the politics of Judea and surrounding areas.Academy award winning Charlton Heston is famously Judah Ben-Hur, a wealthy Jew who is dedicated to opposing the invasion by Rome. Stephen Boyd is his old friend Messala, who has returned to Judea as a Roman official. As they meet and greet again after years apart, it comes down to Messala telling Judah, 'You are either with me, or against me.' With that choice they part ways as enemies.And that sets the stage for the rest of the story. In what is an accidental falling of loose roofing material, slightly injuring a Roman official on horseback, Massala uses this as a demonstration of his will, he sends Judah away to a life of slavery as a rower on a Roman war ship, and Judah's mother and sister to a life in prison. He knew they were not guilty but this would show the rest of the community how far he would go to enforce Roman rule and suppress any opposition.The great chariot race is after the intermission, and is a full 9 minutes of running time. Perhaps even more impressive than the filming of the scene is the work that went into building a set of that scale.History has shown that this is one of the great movies of all time, an enduring classic. Ironically, filming began without a good script and was literally written day-by-day for filming the next day.SPOILERS: For anyone who has not seen it yet, read no further. Judah becomes a dedicated slave and in a battle ends up saving the life of the fleet commander, who takes him to Rome, legally adopts him, and makes him heir to his name and wealth. Meanwhile, although Judah thought they were dead, his mother and sister had contracted leprosy while in prison and were living in a valley of lepers. In the great chariot race, officiated by Pilot, Massala is using his whip on Judah, who gains the upper hand, Masala falls to the track, is trampled, and later dies. This is happening right before the time Pilate sentenced Christ to a death on the cross. Judah had encountered Christ 4 years earlier while being marched across the desert, and was given a drink of water. Now they go to the place where he passes, and later mother and sister are healed as Christ dies, witnessed by a great wind and rain. Judah becomes an early convert from Judaism to Christianity, although that is treated in a very subtle manner in the movie.",Null,0,2,26 December 2011
Casino Royale," A fine James Bond movie.
","I remember some of the turmoil when it was first announced that Daniel Craig would be the next James Bond. It seems that many fans were up in arms because they didn't think he would be good in the role. Well those apprehensions were sorely misplaced because he does a wonderful job as the latest Bond.As has been written, this James Bond is a bit 'darker' than former Bonds. He doesn't yet have the polish and more often strays from the rules. Here he has to thwart a plan by Le Chiffre to rig the stock market to his advantage and, after he does, also has to prevent Le Chiffre from winning a high stakes poker game where $110Million overall is at stake.Good old reliable Judi Dench is perfect as M. The movie has a good mix of action and character development. Less reliance of CGI and more reliance on action stunts. In fact, the opening scenes where Bond chases down a wanted man is one of the best chase scenes I have ever viewed.All in all, a very fine Bond movie.",Null,3,6,11 April 2007
Toy Story 3," This 3rd in the Toy Story story is better than either of the first two, which is a worthwhile accomplishment.
","I'm pretty sure this was shown in 3D in theaters, but I saw it in 2D via DVD in my own home theater.This time the theme is Andy heading off to college, and obviously too old to keep playing with his toys, all the toys we have come to know in the first two Toy Story movies. So in last-minute packing and moving to school, except for Woody the toys bound for the attic are put into a black plastic garbage bag, which mom mistakenly believes is trash. That bag gets put out to the street, which Woody, back on the 'college' box upstairs, notices and they barely manage to avoid the garbage truck.But in a series of other occurrences the toys end up at a school, which they are initially happy about, being played with every day rather being in an attic. But the toys are really a gang, led by the fluffy stuffed bear Lotso, and Andy's toys effectively become prisoners. So it becomes up to Buzz Lightyear on the inside, and Woody on the outside getting in, to save the day.The animation of course is superb, as we have become accustomed, but what makes this the best of the three is the quality and depth of the story. Definitely one to own and see periodically.Tom Hanks is back as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and Joan Cusack as Jessie. The main new voice is Ned Beatty as Lotso and he is superb, absolutely believable.",Null,1,1,14 November 2010
Trainspotting," One of my all-time favorite comedies, although a somewhat 'dark' one.
","I'm still not sure how the title 'Trainspotting' relates to the story, but this is one of my favorite comedies and I rate it 9 of 10. It deals with some rough subjects - hard drug use, HIV, premature death, theft, bloodshed. But the movie in a great sense is about the attempts of one main character to go straight and 'choose life', but his 4 dastardly friends end up making that very, very difficult.It starts in Edinburgh, moves to London, then back to Edinburgh. The situations and dialog generally are very well written and performed. You have to have a sick sense of humor, like I do, to appreciate this scene, but the one where he ends up in the 'worst toilet in Scotland', then realizes he has to retrieve his suppositories, is just great!You really have to appreciate British humor to like this film. I found it much, much better than 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.'",Null,8,16,10 August 2000
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," This third in the Ice Age series is my favorite, I believe.
","Just to reflect for a few seconds, I grew up in the 1950s when animated 'cartoons' were part of the attraction at the theater. When you consider that process, and what we have now in the animation like 'Ice Age', it is amazing how far animation has come in my lifetime.This 'Ice Age' story is in a fictional time when the ice age was still upon the Earth, but an vast, lush underground world is discovered, where dinosaurs and other creatures, thought to be extinct, were still thriving. It starts when the sloth breaks through some thin ice and discovers 3 very large eggs. So he brings them to safety, where they hatch while he is napping. They are baby T-Rex dinosaurs, and of course imprint on his as their 'mother.' Trouble comes when the real mother is looking for her babies, and ends up carrying them plus the sloth down into the strange land.This all happens as the story begins, and most of the movie has the rest of the mixed ice age 'family' traveling down into this strange world to try to rescue their friend, the sloth.The animation, of course, is flawless. The story is a lot of fun and very inventive. I laughed often. As with the other two, the silly squirrel, Scrat, provided much of the entertainment. Here he meets an alluring female squirrel, and when they are competing for a plump acorn, then falling into a deep chasm, he finds out she is, in fact, a flying squirrel.Good movie. I may buy a copy of the DVD.",Null,0,1,21 November 2009
La Vie En Rose," A glimpse into the life of French singer Edith Piaf.
","I can't write anything until I comment on how good 20-something actress Marion Cotillard is as Edith Piaf. To me her performance ranks up there with a select few in the 3000+ movies I have seen. Even if I had not enjoyed the story, watching this actress in the role she created would have been worth my time. I hope she is recognized come Academy Award time.Piaf is a French word for the bird 'sparrow' and that was how she was named when her talent was first recognized when she was a 20-year-old street singer. She had no idea how good she was, and probably all of her life just took her singing for granted, it was just a part of her.The movie touches on her young life in the brothel, until rescued by her father and brought into the circus. But most of the movie is of her actual singing career, and ups and downs, her affair with real life prize fighter Marcel Cerdan who was killed in a plane crash on the way to visit her.All in all a superb movie enjoyable by anyone who can appreciate a good film based on a real famous and tragic life. Piaf died at the young age of 47, although she looked close to 80 in the movie.Feb 25 edit: I see that Marion Cotillard won the Oscar last night for Best Actress, which is very fitting!",Null,0,2,14 December 2007
Before Sunrise," Good movie, feels more like being with a couple, than a film about them.
","I recall hearing good reviews about this film when it came out in 1995, but only this week had the chance to see it when I bought it as a budget DVD for under $6 US. Good little film. Simple premise, boy (Hawke) traveling by train in Europe to fly out of Vienna the next morning. Meets French girl (Delpy) who is traveling back to Paris. As they are about to part, he asks her to stay with him and walk and talk all over Vienna all night, then she can take the train to Paris as he flies back to the States. She accepts, and the whole rest of the film is them getting to know each other, meeting up with various people, and after the evening realizing they have a connection.some SPOILERS - read with caution.  At the very end, as she is about to board her train, and he is about to board the bus to the airport, their logoc says 'that was fun and we'll have good memories, but probably never see each other again.'  But in an emotional moment he says, 'let's meet right here in exactly one year. No! Make it six months, right at this spot.' It would be December. Although they agree, and part ways, you know that they will not carry through with it. Or will they? Maybe one will and the other won't? Good film, good video transfer for a cheap DVD.  No extras.",Null,0,2,29 May 2003
Signs," Really nice DVD, but only an average movie.
","My wife and I enjoyed 'Signs' but when it was over we both said, 'That's a pretty average movie.' We couldn't understand all the fuss and high user ratings. I liked 'Unbreakable' much more, and even 'The Sixth Sense.'  For me, the extras on the 'Signs' DVD are much more interesting than the film itself, a fairly simple alien story that moves along very deliberately. But the extras give a superb glimpse into Night's film-making process, how he writes, how he directs, the building of the farm set in an experimental corn field, and how the CGI alien was done. However, there's a bit much 'mutual admiration' comments at times by the actors and crew. And Night's comment, regarding design of various trailers to advertise 'Signs', 'We're going to show you one of the best movies ever seen', gives us an insight into the perhaps inflated view Night has of his own work.some SPOILERS follow - don't read further if you haven't seen 'Signs' yet, unless you don't mind spoiling some of the surprise.A key theme running through 'Signs' and uttered more than once is, 'Is it possible that there are no coincidences?' It is said at the end, by Gibson's character, when the young boy is spared the alien's poisonous gas because his lungs are temporarily incapacitated from his asthma. We are shown a drawing in a book of aliens where the house looks exactly like the one in this movie. The film gets its title from crop signs, made by alien beings as directions for other aliens to follow them, but also has the meaning of Gibson's character, an Episcopal priest, to get a sign from God regarding his faith, lost when his wife was killed by a car. It turns out that the aliens here are not kind aliens, they want something which is never directly revealed.What did I not like about this movie? I find the dialog unbelievable much of the time. Also, Night wanted to inject humor into the script, which he did, but for me it did ring true in relation to what was happening on-screen. For example, near the end when the alien was in the attic, his brother got on a chair and was holding the attic door shut by extending his arms to the door, as the alien tried to push it open. He says, 'This is only a temporary solution.' Gibson asks, 'How temporary' and the answer is 'About 22 more seconds.'  I don't really believe this is the dialog two adult brothers would have during a life-threatening situation, unles you are simply making a broad comedy. 'Signs' is not a broad comedy, it examines what could happen if crop signs really were made by dangerous aliens, and also how a fallen away priest might regain his love for God. I believe Night tried too hard in filming 'Signs' to come up with some 'grand moments.' There is no doubt he is strongly influenced by great directors like Hitchcock, and artists like Norman Rockwell, because he mentions these in the DVD extras. However it seems that he tries too hard to 'make' emotional things happen instead of letting them simply be a result of really good directing and acting of a really good script.  I believe he failed for the most part in 'Signs' when he tried to create these grand moments. And for me, the film failed to create the mood of terror at any time.Night takes much care to set up the premise of crop signs made by aliens, and the idea that they are dangerous, maybe even threatening the very existence of life as we know it on Earth. But he gets rid of that threat with one simple statement over the news, 'In the middle east using an ancient method the aliens have been chased away. No other details are available.'  As I watched the film I thought, 'What the heck is that? Sure seems like a giant cop-out in the story line.' It was as if he didn't know how to handle this grand premise he had created, so he just invented some quick resolution.In summary, I like Night and his method of making films. I especially like 'Unbreakable' with its good vs evil theme residing in the two main characters. I own the DVD and watch it periodically, I admire how well it was done. While I enjoyed 'Signs' I don't think it rises above 'average', and certainly not in the category of the better films I have seen over the past few years. Night is still a very young film maker and I look forward to what he may offer in the future. However, for him to continue his success I believe he needs to move away from his boyish fascination with himself, which I think dilutes his ideas, and re-focus on what he does best, create fascinating new themes for films. He is no Hitchcock, and I doubt he ever will be.",Null,4,8,2 February 2003
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," If you like Woody Allen, you will like this movie.
","Many Woody Allen films are less likely to have a story that has a 'resolution', instead will be more 'slice of life' stories. But 'slice of life' of rather ordinary, honest, faithful people isn't that interesting so he makes them rather unusual and quirky. This is that type of movie.Rebecca Hall as Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as Cristina are university students who have the opportunity to spend two months in Spain. Vicky is traditional and is engaged to a traditional man back in New York, and they plan to have a traditional wedding and a traditional life, all in all predictable and some think boring.Christina, on the other hand, is just about the opposite of all that. She has a more wild zest for life and the experiences it can provide. She is more likely to experiment when the opportunity presents itself.But both Vicky and Christina are having a nice, pleasant visit until one evening at a function they encounter Javier Bardem (evil guy in 'No Country for Old Men') as Spanish artist Juan Antonio Gonzalo. He is the type that doesn't exist in reality, but here he is charming, intelligent, witty, sexy and ... forward. He very calmly tells the two friends that he would like to have sex with both of them, at the same time. Instead of anyone becoming offended, they have an Allen-esq discussion about it.All that results in their flying off in a small plane to another location. Some interactions result. Then what starts out as a rather nice developing love affair between Christina and Juan Antonio is thrown into turmoil by Pen√©lope Cruz as Maria Elena , the recent former wife of Juan Antonio. (Cruz has received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for this role.) A feature of this movie is Christopher Evan Welch (whom we never see) as Narrator. While this feature of the movie has been widely criticized by some, I found it a rather nice way to augment the story without having to interpret everything a character might be doing.When the 90-minute movie is over, we observe that all the characters have been changed by the experiences, but they mainly continue in the directions they were headed as the story began. Just an interesting, somewhat perverted, slice of life story. For my tastes it is somewhat overrated.",Null,1,4,2 February 2009
Sweet and Lowdown," One of the more pleasant Woody Allen projects, good music, fun story, 7 of 10 rating.
","'Sweet and Lowdown' is a mock-documentary about a 1930s Jazz guitarist who is 'second best in the world', only the real guitarist, Django Reinhardt, being better.  One of the comic threads here is that Sean Penn's character, Emmet Ray, is so intimidated by Reinhardt that even the thought of mmeting him causes Ray to faint. This Woody Allen film is whimsical in the vein of 'Purple Rose of Cairo', but so well done that you easily believe Emmet Ray was a real person. Samantha Morton does a good job as the mute 'Hattie'.  Several other well-known actors - Uma Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol - have minor roles.  Sean Penn does a marvelous job with his character and it is clear to me why he received an Oscar nomination for it.I only give this movie a '7' because at 95 minutes, part of which is 'talking head' snips of Woody and others, the theme is treated somewhat superficially.  More character development and resolution of 'what happened to Emmet Ray' could have made this a much better movie.  Still, it is enjoyable and worth seeing.A major complaint from me - the DVD version is in glorous 'MONO' sound. What a waste and cheap way out, in this modern time of surround sound. However, the picture is very nice.",Null,2,3,15 October 2000
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The Protestant English and the Catholic Spanish go to war against each other.
","I enjoyed this movie a bit more than its rating would indicate, but my wife didn't care for it at all. After I saw it, I looked up a short biography of Sir Walter Raleigh and it seems that the movie is fairly realistic. However Raleigh seems to be somewhat romanticized in the movie. But most of the characters appear to be based on real historical people.It was the 16th century and England was turning towards Protestantism, while about half of England was still Catholic. Queen Elizabeth's insiders urged her to imprison Catholics because of the threat, but she refused to treat her loving subjects that way. She strongly believed that people should stand on what they do, not what they believe. Still, some clandestine executions were carried out without her knowledge.Meanwhile Catholic Spain considered Elizabeth and her Protestant population heretics and vowed to conquer them. Their case was further aggravated by Sir Walter Raleigh, New World explorer, who also pirated the gold from Spanish ships and delivered it to the Queen.Cate Blanchett is excellent as Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. The movie depicts her as having a romantic attraction to Raleigh, who had great affection for her also. However he impregnated one of her attendants, Elizabeth 'Bess' Throckmorton (pretty, blonde Australian Abbie Cornish), and they were married in a small ceremony without the permission of Elizabeth. In real life that got them imprisoned in the Tower of London, but it isn't clear in the movie what their punishment was.Clive Owen is good as charming and witty Sir Walter Raleigh. The movie shows him as a hero in helping to defeat the attacking Spanish Armada, but that was an embellishment for the movie.Geoffrey Rush is good as Elizabeth's adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, who was shown as actually doing things to encourage the conflict between England and Spain. He appeared to be a traitor.Good movie. As history tells us, the Spanish were not successful, England entered into a 'golden period' under Elizabeth, and even today Catholics and Protestants coexist in England. Sir Walter Raleigh did not fare so well after Elizabeth died, he was eventually tried for crimes and beheaded.",Null,2,2,23 March 2008
The Deer Hunter," Viet Nam war theme, focus on before and after.
","'The Deer Hunter' is one of those movies I had been aware of for a long time but only got around recently to seeing, thanks to my local library. I grew up during the period, almost was drafted out of graduate school into the Viet Nam war, and frankly did not look forward to yet another, albeit older, version of the conflict. Fortunately this movie is only briefly about the actual war, most of it is about the three friends, blue collar workers, and deer hunters, examining their lives and relationships before and after they served together in the 'conflict.'  SPOILERS - De Niro and Walken are the stars here, along with girlfriend back home, played by Streep. Excellent drama, but not one I'd like to see multiple times for entertainment. Central to the theme was the game of Russian Roulette, played by the Viet Cong captors, who placed bets as the prisoners tried to avoid blowing their brains out. Through De Niro's bold moves, they turned the guns on the captors and escaped. Traumatized by the war, Walken became AWOL, much later was found by De Niro, who tried to bring him home. Walken was still playing a form of the roulette game, sending cash back home to their wounded friend. After he blew his own brains out, De Niro went back home and took good care of the girlfriend.

Identity," Quite a different thriller, we were captivated.
","Tanya loaned us several of her favorite DVDs and this is one of them. The basic premise is that a group of seemingly random, unrelated people end up stranded at a seedy motel because bad weather and flooding make the roads in and out impassable. But very soon people begin to die. The bodies are discovered in very gruesome situations. So the several remaining adults try to figure out who is responsible, while they also seek to protect themselves.The movie has an A list of actors. John Cusack is Ed, a former cop who now is a driver for a famous actress. She is Rebecca De Mornay as Caroline Suzanne.Ray Liotta shows up as Rhosed, a cop transporting a prisoner, who is Jake Busey as Robert Maine. But we eventually learn this situation is not what it is made out to be. Amanda Peet is Paris, John Hawkes is Larry, Alfred Molina is Dr. Malick, Clea DuVall is a young married Ginny. At the very beginning of the movie we see Pruitt Taylor Vince as Malcolm Rivers, who appears to be a convicted mental patient. We have to wait until the end to find out how he is connected to the rest of the characters. While this isn't my favorite genre of movie, it is very suspenseful and kept our attention all the way to the end.SPOILERS: One family stranded at the seedy motel is a father, his injured wife, and their young son. In the end it turns out that all the characters have the same birthday, and the same birth place, they are in fact different personalities of the mental killer we first see, and the young boy is the manifestation that is killing the others, but they are not a series of real people, instead the different personalities.",Null,0,3,20 November 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," Very captivating story of how Walt Disney eventually convinced P.L. Travers to let him make Mary Poppins.
","Let me get this out of the way up-front, this movie is not necessarily an accurate account, even though it is based on real people and real events. It is about the difficulty Walt Disney had convincing author P.L. Travers to sell his studio the film rights to her book, to make 'Mary Poppins.' But from what I can tell by reading various articles some of the details are different from what actually happened. For example, much of the conceit of the movie is based on P.L. Travers not yet having signed over the rights to make the movie, and her going to Los Angeles to work with the writers was also to get her to sign. In reality she had already done so. P.L. Travers was the pen name of the author, who was born as Helen Lyndon Goff in Australia in 1899. The movie starts in 1906 when she was 7, and during the 2-hours running time of the movie it flashes back often to her childhood. Her father's name was Travers Goff, an unsuccessful banker and an alcoholic who died young, and memories of her father had a lasting effect on his daughter. Her pen name was likely in memory of her father.Emma Thompson is P.L. Travers and she plays her as a very severe and tactless person. She may have been a bit more fun-loving in real life, but in this movie she is very aggressive in having her own ideas incorporated into the movie script. In fact she insisted that discussions be tape recorded and we get to hear her actual voice during the end credits. She seemed to be pretty close to Thompson's portrayal.Tom Hanks is good as genial Walt Disney, shown in this movie as being quite involved with the process of fleshing out the movie, but independent reports say he essentially turned it over to his own writers to work with Travers and had very little to do with it until the premiere. The young Helen is a key character, showing her relationship with her father and her early poetry writing, and she is played very well by young Annie Rose Buckley as 'Ginty', her father's pet name for her. Her dad is played by Colin Farrell as Travers Goff. Her mother is played by Ruth Wilson as Margaret Goff.A fine actor, Paul Giamatti has a relatively small role as the limo driver, Ralph, but it adds a nice touch to the story.In all my wife and I enjoyed the movie, it never seemed long and in fact the story is so interesting I found myself wishing it had gone on a bit longer. It may be a somewhat fictional re-telling of the story, but it is very well made and interesting.",Null,0,1,19 April 2014
Jojo Rabbit," An entertaining parody of Nazi existence in 1940s Germany.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Not knowing what to expect, after about 8 minutes she said 'This is all pretty silly.' And the first 10 to 15 minutes are indeed pretty silly, in effect making fun of the German Nazis and their training of their youth to be men of Hitler. And how to hate Jews.The title comes from the main character, a boy of 10 whose nickname is Jojo. As a test he is ordered to kill a rabbit with his bare hands. Not being that cruel he tried to let the rabbit go, and to run, so the older Nazi boys started calling him 'Jojo Rabbit' as a demeaning label.The story changes tenor when Jojo hears some noise upstairs at home and being a good detective finds a teenage Jewish girl in a secret hiding place in his attic. Jojo's mother (Johanssen) has put her up so that she will avoid arrest and death. As the story develops the boy and the girl form an unlikely bond. They come to love each other as brother and sister.Frankly I'm still not sure what I think of the movie as a whole, I know it got awards and was nominated for 'Best Picture' but being very unconventional I still don't know where I rank it. I need to watch it again before I return the DVD.",Null,0,1,23 February 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Animated, using small puppets, quirky and different, I liked it.
","Wes Anderson, a native Houstonian, makes quirky and interesting movies. Among his my favorite is 'Rushmore', made in Houston. Here he directs and has a hand in writing the extended adaptation of a storybook.George Clooney is the clever and fantastic Mr. Fox. We see him and Ms Fox get captured early, stealing birds, and he vows to go straight, get a legitimate job. So 2 years later (12 Fox years) he writes a newspaper column. Meryl Streep is Mrs. Fox. Jason Schwartzman is his young son, Ash. (Bill Murray voices the Badger and, perhaps not coincidentally, Murray and Schwartzman were the two principle actors in 'Rushmore'.)Other famous voices include Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean, Willem Dafoe as the menacing Rat, and my grandson's namesake, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip.But Mr Fox, and of course all the other animals, are wild animals. It is against their nature to go straight, and not steal chickens, geese, and apple cider from the farmers. So most of the movie pits the animals against the farmers. Mr Fox indeed turns out to be fantastic! The extras are interesting, especially as they relate to the animation used here, small puppets moved slightly between single frame shots. Much like claymation of the Wallace and Grommit movies.",Null,1,3,30 May 2010
Speed," The movie that put Reeves and Bullock on viewers' radar.
","When 'Speed' hit the theaters in 1994, Keanu Reeves was 30 and already had around 20 movies to his credit, but those of us who knew him at all, probably knew him for his two 'Bill and Ted' roles. Hardly a resume' that would lead to the roles that followed, especially the landmark role of 'Neo' in the Matrix movies. Similarly, Sandra Bullock was also 30, had about 12 to 15 movies to her credit, but 'Love Potion No. 9' from 1992 was arguably her best. As we now know, she has gone on to a very successful acting career, and came to her senses a few years ago, moving to the Austin, Texas area. One of her most fun to watch movies, 'Hope Floats' with Harry Connick, Jr., was shot in little Smithville, a town I know well, and where my friend 'Will' lives. 'Speed' was a very successful movie for Reeves and Bullock, mainly because nothing like it came before, and it has a story line which holds your interest. Not a great movie, but always a fun one to watch again.Some SPOILERS FOLLOW, quit reading, OK. Reeves is one of the good guys here, playing Officer Jack Traven, and his nemesis turns out to be Dennis Hopper in a great role as Howard Payne. Payne booby traps a bus, such that once it gets going, explosives will go off, killing all aboard, if the speed drops below 55 miles per hour. Sandra Bullock plays Annie Porter, one of the passengers. To save everyone, Traven must jump aboard the bus, take control of the bus, helped by Porter, and get everyone off before the bus explodes. This creates many exciting 'chase scenes' on the freeways and through the streets. Traven prevails, Porter and he become romantically linked. Cute movie.",Null,0,1,15 December 2004
Live Free or Die Hard," For sheer action and entertainment, this hits the right spots.
","The key to understanding and liking these Bruce Willis 'Die Hard' movies is to accept that nothing is to be taken seriously. You find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all, as the invincible John McClane almost single-handedly hunts down and disposes of the bad guys. How about using a car as a projectile to shoot down a helicopter?Bruce Willis is back as John McClane, pressed into service as the security of our national systems are being hacked in ways they never have before. Behind it all is disgruntled Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gabriel who had designed the data systems, post-9/11, and whose warnings were not taken seriously. So he is out for revenge in his own way, shutting down everything in what hackers call a 'fire sale', as in 'everything must go.' Go into disarray, that is.Justin Long is known hacker Matt Farrell who McClane attempts to take into the offices for questioning, but they never get there. It soon is clear that some one is out to dispose of Farrell, and it is Gabriel who knows Farrell is the only one who can salvage the nation from the hacking.So most of the movie is a series of chases and improbable escapes by McClane and Farrell. Very entertaining.SPOILERS: The 'fire sale' was not the goal, just a means to an end. Gabriel knew, from his design, such a massive hacking would trigger a secret data dump into one location, and Gabriel was out for that data. With it he could copy it, then destroy it to cripple the nation, while using the copied data himself for untold wealth. The situation at the end was complicated because Gabriel had McClane's daughter as an unwilling hostage, but in the end she proved to be as tough to kill as was her father. Gabriel and all his men were killed, and after the movie ended we presume systems will be restored.",Null,0,2,13 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," Highly entertaining comic-book movie.
","Even though I was not a reader of X-Men comics, I grew up reading action comics in the 1950s, and I enjoy most any comic-book inspired movie. Like the first X-Men movie, or Batman, Superman, Spiderman, and Shadow movies. This one, 'X2', is no exception. From the opening sequence, threatening the President of the USA, to the final scenes, the action, sound, and special effects are highly entertaining. Just simple escapism entertainment. I own the DVD, and will view it more than once.SPOILERS follow, don't read any further, OK!?  The premise here is that an evil scientist is out to destroy all mutants, and to do that he gains mind control of some which allows him to have plans stolen for the chamber where Dr X can use his mind to track down people. Since this threatens both the good and the bad mutants, they band together to defeat this plot. All the mutants get to show off their unique powers.",Null,0,1,14 March 2004
Thor: The Dark World," Follow-up to the 2011 movie THOR.
","I saw it on DVD, a loaner from my public library. This is a follow-up to the 2011 movie 'THOR' with most of the same cast and characters, and a new story bridging from the other. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor with his trusty hammer. Natalie Portman is back as his love interest he met when sent to Earth. Tom Hiddleston is back as Thor's untrustworthy brother Loki. Anthony Hopkins is back as their father, King of Asgard, Odin. It was fun seeing a new cast member, Zachary Levi, of the old 'Chuck' TV series, here as Fandral. I enjoyed him so much in the TV series, I am glad he is getting some movie roles. Anyway the story is convoluted but as these types of stories go match good vs evil. There is a convergence of 9 realms which only happens every 5000 years, and when it does they interact in strange and unpredictable ways. There is ample comedy sprinkled throughout so that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The big climax is at Greenwich, outside London on the Thames, and involves a very large alien craft plowing into the land. As we might imagine, the good guys, with great difficulty, prevail.I am sort of an odd viewer of this sort of action movie, I don't really care that much about the story. I enjoy the characters, the action, and especially the sound. I have a home theater with a really great powered subwoofer and during many of the action scenes there is real deep, body- vibrating bass, in the LFE track. To me, that was the best part of the whole movie-watching experience.",Null,0,1,1 June 2014
Lucy," More intrigue from Luc Besson.
","Luc Besson has written and directed such movies as 'The Fifth Element', 'La Femme Nikita', and 'Leon the Professional.' So it comes as no surprise that 'Lucy' follows in that general mold of mind-bending concepts and an abundance of action.Scarlett Johansson is Lucy in China and her boyfriend of sorts tries to convince her to deliver a sliver aluminum briefcase to a man in the hotel. Lucy isn't stupid, even though she only uses a small fraction of her brain, she asks what in inside. When he tells her he gets $1000 to make a delivery, she knows something is fishy and wants no part of it. But he slaps handcuffs onto her arm, attached to the briefcase, so she is forced to go in. That is where her adventure begins.In a parallel story Morgan Freeman as Professor Norman is an expert in human intelligence and over the years has formed theories about what would happen if humans could harness a greater percentage of their brains, say 20% and beyond? As the movie moves along Lucy and Norman are destined to cross paths.This is all science fiction, and lots of people, good guys and bad, get shot and killed. So take the bad with the good, in the end it is a clever, entertaining movie. And Scarlett Johansson is very good. She is an intelligent, well-educated person and her character and lines are genuine, within the confines of the fiction.SPOILERS: It turns out a very powerful drug is in the briefcase, a synthetic form of what a pregnant mother produces to allow a fetus to develop its body structure. The bad guys are kidnapping people, implanting a kilo of the drug into their abdomen, sending them back to their European home cities, to be met by an agent to remove the drugs. But when Lucy spurns the advances of a bad guy, he hits her and kicks her in the abdomen, inside the plastic bag breaks, the synthetic drug begins to leak into and be absorbed by her body. This triggers fantastic improvement in her mental abilities, so she is able to hunt down the bad guys and the drugs, help eliminate them, and fuse with Norman's computers to transfer and preserve all the knowledge and wisdom she has gained before she dies shortly.Edit: Feb 2018 - Watched it again, it all seemed very new to me, still enjoyed it as entertaining Sci-Fi.

Am√©lie," 'Bretodeau! Not Bredoteau.'
","The only problem with the film, 'Amelie', is that you can watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Audrey Tautou is just perfect, and she reminds me a lot of a young Leslie Caron. This film relies more on body and facial expressions than on actual dialog, and she does it amazingly well. I saw it on DVD, borrowed from my daughter, and both the picture and surround sound are first-rate. I recall one scene where Amelie was riding in a train, and the sound track made it seem like you are really on a French train, surrounding you with authentic sound. An almost perfect little film about an unusual girl who wants to help make the world a better place for a few of her friends.June 2008 update: I have continued to watch this movie every 6 to 12 months and have enjoyed it every time. What a gem of a movie.June 2013 update: Saw it again last night, still one of my favorites, never gets old!MAJOR SPOILERS follow - don't read if you haven't seen 'Amelie' yet.The film is set in 1997, but begins 23 years earlier showing in a fun fashion the conception, pregnancy, and birth of Amelie in about 30 seconds. She had an unusual childhood, her father a doctor, thought she had a heart condition, her mother died coming out of Notre Dame cathedral, Amelie grew up flashing a mirror out her window, wishing she had a brother or sister to play with. As did a little boy who was apparently her 'soul mate', destined to meet when they were young adults.Amelie's world is populated with unusual characters. The old painter with brittle bones who hasn't been outside his apartment in 20 years. The one-armed, half-wit grocery boy. The grocer who is rude to everyone. The lady whose husband had cheated on her and died in an accident 30 years earlier in South America. The customer at the restaurant who observes and tape records his former girlfriend. In 1997, upon hearing of Princess Di's death, she drops a spherical bottle cap which rolls to dislodge a bathroom tile, behind which she finds a boy's box of favorite toys, hidden for 40 years. She eventually returns it to the now 50s man (Bretodeau) and his reaction motivates her to become a person who helps others become happy.She makes a lady in her restaurant and the rude customer believe the other is interested, and they eventually develop a romantic interest. She escorts an old blind man to the train station, all the while describing for him all the things he can't see. She fabricates a lost letter for the lady who lost her husband, indicating he was about to return to her, so as a happy person she could get on with her life. And, gets her dad to finally get out and see the world, after she has a stewardess friend take his gnome all over the world, and mailing him photographs of the gnome with landmarks in the background.There is a thread of mystery running through the film, after Amelie discovers a picture album of recovered, torn, discarded photos. She eventually finds the owner, who is destined to be her soul mate from childhood, and both of them wonder about the nameless man with the bland expression in torn-up photos that are found all over the city. They formulate theories about him, but it turns out that he simply was the photo booth repair man and the photos were the test shots he made after each repair.Just an overall delightful film, one of the very best in recent years, one that I can enjoy watching over and over.",Null,1,7,23 March 2003
Moonrise Kingdom," Quirky and funny, I could not stop watching. But may not be for all audiences.
","Wes Anderson and I are both Houstonians, but I find his films 'hit-or-miss' for me. 'Rushmore' is one of my favorites, but the others of his not so much so. I like 'Moonrise Kingdom' for the same reasons I like 'Rushmore', and both coincidentally have some of the same actors. The quirky and preposterous situations, presented so seriously, are very entertaining.The core of the story involves a scout troop and a nearby large family. One of the scouts is Jared Gilman (first-time actor) as 12-yr-old Sam , who doesn't seem to fit in with the others, and seems to be a loner, and as we later find out is an orphan living with a bunch of boys in a foster home. But a curious and smart young boy, with excellent wilderness survival skills. At a local entertainment night he wanders into the girls' dressing room and sees one dressed as a Raven, Kara Hayward (first-time actor) as 12-yr-old Suzy who we later find out is a problem child in her own home.Other key characters include Bruce Willis as Captain Sharp, local police. Edward Norton as chain-smoking Scout Master Ward, Bill Murray as Walt Bishop, Suzy's dad, and Frances McDormand as Laura Bishop , Suzy's mom.The story is about Sam and Suzy becoming pen pals of sorts, and making plans to meet and run away. Then the other scouts, the police, and the parents are pressed into service hunting for them.All totally quirky, novel, fun. But not for all audiences, my wife watched a few minutes then walked out. It is that kind of movie.February 2020, I watched it again, alone, most of it was very fresh after all these years and I enjoyed it as much as I did before.

Midway," Good movie, the pivotal battle of Midway, six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Then a few weeks later I watched it again, it was a worthwhile second viewing. With the COVID-19 sweeping the USA now it is a good time to stay away from real crowds!I wonder how many travelers to Chicago know that Midway airport was named in remembrance of the Battle of Midway? The island, called Midway Atoll now, is about halfway between Japan and California, roughly 1000 miles NW of Hawaii. In June 1942, just six months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway set the course for the rest of the war with Japan.The key to getting the upper hand were code breakers, some were musicians in civilian life before the war, they were able to figure out when and where the next attack would be. So even though the US forces were outnumbered, and many planes and pilots were lost, they managed to sink the Japanese carriers and cripple their operations. Japan never recovered.The movie is very accurate, some viewers may complain about the special effects but those are secondary to the story which recounts what happened. The disc has extras, including interviews with two remaining survivors of the Battle of Midway.Good movie of an important battle in the 1940s war with Japan.",Null,0,0,15 March 2020
The Sixth Sense," A well-crafted suspense movie that makes you think about your own 'hereafter'.
","I was able to watch the Sixth Sense on DVD on its first release today. As enjoyable as this movie is, the 'extras' on the DVD make it twice as enjoyable. Included is a fine interview with the writer/director that helps put the whole story in perspective, which includes his personal and family influences.The votes currently place this movie at about #23 on the top 250 movies of all time. That's probably a bit of an overrating, considering all the other fine movies in the list. However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My 'review' doesn't really say anything about the story itself. That is because it is best viewed if you know nothing about it first. Except to say that it is one of the very few movies that gets high ratings from viewers of all ages, and genders! If you haven't yet, then see it. The DVD version if you can, and watch the extras after. Jan 2007 update: I watched it again yesterday. Even though I knew the basic story, and how it would turn out, it was still a worthwhile re-watch. Night may never match his first effort.",Null,1,2,28 March 2000
The Producers," The original version of the movie of the stage play.
","Two years ago I saw the modern remake of this movie, with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, and really enjoyed it. Tonight this 1968 version, the original movie of the play, was shown on TCM. Zero Mostel in the role of Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder as Leo Bloom. This was only Wilder's second movie, and 18 years before he made the memorable 'Lady in Red.' While both movies are very similar, I enjoyed this version better, the period seemed more appropriate.When you see a show like this, you do so for the acting and production numbers, not for the story. This is the movie version of the hit Broadway play, and has the look and feel of a stage musical. The performances are very good, the musical numbers excellent, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie.The story is the same as in the other movie. Producer Max Bialystock hardly ever has a successful show. While being audited, the CPA Leo Bloom casually mentions that Max might actually make more money with a flop that opens and closes the same night, and just keeping the up front money that he convinces all his little old lady followers to cough up. Very reluctantly Leo agrees to partner with Max, the lure of being a 'Producer'!SPOILERS FOLLOW. Max and Leo set out to find the absolute worst script, the worst actors, and the worst director, while raising $1Million. The play will close on opening night, and they will skip out to Brazil with the money. But 'Springtime for Hitler' turns out to be a hit, a very funny take on Hitler. Franz is upset, comes over shooting, they compromise to try to blow up the theater, eventually get to prison, there they put on musicals for the prisoners, their sentences are commuted for having brought so much joy to the hardened criminals.",Null,1,1,15 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Pleasant and entertaining throwback to the 1970s Star Wars movies.
","My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original.Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key.For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle. Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca.Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death.",Null,2,20,30 April 2016
RED," Good Bruce Willis flick, entertaining.
","'R.E.D.' - 'Retired, extremely dangerous.' That is the code word for Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, perhaps the best 'black ops' agent that every worked. Alone in his retirement, he fights boredom by calling the administrative agency, and talks to Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah Ross, he claims the monthly check hasn't arrived so she has to send him a replacement. Then he tears up the check in his hand. He finds her nice to talk to even though they never met.The action starts one early morning hour when Frank gets up for a drink of water, while a group of armed men are in his house. He first pretends to be half asleep but circles around and gets the best of all of them. Realizing someone wants him dead, he goes on the run.He ends up first in Kansas City, where Sarah lives, and he is in her home as she returns from work. He basically kidnaps her, but for her own good, those who want him dead also are after Sarah because of their phone conversations, she may know something.At one point my wife turned to me and said, 'This movie is really well made.' And it is, very interesting and entertaining. Frank eventually joins up with other former members of his black ops team, Helen Mirren as Victoria Morgan Freeman as Joe Matheson, and the kookie character played by John Malkovich, to figure out what is going on. Sarah, fresh from her boring desk job, finds all this action fascinating and is thoroughly enjoying the situations she finds herself in.Rebecca Pidgeon, rarely seen outside David Mamet movies, here is Cynthia Wilkes, working for the government, and her agent searching for Frank is Karl Urban as William Cooper.SPOILERS: In a 'situation' from the 1980s, a man who now is US Vice President, and soon to run for POTUS, had killed a bunch of people, and now he wanted to make sure none of the others there were alive so no one could talk. The list was being killed off, and Frank was one of them. It was up to him and his group to de-fuse that situation and bring out the truth.",Null,0,0,7 July 2011
Flight," Examines the inner battle of an airline pilot and his alcohol and drug dependency.
","I suppose the first question many of us might have after seeing this movie, 'I wonder if one of my flights ever had a drunken Captain in charge?'We have known for a long time that Denzel Washington is one of our finer actors, but many of his roles don't really require him to stretch very much. This one does, and it is no surprise that he has been nominated for 'Best Actor' in this role.He is Whip Whitaker , former military pilot and now for some years a very good and very well-respected airline pilot. On this day he is flying from Florida to Atlanta, a fairly short flight leaving at 9AM, he didn't really sleep the night before, having his own personal booze and sex party with one of the flight attendants. He nearly oversleeps but gives himself a 'kick' by doing two lines of cocaine.Now that's not a very good vision of how airline pilots prepare for work, but we DO hear periodically that a drunken pilot is removed from the cockpit, fortunately right before the flight leaves.But Whip is an artist at the controls, he pulls a non-approved maneuver right after takeoff to fly through a seam in the severe weather, then hands the controls to his young co-pilot, one he has never flown with before, and takes a nap. Only to be abruptly awakened when a loud thump is heard and they lose the ability to control the plane.As has been widely publicized via trailers for the film, the only way Whip could hope to salvage the plane was to invert it, so the 'dive' would turn into a 'climb' and achieve 'level' via throttle control. The crash landing in a pasture outside Atlanta only resulted in 6 deaths among the 102 on board. Whip was a hero.All this transpires during the first few minutes of the movie, which runs just over 2 hours. The flight and crash-land are only there to set up the real story, whether Whip can ever admit he has a problem with alcohol and drugs, and whether he can ever pull himself out of it. There was no question about the cause, the investigation pointed to improper maintenance, failure to replace a control-surface screw in a timely manner, and its failure in flight caused the problem. Nine other pilots were asked to try to pull the same airplane rescue in simulators, none of them could. Whip really was a hero, had any other pilot been in charge all 102 likely would have died.But there was still that matter of alcohol and drugs found in a sample of Whip's blood, and the several empty small bottles of vodka that were unexplained.The movie, by Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Romancing the Stone, Cast Away, and many others) is very well structured and acting is top-notch. A very worthwhile film about drug and alcohol demons and how difficult they are to slay.SPOILERS: With the help of a good lawyer and some testing irregularities, Whip appeared ready to escape legal consequences. All the had to do is testify that he suspected his flight attendant girlfriend, who died in the crash, has consumed the alcohol. He would be free. But his conscience finally kicked in, he was tired of lying his way through life, told the truth, and as the movie ends he is in prison running an AA group, and in a visit seems perhaps on the way to a better relationship with his teenage son.",Null,2,3,14 February 2013
Unbroken," Based on the true story, Olympian and Japanese prison camp survivor.
","This is just a real good story about a really good and brave man during World War Two. He went on to survive and live a very long life, dying in 2014 at the age of 97, but this movie is specific to the war years. Jack O'Connell plays Louis Zamperini who was born to Italian immigrants and as a young boy had a natural ability to run fast and actually represented the USA as a teenager in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. In his early 20s when WW2 broke out he was a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Surviving hazardous bombing runs, a plane he was in went down at sea on the way to do a rescue. After 47 days at sea they were rescued, but by the Japanese and sent to prison camp.Most of the movie is Zamperini's survival, 'unbroken', during his two years in prison camp. Takamasa Ishihara plays the unmerciful head of the camp, Watanabe. He was a brutal man and as this story goes he took a particular interest in the 'Olympian' and took every opportunity he had to try to break him, but Zamperini always got up and continued on.We are also told that Zamperini later in life returned to Japan and looked up as many of his captors as he could so that they could make mutual amends, but that Watanabe refused to meet with him.",Null,3,4,7 May 2015
Rear Window," Considered one of Hitchcok's best, comes across a bit dated in the 21st century.
","Generally considered one of the best of all time, 'Rear Window' is a very simple story filmed in the Hitchcock manner to provide suspense.  I rate it '8' of 10.  Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a world-traveling photographer confined for several weeks to his Greenwich Village apartment by a broken leg and cast up to the hip. He soon spends all his waking hours watching his apartment neighbors across the courtyard through his rear window, using binoculars and the telephoto lens and camera. Eye-candy is provided by 25-year-old Grace Kelly, in the same year she made 'Dial M for Murder', and only a few years before she became Grace of Monaco. (Current starlet Julie Bowen of TV series 'Ed' looks amazingly like Grace Kelly).As Jeff watched neighbors, he becomes suspicious of one (Raymond Burr), a salesman with a wheelchair-bound wife who disappears suddenly on a rainy night. Clues he pieces together from his voyerism convinces him that she was murdered.  The police help only reluctantly, and Kelly actually goes into Burr's apartment at one point, is caught, is threatened, until police show up.  Burr in the final scene tries to throw Stewart out the window, is nabbed, Stewart falls, and the very final scene shows him in casts on both legs!To accurately rate a film you have to compare it not only to what came out during the same era, but also everything since. With that criteria, I don't believe 'Rear Window' is one of the best of all time.  Still, a pretty good flick.",Null,4,8,2 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," What a long, long movie! Pretty to watch, a bit boring to endure.
","DVD, widescreen version, surround sound, big screen HDTV. So, it was almost like being in the theater. This final of the trilogy of LOTR movies is fitting but, like the others, a bit too ambitious in trying to cram in most of the contents of the books to please all the 'ringheads'. As a result, the story drags a bit in many places. And, when the climax comes, it is all a bit too cartoonish for my tastes. As in the other installments, the picture and sound are first-rate, some may call them 'reference quality.' The acting and directing are good, but perhaps they try to take this fairy tale a bit too seriously. It would be akin to taking Tom and Jerry cartoons seriously. Still, I am glad that I have the whole set of DVDs, I plan to re-watch certain scenes from time to time, but probably not the whole movie.I will give them to my great grandchildren, and they will wonder, 'What's a DVD?'SPOILERS follow, for my recollection. As in the first movie, here I got bored with the huge, drawn-out battle scenes. What may work fine in our minds as we read a detailed book is presented in far too much length and detail in the movie. Second, there seems to be a bit too much reliance on viewers knowing something about the 'books.' For example, at the end (SPOILERS!!) when Frodo has to leave The Shire, we are not sure why, and that is such an important piece of the story. From what I now understand, his having been a bearer of the 'One Ring' placed him in a special category, eligible for a place across the waters which is a sort of 'heaven' where he can get R&R from his crusade to return the ring. Something he just could not get in The Shire. MORE SPOILERS: Another thing about the 'cartoon' aspect of the story. As we all know, when Frodo is at the mountain of fire, in such close proximity to the heat and sulfur fumes, he may have lasted 2 or 3 seconds at the most. We know from everything prior that he is normally mortal, a giant spider stings him, he gets cuts and abrasions to his face and torso, in essence having normal vulnerabilities. So, by rights he should also have burned up in the close proximity to the volcano, but doesn't even seem particularly hot. Which signals that the whole series of movies are cartoonish in basis, not to be taken too seriously.",Null,3,12,26 June 2004
Pitch Perfect," I was thoroughly entertained, lots of music and lots of laughs.
","This story is nominally about college A Cappella groups, but that is not what it really is about. It is about young people realizing what is important in life and relationships, and the participation in the singing groups is just the vehicle.Having said that, I am a fan of singing and a fan of the TV show 'Glee', and while 'Pitch Perfect' is a far cry from 'Glee' I enjoyed it on about the same level. Anna Kendrick who was already a star as a singer on Broadway when she was a teenager is Beca, who doesn't really want to go to college but her dad makes her, he is affiliated with the college and she gets a free education. But she really wants to go to Hollywood and maker her career in music production.At college she meets Skylar Astin as Jesse, and they both end up working as interns at the college radio station. They get friendly quickly, but Beca pushes back when it seems they will get closer.Brittany Snow is one of the singers in the girls group, Chloe, but the leader of the group is Anna Camp as the senior, Aubrey , just wanting one more chance to go to Nationals at the Lincoln Center and hopefully win. She is an unyielding task master, who rejects any input from others, and this causes a rift.My favorite is Australian Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy (that's what she calls herself), she has such good comedic timing and great facial expressions. (Her real name is Rebel, she has siblings Liberty and Ryot.)A fun, fun movie, but not for viewers who don't enjoy lots of singing. My wife said the campus looked familiar, as it turns out it was filmed at LSU, where she was a student 40 years earlier!SPOILERS: The girls group is set to lose again, but a disqualification of another team with a non-college member gets them to Nationals. Aubrey gives in to good sense, she allows Beca to incorporate novel performance elements, and they win.",Null,0,1,8 January 2013
The Truman Show," A truly novel concept, well-executed, a fine Jim Carrey performance, I rate '8' of 10.
","First off, a logical individual knows the whole premise of 'The Truman Show' could never happen, just like 'Being John Malkovich' could never happen. A 'world' entirely encased in a very large dome, with a large lake and even sunrise, sunset, and weather!  So we must look for a deeper meaning to this film. To me, it is a re-statement of the old saw 'it is better to be free and risk the perils of life than to be confined and protected in an artificial world.'  (Hmmm ... maybe that applies to wild animals too - maybe we should abolish zoos!?) Carrey's character, Truman, as a 30-yr-old adult whose life has been a live TV show, 24/7, for 30 years. It started with 'one' camera, but now there are over 5,000 in Truman's world. He begins to suspect his world is not real, that all the friends and aquaintances are actors, that his whole life is 'just a TV show!' This is revealed fairly early in the film, and the rest of the film we watch the development of his understanding of his situation, and eventually his plan to 'escape', or die trying.  Just like the chickens in the more recent film, 'Chicken Run.'A renegade actor tells him it is all a fake. He studies an old photo of his wedding and sees his wife's fingers are crossed.  He changes his daily routine and sees a fake elevator in one building. He begins to notice that the same people, cars, and bicycles simply go around the blocks and repeat. A funny scene, which you can only appreciate if you've been in a film as a cast member or extra, the 'directors' tell all the people in the street, 'first positions, everyone', and they all hold their positions, waiting for 'action.'In an interview with the reclusive 'Christo' (Ed Harris) he explains that Truman was one of 5 unwanted babies due to be born, and he was selected because his birth was at the right time, nothing else. He had a pretend dad who later pretended to drown, as a way to make Truman scared of water and hopefully prevent his exploring too widely.  Was it cruel for a corporation to adopt this baby, then use him for a show? Christo's p.o.v. was that Truman had a much better life this way. The film is very well done, and Carrey does some of his best work here in a 'serious' role. The preise is fascinating, and the way it is depicted remains very interesting all the way to the end. I rate it a very strong '8' of 10.",Null,0,1,12 February 2001
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," If you can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with.
","This is the second in the series of 'Hunger Games' movies based on the books. My wife read them, I didn't. We saw this one last night on Blu- Ray, about a year and a half after we saw the first one. The Blu-Ray picture and sound are quite good, it gave my subwoofer a good work out.All the main characters are back, played by the same actors. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, Willow Shields as Primrose Everdeen, Donald Sutherland as President Snow, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket.In this episode a year has passed, it is the 75th hunger games, the yearly event to remind all of the failed revolution. But Snow is still unhappy how the prior one ended, with Katniss and Peeta both surviving, by threatening to eat the poison berries. Snow wants Katniss dead, but wants it to happen in a way for all to see. So they change the rule, the tributes this year will be chosen only from among the prior victors. This of course is a big betrayal because victors had all been promised a free life after their own hunger games.So this one is about the competition and the alliances, Snow determined they will die, Katniss determined she and Peeta will survive.Frankly, much of the middle I found a bit tedious, the parts where all the contestants were in the domed forest and had to face various dangers. It just didn't seem interesting to me. I had a lot more interest in the opening scenes leading up to the actual competition, and the closing scenes. Still, a good movie, worth the watch.SPOILERS: As it turned out several behind the scenes were conspiring to make sure Katniss and Peeta survived, and in fact when it was all done they described it as the start of the revolution. Not only does Katniss survive, plus Peeta and several others, she managed to shoot an arrow, with copper wire attached, into the roof as an artificial lightning bolt hit a tree on schedule, this destroyed the dome and structure came raining down. She and the others were rescued and nursed back to health.",Null,0,10,8 March 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'Guys, your report had better be something special.' (Bill and Ted's History teacher)
","I bought the DVD, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', to mail to my son and daughter who were teenagers in 1989 and were fans. But I had to watch it first, and I am amazed what a fine film this is. The two boys, Bill and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are slackers on the order of Jeff Spicoli in 'Fast Times', but they have a latent streak of goodness to them. Fearing they will flunk history, in which case Ted would be sent to military school in Alaska and their band 'Wyld Stallions' will be broken up, the human race from 700 years in the future sends back Rufus (George Carlin) in a time machine that looks just like a phone booth. Seems that our race has learned to travel via the 'circuits of history' and can go anywhere, any time, by dialing the proper number. Why are they doing this? Seems the 'Wyld Stallions' are destined to become the most popular musical group in history, and their music calms the savage beasts and brings peace all over the Earth. Their survival as a group means survival of the human race. So, they travel and retrieve such diverse historical figures as Billy the Kid, Ghengis Kahn, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Socrates, Ludwig von Beethoven, and Abraham Lincoln. All of which results in the final presentation at school, and which earns them an 'A+' with Lincoln delivering the final speech, urging everyone to 'be excellent to everyone' and 'party on.'In some respects this is just a silly movie, but one done very well, with an inspired script and good acting. The overall message of redemption is very appropriate and the idea of school kids learning history by actually being there, though impossible, is admirable. The DVD picture is very good for a film of this vintage. It has Dolby 5.1 sound, but it does not actually surround you like modern films do. Overall one of the finer comedies I have seen, and I feel sorely underrated.",Null,1,2,28 November 2002
The Matrix," One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!
","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.This is a review of 'The Matrix' on DVD.If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a '10'. It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the 'extra' features are a big reason to buy the DVD.One 'extra' is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.Another 'extra' is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the 'behind the scenes' shooting. Then the movie resumes.There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of 'extras' I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!",Null,10,21,30 September 1999
Godzilla," Godzilla, benevolent monster saves the world.
","To me when you watch a movie like this, 'Godzilla', you don't intend to take it too seriously. It is all fantasy, the best that I can hope is to be entertained.I was entertained! Part of the entertainment for me is the soundtrack. I saw it on DVD in my own home theater, well-equipped with a powered subwoofer that goes down into the 18Hz range. This movie has such an aggressive deep bass soundtrack that pictures on the wall were rattling and the hair on my arms standing up. It really feels like you are in the action, a bit scary at times.The movie itself? It plays off the 1954 Godzilla where nuclear tests in the Pacific were responsible for Godzilla. But this story takes a bit different tack. Godzilla has been around, lurking below the surface, for all that time. The military knew about it but kept it from the public.Now in modern times there are a couple of strange events and the result are giant, like 200 to 300 feet tall, monsters that look like giant insects and fly. Plus they feed off radioactive materials. There is a male and a female and they plan to mate. If left unchecked they will reproduce and soon the whole world will be theirs.So it is up to Godzilla to restore order. A very interesting, action-packed, thrilling, two hours.And did I mention a great, deep bass sound track?July 2015 update: I viewed it again after 10 months and enjoyed it even more. All the harsh criticism from some quarters is unfounded.Jan 2016: Watched it again, still enjoyed it as good entertainment.",Null,5,9,4 October 2014
Shall We Dance," So, who doesn't have some sort of mid-life crisis?
","Richard Gere is John Clark, competent Chicago attorney, appears to specialize in drawing up wills for his clients. He is happily married to Beverly (Susan Sarandon), and has the 'ideal' family, a teenage boy and a teenage girl. Every evening he takes the 'El' home and looks out the window, and if we could crawl into his head might hear him thinking, 'Is this all there is?' One day he notices a dance studio out his train window, and he wonders. He sees beautiful Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) wistfully gazing out the window. One day he decides to investigate, the sign says 'You are welcome to watch', so he goes in. I'm not sure there is any message in this movie, but I had a great feeling of joy watching these adult men dance. No sex, no murders, and only one curse word. An entertaining 100 minutes.SPOILERS. For some reason John decides to take ballroom dancing lessons weekly without ever mentioning it to his wife or children. That seems unusual to me, but I suppose sometimes a husband or wife just feels they want to do something as an individual rather than as a family. He is obviously attracted to Paulina, but we never get the impression that he is considering cheating on his marriage. He learns to dance, while Beverly gets suspicious and hires a PI to see what he is up to. At the dance competition, the PI tells his wife and daughter, they go, cheer dad on, who freaks out and freezes, dropping his partner, when he realizes they are there. But all ends well as he inspires Paulina to return to England to work seriously for competition, and the dancing gives John a new joy in life. John shows up at Beverly's work, with a red rose and an intention to teach her to dance.John taking dance lessons and entering a formal competition without ever telling his wife seems, to me, a bit far-fetched. However, it is an entertaining movie and all ends well.",Null,0,0,19 February 2005
Looper," Futuristic thriller where the crooks control time travel.
","I mostly watch movies for entertainment. I like this one because it is very entertaining. After seeing literally thousands of movies I am always glad to see something novel, something never done before. Set mostly in 2044 Kansas, but filmed mostly in the sugar cane fields of Louisiana, the actors and characters are first-rate. But it is not a movie to be watched casually, paying half-attention. It is easy to miss something and get confused.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Young Joe, sent from the future, a 'looper' whose only job is to be at a certain place at a certain time, and using an old-fashioned blunderbuss kill the hooded person sent via time-travel from 30 years in the future. Since time-travel has been outlawed these are always criminals that need disposal without a trace. That is, if they are executed 30 years earlier, in essence they never existed. The dead person has silver bars attached to his back, the looper takes this as payment for his services. If he executes his old self, he gets gold bars then is free to travel and live for 30 years.One day Bruce Willis as Old Joe shows up, unhooded and unbound, sent from the future to be terminated. They called this 'closing the loop.' But when Young Joe recognizes his older self he hesitates, and Old Joe gets the best of him and runs away. Now both of them are in trouble with the mob, and the rest of the film has them both on the run to survive. It gets really interesting when they start to meet face-to-face. But Old Joe also has a mission, his wife was killed because of the 'Rainmaker' and now he has a code that will allow him to track down the young boy who will become the future Rainmanker and kill him to preserve things in the future, where the Rainmaker is also closing all loops!A very interesting movie for those who enjoy a good time-travel fantasy and can overlook some possible disconnects. But you have to pay attention!SPOILERS FOLLOW: Soon after we see the Young and Old Joe encounter, we see what amounts to a flashback, to a time 30 years earlier where Young Joe actually does kill Old Joe, collects his gold bars, and travels to China where he spends his money and grows old, turns to a life of more crime when he goes broke, meets his wife, and then gets rounded up to be sent back for execution. But he escapes, takes off the hood, and returns with plans to hunt down the child who will become the Rainmaker. They find Emily Blunt as Sara who has a 5-yr-old boy, Pierce Gagnon, really very good as Cid with extreme TK powers, and who we eventually learn is destined to become the Rainmaker, as a direct result of seeing his mother killed and then not being nurtured properly. At the climax in the cane field, while Old Joe is trying to kill both Cid and Sara, Young Joe realizes the solution, so he shoots himself through the heart, Old Joe disappears, Sara and Cid survive.",Null,0,3,29 January 2013
Life," The terror of finding LIFE from Mars.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are great, I have a powered subwoofer in my sound system and this track really shook the room in certain scenes.I am a scientist and I pay moderate attention to advancements in astronomy. For years there has been a high interest in the question 'Is there life elsewhere in the universe'? Just from a 'probability' perspective, with billions of galaxies and each having billions of stars, and untold numbers of stars with planets around them much like our own Solar System, one point of view is that we would have to be very arrogant to believe we Earthlings are the only intelligent life. The story here involves a six-person crew on the ISS (space station orbiting Earth) receiving an unmanned pod that had gone to Mars and took soil samples. The crew, which included a doctor, were to conduct tests to determine if the soil samples had any component of life. The production values are superb, the actors are experienced and good. The real star of the story becomes the alien life form that grows from a soil sample. In a contest back on Earth school kids get to name it and this alien life form becomes known as 'Calvin.' Calvin never makes a sound but as 'he' grows and develops the crew face bigger and bigger challenges to keep it contained. We really enjoyed the movie, it makes one think of possible consequences as we get closer and closer to actually doing something like this.MAJOR SPOILERS: The life form continues to grow and develop, it has to kill for its nourishment, in the end only two remain, they decide to protect Earth by coaxing 'Calvin' into one of the escape pods with one astronaut and he would aim it to deep space, sacrificing himself to protect Earth. The other pod would reenter to Earth after the ISS had been destroyed. 'Calvin' had become so intelligent that 'he' overpowered the astronaut and directed to pod to re enter to Earth and as the movie ends we see some Asian fishermen coming to his rescue, opening the hatch. Will 'Calvin' and his progeny take over the Earth?",Null,0,3,7 July 2017
Heat," The LAPD put the 'heat' on a group of professional robbers.
","I somehow missed this movie back in the 1990s when it was popular. Recently my public library bought the BluRay version and that is what I watched. It is filled with first-rate actors and for the most part is a very gripping police and crime drama.Al Pacino is Lt. Vincent Hanna, very dedicated and focused on catching crooks and putting them away. His main nemesis is Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, the leader of a well-organized band of big- time robbers. Among his gang are Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis, and Tom Sizemore as Michael Cheritto. A fixer, the kind of person who can make connections and get fake credentials is Jon Voight as Nate. All of them are good but the real focus of the movie are the Pacino and De Niro characters. In fact about half-way they meet face-to- face in a restaurant, each makes it known to the other that they intend to accomplish their missions, and we know both can't succeed.Also good are the ladies, Diane Venora as Justine Hanna, the wife who has a hard time coping with her husband's duties. And Amy Brenneman as Eady, who McCauley falls for, making his exit more difficult.SPOILERS: The big bank heist at the end, where the robbers carry out several large cases of paper money, is almost foiled but in a massive (and unrealistic) shootout in the street the robbers manage to get away. But Hanna is still looking to find an informant, he is certain that the crooks have a plan to leave L.A. for parts unknown.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic when it first came out and now, still a 'classic' almost 30 years later on DVD.
","My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",Null,2,3,7 October 2004
Footloose," Remake filmed in Georgia instead of Utah.
","To state the obvious there seldom is a need, from the point of view of the audience, to remake an old favorite. But old favorites are remade all the time so let's judge it on entertainment value, without regard to a possible comparison to the original.The basic story is unchanged, a tragedy that kills a group of high school seniors in a small close-knit community sparks very restrictive laws on how you can play music and where you can dance. Plus a very early curfew. A teenager enters the community from a different background, takes an interest in the local preacher's daughter, then takes it upon himself to challenge the restrictive laws.The main reason for the remake seems to be to showcase a couple of talented young actor/dancers. Kenny Wormald is Ren , the new guy from Boston. (He really is from Boston.) He likes to work on cars and when he gets frustrated he likes to work it out by very vigorous dancing. (He really is an accomplished dancer.) Julianne Hough, who has done so well with several partners on 'Dancing With The Stars' (a show I don't watch) and who has achieved some success as a singer plays the part of Ariel , the preacher's daughter. She really is a cutie pie, the camera just loves her, plus she has a very nice and natural acting style. There are also several other good actors, like Dennis Quaid as the preacher, but the story revolves around Ren and Ariel. It is a pleasant enough diversion of a movie, my wife and I were entertained.Did I mention that Julianne Hough is a real cutie pie??",Null,0,3,27 March 2012
Deadpool," Comic book turned movie, lots of inventive action and a great sound track.
","We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. I am not familiar with the source comic book. The movie is rated R for a good reason, the main character has a very filthy potty mouth, but it fits his character. Plus a few shots of bare-chested women.This is an origin story. Ryan Reynolds is Wade, always a bit of a loose canon. At his favorite bar is a list on a chalkboard, a 'dead pool', predicting who will be the next to get killed. Wade is with his girlfriend when he collapses, at the clinic his doctor informs him he has cancer, but in three places he doesn't need - his brain, his lungs, and his prostate.He meets a man who says he can 'fix' him, Wade has no choice and submits. He ends up being tortured in various ways, it is an attempt to make the hidden beast in him come out. When he finally escapes he is disfigured but has gained some pretty impressive strength and fighting skills, plus his cancer is gone. He can't go openly as Wade anymore, so takes the name 'Deadpool.'His nemesis is Ed Skrein as Ajax, and his girlfriend is Morena Baccarin as Vanessa. Can he defeat Ajax and get his girl back?The action is impressive, including the opening ultra slo-mo shot of Deadpool and others in a roll-over car accident on a bridge. And, where appropriate the deep bass worked over my subwoofer and rattled the walls.Overall a very entertaining movie, for those who can get past the constant filthy language.

The Replacements," 'There is no tomorrow for you, and that makes you very dangerous people.'
","Those are the words of coach (Hackman) before the final regular season game for the 'replacement' players, filling in for the striking regulars.  The 'never-been' QB (Keanu Reeves) must try to lead them to victory.'The Replacements' is primarily a good screwball comedy, in the vein of, but significantly better than, 'Best of Show' and 'The Waterboy.' Some may even take a 'message' away, about the importance of teamwork, belief in oneself, true love (QB and the head cheerleader). But that is all secondary.I rate this one highly for pure escapism entertainment, but also with good acting by Reeves and Hackman, and some almost-believable football action, heavily interlaced with goofiness.  The lap-dancers turned cheerleaders, who totally distract the opposing team. The tag-team vomiting during the huddle, after the Japanese sumo wrestler eats too many eggs before the game ('I gotta beef up!') The cop who, like in the 'Waterboy', can get enraged (Coach says, 'I want you to get me the ball,' and he does.) The Welsh kicker who is 'wirr-rrry strong' and smokes a cigarette while kicking. The 'I will survive' dance in jail, after the barroom brawl with the 'regulars.'To make a good screwball comedy, the writer and director have to walk a fine line and here they do it well.  John Madden and Pat Summerall, playing announcers, are genuinely funny. The DVD picture, and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, are up to standards.",Null,36,43,30 June 2001
Cloud Atlas," Our lives are not our own, we are bound to others, past and present.
","I almost watched this movie twice, on DVD. And yes, it really helps to turn on the 'subtitles' for many scenes, otherwise it is virtually impossible to make out what they are saying. I had watched the first 90 minutes then put it away for a week, started at the beginning and just watched it all the way through.The great and late critic Roger Ebert saw 'Cloud Atlas' more than once, and this paragraph from his review sums it up very well for many of us:(Ebert) (quote)I was never, ever bored by 'Cloud Atlas.' On my second viewing, I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters. What was important was that I set my mind free to play. Clouds do not really look like camels or sailing ships or castles in the sky. They are simply a natural process at work. So too, perhaps, are our lives. Because we have minds and clouds do not, we desire freedom. That is the shape the characters in 'Cloud Atlas' take, and how they attempt to direct our thoughts. Any concrete, factual attempt to nail the film down to cold fact, to tell you what it 'means,' is as pointless as trying to build a clockwork orange.(unquote)I had read that before I watched the movie, and that is pretty much the approach I took. It is long, but I was never bored, always anxious to see what would come next. One of the stories had an old composer and his young assistant working on the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet', said to be a beautiful piece of music that some characters in other time periods seemed to be familiar with. Also the appearance in various time periods of a very distinctive birth mark. Perhaps it is all part of what one character says, 'Our lives are not our own, from womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present.' As the credits roll, each actor is shown as each of the 4, 5, or 6 different characters they play in the movie. The makeup and costuming are so good that in many cases I had no idea. Some of the male actors even played female roles, and some of the female actors played male roles. All in all a very nice movie experience. DVD from my public library.",Null,4,6,23 June 2013
Thirteen Days," A fabulous film. Just fabulous.
","I know exactly where I was in October of 1962. I was a senior at a small high school in Louisiana and we were more worried about our thus-far undefeated football season than we were about the cold war. In fact, I only vaguely remember the 'Cuban Missle Crisis.'  The year before, our team had won state championship for our small school division, and in 1962 we were ranked first in state, until South Cameron beat us, just barely, in our last game.  Since WW III didn't actually occur that fateful month of 1962, we can still have fond memories of that football season that almost was fabulous.
As we now look back, the outcome of the Cuban Missle Crisis may have been the most significant event of the second half of the 20th century, and ultimately the beginnings of the end of the cold war. In 'Thirteen Days' we see the still young, first-term president Jack Kennedy, with help from his brother Bobby and his close advisor Kenny O'Donnell, attempt to strike a balance between the military leaders who only need a little incentive to invade Cuba, and his own morals which believes there is a diplomatic solution. The fact that they pulled it off, and got the Soviets to back down, is perhaps the reason we are all here.This film does a great job of re-creating those 13 days, and the stress everyone involved was under. The DVD is fine if unremarkable, except it has a very nice set of extras, including historical timelines of the missle crisis, and profiles of the actual players in the 1962 war dance.  Because of the significance of the story, and how well made this film is, it is one of the few I rate 10/10.",Null,1,1,29 November 2002
300," Excellent in style, but the actual movie didn't interest me that much.
","This movie, '300', is a retelling of the 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas defends Greece with only 300 highly trained warriors. His opponent is the Persian Xerxes who has an army of thousands.The movie begins with Leonidas as a young boy, and shows how boys were brought up to be warriors. Gerard Butler, of 'Phantom' fame, plays King Leonidas. Lena Headey is his queen Gorgo, and the earlier scenes contain some good interactions between them.Judging from a photo of an old painting of the battle, the costumes used in this movie are fairly authentic. I like the style of the movie, which in many respects reminded me of the style of 'Sin City.' The depiction of the fighting is fierce, with heads and body parts flying as the warriors fight the enemy.Overall while I enjoyed it at an entertainment level, otherwise the movie didn't touch me.",Null,2,5,7 August 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Mostly entertaining but taken down by pervasive filthy language.
","What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world's population. If it had been less 'dirty' it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.DVD from my public library.",Null,3,9,12 July 2015
Cube," 'There is no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan. Big brother is not watching you.'
","SPOILERS - 'Cube' is a very interesting film, once you get past the first 30 minutes, but I don't consider it a very good film. We never do find out how this assortment of characters get into the cube in the first place. However, by 'chance' we have a young lady who is a math and geometry genius, man who is an idiot savant and able to factor very large numbers just by looking at them, and the designer of the outer shell of the cube. And those talents, in concert, are the key to finding a way out of the cube. If, as the designer says, it is a 'headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan', then the coincidence would be too great to be credible.  This film doesn't purport to be a fantasy, like 'Matrix' or 'Pleasantville', so we are left to assume it attempts to represent a possible reality.  It doesn't work.Still, there are some moments of tension, as they try to survive and travel from cube to cube, hoping to find a way out. My favorite was when they found the blue room with traps activated by sound. So everything became silent as each in turn worked his or her way to the opposite door.  I was even afraid to make a noise. The key, of course, comes when they figure out the the 17,576 cubes (26 on each edge) are moving relative to each other, and they get into the only one which will have a 'bridge to the outside.'  Only the idiot savant escapes, as the others are either killed or otherwise incapacitated. I think the film ultimately fails on two levels. First, we aren't able to have empathy for any of the characters. Second, although the premise is interesting, the writer and director had no meaningful way to pull everything into any kind of satisfying conclusion. Coming up with an idea is easy, all of us can do that, but to wrap up the story is a whole different complexity and, unfortunately, far too few professional filmmakers are up to the task.  About '4' or '5' is the right IMDb rating for this film.",Null,7,13,30 December 2001
Tarzan," One of the most entertaining movies, ever!
","Imagine six 50-something and 60-something men and women watching this version of 'Tarzan' (Disney, animated)on DVD and at the end, some of them saying 'that is the best movie I have ever seen.' Well, I can't personally say it was *the best* I've ever seen, but for sheer entertainment there haven't been many better.The story is very familiar to most of us, and this version sticks to the tried and true (!) very well.  The novelty are in the eye-popping Disney animation, the humorous script, and the 'delivery' of the lines by the various celebrity voices. I bought the DVD because I want to watch it periodically, and also with my grandchildren as they grow up.The 'extras' on the DVD are really fine. Recording of the 'Trashing the Camp' music is featured, plus a few other equally interesting features.  The best being a film 'short' of the animated Disney feature 'Dinosaur' slated for release in May 2000.  I'm going to buy that one too!I gave this movie a solid '9' of '10' for sheer enjoyment.",Null,5,6,16 May 2000
Easy A," Smart high school comedy with the talented Emma Stone.
","Emma Stone is Olive, student at North Ojai High School, just northwest of Los Angeles, where they grow lots of oranges. Although that is not germane to the story. By her own analysis, so far she has gone through high school without getting noticed. By anyone, not even the guidance counselor.Then, one day just to shut up her best friend who persists on asking her about a date she never had (a pretend date to avoid have to spend a weekend with her friend's family) she tells her that he is a college guy and they slept together.All of that was false but with twitter and instant messaging everyone at school got the news right away, after the conversation was overheard by staunch Christian girl Amanda Bynes as Marianne.So suddenly, Olive's anonymity disappears, all the girls look at her with suspicion, and all the guys want to score with her. Instead of quelling all that right away, she sort of enjoys the attention and runs with it.Thomas Haden Church is her favorite teacher, Mr. Griffith. They are reading and discussing 'The Scarlet Letter' and Olive picks up on that theme, often wearing a scarlet 'A' on her chest. Patricia Clarkson is Olive's sort of crazy mom. Lisa Kudrow is the guidance counselor, Mrs. Griffith, and also wife of the Literature teacher. And they even dragged in old Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons.Emma Stone is really good, on the verge of becoming a star, perhaps the star Linsey Lohan would have become if she hadn't screwed up her life. And the writing is very smart. A nice entertaining movie overall. SPOILERS: Eventually Olive's 'reputation' got too far, and a classmate asked her out to actually pay her, with a $200 gift certificate, for sex. She dispatched him in the parking lot of the restaurant, spurning his advances, and was given a ride home by an old friend, now the school mascot. It turned out both of them had secret crushes on each other since the 8th grade, and now that things were cleared up with Olive's webcam broadcast, she and the boy were destined to be together.",Null,1,1,11 January 2011
Apollo 13," An American classic, gripping from beginning to end.
","What can I say about an almost perfect Ron Howard movie about the most exciting near tragedy involving men in space?  It is just a fine movie through and through. The fact that it is a true story just makes it all the better.I saw the DVD version, which has several 'extras', including their techniques for simulating the rocket launch scenes.  Also most instructional was the featurette showing how they used the 'vomit comet' (simulates weightlessness) to shoot all the scenes of men floating in the spaceships. Very innovative movie-making.All in all one of the best movies of all time, deserves to be in the top 100.",Null,1,4,12 May 2000
Fast Five," Guilty pleasure, the plot and action are absurd but it is fun to watch them.
","The action begins with a bold heist, a bus carrying dangerous criminals to another prison. The target is to bust out Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto. The man behind the plan is his buddy, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. Where to go, to avoid capture? How about Rio De Janiero? That is where most of the rest of the movie is set.But the USA doesn't forgive criminals and heists very easily, and their best man, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Luke Hobbs, who brings along his best team, arrive to capture the criminals.That wouldn't generate much in the way of an interesting story, were it not for the third leg of the criminal triangle, a local drug and crime boss. So much of the action and intrigue ends up with both Toretto's group and Hobbs' group getting the best of the crime boss and his gang.The action is 'over the top', with the shooting and car chases. Of particular mention is the theft of the large bank safe containing crime money (the local police were allies) , by pulling it through busy streets and freeways with cables tied to two cars. Maneuver those correctly and the large safe is an effective battering ram.But most fun for me was seeing the two tough-guy actors, Diesel and Johnson, go at each other.SPOILERS: After they got the best of the crooks, and managed to open the safe, it was empty. Toretto's gang managed to pull a switch during the chase and the safe full of $$Millions was in their possession. From mutual respect, Hobbs gave Toretto a head start before resuming his mission to capture him. Which sets up nicely for the next sequel.",Null,0,2,13 November 2011
The Thin Red Line," A good 'war' movie, I give it 7 of 10,
","I have heard quite a bit that Thin Red Line is a better war movie than Saving Private Ryan.  Not for me.  It doesn't have as much action, and is more of a study of how war affected the characters in different ways. Although I enjoyed it, I found my mind wandering quite a bit.  For me, a war movie has to have almost non-stop action, and Private Ryan did that for me.",Null,0,6,7 September 1999
Green Book," Inspired by the real 1962 musical tour down South.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on BluRay from our public library. This movie recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Ali won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The lead role is Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, a New York bouncer of Italian descent. His club is closing for the last two months of 1962 and he is recommended as the driver for a black musician, a pianist, who is going on a tour, a series of performances, in various Deep South locations.Mahershala Ali is in the role of Dr. Donald Shirley, who was a real jazz and concert pianist who over his career played in many high-profile venues. In 1962 he has planned this musical trip to hopefully change some perceptions about black musicians. Having a tough bodyguard as a driver will help insure his safety.The title is a reference to a book which is a guide to where blacks can eat or sleep in southern locations, in 1962 the Deep South was mostly still segregated, blacks could not stay or eat and many locations.As the writer, one of Tony Lip's sons, reveals, the story is only regarding that particular trip and he says the input comes from Ali himself some years earlier, and of course his dad. It is a story of how two men from greatly different backgrounds and world views became friends. Ironically both men died in 2013.Good movie.",Null,1,3,23 March 2019
Honey," 'Honey', a rose growing in concrete.
","A bunch of very mean IMDb voters gave this movie a '1' vote. It is not that bad a movie. Mostly trite and predictable, it features a cute Jessica Alba and a heartwarming story of inner city kids getting a chance through hip-hop dance. Its most reasonable rating is around '5'.  SPOILERS - Honey (Alba) is a natural dancer and choreographer, gets ideas by watching street kids, such things as playing basketball or jumping rope, but has trouble getting dancing jobs. Music video director sees her on TV, seeks her out at her job as a bartender, gives her work, lets her show her talents as a choreographer, until he comes on to her at a party, she slaps him, he drops her and blackballs her, no one will hire her.

Fantastic Four," Mostly entertaining Stan Lee comics movie.
","When I am in the mood for escapist fun, movies from comic books is one of my favorite genres. Superman, Batman, Spiderman, X-Men, and a few others have all made into superbly entertaining movies. I am not familiar with the Fantastic 4, so I viewed this movie as a neophyte. I enjoyed it very nicely, especially because Jessica Alba is in it. I became a fan of hers in the Dark Angel TV series and, even though she isn't an outstanding actress, she does OK and is just great fun to watch. So the story here is 5 astronauts are on a mission when some sort of cosmic radiation cloud sweeps over them. At first, after they get back to base, it appears that no harm was done. However, eventually they all begin to change from 'altered DNA' such that they each develop a different 'fantastic power.' Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) had been on a space walk and thus was most exposed, so he became very heavy and very strong as a man who looks like a collection of small boulders. Sue Storm (Alba) gets the power to become invisible, her brother Johnny can burst into flames and fly by jet propulsion. Reed becomes elastic, can stretch long distances. But the 5th person, Victor Von Doom, becomes the evil villain. So much of the rest of the movie had the Fantastic 4 in battle against Von Doom who wants to eradicate them and be in sole power. SPOILERS. In a final showdown in the street, the four combine their powers to get Von Doom very hot, then quench him with water, to turn him into an immobile metal man. In the end we see him, a statue of sorts, being loaded into a shipping crate then sailing off to parts unknown, along with many other crates. However, we glimpse a sign of life from his crate, setting up the inevitable sequel.(Note: Kerry Washington who plays Alicia Masters looks so much like star Jerssica Alba, they could be twins.)",Null,0,1,2 January 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Third in the series, I rather enjoyed this one.
","It helps to have seen the first two, for continuity, but it is not essential. I am a bit surprised at its low rating, as I think it is a better movie than the second one.The news (in the movie) tells us there have been a rash of unexplained murders in the Seattle area. We soon find out that a rogue vampire is building an army. It does this by biting people who then get vampire attributes and, as we also learn, are the strongest when 'newborn' as a vampire. But why? The new character is pretty Bryce Dallas Howard as pretty, red-head vampire Victoria. She is out for revenge because her vampire boyfriend had been destroyed some time back, and her best revenge would be to destroy Bella. So the whole movie is about both the vampires and the werewolves in the Forks, Washington area protecting Bella.Kristen Stewart is of course back as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, and Taylor Lautner as werewolf Jacob Black. Each of them loves Bella and wants her for himself, each convinced that he would be the best for her. This creates some interesting, competitive situations.SPOILERS: During the third act the local vampires and werewolves cooperate to create a plan to protect Bella and to defeat the army of outside vampires. They succeed and Victoria is destroyed. Bella agrees to marry Edward, but still wants to become a vampire. Edward still resists. I suppose we will find out in the next movie.",Null,1,7,17 December 2010
Click," Mostly for Adam Sandler fans, has some entertaining parts.
","Adam Sandler is Michael Newman, architect, husband, and father who rarely seems to have time for everything he needs to do. Then, constantly confused by all the remotes in his house, decides to go shopping for a 'universal remote'. Inexplicably passing up the Best Buy store, and instead stopping at the 'Bed, Bath, and Beyond' store, goes in and asks to buy a remote. Of course they didn't have any, but Michael notices a door with the word 'BEYOND' above it. He enters, and finds 'Morty' inside, played superbly by always great Christopher Walken. Morty listens to his story and tells him they have this great new remote, and it is so new there isn't even a price on it. So Michael gets it free.Confused, Michael takes his remote home. The dog is barking too loudly so he playfully presses the volume control, and the dog's bark goes quiet. Later his wife Donne (terminally cute Kate Beckinsale) is arguing with him, he playfully presses the 'fast forward' and the argument is completed in very fast motion.So, Michael figures out he has a very special remote, as Morty explains, 'It controls the universe.' He begins to see ways to use it to make his life easier. The problem arises when he also finds out that it is a 'learning' remote -- it remembers his actions and eventually begins to execute functions on its own. Michael's life soon becomes controlled by the remote.Much of the first half of the movie is just the set-up, where Michael and we, the audience, find out what the rules of the game are. The second half takes a different turn, where Michael begins to regret that he is missing so much of his own life because of his selfishness.SPOILERS. At one point Michael falls asleep on a bed in the store, and when he wakes up finds himself back in current time where the movie started. But his experiences had not been a dream, and the remote is still with him. So this makes him change his approach to life, not putting work ahead of family, in all becomings a better person.",Null,0,1,14 October 2006
Pineapple Express," Way too much filthy language, but otherwise a fairly entertaining flick.
","This is a 'dumb' movie, in that it has a dumb story line and dumb characters. In that sense it has some similarities to 'Dumb and Dumber.' And while thinking about this movie I figured out why I don't like Will Ferrell dumb comedies, because Will Ferrell is not funny.Seth Rogen is funny, and his 'dumb' movies, like this one, work. Here he is Dale Denton who is a process server, who carries lots of different changes of clothes in his beat-up car, so that he can gain natural entry to where is to serve the papers.But aside from his job Dale's only existence seems to be as a stoner. He smokes pot before, during, and after his work day. James Franco as Saul Silver is his supplier, and who introduces Danny to the best of the best, called 'Pineapple Express.' Danny's story is kicked up a notch when, as he is getting ready to serve more papers, sees a cop go into the house, shots are fired, and he witnesses the target of his papers bing murdered in the second story of the house. He may have escaped just fine but he tosses the butt of his Pineapple Express out the window, and naturally it is found, allowing the dealer to track him and Saul down, since Saul was the only one to have it.Gary Cole is the drug dealer Ted Jones, and he was the one who shot the guy, along with his partner in crime, Rosie Perez as Carol - Female Cop.

Annihilation," Tragic forecast to life as we know it.
","I watched this at home on DVD. My wife looked at the trailer and decided she did not want to see it.Brought to us by the same man who brought us the excellent 'Ex Machina' I looked forward to seeing it, and I like many of the actors. It features something brought to Earth by alien life, and it is manifest as a 'shimmer' effect in and surrounding a lighthouse. In time it grows in the area it covers. The theme of the story plays on the fact that on Earth animal and plant life have their own DNA and own ways of cell division that results in, for example, an apple tree making apples and a human making humans. But what of that got jumbled such that different species were instead able to pool and share their characteristics? That is what this new force enables.Natalie Portman is Lena, her husband has been gone for a time, she doesn't know where, until he magically turns up. But he doesn't seem like the same person she knew. To try to solve the mystery of missing persons and to learn what exactly this 'shimmer' is all about she joins a group of four other ladies, mostly different types of scientists, to explore the 'shimmer' and see what they can find. Well they find all sorts of things and few of them are good. And in the end it seems that maybe in time this will trigger the annihilation of the species as we know them on Earth and eventually result in something completely different. Not necessarily bad or good, but different.Interesting concepts, I am glad I saw it, makes one think but in the end it is all science fiction. I still will sleep well tonight.",Null,0,2,8 June 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Highly interesting film from the vampire's point of view, I rate it '7' of 10.
","This film is based on the novel by my good friend Anne Rice. And the book was actually based on a short story she wrote back in her college days. Anne, if you are reading this, I only give it '7' because it is not the kind of movie I want to see twice, however I admire the script you wrote. You did it in an overall 'comedy' style and it works well that way.  Although I suppose we need to call it a 'dark comedy' because of the subject matter and all the people who die such horrible deaths.Big stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas are vampires. Pitt is a 'sensitive' vampire and feels badly that he has to live his life killing people by draining their blood so that he can stay alive. Or rats and chickens when humans aren't convenient. Cruise is just the opposite, and eventually they clash. One of the victims is the mother of Kirsten Dunst's character, and the 12-yr-old is 'injected' and she becomes a vampire also. The film covers approx. 200 years of Pitt's vampire life, as it is being told to Christian Slater, thus the 'interview' in the film's title. Most of the 'flashback' is in Rice's hometown, NewOrleans, from about 1790 to the 1990s. But some of it also is set in Paris as Pitt's character travels the world to find others like himself.I'm glad I saw this film, and it held my interest. Still, it is not my favorite kind of film. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the mini-vampire, a role much better suited to her talents then the current 'Bring It On' where she plays a teenage cheerleader.",Null,2,4,26 February 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 'Run away ... run away ... run away!' ,"You have to be a die hard -- emphasis on DIE HARD -- Monty Python fan to really enjoy this movie. I came away mostly disappointed, considering its lofty ranking amongst all age groups. This is the movie where we first hear what sounds like horse hooves, but as we see the men coming it is King Arthur, on his own feet, pretending to be on a horse, and his servant following, making hoof sounds with two coconut halves. A lengthy discussion with castle occupants ensues, whether coconuts migrate, and whether a swallow has enough power to weight ratio to carry a coconut to England. This movie must have given Quentin Tarrantino the inspiration for similar dialog in 'Pulp Fiction'.As the story unfolds, and Arthur recruits other Knights for his round table at Camelot, and the search for the Grail, everyone stays on foot, pretending to be on horse. There are many funny scenes, but mostly the 'movie' is an extended Monty Python skit so popular on TV during the 1970s. Regarding the supposed witch the crowd brought, and wanted to burn ... 'What burns? Wood. When you put wood in water, it ... floats. What else floats ... a duck. So, if she is no heavier than a duck, she must be a witch!'  Or the three questions that must be answered correctly to cross the bridge of doom. However, the whole as a 'movie' does not satisfy me, it all seems rather silly, and I cannot give it a very high rating. SPOILER -- Mid-way in the movie, a present time historian is commenting, apparently for this movie, and a character, a knight, runs by and slashes him, he falls, others later attend. At precisely 1:28 into the movie, the present day police show up in motorcars, arrest Arthur and several of his knights, right before they were to attack a castle occupied by insulting French soldiers. Then the cop goes up to the cameraman, puts his hand on the lens, the picture goes white as we see the end of the filmstrip, then the screen goes dark for several minutes while music plays and that is the end of the movie. I believe the Python troupe commented years later that as they look back, they are embarrassed by some of their work, and are amazed that the public reacted so favorably. To me, this movie falls in that category, not a particularly good or funny movie, mysteriously with a very lofty rating on the IMDb.The DVD is just 'OK'.  The transfer is from a theatrical copy, you can see the reel change marks in the film margin, and there are many imperfections. The sound also is rather mediocre.",Null,3,11,13 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A worthy second (or 5th??) Star Wars installment, might be the best of the bunch.
","My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",Null,143,188,7 October 2004
Minions," The story of how the Minions came to be, starting at the beginning of time!
","The surprise hit of the 'Despicable Me' movies are the cute little yellow Minions, goofy and mean, always laughing when someone gets hurt. So this animated movie is to show their entire history, starting with one-celled organisms developing in the sea.The premise is that Minions naturally adore and are drawn towards the most evil, despicable being that they know about. We know they ended up in modern times with Gru, but who did they attach themselves to during older historic times? A good part of this story occurs in 1968. They are in New York and watching a TV commercial that is advertising a convention of crooks in Orlando. So they hitch a ride with a family going there, on the way stopping to rob a bank. In Orlando they meet the best thief (voiced by Sandra Bullock) who recruits the Minions to go to London with her and steal the British Crown.That leads to a number of things that British audiences probably will be horrified by, considering their reverence for the Crown and the Queen.

There they pick up a very persistent cop who wants to capture and impound them.But they still manage to get in with a circus, work their way through Europe and finally to New York. The story is just a framework for the various characters to do and say funny things. Which they do. Frankly I am getting tired of the Madagascar series of animated films, I hope this is the last one.

A Walk to Remember," Nothing new here, but well-done and Mandy Moore is totally believable.
","Mandy Moore is a beautiful young girl and seems to be a natural actress. Here she plays the daughter of a strict preacher (Peter Coyote), and she herself is a spiritual person who does her own thing in high school, pursuing her list of things to do, while not worrying what the shallow students think of her. Takes her hand-built reflector telescope into the cemetary at night to view the heavens. Tutors other students. Sings in the church choir. SPOILERS -- She and her dad have a secret. She is dying of lukemia, and her 'list' is really the things she wants to do before she dies, which isn't very far away. Number one on her list is to get married in the same small church in Virginia where her parents were married. Circumstances get her and the popular but dangerous guy into common settings, tutoring, the school play, and ultimately she 'makes him want to be a better person', shades of 'As Good As It Gets'. He has to spurn the old friends to move on.
As she gets more sick, and it is obvious her time is very short, he proposes and they do get married in the small church, she dies, he goes on to college, he gets accepted to medical school, the things he put on his list after meeting her.There are absolutely no new ideas in this film. Its charm comes in the way the characters develop, and the truly wonderful acting by Mandy Moore. It is a good story, of what true love and devotion is, rather than two kids just trying to get in bed as soon as they can. The film doesn't preach, but it does touch the subjects of belief in God and the value of real relationships. In my book that kind of film deserves a high rating. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not a perfect movie, some scenes didn't ring true, but overall I really enjoyed it.",Null,0,0,15 July 2002
Inside Llewyn Davis," A week in the life of a 1960s Greenwich Village folk singer.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library.In general I am a fan of Coen Brothers movies, 'Fargo' is a masterpiece, and I have varying degrees of admiration for the others. But they always deliver something interesting.As the 'making of' extra states they were very fortunate to find Oscar Isaac, someone who is an accomplished actor and who also can credibly play guitar and sing. He is Llewyn Davis and the movie's title comes from the name of his first solo record album called 'Inside Llewyn Davis.' But on a broader scope the whole movie is an examination of what in fact is inside Llewyn.The movie actually begins and ends with a continuation of the same scene, Llewyn is asked to go outside into the alley after he performs, a 'friend' wants to see him. It turns out to be an angry husband from out of town, his wife had been performing and Llewyn wasn't very nice.In between the first snippet of that scene and the resolution of it we see about a week of Llewyn's life, trying to make it as a solo performer after his duet mate killed himself. Llewyn is good, very suitable as a 1960s folk singer, but he is not a very nice person and is basically homeless. There is also a cat, belonging to a neighbor, that becomes a running gag throughout.It is well-made and interesting, and Isaac is great in the role, but I find that it has no real staying power in my thoughts the way the better Coen Brothers movies do.",Null,0,1,6 August 2016
Sin City," Black and white, with selective color, a great looking movie.
","'Sin City' is the latest movie where a comic book comes alive. In the hands of Rodriguez the result is spectacular. Many will be turned off by the story and the extreme amount of violence, even though as viewers we know it is 'pretend' violence, the kind you see in comic books where a bullet-riddled man continues to live, or a single gunshot removes an ear or a hand. But being able to watch through that rewards one with the images and 'filming' style used here. (No film was actually used, digital images were.) The movie is mostly in black and white, but in the opening scene we see a beautiful girl in a bright red dress, and with very red lips. Throughout the movie, there are very select images in color. A red car, a woman's very blue eyes, alternating blue, red, green shades of light on the face of a driver. And, of course, the very yellow man. It all works very well. Filmed in and around Austin, Texas where Rodriguez lives, much of the action was shot in green rooms with digital background added in post production. In a style very similar to 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.'The movie has an all-star cast, but some of the more memorable -- Benicio Del Toro as the bad guy, Jackie Boy, Carla Gugino as the beautiful parole officer Lucille, Mickey Rourke in heavy makeup as Marv, looking for his girl's killer, and Bruce Willis as Hartigan, the retiring cop with a bad ticker, out to find and protect Nancy, played as an adult by Jessica Alba.",Null,1,3,29 August 2005

For those of us who are past the juvenile stage, it just isn't funny. It becomes tiresome very quickly.Katherine Heigl is a TV show producer Abby Richter. She is particular and controlling, and starts out to get the ideal guy, armed with a checklist. She has so many hangups that she can't ever seem to get very far.Gerard Butler is Mike Chadway, a profane bachelor who comes on board at the TV station with the show 'The Ugly Truth' which paints all men as uncaring morons who only want one thing, sex, and will do anything to get it.Abby is of course appalled, but Mike gives her a challenge -- if he can tell her what to do and say to get the affections of the guy of her dreams, a handsome young doctor who lives near her, will she accept Mike? They make a deal, and all Mike's advice works. Of course she has to eventually reject the man because she has not been herself, and he will not like the real person she is.Predictably (from a simple plot point of view) Mike and Abby fall in love. Not a very inventive ending to a rather poor effort at a romantic comedy that isn't really that funny, isn't really that romantic.",Null,4,8,25 November 2009
Gangs of New York," Superb fictional but historically-valid account of gang warfare that shaped New York city in the 19th century.
","Feb 2010 edit: I saw it again presently and it still is a fascinating movie. A must-see.'Gangs of New York' is a long movie at 2 hours and 45 minutes, but it never did feel 'long', it never got boring. As the historical featurette on the DVD shows, the time, place, characters and events are predominantly real, New York in the period between about 1840 and 1865 was the dirtiest and most dangerous place in the USA, perhaps in the whole world. The five points area, near what is now Little Italy and Chinatown, drew immigrants, primarily Irish, and freshly-released convicts. Police were there mainly to keep the wealthy from getting mugged by the poor. Rival volunteer firefighter groups would often fight each other and loot the burning buildings. There really was a 'Boss Tweed' and a 'Bill the Butcher.' Young female pickpockets thrived. There were a whole host of rival gangs, and being part of a gang was essential for survival. The riots protesting the draft really did result in almost destroying New York.So, what we have in this movie is a very closely historical look and feel of that era, interwoven with a fictional story. The clear star of the movie is Daniel Day-Lewis as 'Bill the Butcher'. He creates an unforgettable character that is eloquent, sometimes funny, always terrifying, and often deadly to his opponents. Leonardo DiCaprio is very strong as the young man 'Amsterdam' whose father (Liam Neeson) had been killed years earlier in the gang brawl that opens the movie. Cameron Diaz plays Jenny who has connections to both Bill and Amsterdam. The picture and sound on the DVD are first-rate, with either a Dolby 5.1 or a DTS 5.1 sound track selectable. The movie is long, so the only extra I watched was the historical one, and it is a treasure. I like this movie and rate it highly. Anyone who wants to learn more about the 'hidden' history of New York should see this movie.The remaining comments contain SPOILERS and are for my future recollection. Do not read further. If you want more details, go read the critic Ebert's excellent review.Bill was the vicious leader of the 'Nativist' gang that wanted to keep out the foreign immigrants, especially the Irish who they considered even lower than the black former slaves. The rival gang featured here were the 'Dead Rabbits'. (As the DVD extra explains, the real Irish name was different, but sounded much like 'dead rabbit', and actually had a meaning close to 'large and dangerous brute'.) In the opening fight Bill kills 'Priest', Amsterdam's father, the fight ends as the Nativists prevail. Amsterdam is sent to an orphanage to grow up, then we see him 16 years later being released, he goes back to Five Points. Being a quiet but assertive and competent type, Amsterdam soon gets into the good graces of Bill. Voice-over, 'It is strange being under the wing of a dragon. It is warmer than you think.' But eventually Bill learns who Amsterdam really is, and is prepared when he deflects a knife thrown by Amsterdam, subdues him, spares his life but brands him on the right cheek with a glowing hot knife blade. Jenny the pickpocket and Amsterdam were on the way to falling in love, she helps nurse him back to health, he assumes leadership of the Dead Rabbits, he challenges Bill to a brawl, which takes place right when the militia begin to fire upon that section of town using cannons on ships in the harbor, to break up the military draft protest riots. Bill gets mortally wounded, Amsterdam finishes him off. His revenge taken.",Null,1,6,31 January 2004
Windtalkers," Good viewing for those who seek lots of war action.
","I like the characters Nic Cage creates and here he is Sergeant Joe Enders. As the movie begins we see him and his group fighting in WW II, seemingly with no chance to survive. As the next scene begins, we see him in a military hospital, recovering, the only man to survive that incident. He desperately wants to go back into action, even though he is still not physically well and can't hear out of a damaged left ear.This movie depicts the use of Navaho Americans to transmit coded messages that the enemy cannot crack. Joe's assignment is with one of these new recruits, Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach, a real Native American, but not Navaho). The drama is because Joe's assignment is to protect 'the code', not to protect Ben. Meaning, if it appears that Ben is to be captured and questioned, Joe's assignment becomes to kill Ben. Knowing that, he tries very hard to avoid beaconing friends with Ben, but it is unavoidable.For my tastes there is too much raw action, shooting, explosions, etc and not enough of the human side of the story. Still, I found it a worthwhile 2 hours.To me Peter Stormare was miscast as Gunnery Sergeant Hjelmstad. He is from Sweden and, while I generally like him as an actor ('Fargo'!) he never was believable as a tough American because he didn't sound American. Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, and Christian Slater were all good as soldiers, as well as Frances O'Connor, the nurse who wrote to Joe and hoped he would come home some day.",Null,1,2,8 August 2006
Joy," The life and times of Joy, inventor of the self-wringing mop.
","I found this movie on DVD from my local library. I must like David O. Russell films, this is one in a line that keeps getting longer.Joy Mangano is a real person and the one who invented the self-wringing mop that sold well on QVC. As the writer/director explains in the making-of extra, maybe 50% of this movie is actually based on her and her story, the rest of daring females he either heard about or knew. The rest is fiction including many fictional characters. His purpose was to tell a good story, not to make a biographical film.I have had a lukewarm feeling for Jennifer Lawrence but the more I see her the more I like her. She really is a good actress, here she plays Joy from about 25 to about 45. She was born into a very dysfunctional family and put off college to help take care of her 'mental' mother, even though Joy had been Valedictorian of her class. Now she was working as an airline agent. With two children and her ex husband living in her basement.By way of backstory we see as a young girl of maybe 10 she had a vivid imagination but had lost that over the years. Her big inspiration comes when they are on a sail boat, some bottles of wine break, she mops up the mess but cuts her hands on shards of glass. What if she could invent a self-wringing mop with a removable head that can be thrown into the laundry?The whole story follows her and her difficulties in the real world of business, patents, and deceptive contractors. The real Joy now has over 100 patents and a thriving business.I enjoyed this movie and Lawrence is super.",Null,0,2,22 May 2016
Coach Carter," Well told story of a real coach who put academics ahead of sports.
","I like Samuel Jackson, he is one of my favorite actors. And, I like inspiring true stories. Put both of those together, in a movie like 'Coach Carter', and you have a great movie. Jackson is Coach Ken Carter who, 30 years earlier, had been the star basketball player at this very same California high school, and now had a profitable sporting goods business. He took the job reluctantly, for 4 months and $1500, because he wanted a little extra spending money to take his wife on vacation. But he took it only on one condition -- he would be allowed to do it his way. In his years since high school he knew the statistics -- only 50% of the students would graduate, only one in 6 would go to college, and 1 in 3 boys would end up in prison or dead. He wanted to make a difference, to change the statistics for these basketball players who only wanted to play ball and win.Coach Carter, on his first day, requires all who want to play, to sign a contract. Maintain a 2.3 GPA, attend all classes, sit in the front row, and wear a coat and tie on game days. And -- learn to refer to each other and the coach as 'sir.' All quite a change in culture for these borderline ghetto students. Carter figured that unless they could develop a better self-discipline, and follow good rules, then they had no hope of following the rules of society and set personal goals to make something of themselves.Rob Brown of 'Finding Forrester' fame is one of the star players, Kenyon Stone, who has a side issue with his pregnant girlfriend Kyra (Ashanti). The DVD has an interesting extra featuring the real Coach Carter.SPOILERS. Carter through pushups, 'suicides' drills, and lots of outside running makes them the best conditioned team in the area, and uses a running offense to wear down the opponents. They go from poor losers the season before to almost unbeatable. But when Carter finds out that many of them were violating their contracts, skipping class, getting failing or incomplete grades, he locked the gym and canceled games. The parents and town rebeled, wanted Carter to quit, mandated unlocking the gym, but the team held together, refused to practice until all grades were in order, then they were invited to the championship tournament. A low seed, they were forced to play the best team in the state, almost winning, but losing in the final seconds by one point, still they had bonded as a team and understood the priorities in life better.",Null,1,5,9 July 2005
Moon," A rather small and intimate movie, set on a very large stage, The Moon.
","In spite of this movie being set on the Moon, it is actually a small and intimate movie. It only has two characters that mean anything, and one of them is a computer/robot named GERTY.This is set only far enough in the future that we have been able to establish a base of mining operations on the Moon, with a base station and one man operating it. Along with his trusty companion GERTY who has a lens for an eye and, suspended on tracks from the ceiling can travel all over the base station.The scientific premise is the mining of Helium 3 (normal Helium 4 is what fills balloons) which can be used in fusion reactions to generate power, enough that this mined He 3 is sent back to the Earth in dedicated rockets. Large machines roam the surface of the Moon, spewing rocks in its wake. Ostensibly it is collecting and concentration the He 3 that is estimated at 0.1 ppm. That isn't much He 3.Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell, who handles the Moon operations much as an experienced operator would handle an oil refining unit back on Earth. He is anxious and happy, his 3-year stint alone on the Moon is coming to an end and he looks forward to returning to Earth to his wife and young daughter.Kevin Spacey is the soothing voice of GERTY, reminding me a lot of HAL in '2001: A Space Odessy'. But GERTY is clearly on the side of Sam and never turns on him.I don't really want to say what this movie is about because I think it is better to view it knowing nothing. I found it interesting, as a character study. But still science fiction and not as profound as perhaps it wants itself to be. Good entertainment.SPOILERS FOLLOW: As the story unfolds and the 3-year target looms closer Sam starts to behave strangely. He has visions. He goes out to service a harvester and is injured in a wreck. He has physical problems, he spits up blood, a molar falls out. All this are signs that he is wearing out, he can't last more than three years, because he is a clone. In fact, when he awakes from his accident he finds he was rescued by another clone, just like him, and with the same name. Together they figure all this out, no one ever goes home, they are destroyed when they wear out and one of the dozens of clones below deck is awakened by GERTY from its suspended animation to become the next Sam. Memories are implanted into their brains so that each new clone believes he has a family back on Earth and will go home after 3 years are up. At the end they convince GERTY to awaken one additional clone, and the still healthy clone uses an escape module to send himself back to Earth. But what will he find there? Will he expose the operation for what it is?",Null,1,2,13 January 2010
Happy Feet," A very entertaining animated Penguin movie.
","Following on the heels of the most excellent documentary on the Emperor Penguins (March of the Penguins) is this animated and, of course, fictional tale of a peculiar penguin. While his dad is holding the egg while mom is out for food, the egg ends up on frozen ground for a few seconds and it appears that the baby is lost. But he is in fact hatched as Mumble (Elijah Woods), who only has one problem. He can't sing. All Emperor Penguins in this story have a unique song in their heart that defines them, but Mumble can only squawk. But his feet are happy, they can't be still. He is a tap dancing machine.The story has threads of acceptance of others who are different, and how perseverance can make a difference for all. The voice cast is all-star, including such actors as Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman (who also sings wonderfully), Nicole Kidman (who sings a little), and of Matrix fame, Hugo Weaving. The animation is superb.SPOILERS. Predators are being unusually menacing to the penguins and they figure out it is the aliens, human boats taking loads of fish. Little Mumble follows one, ends up beached far from the South Pole, and is taken into an aquarium exhibit. After some time he begins to dance and becomes a feature attraction. Eventually he also is able to draw attention to the problem and a world conference of humans plan to do something to rectify the fishing problem. The peculiar little penguin is a hero, and others begin to learn to dance too.",Null,1,3,3 May 2007
Her," What is love, really?
","Rather than think about what time in the near future this story might be set, I prefer to think of it as an alternate Earth that developed its technology a bit different from what we actually experienced.It opens with Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore at his job. He is at a desk and dictating beautiful, emotional words, as those words get written in script on paper right before him. He, and a number of others in cubicles, work for a company that writes letters for people to send to their loved ones. Presumably they also submit handwriting samples, because each looks like different cursive script.Theodore seems like a nice guy but he is just breaking up with his wife. He is a bit lost it seems, and as luck would have it he is getting a new operating system, and OS1, for his computer. It is the latest and greatest. OS1 is on the cutting edge of A.I. and it has a personality. You can choose either male or female when you first boot it up.So Theodore boots his up, naturally specifies a female, and for the rest of the movie we hear the glorious vocal tones of Scarlett Johannson as the OS1 voice, and she names herself Samantha. But the honeymoon is destined to end because as Samantha learns and changes but using her instantaneous and powerful searching and learning abilities, she will soon become too much for Theodore to handle. To me this story is playing on at least a couple of concepts. One would be the increasing reliance some people have on their devices, texting, picture-sharing, social media, computer games, all resulting in less and less human contact. In our real lives today, most people seem much more comfortable exchanging text messages than actually talking to someone.The other theme that is foremost is the idea of love and how do we fall in love. Theodore actually falls in love with Samantha, his operating system. And he isn't reluctant at all to tell others about it. But isn't the idea of being in love with a computerized voice the height of self- delusion? Anyway this cannot end very well, and I suppose each of us has to take away what we want from the movie. SPOILERS: Samantha quickly develops 'relationships' online with many other persons, thousands. And, she tells Theodore that she is in love with over 600 of them. She pleads with him, trying to convince him that doing so doesn't take away from what the two of them have. That she has the capacity to give proper attention to all of them. (Sounds almost like some people do in real life!) In the end, discouraged, Theodore and his good friend, played by Amy Adams, go to the roof of their high-rise, and sitting not too far from the edge the picture fades to black, and during the credits we hear sirens. Does that mean they jumped to their deaths, to finally be in union with the personalities of the Os? It isn't clear.",Null,1,2,6 June 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A worthy winner of 'Best Picture.'
","I guess looking back I'd have to say I generally enjoy movies directed by Danny Boyle. 'Trainspotting' and 'The Beach' just to name a couple of them. Here he brings us a young-love fable set in modern India, the realistic modern India where people make a life the best way they can. The critic Ebert has a very nice, accurate review.The story focuses on one boy who was orphaned at a very young age when Muslims were attacked at a washing hole and his mom was clubbed to death. That he and his brother managed to escape and survive was just the start of their ordeals. Dev Patel is the teenage Jamal K. Malik.He makes do the best he can, running a series of relatively harmless scams, often involving tourists. His brother Salim follows a quite darker route and as a young adult is a gangster working for a big gangster. As children they also become friends with a small orphaned girl Latika, who is played later as a young adult by Freida Pinto.As a young adult Jamal works in a large 'bullpen' type of phone sales group, but his job is simple, bringing tea to the others. One day a worked asked him to take is phone station for a few minutes, and Jamal had figured out how to make the call at the right time to get on the 'Millionaire' show. He does, and he does very well, answering questions that a 'slumdog' like him, someone uneducated, should not be able to answer. So they begin to wonder 'how is he cheating?' Eventually 20Million Rupees is at stake, which is about $400,000 US dollars.Good movie, filmed in an exciting manner and edited interestingly. The story is not told linearly but all comes together easily.SPOILERS: Jamal even as a young boy fell in love with Latika, but she became separated from them. They grew up apart but he eventually found her, in virtual slavery for the man Salim actually works for. Jamal's real motivation to get on the TV show was to make contact with Latika, because everyone watched it. As the flashbacks show, there was a particular incident in his growing up that contributed to his knowing the answer to each question, like 'who invented the revolver' or 'who is on the American $100 bill'. Still, after one day of the TV show he was taken away and in a sense tortured to reveal how he cheated, but Jamal only told the truth. However the next show when he was faced with the 20Million Rupee question, 'the 3rd Musketeer', he didn't know the answer. He guessed, got it right, because of fate. And fate got him and Latika together.",Null,3,7,13 April 2009
The Nice Guys," Gosling and Crowe as slapstick detectives in 1970s Los Angeles.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. After seeing the trailer for this movie my wife decided to skip it, probably a wise choice for her.I enjoyed it. But I would not rate it very high, there are too many flaws and much of the writing is lazy, using 'Jesus Christ' as an exclamation too often and throwing in filthy language gratuitously. Set in 1970s Los Angeles it involves a dead porn star, a missing daughter, and a corrupt law enforcement. Russell Crowe is Jackson Healy, who it seems earns his living mostly by taking payment to hunt down and beat up people. The example we see early is a 39-yr-old man getting too friendly with a 13-yr-old girl, smoking pot with her, etc. With his brass knuckles on Healy goes to his door, punches him out, and warns him to never see the girl again.His job leads him to Ryan Gosling as Private Investigator Holland March. After getting beat up by Healy they eventually form a partnership of sorts and the result is a Two Stooges type of story from that point on. There are some very funny scenes, but also some that fall flat.Cute young Australian actress Angourie Rice is really good as Holly, the PI's daughter who in many respects is more mature than he is. She even drives him places. She has a very natural acting style and a good screen presence, we will continue to see her in featured roles. Not a good movie, a very dark comedy with lots of shooting and frequent bloodshed, but an interesting diversion for those who enjoy this type of movie.",Null,1,2,26 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," The roar of the grease, the smell of the desert crowd.
","They are on their way to Valhalla. Witness! This is a re-imagining of the original Mad Max movies with Mel Gibson. There is no direct link other than Max. On these boards I asked 'What is the basic story?' A couple of interesting replies are: ' In the new world order there is a family (faction?) in monopoly of (each of) the resources, one has the water, another the oil production, and another the gun production. Furiosa escapes the clutches of the water baron taking his captive breeding women. He pursues her with the help of the other monopoly members. She realizes her dream homeland is gone so she returns to the water baron's place, killing him en route and taking over his fiefdom. Along the way Furiosa encounters Max, who decides to help her. '' Leader of bad guys has 5 models who are his brides who have his children for breeding the pale white guys. girls run away, bad guy chases them across the dessert, max helps the girls and battles the bad guy. max wins by ripping off the bad guys face. end of story. boooooring as hell but pretty to look at scenery and oh so cool chase scenes. 'So whether one considers this boring or exciting depends on one's frame of mind. In the chases across the Namibian desert it is almost nonstop action. Chases, shooting, flame-throwing guitar playing, cars and motorcycles crashing, explosions. I have to give credit to the filmmakers, and the sound track has much deep bass to emphasize all the action, you need a home theater with a good subwoofer to really appreciate all of it. I watched it at home on DVD.I enjoyed all the main actors, Tom Hardy is Max and Charlize Theron is the crazy lady, Furiosa, who takes the truck and the women to set out to find the Green Place of her childhood memories.",Null,0,3,28 September 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Very meaningful WW2 movie, essentially a true story of one man's great bravery.
","We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. Sound and picture are exceptional, I have a good powered subwoofer, at key scenes the whole room was pulsating with the explosions. Mel Gibson directed, one of his sons is a key character.This is essentially the true, accurate story of Desmond Doss. As a young man in the early 1940s he felt a great obligation to join the Army and fight for his country. But he was a religious young man and had decided that he would never take up a weapon, a gun or rifle, under any circumstances. But he would instead become a medic, one who would go in battle and help the wounded survive.Much of the first half of the movie involves his early life, his meeting the pretty nurse he would eventually marry, his difficulties during basic training when they tried to break him to receive a discharge. They didn't want a coward in their unit, unaware that Doss was probably the bravest of the bunch.Most of the second half involves the battle against the Japanese on Okinawa, particularly the effort to take Hacksaw Ridge. The Americans were ambushed, there were many casualties, the healthy retreated down the rope ladder on the ridge. But Doss all night looked for wounded, dragged or carried them to the ridge, lowered them down. Through the night he saved about 75 men that way, when morning came the officers were amazed, 'Where did all these come from?' British actor Andrew Garfield is really good as Desmond Doss. The movie was filmed mostly in Australia, a favorite place of Director Gibson's, and features mostly Australian actors. In fact the only American actor I am sur4e of is Vince Vaughn.All-N-all a fine movie but often difficult to watch for the realistic depiction of the savagery and gore of infantry war. Clips of the real Doss are shown at the end.",Null,5,7,24 April 2017
The Runaways," Pretty good movie of the story of the 1970s girl Rock and Roll band, The Runaways.
","The two main members of the 1970s Rock Band, The Runaways, were Cherie Curry as the lead singer and Joan Jett, the band's catalyst and guitar player. This movie is based on Curry's book, and one of the producers is Jett. From that I believe it is safe to assume the movie is very faithful to what really happened all those years ago.When Rock and Roll hit its stride all the bands were guys. It was a rough music, not something for dainty girls. But Joan Jett as a teenager was not interested in what most girls were interested in. She bought a black motorcycle jacket, the kind that tough guys wore.Kim Fowley, a guy, already had established some credentials as a producer and Jett got his attention at an event. He was intrigued by the idea that an all-girl group might be America's answer to the British invasion. He introduced her to a girl drummer, told them to work something up, and in a teen nightspot found Currie, told her she would become their singer because she had the 'look', even though she was not yet a singer.When you take all that for what it is on the surface, there was no reason why this motley group of girls should have ever gotten farther than the garage, but Fowley, as eccentric as he appears to be, somehow had a vision, he drove the girls to look and sound like a rock band, and in a funny scene had neighborhood kids throw things at them, empty cans, paper junk, even dried dog turds, to teach them how to play under adverse conditions and to defend themselves.The girls were teenagers. Currie was only 15. They didn't have much in the way of home lives, and they basically became 'runaways.' The movie is hard to watch at times, filled with profanity and drug use. But it gives a glimpse into that life and what it took to form a successful girls R&R band.All the actors are good. Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning (who really was 15) as Cherie Currie. And Michael Shannon in an inspired performance as Kim Fowley.",Null,1,6,29 August 2010
Me Before You," The complications of taking your own life.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Set in England, Sam Claflin is Will Traynor, young successful businessman from a wealthy family. As the movie starts we see him going out to the street, momentarily distracted, and he is hit by a large motorcycle.The movie doesn't dwell at all on the accident or its immediate aftermath, instead it switches to two years later. Will is now living back with his parents, he is mostly a quadriplegic and confined to a motorized wheelchair. He has a professional caregiver who comes in especially for the medical and personal care issues. But Will isn't happy or even faking happiness, he is always in a rather sour mood.Emilia Clarke (of 'Game of Thrones' fame) is ditzy Lou Clark, a 26-yr- old with a job as a clerk, as we meet her near the end of her day's work she is given an envelope with her last pay, she has just lost her job. She is from a working family and with an unemployed dad, she needs to find work to help with expenses.Through a placement agency she is presented a job, unclear what exactly it is but it would be working for Will's parents, she would be a companion of sorts for Will, drive him places, find ways to keep him entertained. Even though Will himself doesn't want any part of that plan. Will is dour, Lou always dresses colorful and funky and is always upbeat.So the story here really is to see if somehow Lou can break through and get Will to better enjoy his handicapped life. Things are complicated quickly when Lou learns that Will is planning to travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. He has promised his family he would give it 6 months before making his final decision.So the story is both funny and painful. Both main actors do fine jobs with their roles. Life is seldom simple.SPOILERS: In the process both Will and Lou fall in love with each other. Lou even lets go of her existing relationship. She desperately wants Will to stay, build a life with her. But as much as he would like that he can't forget his former active lifestyle. And he doesn't want Lou to be burdened, perhaps for many years, with him in his condition. So he goes through with his plans and in his will leaves a handsome sum of money for Lou, as he says, not so that she is fixed for life but enough to allow her a fresh start and a real career.",Null,2,2,16 September 2016
Gladiator," Excellent story, good acting, lots of gladiator action, beautiful filming, I rate '8' of 10.
","I have criteria for a film to make it up to my '9' or '10' rating and this one does not reach that level. Still, it is a very entertaining film that plays shorter than its 2 1/2 hours, and gives a good glimpse of the Roman state of emperors and politics in the second century after Christ. I rate it a solid '8' of 10.The straightforward storyline is not new. A loyal soldier, a 'Spaniard' (Russell Crowe)who aging emperor Marcus Aurelius calls 'Rome's greatest general', leads the Roman army to a convincing victory in Germania, the last frontier for the 180 A.D. Romans. This general, 'Maximus', is the son the emperor wishes he had and asks him to come to Rome to help create a democracy. Immediately all fortunes change and Maximus goes from general to slave to gladiator to rebel. Packed around that storyline are some excellent, however gory, battle and arena scenes. The film ends a bit unbelievably.The DVD picture and sound are great. You get 2 discs for your purchase, the second has all the 'extras' which are quite extensive and provide good perspectives on the Roman Empire, and the making of this film.** CAUTION - SPOILERS - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK -----After the victory at Germania, all Maximus wants to do is go home to his farm and wife and young son. It had been 2 years and 265 days since he had seen them. When the emperor's son, Commodus, finds out about his father's favor towards the Spaniard, he kills his own father to become emperor, has his guards take Maximus out to kill him, but Maximus gets the upper hand and kills them all and, badly wounded on his left shoulder, rides towards home. Roman guards also destroy his home, and kill his wife and son. He sees this, passes out, and is a changed man.He is rescued and sold into slavery to become a gladiator in small venues in a remote Roman province. There, he quickly becomes a killing machine, and soon heads for the big time in Rome, where the new emperor is putting on '150 straight days' of gladiator games in the area.  The Romans are entertained by seeing gladiators kill each other, or Christian children eaten by lions.Ever since the old emperor was killed, then his family killed, Maximus's sole ambition was to face the emperor and get revenge. At their first face-to-face encounter, the Spaniard's popularity with the crowd kept him alive. Repeated 'traps' were unsuccessful because Maximus was such a good fighter.Commodus borders on insane. He has a driving lust for his own sister, Lucilla, and tells her he wants a son by her so he can have his own legitimate heir to the throne, instead of her son by a now dead husband. Lucilla ends up helping in a plot to free Maximus who would return in a few days with an army of 5,000 to kill Commodus and restore some semblance of democracy, to fulfill the desires of the dead emperor. But insiders spoil that plot, kill Maximus' friend, and imprison him again.Finally, crazy Commodus wants to settle it in a fight in the arena between him and Maximus, man-to-man. But Commodus cheats - while Maximus is still shackled, Commodus stabs him deeply in the abdomen in what turns out to be a mortal wound. However, he has enough strength to first kill Commodus, and order all prisoners freed, and Rome freed, then Maximus dies and we see him, in dream-like sequences, joining his wife and son in the afterlife.A couple of things did not ring true.  Maximus was so much better than everyone else, and it is only barely credible that anyone could have fought out of all those situations. Also, I am not a student of Roman history, but I find it hard to believe that an emperor would get into the arena and fight a gladiator.

","It is interesting to look at some recent films by young filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez did 'El Mariachi.' Luc Besson did 'The Fifth Element.' M. Night did 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable.' And now, 25 and two years out of So. Cal. Richard Kelly did 'Donnie Darko'. All of them both wrote and directed. 'Darko' was done on a very small $4million budget with cheap or free actors. It is true what they say about growing older, we lose our imagination, our ability to think like children, without boundaries. 'Donnie Darko' is without artificial boundaries, is a work of great inspiration. However it is not easy to view and understand on its own. Watching the film twice on DVD, the second time with director commentary, is practically essential. I did just that and this is a film that will stick with me for a long time. 
SPOILERS - This is pure Sci-Fi, playing on the concept that time-travel is possible through a wormhole if conditions are just right. At midnight on October 2, 1988 such a thing happens, a break in the space/time continuum, and the consequences threaten the very future existence of the universe in 28 days plus a few hours. Through Devine Intervention, 'Frank' is chosen to be Donnie's guide, disguised as a six-foot rabbit, and Donnie is chosen to be the super hero that will figure out how to put things right and save the universe. So Frank first has to save Donnie from the time-traveling jet engine that is about to fall into his bed, so goes to Donnie in a dream and has him go out onto the golf course. Donnie's family and many friends think he is mentally disturbed, he sees a shrink, but the medicine she prescribes are just placebos. There isn't anything wrong with him, he is just ultra-aware and very intelligent. In his waking hours he senses that he has a mission, and must piece together clues provided by Frank and others. Everyone is manipulated in this parallel universe gone off kilter, to provide situations which will lead to Donnie's correcting things. The flooding of the school. The burning of the house. The shooting of Frank in the right eye. The running over of Gretchen. Everyone, teachers, students, family, strangers, all act in small strange ways, consistent with a universe being slightly off kilter.In the final act Donnie figures out how to build a portal and pull the engine off his mom's return flight. We are not shown all the ways he does this, but when he does, time reverses for those 28 days, back to midnight October 2. Gretchen and Frank are alive again, the house has not burned, the teacher was not fired, the 'proper' universe has been restored and the parallel universe non-existent. But the jet engine still falls at midnight, Donnie is in his bed. He has sacraficed his own life for everyone else, saving the whole world.This is Science Fiction. Donnie Darko is a comic book name. The writing, acting, and filmography are all first-rate. The director's commentary reveals a maturity way beyond his age of 26 or so when the commentary was recorded. My only complaint about the film is that it is bit too vague, and most audiences will not be able to appreciate its full intent without listening to the director's commentary. That's why I rate it '8' of 10, but could very easily have been a '9'.",Null,4,8,27 August 2002
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Rather enjoyed the first half, but not so much the unending fights of the machines in Chicago.
","Saw it on DVD loaned from my public library system.Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky. The stage is set early in his apartment, with his very briefly clad girlfriend walking up the stairs to where Sam was still in bed. She(model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is quite pretty. But Sam has a bigger issue at hand, his parents are coming to visit him in Washington, D.C. and he doesn't yet have a job, and that would be a big deal with mom and dad.That is the personal and love-interest story. But the story about the autobots begins in 1962, with Kennedy as President. An impact of sorts is detected on the far side of the moon, and it is assumed the Russians, who the USA was in a space race against, were responsible. In this fictional story, it was this impact that was the catalyst for Kennedy to declare his intentions to send a man to the moon before the decade was over. And, we see again in this film, the moon landing in 1969 depicted.But what was discovered in 1969 was a crashed space ship, one that contained remnants of the vanquished autobots. This was of course kept secret, but now in modern times artifacts brought back from the moon are on the verge of starting yet another autobot war on Earth.The critic Ebert has a good, complete review. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, for its story line and tying it back to events in the 1960s. But as I have experienced with the other transformers movies, the fighting among the autobots wears thin long before each battle is over, and at a running time of right around 2.5 hours is too long for me.",Null,0,4,27 October 2011
The Social Network," For all of who participate on Facebook, it is a fascinating look at how it came to be, and in such a short time.
","As several of the actors and filmmakers comment in the DVD extra, this is NOT a movie about Facebook, that would be 4th or 5th on the list of things it is 'about.' As they go on to explain, it really is about college friends, how that friendship shaped the creation of social networks, and how ambition and disagreements led to lawsuits.Jesse Eisenberg is Mark Zuckerberg in college at Harvard, a programming genius who was also a social misfit. It seems that the real Zuckerberg is either quite different from that, or he has blossomed quite well in the 7 or so years since the period this movie covers. But Eisenberg does a good job, and he is of course bound by the script, which is very interesting, and what the director wanted in the way of a portrayal. Andrew Garfield is good as Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's close friend and co-founder of Facebook as its CFO and 30% partner. The movie portrays Saverin's getting into a Harvard organization as the catalyst for Zuckerberg's eventual snubbing of Saverin, an idea that Zuckerberg says is totally fabricated. Justin Timberlake is also good as the Napster guy who ends up influencing Zuckerberg's moving to California, and getting at odds with Saverin.As the story is developed in a rather linear time line, it also often cuts forward to the time when depositions were being taken and various parties were suing Zuckerberg for theft of ideas and breach of contracts. The film is accurate from the point of view that it reflects the testimonies and statements faithfully, but as Zuckerberg says in the movie, people lie under oath. Still, it is a matter of record that he paid $Millions as a result of the suits, but he is still the youngest Billionaire. Very interesting movie, we will probably never know the truth. But it isn't possible to visit your Facebook page and look at it the same way after seeing this movie.",Null,2,3,17 January 2011
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore before '50 First Dates.'
","By all rights this should not be a good movie, but it is very entertaining. Sandler is Robbie Hart , working as a wedding singer just to pick up some cash until he hits it big as a song writer. Drew Barrymore is Julia Sullivan, working as a server at wedding parties. Both Robbie and Julia are engaged to be married. But things get complicated, and that is the movie. Sandler and Barrymore are both good here, unless you are one of those people who just don't like them.SPOILERS. As Robbie is ready to be married, his fianc√©e fails to show up. The next day she explains to him, she loves the 'Robbie Hart' of 6 years ago, the rock singer. She doesn't want to marry a 'wedding singer', there's no security in it. As Julia is working to plan her wedding, Robbie finds out her fianc√©e is a cad, bragging about how he still is able to get young women, because he works in New York. Predictably, Robbie and Julia finally get together.",Null,0,1,17 June 2005
In the Land of Blood and Honey," War is ugly, no happy ending here.
","This movie has an unusually low IMDb rating, perhaps because some don't like the political positions of writer/director Angelina Jolie? For that reason mainly I avoided it for a long time but saw it today. War is ugly, no one comes away happy, but this movie provides a glimpse into what it was like. As those who participated in making the movie have said, it is all very realistic.Most of the actors are native to the area, Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina. In fact many of them were children during the subject conflict, almost 4 years from early 1992 through late 1995. It started after former communist Yugoslavia broke up, and the remaining Bosnian area was inhabited by Muslim Bosniaks (44 percent), Orthodox Serbs (31 percent) and Catholic Croats (17 percent), different ethnic groups that had gotten along for years, but now became locked in fierce and deadly battle. This movie focuses on the ethnic cleansing by rounding up and executing the Muslim Bosniaks.The war story is told with a fictional love story. A 24-yr-old Zana Marjanovic is Ajla, a Muslim and an artist, and she is excited about meeting a new guy, Goran Kostic, Danijel, a Serb. They go to a night spot with singing and dancing, when a bomb explodes, perhaps signaling the beginning of the war.The movie which runs nearly 2 hours has the story of Ajla and Danijel woven into the war. Danijel is an officer in the Army, he discovers Ajla in one of the camps where the women cook, mend clothes, and provide sexual services. He has her brought to his camp where he protects her and carries on a strange romance tainted by the fact that he is the enemy of her people, seeking to eliminate them.The movie is a good reminder of the ugliness of war.",Null,2,9,23 February 2013
Macbeth," Macbeth, great soldier with PTSD.
","I saw this on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, not her kind of movie. It is helpful to view the DVD 'extra' first where the director and the actors discuss their approach. And basically it is presenting Macbeth as a man suffering from PTSD after all the wars, and this is responsible for his actions. He even says 'My head is full of scorpions.'It is also helpful to view it with subtitles on, otherwise much of the dialog is difficult to comprehend, especially with the language usage it was written in.Macbeth is a Thane, a landowner under the sanction of the King of Scotland. He is also a great soldier and given credit for winning the King's battles in the Scottish wars. But he is confronted by three witches who say he will become King.Michael Fassbender is really good as Macbeth, so consumed with the idea of becoming King that he will stop at nothing. And his first act is to murder the King at night and blame it on those assigned to guard him. Equally good is Marion Cotillard (one of my very favorites) as Lady Macbeth who even more than Macbeth himself seemed consumed by the idea of the power that come with all that.I will admit that I am not a fan of Shakespeare and I have not seen any other adaptations of Macbeth, but I enjoyed this one, it is very nicely acted and filmed.",Null,0,0,1 June 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'Last Crusade' is superb on its own, even had the first two never been made.
","I was so anxious to buy the DVD set of the three Indiana Jones movies, and did the first day of release, but only last night got around to watching 'The Last Crusade'. As I did, I could not help thinking, how would this movie been received if the first two Indiana Jones movies had never been made? It is very difficult to follow the lead in a trilogy, as we saw in 'Back to the Future', for example. But my answer to myself was, 'The Last Crusade' is superb no matter what. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' will always remain my favorite of the trilogy, but 'Last Crusade' is just a small fraction of a mini-step behind. Sean Connery's role as Indy's father, Dr Jones, works perfectly. And the opening sequences with River Phoenix as the young Indy, showing us how he got the scar on his chin, plus his trademark hat, are very fitting to the whole movie. Even though the adventure becomes the search for the chalice, it is really the father and son searching for the relationship they somehow missed as Indy grew up. As we expected the DVD is absolutely superb. Colors are accurate and rich, and the video bit rate is almost 'Superbit' quality. The Dolby 5.1 sound with the John Williams score is a perfect complement. Just one, fine adventure movie!Main cast ... Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones , Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones , Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody, Alison Doody (an Irish lady) as Dr. Elsa Schneider , John Rhys-Davies as Sallah , and River Phoenix as Young Indy .Update: Dec 2016 - watched it again after 14 years, so much of it was fresh again, and thoroughly enjoyable. SPOILERS follow, for my own reference, please read no further.Young Indy as a Boy Scout in Utah (Arches Nat'l Park) finds a relic-robber discovering an antiquity, captures it for placing in a museum, is chased, on a train, the lion's car, bullwhip nicks his chin, thus the scar, eventually escapes, gets home, but the police are waiting for him, the explorer gets his antiquity back, gives young Indy the hat that will become his trademark, sees the foreigner who is buying the antiquity. Cut to modern times, ship at sea, Indy is recapturing the same antiquity from the same foreigner, he jumps, ship explodes, back in the classroom, shows Marcus Brody the recovered prize. Strangers recruit him for a mission to find the chalice that Christ used at the Last Supper, he balks, finds out his dad (Connery) was their hire but now missing. Dad's diary had been mailed to him from Venice, he heads there, the real adventure begins. Ends where the chalice is, guarded 700 years by an old knight, dad is shot by the bad guy, Indy has to get chalice to save him.",Null,0,2,4 August 2004
Back to the Future," Back To The Future, great start to the trilogy, movies in 1985, 1989, and 1990.
","As of this date, the 3 'Back to the Future' films have these IMDb ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes. #3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of 'time travel.' BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski ('flower child' spelled backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly 'defines' a role as few have been defined in films.The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is what really makes them 'believable' within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus, although all the 'science' in the 3 films is 'bad science', which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a 'science' explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think, 'Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France, drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country.' And you look around, you're back home to a totally different world.That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885, evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland, fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his 'parents.' The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for 'future' events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of 'discrepancies', but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",Null,0,2,9 June 2001
Goodfellas," Gangster life, the 'goodfellas' as related by Henry Hill.
","For some reason I had missed seeing this movie for all these years, but recently found it on BluRay at my local public library. The picture and sound are first-rate and has several very interesting extras. Perhaps the most interesting one is Henry Hill himself talking about his former life as a gangster and stating that this movie is at least 95%, no 99%, realistic and true. Crime reporter Nicholas Pileggi helped Hill write the book Wiseguy, published in 1986. This movie is based on that book. He died the day after he turned 69, in 2012.Many consider this Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. It isn't my favorite genre, it contains lots of violence and gore, plus lots of graphic cursing. But for its type, yes it is a masterpiece.Among the gangsters we have Robert De Niro as James Conway, Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who also narrates, so we know he will survive. Joe Pesci is devastatingly good as the despicable Tommy DeVito who will shoot anyone outside the 'family' if he gets mad at them. Paul Sorvino is Paul Cicero.So what we have is a portrait over a couple of decades of these men who look at their life of crime as their business. They see an opportunity, they arrange a heist, that is their life. But it is a dangerous life with a short cycle, they will each soon be in prison or be killed.In the end when Hill sensed that he was being set up for an execution, he and his wife tried to run only to be caught by the Feds. He ended up being the star witness to put the others away, in exchange for his freedom.As an aside of sorts, some of the scenes are set at the Copacabana club, and in one we get to see Jerry Vale singing, while in another Bobby Vinton's son is shown lip-syncing an original Bobby Vinton song. Nice touches!",Null,0,2,25 June 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," A worthwhile second 'Bourne' installment.
","(No spoilers in this first paragraph.) This is the kind of movie one either likes or doesn't like. It is an action, mystery movie just for entertainment. We were entertained. Matt Damon again comes across as a credible super fighter. Highly conditioned and highly trained, he survives by his ability to think quickly and take evasive action. He is not a James Bond, he is not a super hero. This second Bourne movie takes off where the first one left off. Jason (Damon) and Marie (Potente) have a nice life in some out-of-the-way place half-way around the world, all they want is to be left alone. But they aren't, and that starts the action in the 'Bourne Supremacy.' The fight for survival is back on.Jason and Marie are going somewhere in their jeep when Jason notices something not quite right. They flee, are chased, almost get away but a rifle shot gets Marie, who was driving, they crash into a canal, he pulls her out but, still under water, sees she is dead, he eludes the attacker, who thinks Jason is dead also.A job is done in Berlin, two people are killed to silence them, Jason is framed via planting of his fingerprints. Joan Allen as Landy takes over the investigation, not realizing how good Jason is. He finds where she is staying, her room number, talks to her via phone while he has the telescope of a high powered rifle trained on her temple.The real villain is exposed, but Jason remains on the run. The last scene, a very elaborate and exciting chase scene filmed in Moscow, ends with his attacker dead, and Jason walks towards the light of the tunnel entrance, symbolic of his quest for the 'light' of being. He is a killer, but instinctively he wants to be a happy man.The DVD has a very interesting set of extras. Unique techniques were used for filming car chase action scenes, putting the characters and viewers right into the action. Filming was done in authentic locations, very little 'special effects' were used. Overall a very entertaining movie.Brian Cox as the rogue Ward Abbott is good, as well as Julia Stiles as Nicky and Karl Urban as Kirill, the assassin after Jason.",Null,2,4,30 December 2004
The Great Gatsby," Tragic tale of a war veteran trying to get his young love back.
","I saw the earlier 'Gatsby' movie with Robert Redford all those many years ago, and I don't remember much about it. Now I have to re-watch it to compare, but I believe the basic story is faithful to the book.Leonardo DiCaprio is Jay Gatsby. That isn't his real name, at least it wasn't the one he had for most of his life. Growing up rural and poor he eventually left home, encountered a sailor, and from the older man learned how to become a 'gentleman' in modern society. But when the older man died, and the surviving family inherited all the money, Gatsby moved on with his new, more sophisticated name. At some point as a young adult he fell in love with pretty Carey Mulligan as Daisy. But when he went off to war they lost contact, and she married to become Daisy Buchanan. Her husband is Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, a wealthy man, some called him 'the polo player', living in a mansion on a bay on Long Island.So after a few introductory scenes that I found a bit unclear and disjointed, the story became Gatsby's quest to regain the love of Daisy. It is 1922. His method was to get very rich, ostensibly via illegal commerce, and buy the even more ostentatious mansion across the bay. Here New Yorkers would come often for lavish parties, with entertainment, all without invitations. Gatsby hoped one of those parties would bring Daisy back to him.Tobey Maguire also has a key role as Nick Carraway, a writer whom Gatsby had befriended, and who tells much of the story from a doctor's office.It is important to remember this is a Baz Luhrman film, and as such has a certain look and pace to it. I enjoyed it after the opening scenes were passed and the story began in earnest.Spoilers: As we know the story ends tragically. Gatsby tries very hard to get Daisy to admit she never loved Tom, that she still loves Gatsby, that she will divorce Tom and they will go away to a new life. But a gas station man mistakenly believes Gatsby was having an affair with his wife (Isla Fischer), when it really was Tom, so he shoots and kills Gatsby, ending his dream of getting Daisy back.",Null,0,2,16 October 2013
The Proposal," Cute movie, entertaining with Bullock and Reynolds.
","For me this is the kind of movie that depends heavily on the actors chosen for the parts. For example, if someone like Will Ferrell had played the part of Andrew Paxton, it would not have been a very good movie at all. But it is a good movie, with Bullock and Reynolds, funny and with an interesting story.Sandra Bullock is hard-driving publishing house boss Margaret Tate. Her assistant who puts up with all the crap she can sling his way is Ryan Reynolds as Andrew Paxton. He wants badly to get a promotion to editor and a situation arises that just might give him his big break.Margaret is Canadian, working in NY on a visa. But when she goes out of the country without approval, for an important business deal immigration doesn't like it. Now she must go back to Canada, and wait a year, unemployed, to regain her status. Unless ... she marries an American.So that in essence is what the movie is about. She essentially blackmails Andrew, he will be out of a job is he doesn't agree to marry her, and if he does marry her he will get the big promotion.Most of the movie is set at Andrew's family home, a large estate on the water outside Sitka Alaska. Seems that his family is very wealthy, own quite a chunk of the businesses in Sitka, but Andrew wanted to go away and make a name for himself.Mary Steenburgen is good as Andrew's mom, Grace Paxton. And Craig T. Nelson is good as his dad, Joe Paxton. His grandmother is Betty White as Grandma Annie, celebrating her 90th birthday, and that is the reason they travel back to Alaska.The funniest scene is when Margaret forgot to get a towel, and is walking across the bedroom floor naked as Andrew is also walking naked, and they surprise each other and end up on the floor.MAJOR SPOILERS, for my recollection. As the wedding ceremony is happening in the old barn, a traditional family wedding location, Margaret is overcome with guilt and confesses everything, and the wedding is stopped. She arrives in her NY office, and is cleaning everything out to leave immediately for Canada, but Andrew shows up. He has fallen in love with her and wants to marry her. She is scared, but agrees and the movie ends with them hugging as office personnel cheer them on.",Null,0,0,3 November 2009
Shark Tale," Beautiful animation, superb sound track, but only a so-so story.
","The past six years or so have spawned a new genre of animated movie, the super realistic, super sharp, almost 3-D computerized animation. So any movie like this one, 'Shark Tale', will automatically get compared to all the others in the genre. For me it falls near the bottom of that heap. Not that I didn't enjoy it, because I did. But the story itself, of a vegetarian shark, offspring of a shark 'Don' who wants him to be able to kill like all the other sharks, isn't very interesting. It is there just to provide cute and mostly funny episodes involving the fish that live in an underwater community that looks amazingly like Times Square in Manhattan. But the animation and colors are beautiful, and watching the movie just to marvel at that aspect is enough for most of us. My advice, watch it for the beauty, and don't worry about the story itself.The voice acting features quite a fine cast, including Will Smith as Oscar, who works at a whale wash business, and whose job is to clean the tongue. How low can you get?? Robert De Niro is Don Lino, the old papa shark. Ren√©e Zellweger is Angie, who works at the whale wash also, is sweet on Oscar but doesn't get much attention. Jack Black is Lenny, the young shark who can't bring himself to eat anything alive. The story is two-fold -- how does Lenny get acceptance from his father, and how does Oscar come to discover true love? Angelina Jolie is the sexy Lola, and Today Show hostess Katie Couric does a good turn as Katie Current, a news reporter. Not much of a stretch, but she does a fine job. Other voices of note include Martin Scorsese and Peter Falk.",Null,1,3,13 February 2005
13 Hours," 'Remove all my clothes. Check for bleeds.' - badly wounded mercenary
","I watched this on DVD from my public library, my wife didn't watch it.The Benghazi attacks have been in the news the past year because the partisan Republicans have nothing better to do than conduct witch hunt after witch hunt, finding nothing else but what had already been reported in the various investigations. It is a shame that they chose to politicize this. The movie is good but long, in many respects just another 'war is hell' movie. One can probably get all they need by watching the first 45 minutes then the last 15 minutes right before the credits, essentially turning a 145 minute movie into a 60 minute movie.The first 45 minutes sets the stage, showing how dangerous a place Benghazi is, and how the CIA and their contract mercenaries operate. On September 11th, 2012, most in the compound are having a leisurely day, several of them talking back home via Skype with family. Then in the early evening all hell breaks loose as terrorists, angry at the USA, storm the compound. One of the dead was the Ambassador. This is a very serious act in terms of USA - Libya relations, it is commonly accepted that Ambassadors and their staff are safe, but the Libyan government simply did not have the system in place to protect them. The country quickly apologized and made it clear that terrorists were responsible.The last 15 minutes shows the fighting ending and the evacuation of the survivors and the dead. Again, war is hell, no matter if it is against a country or against terrorists.",Null,1,7,8 July 2016
Hustle & Flow," You know, it's hard out there for a pimp.
","I wouldn't say that a movie about pimps and Ho's is exactly my favorite kind of entertainment, but if it had been, this is a superb pimp and ho movie. Set in N. Memphis, it takes us right into that world, and why people stay in those 'jobs.' I even began to like 'rap' a bit after seeing it. At least I had a better appreciation for how it is created, when a good part of the middle was spent on how they put together that mesmerizing song, 'You know it's hard out there for a pimp.'Terrence Howard was nominated for Best Actor, for his role as Djay. I have been a fan of Howard's since I fist saw him in 'The Best Man', and wished he had played Ali, instead of Will Smith. I also wish Howard had been awarded Best Actor, because in my mind he won it with this gripping performance as a pimp who didn't really want to do that for the rest of his life. As well as his bottom ho.At best, Djay was a small time pimp, riding around and parking with his cute and tiny ho Nola (superbly played by Taryn Manning). He would drum up business $20 at a time, and back at the apartment had a pregnant ho Shug (Taraji Henson) that couldn't work right then. As hard as Djay appeared on the outside, there was an inner tenderness inside that had him taking care of Shug. And, when Nola said she wanted to do something better, but didn't know what, Djay didn't slap her around, instead asked her what she wanted to do. Also, when Djay and Nola happened in on a recording session inside a church, we see a big tear stream down Djay's face. A gentle man seemingly trapped inside his job as a pimp and minor drug dealer.But Djay had a bigger vision, and it was rap. With the help of his friend, who was a recording specialist, he wrote some lyrics and made a demo tape. Needing a 'hook', his pregnant girl Shug sang the background chorus. But all didn't go smoothly, the microphone was cheap and distorted his sound, so they had to find a better one. Again, Nola came in handy, to get the pawn shop owner to cut Djay a deal, but Nola hated being used that way.Rapper Ludicrous plays a famous rapper and former N. Memphis resident Skinny Black, who now had become a record mogul and was back visiting for July 4th. Djay figured that if he could get close to Skinny, have him play the demo, he would get onto the radio and his career jump-started. But it didn't quite work out that way, but you have to admire the hustle that Djay put on. All in all an excellent movie about a very unattractive subject. It is a story about redemption, even if it is not all the way back to respectability. And Howard's performance alone is a reason to see it.MAJOR SPOILERS. When Djay goes to the men's room and finds Skinny passed out on the floor, he first tries to help him to the toilet, then realizes Skinny threw the demo tape into the toilet. Angry, Djay began to beat him about the face, when one of Skinny's handlers came in, drew a gun, Djay got Skinny's gun, wounded one man, managed to get out of the nightclub, but the police were waiting when he got home. While being arrested he told Nola to take the demo tapes and get them played. She was 'in charge.' Convicted, Djay spent a year in prison, but became known for his song. Nola had found her 'other' career, she had dressed up in a smart but short business suit, and marketed his tape, and his career was waiting for him as he left prison.

Warm Bodies," Finally! A zombie movie that is clever, interesting, and funny.
","I came across the DVD of this movie from my public library, and coincidentally my wife was reading the novel on her Kindle E-reader. After we watched the movie, I looked at the extras on the DVD. The main producer who pushed to make the book into the movie, getting financing and a writer/director also read it first on her Kindle. Welcome to the electronic age!This is not your usual zombie movie, being told from the zombies' perspective. As it starts out, an infection has spread and now the last band of 'normal' people live in a city with a high, guarded wall. But Brit Nicholas Hoult as R (as a zombie, he can't remember his name, only that it started with the letter 'R') seems a bit different. At a short battle in a lab, R is angered when he is shot at, so he grabs the guy and eats his brain. Eating a person's brain has the effect of the zombie sharing all that person's memories, so he realizes that the blonde in the lab is the dead man's girlfriend.Aussie Teresa Palmer is that blond, Julie , who is terrified, but R manages to mumble out that he will see that she is kept safe. And he leads her out of there, to his own place of residence, an old abandoned jet liner on the tarmac of an abandoned airport. Gradually she learns to trust him.In the meantime, as R is losing some of his zombie qualities, it is also rubbing off on some of the other zombies, particularly his friend, fellow zombie Rob Corddry as M . (Side note, there is a strong 'Romeo and Juliet' element in parts of the story, and in a key scene Julia is on a balcony looking down at R. It can be presumed Julia and R represent Juliet and Romeo, while R's friend M represents Romeo's friend Murcutio, and so on.) The other key character is John Malkovich as Grigio, Julie's dad who seems to be in charge of protecting the walled-in city. This is an excellent movie, the writing is very clever, and we laughed often. The acting is also superb, especially Hoult playing the zombie 'R' as he gradually goes from grunting to saying a word or two, to eventually speaking, as he became more human. A very entertaining movie.",Null,1,3,20 July 2013
Sully," Great recreation of the 2009 Miracle on the Hudson.
","We saw this at home on DVD from Netflix. Plain DVD, no extras. I remember the original incident clearly and it doesn't seem like almost 8 years ago. It only seems like 2 or 3 years ago, when 'Sully' in command of his plane lost both engines from bird collisions shortly after takeoff and had only a few seconds to decide to try to return to the airport or to try to make a safe landing on the Hudson River in NYC harbor. Sully was an experienced pilot of 42 years, a cool head when things go wrong, just what you need in that situation. After barely 35 seconds of deliberation and finding alternate landing strips he judged that he did not have enough altitude and air speed to glide to an airport. He chose to land on the water.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the fine cast features Tom Hanks, well- chosen to play Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, and Aaron Eckhart playing his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles. Yes the movie does include a recreation of the landing in the water, the subsequent evacuation personally managed by Sully, and the rescue by harbor boats and helicopters. But we all knew that, more importantly the movie covers what we never had a chance to know.It deals with the FAA hearings and what seemed like an attempt to place the blame on pilot error, that Sully in fact could have and should have returned to one of the two landing strip possibilities rather than landing in the Hudson. The FAA had engineering calculations and flight simulator runs with real pilots that showed he could have landed safely.All in all a fine, worthwhile movie that pays proper tribute to the right pilot in that particular situation to assure the survival of all 155 aboard.(Side note: Anna Gunn was one of the FAA officials at the hearings but I could only look at her and think of Walter White's wife in 'Breaking Bad.') SPOILERS: At the hearing Sully spoke up, he couldn't believe the FAA investigators failed to consider the human element, the time it took after the bird strikes to size up the options and choose one. After all the pilots who, in the simulator, made safe landings had as many as 17 practice runs first. Then they added 35 seconds between the bird hits and the decisions to go back to either Laguardia or to Teterboro. Each time they crash landed short of the runways, proving Sully had made the only decision that would have saved the lives of the people onboard.",Null,0,0,28 December 2016
Cinderella Man," Inspiring story of a boxer who was a husband, father, and gentleman first.
","Superb movie!!I am not a boxing fan, and I didn't take the time to look up the actual biography of Jim Braddock. But knowing it is an Opie film, I suspect it is pretty accurate. We have seen so many spoiled, brash athletes, sometimes even criminal, it is refreshing to see that you can be a top fighter and still be a gentle, humble man. When something good happened, he may just say, 'Well maybe it was the luck of the Irish.'Russell Crowe was already established as one of the very best actors working today, and this role as Jim Braddock is no exception. As he did in 'The Insider' and 'The Beautiful Mind', the character he becomes is believable, no longer the actor Crowe. Ren√©e Zellweger also shines as the caring wife and mother Mae Braddock. Paul Giamatti is his manager, Joe Gould, in a very effective performance. Braddock was one of the best fighters in the mid- to late-1920s, but the depression hit him hard as it did most everyone. He had invested his winnings in the stock market, to provide a secure future for his family, and lost it all. Occasionally getting day work, he was barely able to keep heat in the apartment and food on the table. He broke his hand in a fight, and lost the confidence of promoters. At one point, just to save his family, he went to former associates and literally begged to get a few dollars together to turn the heat and lights back on. All though this he didn't complain, he knew it wasn't anyone's fault, he just did the best he could.Then, a bit old for the ring, in the mid-1930s got a chance for a fight when one opponent came up injured. Surprising everyone, he won, and later became contender for the world championship. A scene shows him going back through the welfare line, to re-pay the money that had been given to him when he was indigent. In the title match, he was matched against Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who had actually killed a man in the ring. SPOILERS. The movie ends with that fight. It was a 15-rounder, as history knows Braddock won the fight in a unanimous decision, A very well choreographed fight. Braddock went on to be a successful businessman.",Null,1,3,31 December 2005
Valkyrie," Very fine account of one of the many Hitler assassination attempts.
","Quite by coincidence I watched two Nazi-related movies on successive nights, first 'The Reader' and now this one, 'Valkyrie.' Both different, both excellent.As we have been able to reflect on the aftermath of WW II (I was born right after it ended) it is clear that Hitler had many enemies in his own country. As far back as 1938 and continuing through the mid-1940s there were a number of attempts to assassinate him, by his own soldiers. As history tells us they all failed, but mercifully Hitler took his own life at the end of the war.'Valkyrie' is a Wagner composition, but also a code word for a military contingency plan in Nazi Germany. Tom Cruise is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, seriously wounded in 1943 in North Africa fighting, and now viewed as a military hero back in Germany. He is one of many who realize that Hitler is misguided and worry that if they don't do something to stop him it will result in the end of Germany and Europe as they knew it, as the Allies were getting closer to victory.This movie contains a good number of established stars in key roles, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Thomas Kretschmann, Terence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard.The story recounts, with suitable historical accuracy, one of the attempts on Hitler's life, with Von Stauffenberg as the key driver of the effort. It is an absorbing glimpse into 1940s Nazi Germany and the different factions, those with absolute loyalty to Hitler and those seeking ways to oust him.SPOILERS: Of course the assassination attempt chronicled here failed, the small bomb went off and Stauffenberg escaped the encampment, but the heavy map table shielded Hitler well enough that he survived the blast with only relatively minor injuries. Thinking Hitler was indeed dead the rebels initiated the revised Valkyrie plan to usurp power, but were fairly quickly arrested, tried, and executed.",Null,7,7,27 May 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Cute little movie for Homer Simpson fans. I enjoyed it.
","The Simpson family live in Springfield. Environmental awareness is the subject here, and the town lake is becoming polluted. Somehow weird Homer gets a pet pig, and ends up with a large tank of pig poop in his yard. When Marge asks how that little pig could have filled it up so fast, Homer answers 'I helped.' A crisis arises when Homer decides he needs to get rid of the pig poop quickly, so driving through barricades he sends it into the lake waters, immediately turning everything toxic. The whole town gets after him and his family, they narrowly escape but then the president, Schwartzenneger decides to isolate Springfield by having dozens of helicopters with suction cups fly a large transparent dome over the town and drop it in place, making it impossible for anyone to escape.SPOILERS: Later the president gets talked into an even more drastic plan, a bomb is suspended into the dame through a hole, it will go off in 15 minutes to destroy all the city and the people. But Homer saves the day by riding a motorcycle round and round the dome, higher and higher, until Bart on his back is able to sling the bomb out. It exploded on the outside of the dome, which shatters, and rains down on all.",Null,0,1,26 December 2007
Alien: Covenant," This has become my favorite 'Alien' movie, interesting and gripping all the way.
","Ridley Scott directed this, if you look at his body of work he seems to specialize in big, sweeping movies and this one fits in that category. While I enjoyed all the previous 'Alien' movies after seeing this one it has become my favorite, for the overall story, the cinematography, and the sound track. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library.It opens with one of the most magnificent 5-minute scenes ever. Filmed mostly in New Zealand we see two characters in a large all-white room with wide panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a lake with mountains in the background. There is a black grand piano, there is one painting on one wall, there is a small statue of Michelangelo's David, and in the solitary chair a man dressed in all white. The other character questions him, the man in the chair is an intelligent animatronic created by the other man. He takes the name David.Then the movie cuts to a large spaceship the 'Covenant'. It is the year 2104, it is carrying a crew of 15, plus 2000 colonists, and over 1000 cryo- preserved embryos. They are all in a state of suspended animation, headed to a distant planet chosen as the site of a new human colony. They are still a bit over 7 years away. An animatronic man, who looks just like David from the opening scene, cares for continuous operation of the spaceship, but we find out his name is Walter. He speaks to the ship's computer called Mother.Upon deploying the large sail-like solar panels to recharge the ship's energy cells an unexpected burst of solar energy disrupts everything, resulting in the ship's crew coming out of cyro prematurely. The systems are rectified but now they are awake. They get a strange signal, garbled, but one crew member identifies it as a John Denver song. They locate the source and determine it is a nearby planet, Earth-like, and after some deliberation decide to divert to there. (Would a real expedition do that? Unlikely, but let's go with it for the entertainment.) And that is where all the action really begins. Michael Fassbender is his usual superb self at creating two different roles, the initial David with a British accent and the later Walter, a later and improved model, with an American accent. The movie of course has a number of good actors but it all depends on Fassbender.SPOILERS - read at your own risk. It turns out that the music source was a crashed ship from an expedition some years earlier, when they encounter David he tells them how they all died but we eventually find out he was lying, and he was responsible for their deaths, and subsequently experimenting with breeding and hybridizing new forms of aliens. This originated in the opening scene all those years earlier when David and his creator discussed 'creation' and where did various species come from? David had become a creator. As the movie ends and the aggressive aliens have been fought off, the remaining crew and colonists head again for the original destination we see what appears to be Walter attending to everything but it was in fact David, who also brought aboard some alien embryos. This sets up for the sequel which, according to IMDb, is now in the planning stages.",Null,2,4,21 September 2017
Draft Day," NFL draft day, Costner is the GM facing difficult choices.
","This movie depicts one day, NFL draft day. This is where each team hopes to get the one or two college players that will help them get to the Superbowl, and where the top college prospects hole to become instant multi-millionaires. The movie includes many who really are in football, including the NFL commissioner playing himself, so I choose to believe that what it portrays, while fictional is also plausible.Kevin Costner is Sonny Weaver Jr., his father the former Cleveland Browns coach died very recently, and as Browns General Manager is faced with the #1 pick resulting from their dismal record the season before. The Heisman winner is quarterback 'Bo' and everyone, including the owner, assumes that Sonny will pick him.But as anyone who follows pro football knows, many trades are made on draft day, sometimes just minutes before a pick needs to be made, and that is largely what is depicted here. Sonny is not sure that 'Bo' is the best pick for Cleveland, they have a good QB (Tom Welling of Smallville fame) that was injured last year and he seems to be stronger than ever after recuperation.The other key character is Jennifer Garner who, in spite of the 17- yr age difference in real life, is Sonny's love interest. But also the person who looks after the Browns payroll and balances salaries so as not to exceed the salary cap. Also Dennis Leary is good as the coach. But this is a Costner movie all the way and he is good in his role as the GM with his own view of the draft day scene, who gets what he wants and what his team needs, but has to do it with a series of unexpected trades.Good movie!!",Null,2,2,13 September 2014
The Wizard of Oz," A comment to the few absurd reviews and silly questions.
","I just finished reading most of the 100+ IMDb reviews of 'Wizard of Oz.' It is clear that the vast majority of reviewers rate this as one of the best films of all time, an evaluation I agree with. But there are a small few reviews which criticize it harshly. And some just ask simple questions. The following addresses this.SPOILER - First off, once you've seen the entire film you realize the whole visit to Oz was Dorothy's dream. During the storm a window frame blew into her bedroom and knocked her out. The house was not swept up by the tornado. When the storm passed, and everyone else came out of the storm cellar looking for Dorothy, they found her on her bed, unconscious. While she was unconscious she had the dream of going to Oz. All the strange people she met, all the strange places, were all things she imagined. It was all set up during the first 10 minutes or so, in conversations with her family members, and the fortune teller she met when she attempted to run away right before the storm.Why dream of going to Oz? Recall that Dorothy was being hassled by the wicked rich woman who wanted to kill her dog, and family members wouldn't give her the time to talk about anything. They were all too busy. She sang about finding a place 'over the rainbow' where everything would be wonderful. When we go to sleep with a lot on our mind, we often have very vivid dreams about it. Her dream of Oz was the playing out of her imaginary place over the rainbow. But her dream eventually made her realize that such a place was not where happiness resided, but instead within her and her family, 'there's no place like home.' And then, she woke up.So, do all of us dream too?  Sure we do, if we are normal. Do all things in our dreams make sense once we wake up?  Of course not. Then why should we expect anything different of Dorothy's dream? Why didn't the good witch tell her early on she could get back to Kansas by clicking her heels? Because there was no good witch. It was all part of Dorothy's dream, therefore she would have to get angry at herself. Now, do you see the absurdity in criticizing any part of the movie's plot? Or talking of 'plot holes?' Dreams are dreams, and are not expected to bear a strong relationship to reality.I don't believe everyone should consider 'Wizard of Oz' a great film. Tastes differ. I don't think 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Lord of the Rings' are great films. But I do believe everyone should realize when certain comments just don't make sense. Because it was a dream, the story cannot have plot holes. Why could the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion talk? Because it was a dream. The dream of a 15-year-old girl.  Accept that, and any questions you may have suddenly make perfect sense.",Null,5,7,19 August 2002
The Soloist," Heartwarming true story about a homeless man who makes nice music.
","This movie has two of my favorite actors playing the two primary roles. So I would have found it interesting no matter what else it may have had. But I am also a musician, and fact-based stories about musicians always grab me and hold on.Instead of a blockbuster movie this could well have simply been made into a documentary, using the real homeless musician and the real LA Times reporter who brought his situation to the attention of the rest of the world. Since they chose to make a movie with actors I suppose there is a fair amount of dramatization added to the bare facts. In a short DVD extra where the musician and the reporter speak, they each seem a lot more 'normal' that was portrayed in the movie.Still, I enjoyed it greatly. Jamie Foxx is Nathaniel Ayers, formerly in the 1970s at Juliard, but he left in his second year. He has become homeless, living where he can, and playing music on an old violin with only two strings.Robert Downey Jr. is LA Times reporter Steve Lopez who appears to be running low on good story ideas. When he happens to encounter this man, playing a 2-stringed violin, he decides it would make a good story. At this point he had no care for the man, just for himself. However as he found out more, and got to know the man he began to take a more personal interest.Good movie, and much more complex characters than it first seems. Foxx is superb, in another award-quality performance.",Null,0,0,12 August 2009
Rock Star," Good story, imperfectly done, but very entertaining.
","SPOILERS - Even though not great, by any measure, we enjoyed this film very much, Wahlberg and Anniston giving very nice performances. It's median rating of '7' is about right.  Walhberg is a copier repairman in Pittsburgh, but also lead singer for a 'tribute' band copying the Steel Dragons. Meanwhile the 'Dragons' are firing their lead singer, get wind of Wahlberg, audition him, and hire him as he takes the name 'Izzy.' Reportedly this closely parallels what had happened to a real rock band in the 80s.
The film is about Izzy's transformation. He goes from frustrated 'tribute' singer only wanting to copy his heros, to the lead singer and hero himself, to wanting to write his own songs, to quitting when he realizes his direction is wrong. And the band leaders will not let him participate in writing.During his months with the Steel Dragons he becomes a person even he doesn't like, loses his girlfriend, Anniston, stays stoned most of the time, participates in meaningless sex.  After he quits, they meet up and presumably resume their love relationship. The transformation complete.It's a good story which has a moral and ends well. The music, and DVD soundtrack, are good throughout.  Although Wahlberg does some of his own singing, a better singer 'assists' and at critical times the sound track transitions seamlessly from one to the other, so that it really looks like Wahlberg is doing all his own singing.  Good production, nicely entertaining, some nudity and blue language.",Null,0,1,15 February 2002
The Martian," Help is only 140 million miles away. For Mark Watney, stranded on Mars.
","We viewed this on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are first-rate.The premise is somewhere in the 2030s we have advanced our space exploration to successful missions to Mars. While one is underway a large, unforecast storm comes up on Mars requiring the crew of 6 to cut the mission short and use the escape rocket to blast off and rendezvous with the main space ship orbiting Mars. But one of the crew, Mark Watney, is hit by a large object and carried away, injured and out of communications. Reluctantly they have to blast off without him after a short search was futile. Mark was presumed dead.But Matt Damon as Mark Watney didn't give up so easily, he managed to get himself to a base station and using medical tools and staples repaired his wounds and set about trying to figure out how to survive with limited resources. Fortunately with rations for 6 he was able to make food stretch, and as a Botanist even came up with a method to make water and, using his own waste as fertilizer, used a Thanksgiving package of potatoes to grow potatoes in a chamber converted to a greenhouse of sorts.So much of the movie is about Mark's survival, plus his figuring out a way, using old abandoned Mars exploration robots, to communicate with NASA. The real hard part becomes how to plan and carry out a rescue mission. Mars is far away, it takes a long time, he has limited time to survive.The cast is varied and good, with Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis, the commander of the mission. Kristen Wiig in a serious role as a NASA communications officer, Jeff Daniels as Teddy Sanders, the NASA chief, Michael Pe√±a as Rick Martinez, the pilot for the mission, Kate Mara as one of the crew, a computer expert, Beth Johanssen, among others.This is a really good and entertaining movie. It is a serious subject but is treated with appropriate humor. EDIT: I re-watched it 8 days later and enjoyed it as much the second time!SPOILERS: When the first rescue approach failed in a faulty rocket launch, a young data nerd calculated, using NASA's super computer, that the crew on their way back to Earth could accelerate and using the Earth slingshot return to Mars, but it would require a risky capture of a re-supply module and a never-rehearsed module take-off from Mars to try to capture Watney in a Mars fly-by. NASA said no to the risk but the crew decided on their own to try the rescue. That whole last scene was very tense and of course it was a success.",Null,4,8,5 February 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," This is a really good movie, what is 'justice' all about?
","A trait of a really good movie is it keeps your interest by wondering what is going to be the next development. This one does that really well. When you learn everything there is to learn most would consider the developments implausible, if not impossible, but put that aside and you enjoy a good story with interesting dialog and good acting.Gerard Butler (who also is one of the producers) is Philadelphia family man Clyde Shelton. As the movie opens his home is invaded and two men bind and stab him and his wife, and take their young daughter. The wife and daughter die, but Clyde survives.The men are arrested, and the badder of the two strikes a bargain with the DA, in exchange for testimony which will send his partner to the death chamber, he will only get a 3rd degree murder sentence, which means he could be back on the streets in 5 years or so.Jamie Foxx is the prosecutor Nick Rice, probably the best in the DA's office, and probably next in line for DA. But Nick is proud of his record, when someone cites his '95% conviction rate' he quickly corrects him, '96%.' So it is clearly established that Nick also has his own image in mind, he hates the thought of losing a case. So that is why he struck the deal and maybe circumvented real justice.But when Clyde met with Nick, where Nick was trying to convince Clyde that this plea deal was good, because at trial they risk losing, Clyde had trouble accepting that. He was there, he saw what happened, he could testify. Finally Nick told Clyde the deal had been made already, and he had to accept that. That didn't sit well with Clyde who realizes Nick is putting his own interests ahead of justice.So that all happens early and sets up the real story, what is justice and is our justice system working the way it is designed? Will Clyde, a law-abiding citizen, accept that or will he take justice into his own hands? Well he has to, otherwise there would be no movie.Good movie, makes you think.SPOILERS FOLLOW: Very quickly we see the executed prisoner die a very painful death, and then after he gets out of jail Clyde cons the other man into a trap where Clyde, dressed as a police officer, kidnaps him and slowly tortures him as the dismembers him until death. But that is just the beginning of Clyde's revenge. A smartest of the smart, a former best of the best at secret operations, he systematically carries out a plan to wreak havoc within the Philadelphia government, and killing everyone who had even a peripheral involvement in his case. He purposely gets put in jail, then into solitary, to carry out his plans. Everyone is puzzled, how can this man in prison cause these murders?MAJOR SPOILERS: They finally tracked down that Clyde had bought a number of parcels of dilapidated property, and one of them is adjacent to the prison. In preparation for his revenge he had dug a number of tunnels into prison cells, including one into his solitary cell. Equipped with sophisticated gadgets and uniforms, he would escape in disguise and carry out his deeds. The final one, would take out Nick, the major, and others with a cell-activated bomb, with napalm-like effects. But Nick figured it out in time, and was waiting for Clyde when he returned to his cell. He tried to talk Clyde out of it, don't make the call, don't wreak more havoc. But Clyde did anyway, and as Nick exited the cell, Clyde realized the bomb had been moved and now was under his cot. He dialed his own death.",Null,0,2,5 May 2010
High Fidelity," A John Cusack vehicle, screenplay and star, about learning to commit.
","John Cusack co-wrote the screenplay and starred in 'High Fidelity', as a record-store owner in Chicago who had endless 'top 5 lists' about almost everything, but found himself in a series of relationships that went nowhere. Inside he was a very unhappy person. The story is about his character and how he finally realized that fantasies are just that, and happiness depends on one's ability to accept reality and 'commit.'The movie has a number of famous actors in 'cameo' roles that are essential to the plot development - Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bruce Springsteen, are the ones I remember.Cusack's love interest is played by a foreign actress whose name I can't pronounce. It is interesting that two female 'American' characters were played by foreign actresses, who did a good job but always sounded like foreign actresses playing Americans, if you know what I mean. Slightly distracting.The DVD has a number of interesting extras, including good interviews with the director and Cusack. Plus, the deleted scenes add some enjoyment.I give this movie an 8 of 10, but that is a high 8. It is a good story and Cusack does his usual fine job of playing a quirky character.",Null,1,3,20 September 2000
Up in the Air," Clooney in a serious role, a study on the meaning of life.
","George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, the number one road man for a company that specializes in firing people. The people don't work for his company, but his company is hired to fire them and then spend 6 to 12 months to help them re-direct their careers. (Some of the characters seen being fired are not actors, instead they are people who really had been fired recently.)Ryan is happy with his life. His 'home' is the airplane, the hotel, the constant traveling. When he shows up, yet again, the staff knows him by name. He has a goal, he hesitates to tell about it, to reach 10 Million traveler miles. Not that he wants to go anywhere else, he just wants the satisfaction of achieving that milestone. He would become only the 7th person to do so, and his name would be added to the side of a plane.He was happy, but his life had no substance. It was all fluff, even though he was very good at his job, actually being able to make fired employees feel good about the situation. He gave seminars on 'how full is your backpack', urging attendants to get rid of unnecessary things and relationships to walk easier through life. But he does have one vice, a girlfriend road warrior whom he meets periodically. Vera Farmiga is that girlfriend, Alex Goran.All that sets up the main of the movie, where a young new MBA, Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, joins the company and convinces the boss that they can save lots of time and travel expense by using video conferencing to fire people, no need to do it face-to-face. Jason Bateman is the boss, Craig Gregory. There are a few other side stories involving Ryan's sisters and one of their weddings, but the meat of the story is Ryan, how he eventually realizes that his life is very empty, and even if he can convince his boss that they need to travel, his life will still be empty. Good movie.SPOILERS: At some point, while dealing with the new girl and some fired employee issues, he starts to realize the emptiness of his life. He starts to mend that by inviting Alex to be his date at his sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Then, in a spontaneous moment he travels to Chicago, and rings the doorbell at Alex's home, only to find she is married and has children, something they never discussed.

From Here to Eternity," From 'Here' (1941 Pearl Harbor) to 'Eternity' (war and death).
","This was the darling of 1953, winning a whole slew of Oscars and several more nominations. One of the Oscars went to Sinatra for Best Supporting Actor. Most of us remember Sinatra for his singing but he was a fine actor with 64 roles credited to him.This story takes place in Hawaii in 1941 on an Army base, just a few months before the eventual December 7th surprise attack of Pearl Harbor, the event that got the USA into WW2 against the Japanese. There is a boxing theme running through it, with the military championships scheduled for December 15th, and we know that will be upstaged.Burt Lancaster in his early 40s is the lead as Sgt. Milton Warden. He is confident and runs a tight ship, but he also has his eye on the pretty girls, one in particular, the wife of his commanding officer. It seems pretty well known that the officer routinely cheats on his wife so that makes the pursuit somewhat logical. Deborah Kerr in her early 30s plays that woman, Karen Holmes. The second main story involves Montgomery Clift as Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a former boxer who quit after a man he knocked over was badly injured and lost his sight. So he was transferred to Hawaii and ceaselessly harassed by men in his platoon trying to get him to change his mind and fight on the team.In his Oscar role Frank Sinatra was Angelo Maggio, a little guy with a big heart but who drank too much. In a bar another man, Ernest Borgnine as Sgt. 'Fatso' Judson, insulted Angelo's mother so Angelo hit Fatso over the head with a chair. The fight was broken up but later when Angelo was thrown in the brig for deserting his guard post, under the 'care' of Fatso, it eventually led to Angelo's death.The last scenes in the movie depict the attack of December 7th and it appears that some real news footage of the attack was used.Several good stories are woven in and while I haven't seen the movies this was competing against I can understand why it was then and still is considered such a timeless movie.",Null,2,4,24 August 2015
Atonement," Epic period piece spanning 65 years, starting in the 1930s England.
","Atonement: compensation for a wrong.The story is not always linear, but in total spans from around 1934 when Briony Tallis, future author, is around 11, to around 2000 when she is 77, dying, and announces that she has written her last of 21 novels. She says, in a real sense, it is her first since she began thinking of it since she was a young girl. The movie is made mostly from Briony's perspective. Saoirse Ronan is Briony Tallis at age 13, living in a mansion in rural England in 1935. Her older sister is Keira Knightley as Cecilia Tallis. The third member of the 'love triangle' is James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, son of the Tallis household's maid. He is treated much like a family member and even his schooling is financed by them. His mother is Brenda Blethyn as Grace Turner.Briony is smart and demanding, and fashions herself as an author, writing her first play at 13. But she also is secretly in love with Robbie who just treats her as a younger sister. We see a flashback to when Briony was 11 or 12 (her words) and she jumps into a pond to have him 'save' her.But Robbie and Cecilia are the ones who really are falling in love with each other. Something happens at a fountain, Briony sees it from afar, doesn't understand what happened, and comes away with a bad feeling against Robbie, partly because in her young mind feels cheated by him. So, when something else comes up later that evening, she takes it out on Robbie and it has a lasting affect.So the rest of the movie is about Briony eventually learning the truth, and doing what she can for atonement, trying to make right her wrong. Good movie, even touching on the conflicts in France in the early 1940s part of WW II. August 2013 update: I just watched it again, it is better than I had remembered it, very good on repeat viewing.SPOILERS: Briony's wrong was naming Robbie as the man she saw that night apparently raping a teenage house guest in the field. As a result Robbie was imprisoned, and after 3 1/2 years got out only because he agreed to enlist in the Army and fight. So his and Cecilia's romance was effectively ended. But later Briony found that the 'rapist' and the teenager got married, meaning it probably wasn't a rape at all. Unfortunately both Robbie and Cecilia, now a nurse, both died as a result of the war, but in 'atonement' Briony gave them happiness and a life together in her final book, 'Atonement', that was the only gift she could give to them, after their deaths.",Null,3,4,4 April 2008
V for Vendetta," Superb movie of the graphic novel.
","It is the somewhat near future, the USA has virtually destroyed itself in civil wars, and England has come to be ruled by a political machine that is closer to being a dictatorship. But there is one man who has survived some of the past atrocities and is determined to set things right again, his own way. He simply goes by 'V' and his is a grand Vendetta. Whether a viewer likes this movie depends on what they are looking for. My wife didn't care that much for it, but I really enjoyed it. It isn't as stylized as, for example, 'Sin City', but to me has more of a 'Batman' feel to it. You know that what you are seeing is not to be taken literally, and much of it is social commentary on the dangers of government taking over the 'freedoms' of the citizens.Natalie Portman is into her mid 20s now and a serious young actress. This is a good role for her, as Evey Hammond whose mother and father both fell victim to the government. She meets 'V' (Hugo Weaving, Neo's nemesis in the Matrix) near the beginning of the movie, on November 5th, as they listen to a concert of sorts, while they view the Old Bailey being blown up, all orchestrated by 'V'. The movie ends one year later, on November 5th. I like the mask that 'V' wears, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker' face, but this mask never comes off, and appears to be bullet proof. The cast contains a whole host of fine British actors, including Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich, John Hurt as the evil Chancellor Adam Sutler, and Sin√©ad Cusack as Delia Surridge. The movie contains much violence, much bloodshed, and has some very dark themes. But it is worth a viewing.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As 'V' systematically tracks down and destroys each of the enemies whom he had targeted, and police are looking for Evey, the two of them become companions of sorts. While Evey doesn't approve of all the killing, she begins to sympathize with his cause, and in fact falls in love with him. His final act was to be sending a train loaded with explosives into the Parliament building on November 5th. But as he is dying after the final fight, he walks away and gives Evey the option to pull the lever and start the train. It is, after all, her future world, not his. She does, and the movie ends with a spectacular display. NB - 'V' got his strength and other powers after surviving government virus testing and also a fire, the mask and gloves were partly to cover his disfigurement.",Null,7,13,15 September 2006
The Island," I win the lottery, and I get to go to the 'Island'!
","This is a near-future story, where there are no youngsters, and all the men and women are dressed in sleek white jumpsuits. At unpredictable intervals a lottery is held and the 'winner' gets to go to the island. In their realm, it is the only other safe place, free from deadly 'contamination', and we naturally assume some sort of nuclear disaster has made the outside world unfit.The premise is set up very well, and the viewer's mind is ready for something better. While the movie is entertaining, the middle of it involves too much action just for the sake of action, and the ending unfolds rather predictably, once we know the gist of what is really going on. Good entertainment, with pretty actors (Johansson and McGregor), but overall just another action movie.SPOILERS. Some law has been passed in 2015 that allows use of genetic cloning to make human replacement parts, as long as they don't become 'people.' But the owners of the company find that it doesn't work properly unless they DO become real people, and 'going to the island' really means they will be killed to harvest organs and/or other parts to repair the sick or injured 'sponsor', their identical twin, that owns them. Of course this operation is all highly illegal and concealed underground in an old bunker. When Lincoln 6 Echo (McGregor) and Jordan 2 Delta (Johansson) manage to escape after he figures out what is really going on, they look for their sponsors to seek an expose' of everything, in the process get chased for extermination and half of Los Angeles is destroyed. Finally, against all odds they survive several close calls, make it back to the cloning operation and destroy the place, and free all the living clones.",Null,0,0,21 December 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," '3 Stooges plus Homer's Odyssey' yields this film, according to the Coen brothers.
","Edit, August 2016: I just watched it again after 15 years and it is still a comedic masterpiece. Those Coen brothers sure know how to entertain.**SPOILERS**Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, where Ulysses attempts to return home to his wife, Penelope, and his children after the Trojan war, encountering the Cyclops, the Sirens, and other obstacles, finding tormentors who believed him dead and wanting to marry his wife.In 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', George Clooney plays Ulysses, Holly Hunter plays Penelope (Penny), John Goodman plays the Cyclops (patch over his eye), and three beautiful women washing clothes in the creek play the singing sirens. All-in-all a very well-done film, definitely a comedy, and interesting the way the Coens used the 'Odyssey' as inspiration, even crediting Homer as a co-writer.The film opens in almost black and white, slowly, gradually showing color, first with a light blue sky. The DVD 'extra' showing the filming technique I found highly interesting. To achieve the 'look', all film was scanned and digitized so that images could be properly manipulated. Most of the greens of grass and trees, for example, where made to look almost golden. The colors were de-saturated to give a light pastel rendering, but with normal contrast. Then, all digital images were transferred to film and copies made for theatrical showings.SPOILERS -- Instead of the Trojan war, Ulysses and his men, Pete and Delmer, have just escaped from a depression-era rock-breaking chain gang in Mississippi. Although he was imprisoned for practicing law without a license, he tells the other two men he stole and hid $1.2million, and when they retrieved it they would split it 3 ways. Later he tells them, 'if I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have come with me', and they were all chained together.They get a ride with Babyface ('my name is George') Nelson, and are beneficiaries of a bank robbery. They 'sing into the can' for money, as the 'Foggy Bottom Boys', and later it comes in handy as they get a pardon from the governor. During a picnic, Goodman a giant with a patch over one eye (Cyclops), steals their money. They foil a KKK lynching.Ulysses finally makes his way back to his 'ancestral home', finds Sheriff Cooley (Von Bargen) and his men digging 3 graves, nooses over the branch, when suddenly a great flood sweeps over them all (hydroelectric power), they save themselves holding onto a floating coffin, drives out his wife's tormentors (politician), and the films again fades to black and white, as Penny and Ulysses talk about getting re-married. She had divorced him, telling the children he had been hit by a train, 'Some very important people have been hit by trains.'The DVD is really a superb visual treat, probably being made directly from the digitized images. The surround sound is selectable in either DTS or DD 5.1. I watched it with DTS and the sound is great. As I mentioned above, the extras are a fine addition. Many people will not like this movie. My wife only gave it 30 minutes.On a personal note, it is nice to see Daniel Von Bargen (Cooley) fit and trim, since he had gotten a bit heavy in recent years. Our history goes back to 1969, where he and I were on stage (with a bunch of others) at Purdue for the 28-performance run of the student production of 'Leave It To Jane.'",Null,2,3,4 July 2001
Semi-Pro," A truly awful movie full of dirty humor and very few laughs.
","We got the DVD from our public library. My wife saw 5 minutes of it and left. I watched the whole thing with two college students and we were mostly shaking our heads over how crude and unfunny most of it was. We all know that men, and maybe especially professional sports stars, often gather and discuss women and sex in rather crude ways, but do we need to see that in a movie? Fictional characters talking about various sex acts in graphic terms, just to try to be funny? No, I don't appreciate that kind of attempt at humor, and this movie is full of it.Will Ferrell is Jackie Moon, owner, coach and nominal star of a very mediocre basketball team in the old ABA, set in the year that a few of the ABA teams were to be invited to join the NBA. Moon's team is poor, but they hope that they will be one of the 4 teams chosen if they can finish the season in 4th place or better.Woody Harrelson is Monix, a guard, who they get in a trade for a washing machine. (That was actually the funniest joke of the movie.) Monix is a no-nonsense guy who becomes the defacto coach and whips the team into shape to start winning.But the one bright spot for me was Jackie Earle Haley (little guy of early 'Breaking Away' fame as a 'cutter') as Dukes, who in very unlikely fashion wins a half-time full-court basket toss for $10,000. Unfortunately the team didn't have $10,000 so Dukes is given the standard poster-sized check which he is unable to cash. He is told, 'Try a bigger bank.' We see him several times more.A few laughs but overall a poor movie, just too dirty for the sake of being dirty.",Null,1,1,8 July 2008
Furious 7," 'The thing with street fights, the street always wins.' Toretto
","I have not seen all of the 'Furious' series of movies. But I was a Paul Walker fan since I saw him in 'Pleasantville'. His death in a car crash almost 2 years ago was so close to real life imitating art. Filming for this movie was not yet finished so they had to jump through a few hoops, including using Paul's two brothers as body doubles in unfinished scenes. Plus using some footage and cut footage from prior 'Furious' movies.All in all it works very well, if we had not known of Paul's death we would never have guessed that he was not involved in the whole shoot. Now 'Furious' movies are not for all tastes but when you look at the box office numbers one must recognize the success of the franchise. I like the 'Furious' movies for the absurd action and sound they provide. Plus the actors are all good, the characters all interesting, and the story is good.Vin Diesel, also a producer, is back as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. A new villain is introduced, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw. He is a trained special ops guy who has turned to crime and in particular he is out to get those who put his brother in the hospital. So most of the movie has the good guys chasing Shaw and the men who help support his cause. There is a very cool mountainous chase scene supposedly in Eastern Europe but actually filmed on Pike's Peak in Colorado, both the winding roadway to the summit and the crashes down the mountainside. Michelle Rodriguez is back as Letty, needing to get her memory back. Of course Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs. The cool new character is Kurt Russell as 'Mr. Nobody', providing tactical support for the good guys.SPOILERS: In the end, of course, Toretto gets the best of Shaw, and as the movie draws to a close Shaw is shown being put into a maximum security prison cell. I suspect he will escape and be a villain in a future 'Furious' movie. Plus there is a tribute of sorts to the deceased Paul Walker, we see his body double on the beach with his wife and child, then as he and Toretto are in separate cars, driving side-by-side, conversing with windows down, an aerial shot shows the cars parting as they come to a 'Y' in the road, Walker's car going its own way.",Null,0,3,2 October 2015
The Godfather," Simply a great classic, number one on many lists.
","I was fortunate to see 'The Godfather' back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many 'gangster' movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about 'family' and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have 'The Godfather' as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a 'gang family' movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me 'One From The Heart', shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as 'Peggy Sue Got Married', another 'family' theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. 'The Godfather' is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.",Null,8,14,12 December 2004
