Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Humor Was Overdone
","This movie was done by someone who truly does not understand that there are many different cultures within the former-USSR. Borat is portrayed with a fake Russian accent, when in fact Kazakhstan is not a Slavic country. The movie had a lot of potential. It could have stopped while it had a chance to. It did try to show some of the differences in thinking between two cultures. However, then it became a caricature. It became gross, offensive, and disgusting. This should really offend the people of Kazakhstan. Borat is portrayed as being completely insane and lacking any manners. The movie was funny at moments, but then became disgusting. At some point, I just got annoyed by Borat. He didn't seem funny anymore, just obnoxious. Borat also does a disservice. The audience learns nothing real about Kazakhstan, and is not left with any curiosity to find out more. The movie was revolting and silly.",3,6,13,22 November 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the great adventure films.
","Most of the great adventure films were made a long time prior to 1981 - i.e. - North By Northwest, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and African Queen. This film began the whole modern era of adventure films. This was the great pairing of the minds of Spielberg and Lucas, and it worked. There is greatness in so much of this film. The plot just keeps going and going. There is no time for boredom. There are great characters. There is the gestapo character. There is the crazy French archaeologist. There is the Egyptian friend and archaeologist. And, then there is Indiana Jones. I sense a great deal of mockery and parody within the film as well. There is the scene where Indiana Jones shoots the knife master, instead of fighting him. Allegedly, Ford had a bad stomach ache that day. By cutting out the fight scene, they unwittingly had one of the funniest scenes ever captured on camera. There was the silliness and bureaucracy of governments, who were afraid of the power of the ark, but also intrigued. It was the mixture of adventure, parody, and humor that really makes this one of the greatest adventure films. Indiana Jones definitely was the first modern adventure movie. I don't think that any adventure movie since cannot consider Indy to be anything other than the genesis of all adventure films within the last three decades.",10,0,1,25 December 2007
Minority Report," Tom Cruise role that is not annoying
","About 50% of Tom Cruise's roles are annoying extensions of his personality. However, this one was not one of those. It was a straight acting role by Tom Cruise. He was not 'superhuman', although he did have some pretty incredible escapes. Cruise plays the manager of the Pre-Crimes Division in 2054. In 2054, people are found guilty and punished for a crime before they can commit them. The politicians of the future love this, because DC has zero murders. There are these three people - one female, two male who are kept in a pool in a semi-conscious state. They are able to predict crimes before they happen. Max Von Sydow plays the big boss, who pretends to be his friend. Colin Ferrell plays the young idealist Assistant DA, who thinks that he can come crashing in on the program and find flaws. Unbeknownst to him, Von Sydow's character betrays Cruise's character. He ends up being himself the subject of a manhunt. Allegedly, he is to kill someone he hasn't even met. The movie is not quite as good as Gattaca or Bladerunner, but Spielberg does a good job keeping a tight, entertaining plot. I would say a 7.6 out of 10.",7,1,3,3 May 2007
Training Day," Entertaining Fiction
","This movie is not Donnie Brasco. It is isn't based upon truth. It is more in the spirit of Bad Lieutenant. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, insane cop. If you overlook the implausibility of this movie, it is still quite entertaining. The acting is great. Washington definitely captures a really insane character. Although his portrayal is fictitious, there is a grain of truth. It must be very difficult being a narc in 21st Century L.A. However, even as over-the-top as Washington's portrayal, you realize that a cop could be more dangerous than a criminal, if 'under the radar'. Ethan Hawke is also great as a very good cop, but a little naive. Hawke's character is manipulated and charmed into submission by the Washington's 'evil cop'. The ending of the movie was the best part. Despite having a certain fear of the evil cop's authority, in the end you find out that he was really despised. Hawke's good cop is actually saved in one scene by an earlier act of decency on his part. The evil cop eventually is destroyed and revealed as a power-hungry, sick individual that he truly is. In conclusion, don't expect believability. However, if you want to be entertained, this is a movie to see.",6,1,3,14 February 2007
Mississippi Burning," Stereotypical portrayal of the southern whites.
","I hated this movie. It is not that I don't think what some did in the South wasn't a horrible crime, but this film stereotypes the South. Senator Julian Bond, a black senator, rightly said that the 'FBI really did nothing for blacks in the South'. I can't disagree with this. I love Hackmann, but his character is an insult. He is shown as trying to be Robin Hood, but that wasn't the truth.I also am tired of movies that stereotype poor southern whites. In this movie, all white and poor southern males are portrayed as 'monsters'. That's bigotry just as bad as any bigotry. Worse than that, it is false history. Just like how Gone Like The Wind glorifies the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners, it was the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners who ruined the South - pitting poor whites against poor blacks. So, where is the 'evil' rich white character in this movie? Nowhere. In other words, all poor whites are 'evil', but you can't possibly indict rich northerners and rich southerners, who kept poor people of both races enslaved and against one another. This movie is so wrong.",1,12,30,15 January 2011
Ted," Funny film
","A lot of people gave this movie bad reviews, but I am sick of Political Correctness. I am not such a big fan of Family Guy. Find it annoying, but this movie was cute. There was a lot of crude humor, which is to be expected in most films today. However, the movie had a heart. A boy gets a teddy bear as a kid who talks. Both become obnoxious and immature as adults, but when the star's girlfriend gives him an ultimatum to give up Ted the teddy bear and grow up or lose her, both the Teddy Bear and adult start to grow up. I was laughing throughout the movie. Yes, the movie was corny but people nowadays have become too serious and need to chill out. That is what we use to say in the 80s. Have fun and laugh at this movie. Not a great film, but still plenty of laughs.",5,0,0,21 July 2018
Home Alone," A kiddie movie for all ages
","I can't believe liking a kiddie movie, but I do. This movie is very funny. McCauley Caulkin displays great talent for his age as the child trying to defend his home from two dopey burglars, played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. Pesci has never been funnier as a competitive burglar who can't believe that he is being beaten by a kid. Pesci and Stern end up making complete fools of themselves. Caulkin's parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara. They are both funny as different personality parents, who completely forget their son on a holiday trip. There is also an amusing scene with John Candy as a polka clarinetist. I liked the part where Caulkin helped out his neighbor by advising him to contact his estranged son. All and all a delightful children film - up there with A Christmas Story and Dennis the Menace. P.S. - one flaw. A lot of characters were speaking in a definite New York accent. The movie was set in Chicago.",9,0,1,31 August 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Why does Hollywood still not understand Science 101?
","This movie was a huge disappointment. It was supposed to be about the effects of global warming. Instead, the movie trivialized the whole thing. First off, if it was to get to 150 below zero, where was NASA? Do you know how cold that would be? That would be a cold temperature on Mars. If there were only 8 days left before the deep freeze why assign a minor scientist to solve the problem? NASA would have been madly trying to develop space suits. You would need a space suit just to survive those temperatures. Instead, we have people running around with their faces exposed. The biggest joke was believing that if you shut the door on the New York Public Library that you would be protected from the cold. You would need triple-paned glass, and space suits just to survive 150 below zero. All the creators had to do was say 70 below zero. That would have been realistic for survivability, although still Fairbanks, Alaska cold. Then, the freeze happens all of a sudden. People are running outside, and then all of a sudden the cold comes. How silly. In addition, for no reason it warms up to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Yippee!! Not! If that were not ridiculous enough, when the tidal wave is heading towards downtown Manhattan, people are walking around slowly to get each other together. Hello. The water would be coming at about 500 miles per hour. And why the New York Public Library? There were plenty of bigger, more secure buildings. You might have survived better if you cordoned yourself into a stairwell in one of the skyscrapers. And why all of a sudden do all these people decide to leave and walk south for food? In rural New Jersey, you would find far less then if you stormed into all the big buildings in New York City. There would have been cafeterias and fridges all over the place. Why would they leave New York City? What happened to the ship? Why was it abandoned? I also thought that wolves don't attack humans. About the only good thing about this movie was the special effects. Although, there was a huge period for about an hour where people were boringly sitting around a fire in the library talking about nothing",1,2,6,7 July 2007
Crash," Tried a little too hard to be cute
","The movie was entertaining, and for that is a watchable movie. However, Crash definitely didn't deserve an Oscar nomination. The movie was too politically correct. This movie was politically correct 'fantasia'. Characters in the movie openly say racist and bigoted things. I don't believe that in L.A. nowadays people talk like in the 1920s. Nobody goes around as openly racist and bigoted as in this movie. There was some good acting. Sandra Bullock I think is highly overrated, but she was good as a crabby, bigoted woman. Matt Dillon was very good. I liked that he was bigoted in one scene, but then rescued the very woman he had alienated. The movie seemed to go along as a passable film until the last few scenes. Ryan Phillippe, for example, played Officer Tom Hansen. He was alienated by his partner John Ryan's (Matt Dillon) behavior when stopping a black couple. He ended up preventing a shooting situation by calming talking an angry black man whom he was familiar with out of waiving his gun around. Then, Officer Ryan is driving home late at night and picks up a total stranger. No one in L.A. picks up strangers at night. Officer Ryan ends up shooting the black youth passenger, because he falsely believes that he is getting a gun out of his jacket. Then, the youth passenger dies and turns out to be Detective Graham Walters' (Don Cheadles) brother. This made no sense, and Don Cheadles had one of his poorest performances. We never found out much about his character to really have much of any opinion about him, and to justify his poor role as an older brother. So, this movie was entertaining, but the movie became more and more implausible.",5,6,13,16 September 2006
MASH," Less Good As Time Goes By
","Although this movie attempts to be exciting and humorous, the humor is disconnected with reality. Altman wanted to make a statement about war without really understanding what it was really like to be in a combat situation in Korea. The surgery scenes are gruesome, yet they don't seem real enough. There is no sense of connection in the operating room with the pain of war. There are no artillery shells. They even have lots of time for horsing around and playing football. Basically, it is 'good guys' versus 'bad guys'. The 'bad guys' are Major Houlihan and Major Burns. Both Kellerman and Duvall are very good in their roles. Sutherland is pretty decent, but poorly developed. You get the sense that he likes dogs and is pretty decent, but he comes of as a complete pain-in-the-neck. Gould is disappointing. He comes across as a hippie, not as someone who really existed in the 1950s. Basically, there were amusing moments, such as the football game, but I never felt that this movie was anything more than an ego trip for Altman. I never felt that it was an honest look at the Korean War.",5,21,41,23 April 2007
Interstellar," A good movie with some flaws.
","The movie was very exciting and had a good cast. People on Earth could only grow corn now due to a blight. There were a lot less people and most lived in rural areas growing corn. Even the New York Yankees had relocated to the country. Matthew McConaughey plays a farmer who once was a top pilot. He and his daughter somehow figure out where a secret NASA base is located. When they investigate they are captured and one of the people there is an old professor of his played by Michael Caine. Caine believes that the World will end in two generations due to a projected corn blight. McConaughey is recruited to take a crew through a wormhole to a neighboring galaxy where there are three planets that may support life. An early mission, led by an astronaut played by Matt Damon, disappeared on one of the planets. When the crew arrives on the planet where the astronaut is located, it turns out that the astronaut had been playing a con game. He pretended that there was urgency to come to the planet to save humankind, but in reality he cowardly just wanted to be rescued from the isolation of being the only person on the planet. There is also the duplicity of NASA in believing that they could let all of humanity die while letting a few colonizers continue life on a new planet. 
 The movie was very good with a great story, but had a few flaws. Firstly, when the crew arrives on the first planet there is nothing but still water a few feet deep. However, suddenly miles away a giant tidal wave about one thousand feet high appears. It only takes a few moments to get to within a few hundred yards of the space ship. The tsunami in Indonesia a few years ago was only about twenty feet high, but traveling at 535 miles per hour. It would seem logical that a thousand foot high tsunami would be traveling faster and with even more deadly force. Yet, suddenly the tsunami slows down and gives the astronauts tons of time to get back into the space ship. Still, one astronaut is killed when the female astronaut, played by Anne Hatthaway, insists on retrieving important data left by the previous exhibition to the planet. One of the four astronauts is killed. And, the force of the tsunami that big would probably destroy and crush even the strongest built space craft. 
 Another major flaw was that the movie assumed that all of the audience understood what was going on. Not everyone understands all the science involved and the movie needed to do a better job explaining how the science was plausible. The only possible explanation for the spaceship surviving the massive tsunami is the word 'gravity of 130%'. The significance of 130% was not very well explained. 
 Another problem had to do with the DVD I was watching. Some DVDs are not very good with sound. Oftentimes, characters were practically whispering, particularly Matthew McConaghey's character. There was some important dialogue going on, but I could not hear a lot of it. 
 Lastly, the last part of the movie was very complicated. While I did understand the concept of Love and the connections between events in the movie, particularly with his daughter and how she reacted to his abandoning the family for the mission, it seemed fantastic. The robot and the female astronaut eject from the space station, but the main character does not. Not really explained. Also, at some point, he ejects from his space craft. Not really explained. Also, I was wondering how a space craft could travel through this enormous worm hole at fantastic speeds and not hit one of the countless objects in the worm hole. It would take an exact projection of where all possible objects could be located to avoid the space ship from being destroyed. 
 Fantastically, the main character is rescued by the NASA station. The NASA Station was able to be refitted and went into space, becoming a two-dimensional circular micro World where some of humanity had survived (there was an eighty year time lapse due to the astronauts going deep into space and time becoming relatively faster). 
 Overall, a very good movie. Some things needed to be explained better. The movie got a bit confusing towards the end.",7,0,1,16 July 2018
Forrest Gump," Didn't like or get the message
","This movie suffers from a bad case of 'schizophrenia'. The movie starts out as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strong single mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a 'low key' version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles one has to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement about American history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmental indictment without regard for the 'complexities' involved. For example, we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so 'dimwitted' that he doesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying to attend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is something about having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some people find this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goes off to Vietnam, leaving his 'flaky', 'irresponsible' girlfriend behind. You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as an irresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight with some pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entire anti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complex issues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-war movement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. Now Forrest is running for no reason. In the movie 'Convoy', where this idea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), there seemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is just running for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am just annoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremely annoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been a better, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, instead of pursuing a right-wing political agenda.",1,72,175,28 August 2006
He Got Game," Overboard
","This movie tried to tell a story about one black basketball player's life by trying to put every possible conflict rolled in one. It didn't work. This movie was an eyesore. The music was very good. However, the plot wasn't. The movie was misogynist. The only good women were the immediate relatives. All other women were portrayed as just users and objects. The girl friend of the basketball star (Ray Allen) was not seen sympathetically at all. She was just there for him. The message was she had no hopes and dreams of her own, other than to be around the basketball star.The part about the basketball star going to the white college and having white women fall all over and have orgasms is nonsense. Black basketball players have to be careful, because there are lots of women out to scream sexual assault, etc. And even the most self-disrespecting women wouldn't just automatically fall all over a black basketball player, even if he were Michael Jordan.The most ridiculous thing was when Denzel Washington's character returns home and his son doesn't trust him. At first, one thinks 'okay, forgive the father'. Then, you find out that the father accidentally killed his wife in a fit of rage. Okay, I know lots of people who are mad at their father about things less than that. You can't tell me that a son wouldn't want to have nothing to do with the father after this incident.Then there was the Hispanic drug dealer. Was he working with the City Of New York? He's driving around the basketball star telling him every sin that is out there. That doesn't sound like a street smart drug dealer, looking out for his interests. That sounds like someone hired to give a young man a lecture.I am sorry that this film was destroyed by all this. There was a lot of good in the film that was marred by all this. For example, life is very hard. The song by Public Enemy at the end was probably the best way too summarize about the hardship of life in Brooklyn. I think that Spike Lee was trying to be like Scorsese, but not the Scorsese of Mean Streets. Mean Streets was Scorsese's debut masterpiece. He Got Game was more like the mediocre and overrated Taxi Driver. The movie wandered all over the place trying to make a moral point, but failing at every turn.",3,3,8,11 March 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," These movies are too few nowadays
","I was expecting the movie to be a drab movie saved by Alan Arkin. In fact, Arkin was just one character in an extremely funny movie. Not only is this movie funny, it also critiques modern America. The story revolves around a seven year old who dreams of being Miss America. She is not the 'barbie doll' type. She wears glasses. Her crazy family all piles in to an aging VW van to head from Albuquerque, NM to Redondo Beach, CA. There is the uncle, a man who became depressed after the second foremost Marcel Proust scholar left him for another man. There is the teenage brother, who worships Friedrich Nitzsche, and has decided to talk to no one until he makes it to the Air Force for pilot training. There is the father, who goes all over the place with his 'seven steps to success', but is a failure in life (but still drives everyone nuts with his seven steps). Then, there is the grandfather, who doesn't care what he says, no matter how offensive. The movie is clever, and perhaps the funniest moments deal with the problems with the vw van that they have along the way. The movie showed that in today's World, we all want to be successes, but we all have to deal with the craziness of life along the path to our dreams.",10,1,4,7 October 2006
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A little dull, but pretty good psychological exploration
","Don't expect an adventure, thrill ride, get you out of your seat movie when you watch this. This movie is 160 minutes long. It is a bit like watching Jeremiah Johnson. It is set in the backwoods of the plains states (particularly Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado). Nature is very much a part of this film, and much of it is set in dreary winter.The characterizations are very earthy. None of the characters are particularly likable. Frank James is rather dour. Jesse James is not a nice man, especially when he beats up a boy. He is paranoid, arrogant, and dangerous. The antihero, Bob Ford, is probably the most likable of characters. Even he is not heroic, nor likable.I suppose that is the point of this movie. They talk about the Bible (both Bob Ford and Jesse James are children of Baptist ministers), but know that they are not worthy of a seat in Heaven. In fact, they kid each other sarcastically throughout the movie about this (Don't play holy with me, etc.).There is an interesting relationship between the two. They are almost like two sibling rivalry brothers. In fact, I think the Fords and the James were cousins of some sort. The real Jesse James was the son of the wealthiest slave owner in Missouri. The Civil War devastated the James family, and had everything to do with turning them into renegades .Jesse James is arrogant, moody, deadly, and ever watchful. No one feels safe around him, because they know that at any moment he can unearth some secret betrayal/plot. In fact, a Marshall warns Bob Ford to never turn your back on him.Bob Ford is the runt of the litter. He wants to prove his worth, but is dismissed as young, immature, and odd. He changes almost imperceptibly from a naive, loudmouth boy to one who is stoic and resentful of James. Jesse James realizes that he messed up when he beat up one of the Ford clans' young boys. It was a cowardly act by James picking on a boy. I think that Bob Ford never forgives him for picking on his younger brother or cousin (I never figure out which).You feel a little sorry for James, because he is gunned down at the most innocent point in his life (the moment he finally lets down his guard and appears to finally trust the two Ford brothers who are the remnants of his gang. The last twenty minutes of the film are about how Bob Ford profits from his death, and then grows to regret his action.I suppose a big mystery that movie leaves is how much of it had to do with Bob Ford's jealousy, his cowardice, and his need for self-preservation. When James reads a newspaper that George Liddle, a former member of his gang, has collaborated with the police, it is almost a certainty that James knows that Bob Ford was also secretly collaborating with the authorities. Does Bob Ford shoot him, because he knows that James will get him soon, for fame, because he is angry about how James dealt with members of the Ford clan, because he himself hopes to takeover, or because he wants to play good guy. The movie does a decent job of leaving that up in the air.",Null,0,1,7 March 2010
Slap Shot," Maybe I was just tired?
","I watched this movie fully for the first time ever on video late at night. I wasn't that enthralled by the movie. Paul Newman was not that great or dynamic in this role. I thought the hockey violence was exaggerated, even by hockey standards. The Hanson Brothers were funny, but they were a side story to the plot. The movie seemed awfully dated. I think in 1977, it might have appealed to the libertarian audience who wanted some entertainment. However, today the movie seems awfully dated. I also felt that there was poor character development. You never really got to know what was really going on between the hockey player and his girlfriend. Then, suddenly the young hockey player sees his girlfriend and starts stripping. Is this supposed to be fantasy, reality, or satire. It was never clear. The ending was very confusing. I guess the part I did like was when Newman's character goes to meet the snobbish owner of the team. It really highlighted how business could be so cold and impersonal. In general, I wasn't that impressed by this movie, and found it a bit boring. I don't think that the hockey World is that insane. And if this was supposed to be comedy, the creators of this movie couldn't decide whether they were making a comedy or a documentary.",4,4,10,13 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Beautiful photography. A little too Simplistic plot.
","The photography in this film was beautiful. Surrealistic scenes reminiscent of a Fellini film. Carey was brilliant as ever as a depressed lover who can't seem to be able to pay enough attention or have enough say-so in how his relations are going. Enter a new concept, have your memory of a relationship erased at a clinic. While the main character's memory is being erased, he ponders over all the mistakes and sagas of his relationship that failed. By the end, you realize that Carey and his lost lover (Winslet) really did find a niche with each other - and is knowing that every relation may end, but that shouldn't stop you from trying. The main flaw of the movie is that it sounds like an idea tried out on the old Twilight Zone. I will need to look into this. The movie seems a bit too formulaic, and expects us to be in constant awe that one's memory can be erased through a computer program.",7,0,3,6 April 2007
Stalingrad," No One Gets Out Alive
","You can tell this is not a Hollywood movie. It did not have a happy ending. A unit of 400 German soldiers is reduced to zero in a hopeless situation at Stalingrad (Volgagrad), Ukraine. An idealistic young officer tries to point out the injustices caused by other German officers against Russian civilians and soldiers, but the higher command accuses him of being against the war effort. They hint that the only reason he is not arrested and shot is because his father is an important person. The German soldiers go through an unimaginable hell. All die hopelessly, tragically, and painfully. It is hard for any movie to come close to the horrors of war, but this film does about as good a job as possible. It is not too long before the German soldiers discover that they will never make it back home to Germany again. There is no escape, and the winter is another harsh factor. It is hundreds of miles through barren lands that make Midwest winters look tame. The Russian soldiers and Ukrainian people are seen as victims of the war just as much.Unlike many Hollywood movies, where there is a happy ending this movie has no consolation as every single one of the soldiers of the original 400 is doomed to die. The majority of soldiers are just ordinary folk led by fanatical and terrified officers. In the end, the powerful officers are reduced to starving, shivering animals themselves with no hope of escape. The only knock I have on this movie, because it was focused on the point of view of the German soldier, is that nothing was shown about how Communism was even worse. Stalin was a complete monster. The reason why the Russian boy who was captured is so silent is because Stalin killed any soldiers who had contact with Germans. Stalin claimed that he himself was responsible for winning the war. Stalin was just a coward who was protecting himself. It was the people who were the real winners of the war. Just to show how vile a person Stalin was. A Jewish prisoner who survived the concentration camps was arrested by the Soviets, accused of being infected by Germanism, and sent to a Siberia camp.Still, this movie is in the tradition of realistic European films. One feels true sadness for the inhumanity of the whole war. Everyone is a victim of a mad situation where no one comes out alive. In the last scene, the last surviving soldier freezes to death in the open fields of snow and winds.",8,0,2,18 February 2019
Wedding Crashers," Surprisingly Not Bad
","Every critic I have read and person I have spoken to disliked this movie. After seeing it recently, I disagree. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are brilliant as con artists who go to weddings to pick up women. Yes, you can't pick up women that easily in real life, but it is a comedy. Wilson and Vaughn are hilarious in showing how a big male ego can get you by in the World. They are both highly immature, but you can't help admiring the verve of the two. If you are thinking that this is the entire point of the movie, no, it isn't. Wilson meets the daughter (Rachel McAdams)of the Secretary of State (Christopher Walken). The patrician family is on the surface chic, but in reality a collection of misfits. The rival in the movie is terrific as someone who thinks that the World owes him everything, simply because he is rich. There are many great moments in the movie. There is a walk on role by Will Farrell as a 'funeral crasher'. Farrell is very funny. I really felt that this movie showed that one has to have guts in life, but that you also can be changed and grow up due to the very things that appeared to just be leading you nowhere.",7,0,0,7 October 2006
Any Given Sunday," Good cast, but too much of a soap opera
","The positives in the movie was a good cast. I don't like Cameron Diaz in most roles, but this was her best one by far. She is very good as a woman owner of a football team trying very hard to do it as a woman. In addition, at times the football action was entertaining. It is the 'off-field' dramas that mar the film substantially.First of all, it was a professional football team. In the real world of pro football, the quarterback doesn't puke on the field. There are fans watching the game. James Wood's role was largely comical and irrelevant. Since pro football is a multi-billion dollar business, 'amoral' doctors are not going to be hired or tolerated. It was also almost playoffs. As bad as the sport's world seems, players don't party openly, do drugs, and hire prostitutes right before the playoffs. Even the most irresponsible football players are not that dumb, because at that point of the season they wouldn't want the entire team and city hating them. The coach of a football team would be planning plays after the game, not drinking at bars and being propositioned by prostitutes. A coach wouldn't openly scowl, when his quarterback deviates from the play slightly, if it results in a win. Pro football coaches are celebrities, and wouldn't scowl when their team won as a result of a player being independent minded. The coach may after the game in the locker room remind the quarterback that there is a game plan. That was another major wrong with this film. There was only a play called in the last few seconds of the final regular season game. Pro football is all about plays. All the coach did was give pep talks.So, the film was basically ruined by unrealistic, exaggerated scenarios. Stone should have spent more time studying the real game of football, instead of some Hollywood interpretation. The acting was good, and at times there was an attempt to show that football is a very rough sport. However, I can not really recommend this film, other than being slightly entertaining, and possessing a good cast of actors.",5,12,17,29 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Decent and Entertaining.
","I admit to be only a mild fan of The Star Wars series. Yes, I saw the original back in 1977, and it was the best one. Still, I prefer THX 1138, and the original Star Wars was just very good. The worst one was (this causes the grossest confusion) the sixth one filmed. The one with Ewan McGregor was a horrible letdown, and just abysmal. This one is the seventh one filmed and it is at least as good as New Hope and The Return Of The Jedi. We have the storm trooper who defects,and this pretty woman who we can guess is the daughter of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker. Right away we see the great actor Max Von Sydow. His part was cut short. Harrison Ford was as funny as ever. The other actors are not really well known yet, but they seemed to be good sidekicks to Han Solo ' s personality. It was neat at the end when the woman heroine just hugged Princess Leia and it ended with She and Luke Skywalker looking at each other, rather than admitting that she must be their daughter. The special effects were good. I think the movie was decent, but then again the original Star Wars was just a very good movie.",6,0,17,12 March 2016
Heat," I loved this film
","Imagine a film with De Niro and Pacino on the same frame. There hasn't been one. In Godfather II, De Niro was the 'flashback' Don, and Pacino played the 'present time' son of the Don. I was not disappointed by the pairing of these two titans. Pairing together two titan actors is a big risk. Their egos could get in the way. This was not the case in this intelligent and exciting thriller. De Niro plays a criminal, and Pacino plays a cop. Although, on opposite sides, both characters are very similar. They both are excellent at their jobs, and they both have ruined their lives by being obsessed with their respective careers. This is the point of this film. In the end, both characters are tragic - De Niro for being trapped in his role, and Pacino for ruining his personal life in a lifetime pursuit of justice. The interaction between the characters is brilliant. There was also a tribute scene to Bullet (the McQueen film), where a chase goes through an airport. Val Kilmer also is very convincing as an apprentice criminal. De Niro's character feels an obligation to help out Kilmer's character, but also reminds him constantly that 'you have to walk away from anyone and anything within 30 seconds to get the heat off your trail'. This is a brutal reminder of how hard a life it is to be a career criminal.",10,2,4,29 November 2006
Gladiator," I thought this would be just a blood fest, but I was wrong.
","For the last seven years, I heard many people rave about Gladiator. I put off viewing the movie, because I thought it would be just another gore fest. I was wrong. This movie has a great plot and great heart to it. It doesn't sugar coat life in ancient Rome. Rome an assume civilization, but it also was one of great brutality. Life was very hard. Russell Crowe was excellent as a hero who was pure of heart. He could fight and defeat the best of them, but he never did it out of sadism. His character, a Roman general, was a bit naive actually, and believed in 'good intentions'. Unfortunately, he is up against the amoral son of the Roman Emperor (Richard Harris), who is all into macho-ism, but never has really been on a battle field or in the gladiator ring. That makes the son (Joaquim Phoenix) filled with spite, fear, resentment, jealously and hate for all that the Gladiator-General (Crowe) represents. The hero is all about bravery and valor, but not out about playing politician and hurting people out of spite like the Emperor's son was. I really liked this movie a lot. It was very well acted, very well filmed, very realistic, and also portrayed how hard and brutal life was in the Roman Empire. It was also Oliver Reed's last role. He plays an Arab or African owner-leader of the 'Gladiators'. He can be brutal and ruthless, but develops a heart when he sees that the hero is really standing up for the 'common man', and not just a 'coward'.",10,1,2,2 December 2007
