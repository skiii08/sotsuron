Blade Runner 2049," If replicants aren't dangerous androids, then there's no reason for the movie.
","In the original movie Blade Runners were around to retire dangerous androids, called replicants, which were running amok. In the new movie, replicants are, for all practical purposes, GMOs, so there's no need for Blade Runners to even exist. Replicants are basically humans with serial numbers.They can put as many boobs in the movie as they want and it won't fill the terrific hole through the foundation.",1,25,49,25 October 2017
