The Blair Witch Project," Excellent!
","Without a doubt the most interesting and frightening movie I've seen in a long time. The Blair Witch Project scares in a way that horror films haven't been able to since 'Halloween': subtly. There's no outright, in-your-face terror and no discernible antagonist; what frightens you is whatever your mind conjures up - it's sad that so many people require the film makers to do that for them. There's a consistent sense of dread that saturates each scene, though it isn't always obvious, and watching the three kids slip irresistibly into madness is, at once, frustrating and mesmerizing. Pure emotion can be shattering to witness and The Blair Witch Project comes about as close as possible to capturing it. There is one particular scene in which an apology is recorded that is absolutely heartbreaking. It's that rawness and realism that make the days so captivating. Find me three cold, tired, wet, hungry and scared 20 year-olds who get along and don't swear like sailors and I'll give you a thousand dollars!  At night dread manifests itself in the form of pitch darkness, obscure noises and what sounds like children's voices, and the fear is not about being startled out of your seat as much as it's about burying yourself in it and not breathing. The movie builds on this fear and dread at night and returns to the frustration of day, continuously escalating.  Each day becomes more unbearable and each night becomes more frightening culminating in what is, truly, one of the most terrifying scenes I've ever watched. The final frames are absolutely haunting.It's certainly not for everyone - what movie ever is? - but I can't recommend it enough.",10,1,2,8 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Custom-built for mass appeal
","**Spoilers**
There's nothing particularly awful about this film, there's just nothing particularly great about it either. About 10 minutes into it, the ending is painfully obvious and the climax - where Cole finally reveals his 'problem' to Malcolm - has been given away from the very start by the overzealous trailers. What we're left with is an hour and a half of tedious plot exposition and a denouement that is so contrived it makes you wonder what the point of the entire movie was. Then the 'surprise' comes and you realize that the entire point was to fool you with the ending! If you were fooled then the movie worked; if not then it probably didn't.
On a positive note: the performances were very good - notably, Osment and Colette - and the cinematography was excellent. Ultimately, however, - unless you are terrified even thinking about ghosts - the Sixth Sense is only mildly entertaining and, upon a second viewing, even less so. 5/10",5,1,1,15 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Music for the masses
","The Sixth Sense is one of those movies that will appeal to the mainstream viewer: nothing in it is shocking, there's nothing particularly menacing about it and everything is wrapped up in a nice, sweet, little package by the end. The performances by Osment and Collette are excellent but it doesn't make up for the tedious pace of the plot. Two-thirds of the movie deals with exposition which, in this case, is devoted to the interaction between Cole (Osment) and Malcolm (Willis). Cole's got a problem and Malcolm is determined to help him - as his problem is similar to one that another patient of his had whom he couldn't help. The problem is that we already know what Cole's problem is so we're left with an anti-climactic climax. When he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people, there's no shock value or significance. That leaves the resolution to Cole's problem as the focal point of the movie; however, it's so tame it makes you wonder what the big deal was in the first place.
The movie works best when Cole and his mother (Collette) are together. There's a particular scene at the end when they are in the car that is incredibly touching. The movie breaks down when it tries to be scary, though. There are a few startling scenes but, overall, it's devoid of any real terror. How it was labeled as a horror movie, I'll never understand.
Overall, it's a pretty decent movie - much better than what Hollywood usually puts out - but, in the end, it's nothing to write home about. In my opinion, of course.",5,1,1,15 September 1999
