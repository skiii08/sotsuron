It," About As Subtle And Composed As A Brick To The Face
","This film is just appalling terrible. The fact that it sits at (currently) above 7 makes me shocked and appalled at audiences today. This is not It. This isn't even close to It. This is a collection of awful and generic chase sequences each with a small gimmick. The subtlety and the idea of mental torture is completely cast aside for cheap and generic horror film cliche's. Pennywise (in my opinion) was portrayed near perfectly in the original TV production by Tim Curry, Pennywise has charisma, a twisted sense of humour and a way of manipulation that is truly frightening. This rendition of Pennywise is pathetic. A good example would be the famous drain scene. In the original; Pennywise uses his charm and puts on a friendly face and tone to lure Georgie in, he makes sure to always stay in a position where he doesn't appear scary in any way, this makes Georgie let his guard down so Pennywise can go in for the kill. In this film however... throughout the scene Pennywise is sat in the darkness with bright evil eyes, drooling and speaking as creepily and pedophile-like as possible. In no universe would this ever work on a child, he looks like an evil monster living in the sewer, this completely destroys the idea of Pennywise being a charismatic killer who draws kids in with jokes and an almost self mocking persona, not unlike what a pedophile would do.Pennywise is not a stupid monster who chases children every other scene just attempting to be creepy in any way. He mocks people from a distance, messes with their minds when they are alone and vulnerable (without jump scares or chase sequences). The horror moments, if you could even call them that, are pathetic, generic and predictable. The only enjoyable quality of this film are the children, well some of the children... particularly Finn Wolfhards character who just steals every scene he is in and kept me from walking out on this piece of crap film.",1,5,8,24 November 2017
