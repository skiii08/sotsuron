Ford v Ferrari," A damn good film
","Let me preface this by saying I'm not even a car guy. Not even a fan of racing, but this movie although a bit lengthy was good. Everybody turns in a remarkable performance and you forget you're watching a movie for awhile there. Would watch again every once in awhile.",10,1,5,27 December 2019
Knives Out," Thoroughly Entertaining.
","This movie might be in my top 5 of the year, definitely top 10 though. It was funny, wasn't confusing, and was just subtle enough to keep those who may not catch on as fast engaged with the rest of us. Movie didn't even feel as long as it was.",10,0,6,21 December 2019
