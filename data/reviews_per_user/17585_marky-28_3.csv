Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mediocre
","I'm not the type of person to give in to hype, so I can see this movie for what it really is. The story and acting are so-so, the special effects are standard, and the movie in whole was mediocre.I did enjoy myself during various scenes, but other than that, I wouldn't rate it anywhere above the other movies I've seen this year.",6,0,1,25 March 2000
The Others," Genuinely Scary
","I am absolutely shocked by the number of people who are claiming this movie is boring. In a world dominated by monstrously uncreative horror flicks (ala 1999's The Haunting), this is the first legitimately scary movie I've seen. I was absolutely terrified.If you are reading this, and you haven't yet seen the movie, please stop reading all these user reviews and go see it. The only thing you need to know ahead of time is the high user rating (8.2 out of 10 as of this writing). But once again, a warning: There are some reviews posted here that will absolutely ruin the whole experience for you. Close this browser window and head to the theatre. This movie is a chilling classic.",10,0,0,24 August 2001
The Evil Dead," A favorite
","I rented this movie expecting it to be a thriller, but it ended up being one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. The unintentional humour is enough to bring tears to your eyes.Join Ash and his friends for the ultimate cheesy/gory horror flick from the early 80's. You will not be disappointed.",8,0,0,25 March 2000
