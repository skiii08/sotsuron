The Blair Witch Project," i think i got ripped off?
","The hype behind this movie is phenomenal and i give credit where credit is due. The marketing behind this movie is genius and still today, several weeks after its nation wide release, there are still some who believe that this is real documentary footage. Of course, no studio would ever purchase actual footage and turn it into a major motion picture. Real documentary footage and home videos are reserved for the FOX television network and shows like RealTV. But that's besides the point. The movie itself is not very good for a couple of reasons. The first reason is unavoidable, but darn it, i got so dizzy watching this movie that I spent much of the movie looking away from the screen in order to stop myself from getting sick. I was expecting it, so it didn't come as a surprise, nevertheless I almost lost my lunch. The second reason is that this movie was not believable. I'm sorry, perhaps their nighttime footage was believable, but I didn't buy into their daytime footage with their little quarrels and soliloquies. It was highly exaggerated. The third reason, to go along with reason number two, is the 'townspeople' at the beginning of the movie. Not to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen it, but the ending was more realistic than the two fishermen being interviewed. There was no way anybody could watch these two clowns and believe they were real. By the time the movie got to the end, i was too upset with the camera and with the girl to be scared or creeped out. It might have been a cool ending, had the previous hour and ten minutes not ruined it. I almost wanted to leave during this movie because it was so bad. I'm glad its making all the money its making and i'm glad everybody has adopted an obsession with the Blair Witch legend, but the fact remains, the movie itself wasn't very entertaining.",9,0,1,10 August 1999
