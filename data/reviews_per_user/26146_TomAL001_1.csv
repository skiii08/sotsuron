Requiem for a Dream," Gritty, real, not for entertainment. Educational....the worst of drugs
","If you want to watch something to relax and entertain then don't watch this. It is not Hollywood mainstream. A blockbuster in its own right though. A blockbuster of extreme, graphic, an in your face film of what happens when you take drugs. The end is extreme with the four lives portrayed in the film but real. Real as it did happen back in the time period it is set in and today still does perhaps different respects. Electric shock treatment is not as common place perhaps now but illustrates how extremely brutal people can be, uneducated and irresponsible e.g. the doctors. It reminds me of the Hitler era, medical leadership leading to the extremely brutal treatment of others who only really need clean living and companionship. As of the other characters, they depict more real reality but with no help to hand. Too many people slant drug users as scum etc. but the reality is, if life gets too tough and goes not go to plan it could flip anyone to drugs and it is then time to help these people in the right way.The film perhaps makes one as ask where is the real justice, compassion and above all human rights and human hands extended to others in need of help. People just really in desperate need of help to come off drugs and turn there life around to get some sort of normality and happiness back.In summary, I felt sick watching it at points, even dizzy but not in a true sense. However, if you want to educate yourself about the extreme sadness and horribleness that drugs can lead to then watch it and there are worse cases no doubt.The acting is fine and must have been difficult to get into character. The actors work harder perhaps in this than most films, as it is so raw.Worth watching but you got to be mentally ready for this type of movie.",6,0,1,6 December 2014
