3:10 to Yuma," another extraordinary western movie
","Wait a long to watch this movie. I was wrong. This movie is worth of watching at the first releasing date. Amazing, brilliant. The story is quite simple, a temporary team recruited to send a robber and killer onto 3:10 train to Yuma, but the director made this movie tight and attract audience attention all the time, not any waste in story forwarding. Bale and Crowe were brilliant; they portrayed the characters multi-dimensionally, exhibited the characters' mind to audience. Ben Foster is really shocking in playing the gangster, smart, cold blooded, and loyal. At the end, I kind of started to like Crowe's character. There was still love in his heart somewhere, deeply.",9,1,4,30 December 2007
