Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad at all.
","This was a great movie. And can be more appreciated after watch 'Episode II'. It plants the seeds of Anakin Skywalker as a boy with great potential for great things. Which goes great with 'AOTC' when we see his innocence shift to darkness. Liam Neeson plays 'Qui-Gon' the best Jedi out of the whole series (sorry obi-wan). Darth Maul and Sideous are also great villains. Dig that double-sided lightsaber! This movie does exactly what it sets out to do. Begin the story which is a direct contrast to what the story ends up to be. Thats where all the drama and conflict lies. Jar Jar isn't that bad either. And anyone that calls for the death of a FICTIONAL character needs a life! The story is good, effects are cool. What more can you ask for. Not bad. Not bad at all.RATING: *** out of ****",5,3,6,20 October 2002
Minority Report," BEST FILM OF 2002!
","Forget Spider-Man and Star Wars (although I liked them both). The movie of the summer and the year is Spielberg's 'Minority Report'! It's about John Anderton (Tom Cruise) a cop who catches murderers before they commit the crime. The way the 'Pre-Crime' unit knows who and when is due to 3 genetic mishaps called 'Pre-Cogs'. Life is not so good for Anderton, especially when he sees a Pre-Cog vision of him murdering someone. So he must flee from his would-be captors and solve the mystery of the vision. Spielberg's vision of the future is fantastic. And he gives a new definition to chase scenes! The plot will keep you glued to the screen till the movie's climactic finale! Cruise is at the top of his game, exceeding his preformance in 'Mission: Impossible' (the first one, not the awful John Woo version). This is why Speilberg is the master of movie-making! I can't wait till this comes out on DVD!

Unbreakable," Comic Book fans...Rejoice.
","I don't know why people give comic books a bad rap. If the masses think comics are sophmoric, then why do they flock to Spider-Man in droves. It's ridiculous. M.Night has gone on the record saying he wanted to deliver a comic book movie without the flashy costumes and campy super-villains. And he did just that. He delivered a story that seems like it can really happen. That there are people here on earth to help those that can not help themselves, and thats a good feeling. This is one of my favorite movies. And far superior to The Sixth Sense. Night also said that this was the first act of his story. But do to the negative response he's re-thinking doing a sequel. Hopeful he will, because this story is just begging to be told!",10,0,0,5 August 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Bringing Swashbuckling movies back
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is truly an adventure that is worth 4 times the price of admission. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are after the fabled ship, The Black Pearl, after the dreadful crew lead by Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Will's main squeeze, Elizabeth Swann (played by the lovely Keira Knightley). On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie? Cutthroat Island doesn't count! Anyway, this movie is one of the best of 2003 and manages to make pirates cool again.RATING: **** out of ****",10,1,2,19 October 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Animation at it's very finest
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Howard Ashman (who produced and wrote the lyrics to the songs) was an absolute genius. Its a tragedy that he never saw the movie's completion. He died in March of 1991 of AIDS. 7 months before the film's release. But boy would he have been proud of the tremendous success the film had; and how it touched the hearts of millions with lovable characters and brilliant songs. And the ultimate message 'Love conquers all' and 'Beauty is skin deep'. The IMAX release in January 2002 only made it better, with a new musical sequence that had viewers scratching their heads over why it was left out in the first place. But without Mr.Ashman this film wouldn't be half of what it is. I leave you with the films dedication. 'To Howard: Who gave a Mermaid her voice and a Beast his soul'                            Howard Ashman 1950-1991RATING:**** out of ****",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
Finding Nemo," The Pixar streak continues
","Pixar manages to deliver another great film. 'Nemo' is about a father clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his journey to find his son, Nemo. Who was taken by a local dentist and brought to live in his fish tank. With the help of Dorry (Ellen DeGeneres) a fish with short term memory, he scowers the ocean meeting all sorts of colorful, funny, and sometimes scary creatures. As well as risking his fins over many a danger. A father's love and the peril he'd go through to find his son, also letting an offspring grow up, is the movie's ultimate point. And it is a beautiful one. The movie also manages to appeal to adult and kid alike. The movie is funny with jokes the whole family can enjoy, and any parent can tell you that that is rare. Its even good for a group of teens or adults to go see by themselves (which is rarer for a kid's film). As long as we have Pixar, we'll always have good family entertainment, or entertainment in generalRATING: **** out of ****",10,1,2,31 May 2003
X-Men," Perfect Adaptation
","People's main problem with 'X-Men' was that it didn't follow the comic. Well in my mind it hit the nail on the head. Tolerance was the original theme in Stan Lee's X-Men. And was played out beautifully here. The movie is about the next step of human evolution. 'Mutants' or Homo Superior are born with special powers. And are therefore feared and hated by regular humans. Professor Charles Xaiver (Patrick Stewart) wants to look past their differences and look toward a peaceful co-exsistance. But, Magneto (Ian McKellen) another mutant wants to wipe out humans to make way for his kind. He can only see the evil of homo sapiens, and will stop at nothing to destroy them. Like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, they both had the same agenda, the same goal, but could not see eye to eye about how to do so. And thats where the recruitment comes in. The Brotherhood(Magneto's team) and the X-Men(Xaiver's team) go head to head with each other. One set on destroying man. And the other protecting those that hate and fear them. It doesn't matter if characters were left out. Or if their wasn't enough fighting in it. The message was perfect. And thats really all that matters.RATING:***1/2 out of ****",10,0,1,15 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," These characters are going to need some SERIOUS therapy after all this!
","First off, this is a great movie and makes 'The Phantom Menace' better by explaining things. It does a great job of piecing the prequel puzzle together. Anakin's anger and hate are swelling. The empire is rising. And we all know it's going to happen. The love scences work well because we know it's going to end badly. Anakin really loves Padme and his master Obi-Wan (AS A FATHER YOU PERVERTS) which makes the knowlege that both characters are going to try to kill each other, sad. Fits well in the STAR WARS legacy and after a viewing leaves you itching to see 'Episode III'.RATING: ***1/2 out of ****",10,3,4,20 October 2002
Notting Hill," Works on so many levels
","'Notting Hill' is actually a very funny movie in it's own right. But that's not what it's about. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, a huge celebrity that can't get any privacy. This is perfect casting, because if you want someone to pull off acting and getting treated like a celebrity, cast a celebrity. It really makes the movie seem believable. She meets a funny Englishman named Will Thacker (Hugh Grant) and the two spark a romance. The scenes where they are supossed to be in love with each other are very convincing (at least on Roberts' end). And it didn't fall into the stereotype of a movie about a celebrity. Sure, we see the papparazzi chase her and stress her out. But the movie isn't about that. It's about the way an average ordinary man who can get the pretty popular girl, which in turn shows the audience that social status means nothing. And if you let it, love can help you find your perfect mate. At least that's what I got out of it. Writer Richard Curtis is a gift from the movie gods. His writing is so fresh and funny. He combines the 2 things that make life worth living (Comedy and Love) and puts it on the screen. It's hard to be funny. Try writing a funny screenplay! But he makes it look so easy. Britain should really import more movies state side.RATING: *** out of ****",9,0,0,17 November 2003
American Pie," Give me a slice!!
","'American Pie' is one of those rare comedies that fools you into thinking it's a gross-out pointless bomb. But it isn't, it's actually filled with tremendous heart. Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are out to lose their virginity before their Senior year of High School is over. Along the way they get made fun of by Jock-Jerk Stifler (Seann William Scott) and seduced by forgien exchange students. While many gags are aimed torward teens the real stories lie in Kevin's difficulty in figuring out if he loves his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) or not. And Oz's shedding his Jock persona and signing up for Choir to prove to Heather (Mena Survari) how much she means to him. The ensemble cast (which includes Natasha Lyonne and Eugene Levy) also makes the movie such a joy to watch In the end, the adolecent mischief and curiousity regarding sex becomes unlikely entertainment for teens that are going through it and adults who want to remember.RATING: *** out of ****",10,0,1,18 August 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He's back...
","When I first heard they were making 'Terminator 3' without James Cameron (the first two's co-writer and director) I immediately knew that this movie wouldn't come close to the the perfection that was 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', a movie that in my mind is one of the greatest films ever made. So I put that out of my mind. But as the film neared release, I gained an excitement I didn't think would generate from the film. I became excited about it. It looked good. And while I didn't really think about it as the movie was being made, I had suddenly felt that this movie would be good enough to be recognized as a true edition to the franchise. Even with new writers and a new director. And my feeling paid off. While not as good as 'T2', the film is very impressive in its own right. Questions about the sequel were being answered. Like, why would more Terminators come back? Haven't we seen all there is to see? It even put new insight into the story of John Conner. I honestly didn't care what he was up to since the second movie, but now I did. Most importantly, it doesn't dwell on what the first two flicks did, which was 'Terminator chases heroes, heroes run away'. It propelled the story forward. The action was top notch and had one kick ass chase scene (every summer movie does nowadays, so it's a task to produce an exciting one). My favorite part was the T-X. The new Terminator in town, played by the beautiful Kristanna Loken, who's powers are far more advanced then previous Terminators. She played a big part in me enjoying the movie. While I'd like to highlight why, that would be spoiling it. Nick Stahl does a very convincing job at taking over the role of John Conner that was vacated by Ed Furlong. And the new addition to the pack, Kate Brewster (Clarie Danes) holds her own to make her character likeable and interesting. To be frank, I didn't think she'd have anything to bring to the table, but she proved me wrong. Overall, I was very pleased with all involved for making a worthwhile sequel, 12 years after the last movie was released! Keeping audiences interested, with such a gap in the story was a daunting task. But they delivered in spades. Even James Cameron was pleased with the result (and he hated Alien 3, he made Alien 2). So he isn't just saying that. The movie leaves open for a Terminator 4. As long as they continue to move forward with the story and not just repeat past gimmicks, I'm sure it will be good. To conclude, I love this film, and like it better than the first but not the second. I hope to see more of Kristanna in other movies...if you know what I meanRATING: *** out of ****",9,0,0,15 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Quite possibly, the greatest movie of all time!
","And rightfully so. Think about it. A great fantasy story line: A boy and his mother being protected by a cyborg, from a seemingly unstoppable liquid-metal villain! And failure would lead to the destruction of human existince. The action scenes are great for the time and still hold up!The acting was eriee and dark. And the screenplay was intense, fast paced and well written. The direction from James Cameron was that of a passionate film-maker striving to raise the bar for motion pictures. And it was also the most successfully marketed R-rated movie ever! Buy this movie on DVD! It's a must-add to your collection!",10,1,1,16 August 2002
Spider-Man," Flawed. But still good.
","And by flaws I don't mean Organic Web-shooters. People who whine about that need a life ASAP! I didn't like 'Spider-Man' at first. I felt there wasn't enough good action and ariel battle scenes. And the Green Goblin's costume was just terrible. But at second glance, the acting was great. Tobey Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker, and had great chemestry with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). And Willem Dafoe was also good. The beginning of the movie was very well done. Real faithful to the comic. But the scenes with MJ take away Spidey/Gobby action time. A bitter sweet trade I admit. Although these scenes had great emotion and depth and really defined the characters, I think they should have put equal amount of time and effort towards the action. Some of the action is laughable. The CG was pretty good though. But over all its a pretty good comic movie. But it could have been better. For an example of a perfect comic adaptation, look towards 'Daredevil'.RATING:*** out of ****",7,0,0,15 February 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Zoom!
","I love this movie. Not because of the cars, they could be driving Volkswagon Beetles for all I care. It was the story that made me care about the movie. Paul Walker plays an undercover detective who is investigating a group of people who street race, they are also suspected of hijacking trucks of valuable merchandise. He becomes friends with Vin Diesel's character...and his little sister, played by the beautiful Jordanna Brewster. The action scenes are pretty cool, I didn't know much about suped up cars, nor did I care about them. I still don't. But it was fun to see how fast they went. The acting is superb, with the exception of Paul Walker. He was the least interesting character. Diesel was good. Michelle Rodrigez who plays Diesel's girlfriend is spunky and has attitude. She's a fine little actress and is going places. As is Brewster, she is just lovely and gave a pretty good performance. They're making a sequel and only Walker is returning. None of the good characters will be back. So will I see it? Two words. Eva Mendes. She is the only reason I'll be in that theater. As for this movie, it's a fast paced adrenaline rush. It's an action movie with good characterzation. That's rare these days. So if you were pondering checking this movie out, you don't have to be a car fan to do it. Just a movie fan.RATING: *** out of ****",10,0,2,13 May 2003
Blue Crush," Meh...
","Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodrigez are in bikinis through out the entire movie. That is pretty much the only reason for seeing it. Its about Bosworth and her 2 friends surfing alot. And she has some championship to win. And she meets a guy. Yeah that sums up nicely the whole thing. There are alot of people in bed in it, but they aren't doing much beyond sleeping and waking up. And of course there is alot of surfing footage, but that gets boring after 5 minutes. Too bad its basiclly the whole climax. Kate Bosworth makes the movie worth watching, even though she is scantly clad, she is a pretty fine actress. So is Rodrigez, I hope she breaks free of supporting roles like this. I can't really recommend this movie beyond Sunday afternoon or 'I can't sleep so I'll watch a movie' watching. It is sort of fun. I'll give it that. But it isn't much to brag about.RATING: ** out of ****",6,0,0,13 May 2003
Good Will Hunting," Brilliant and inspiring
","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the janitor at the most prestigeous college in the country. He is also the most brilliant person there. He solves incredibly difficult equations in minutes, where it took others years to. He is well read in history, mathematics, and art. But spends his days drinking with his buddies. It is not until one of the professors (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers his genius, that his life starts to turn around for the better. But he also has alot of anger. As a part of Will's probation, he must see a shrink (Robin Williams). Will also meets a girl (Minnie Driver) that seems to be his soul mate. With the help of Sean the shrink and Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will acknowledges his potential and his abandonment issues. This movie is very well written and acted. Most especially by Damon and Williams. It shows that even the most complex person can find solace and understanding in others, if he only opens up. The movie was nominated for 9 Academy awards, it was truly one of those special feel good movies that had a message. And has quickly become one of my favorite films.RATING: **** out of ****",10,0,2,31 May 2003
School of Rock," It ROCKS!
","THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is a surprise and a half. Dewey Finn (the hilarious Jack Black) is an out of work rocker who can't pay the rent and has just been thrown out of his own band. He pretends to be his friend Ned (Mike White) and becomes a substitute teacher at the prestigous Horace Green elementary school. At first, he ignores them. Then he realizes their music potential. So, he starts up a band featuring his students. Along the way, he dodges the watchful eye of Horace Green's principal Ms. Mullens (Joan Cusack) and teaches the kids self esteem. It all climaxes when the students play at the local Battle of the Bands contest and play a very catchy tune called 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'. This movie is adorable times two. The kids are very charming. Each and every one of them. And fine actors to boot. Without being cutsy pie. Jack Black is now a bonafide comedy star. His funny actions and motions are very enjoyable to watch. And the music! It's awesome. The song they play at the end is kick ass! The movie has very little if nothing wrong with it at all. It's hilarious, fun, and also tugs at the heartstrings a bit. The director Richard Linklater was an odd choice, because his movies are often obscure independent films. A family film isn't exactly what you'd expect from him. But he DOES know comedy. He manages not to make another gross or boring kid's film. It's not a family film, as much as it is a film that everyone can enjoy. Not one person I saw this movie with was bored and mostly all of them just plain loved it. As did I. This is the funniest comedy all year. And probably of the last 5 years. Go see it...NOW!RATING: **** out of ****",10,0,0,19 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," You didn't think it was going to be that easy, did you?
","Quentin Tarantino proves with 'KILL BILL: VOL.1' that he really can do no wrong. Right from the opening sequence, you're strapped in and clutching the arm rest of your seat. KILL BILL is about The Bride aka Black Mamba's (Uma Thurman) odyssey of revenge. When she is beaten and left for dead by her fellow assassins on the order of her boss, Bill (David Carradine),on her wedding day, she goes into a coma only to awaken 4 years later, thirsty for vengeance. She makes a list of the people that betrayed her, and goes on a absurdly violent killing spree. The plot is very thin for this half of the show, but Tarantino promises a lot more dialog in 'KILL BILL: VOL.2'. The film's highlights are the way the movie unfolds. It isn't a linear story at all (with Tarantino, it never is), but it's still damn entertaining. We learn the origin of O-Shi-Ren (Lucy Liu) in a kick ass anime sequence. We see The Bride receive the weapon she will use on her quest from the man who trained her enemy. And we see the end all beat all of fight sequences in the showdown at the House of Blue Leaves, which promises to astonish and amaze. Something that I have always admired about Tarantino is his taste in music. He always seems to find the right song, be it a Japanese rock tune, or Mexican type surfer music, that fits the scene perfectly. The Nancy Sinatra song that plays over the opening credits is perfect and so is the rock song that plays during the House of Blue Leaves melee. The one problem is that the movie is way too short. Only 90 minutes. I would have preferred to see both volumes as one 3 hour long epic. But it does end on a great cliff hanger line that comes out of nowhere. I honestly can't describe with words the perfection of the fight scenes, from the screams of pain to those who've had their limbs chopped off, to the brilliant choreography. But I will say that this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The violence is extreme and over exaggerated. I went to see it with friends whom a few weren't used to insane violence and they cringed and covered their eyes. But me, and the others who have been desensitized, loved every blood soaked minute. A movie about vengeance has never been so intriguing. You really feel for this character and root for her as she seeks restitution from the people that took so much away from her (things I can't mention without spoiling the movie). Bill (or what is seen of him) is played very frightening and worthy of a slice from The Bride's samurai sword. All and all, this is a great movie that would probably reach the heights of perfection if seen as a whole.RATING: ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,10 October 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Enjoying this movie is an impossible mission.
","I loved the first M:I. It was a great spy thriller. Thats why I was stoked to see the sequel! But when I saw it, I was surprised at how different it was from the original. It's like I was watching a completely unrelated movie! The movie itself is not all bad. But it should have been more like the original. And they over did the whole mask thing to death! David Fincher (director of 'Fight Club', 'Se7en', and 'Panic Room') is slated to direct M:I-3. I have complete faith in him to bring back the dark gritty feeling the first movie had into the M:I franchise.

The Matrix Reloaded," Good, albeit a little wishy washy
","250,000 sentinels are drilling into the last human city of Zion, meanwhile their mainstake Neo is on a path that would lead to the salvation of the human race, or its ultimate destruction. This is the basic plot of 'Reloaded', and the movie likes to drag while expanding on the concept. But the movie does have alot of cool new characters. Like Persephone (Monica Bellucci), The Key Maker (Randall Duk Kim), Link (Harry J. Lennix), Niobe & Ghost (Jada Pinkett-Smith & Anthony Wong) and last but not least, the Marovingian (Lambert Wilson). Also I expected more from the Twins. The 'rave in Zion', I think was pretty cool. Very stylish. The action is real cool, the movie is good. But I think there should have been more plot. And more Agent Smith,the whole Agent Smith clone thing gets a little old after awhile. But its on par with big action blockbusters of our time. Maybe even better. Hopefully, 'Revolutions' will blow us away.",10,0,0,28 May 2003
Mystic River," Why does this remind me of a Stephen King story?
","It really feels like one. Anyway, MYSTIC RIVER is about a small town who reacts to the horrible murder of the daughter of one of it's residents Jimmy Malcom (Sean Penn). Interestingly enough, his two childhood friends Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are both very much involved in the case. Sean is a state policeman investigating the crime with his partner Morpheous...I mean Whitey (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave is one of the prime suspects. The true wonder of this movie isn't really the plot, but the performances. Penn, Robbins, Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden (who plays Dave's wife, Celeste) are all fine actors that really make watching this movie fun. Most notably Harden's portrayal of a wife that is torn between her loyalty to her husband and her duty as a citizen to uphold the law. The movie has a great beginning and a fine ending. But the middle is a bit sloppy. It could have used some better editing to make the middle of the movie more taut. Other than that, the movie is pretty good. The mystery of who killed Jimmy's daughter is intriguing, but really makes for a tense thriller toward the 3rd act. People and critics are saying that this is the best movie of 2003. I don't really get that. It's a good movie. Just not a great movie. It isn't as good as some of my favorites of 2003, such as MATCHSTICK MEN or WHALE RIDER. Or even some of the popcorn flicks like PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. But still, I recommend this. See it if just for the performances.RATING: *** out of ****",8,1,1,19 October 2003
Love Actually," Exuberant, Actually
","This movie is exactly what we need at the holiday season. Something fun and funny that touches the heart in a non sappy kind of way. 'Love, Actually' is the intertwining of 9 seperate love stories. At Juliet and Peter's wedding (Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor) Pete's best friend realizes he should have told Juliet he loved her. Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his step son are trying to figure out a way for his step son to win the heart of a classmate. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) is starting to fancy his secretary, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). His sister, Karen (Emma Thompson) is finding out that her husband (Alan Rickman) is having a fling with his secretary. His employee, Sarah (Laura Linney) is trying to get something going with a fellow co-worker. Jaime (Colin Firth) is trying to write a novel while falling in love with his house keeper. And lastly, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is an aging rock star trying to get his Christmas cover song to the top of the pop charts. There are a couple of subplot stories as well. The writer/directer Richard Curtis has exactly the kind of comic flare and heart that so little filmmakers try to capture. His brand of humor can please anyone. The star power in this movie can light a building, there's so much of it. It makes you all warm inside when you leave, hoping that the same thing can happen to you in real life. The film captures a charm that Britain is uniqely known for. Makes you want to pack your bags and head there for Christmas holiday. Every character is likable. So when they transition to other parts of the story, you're always left entertained. It's a classic movie going experience.

Signs," 'Signs' that M.Night is losing his touch?
","Hopefully not. Not liking 'Sixth Sense' too much, and falling in love with 'Unbreakable' I approached this movie having been to both ends of the shamylan spectrem. After having seen this, I was still confused on what Night was trying to do. ****MINOR SPOILERS**** Mel Gibson plays a former Reverend who loses his faith after his wife is killed in a traffic accident. When these aliens come he discovers why all sorts of tragic events in his life happened. But with all the mish mash in the second act, you realize that its like an hour and a half set up for a one second punch line. I think Night was confused too. He's not sure how he wanted to tell the story. The best part is that when this alien invasion is going on, we never stray from the main characters. We only hear about the madness from T.V. and radio. The music is also first rate. I think James Newton Howard is going to be the next John Williams. Just listen to the opening credits to this movie and the score to Unbreakable. Simply magic. As a closing statement, I would like to let you know that Night wants his movies to be like feature length 'Twilight Zones' and with that in mind you have a little more respect for them. But it's certainly not enough. Hopefully, he'll do another Unbreakable. That's great way to make up for this.RATING:**1/2",Null,0,1,5 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," 'You picked the wrong house, Bub'
","'X-Men' is responsible for reviving the once dead Super-hero genre of movies. Since then, we've seen Spider-Man and Daredevil protecting the streets of New York while accomplishing box-office success. But 'X-Men', to me, is still the best Super-hero movie since Batman. So it will be rather difficult to achieve the same kind of success with a sequel, right? This is the first 'part 2' sequel from the super-hero genre since Batman Returns. So it's sort of testing the waters, on Hero staying power. 'X2' continues right where the first left off. Wolverine arrives back from his trek in Canada,at Xavier's school for mutants. Magneto is still in a plastic prison for his attack on Liberty Island. And all is right for the mutant world. But not for long. A mutant named 'Nightcrawler', attacks the president by infiltrating the white house with his teleportation powers. Which causes civil unrest in the country. Gen. William Stryker finds out about Professer X's mutant academy, and uses the attack on the president as a means to invade it. Here groups of mutants are seperated, but they find out about Styker's plan to destroy every mutant on the planet using Professer X, and a secret weapon. This situation calls for the X-Men and Magneto's (you may have guessed, he escaped) Brotherhood to unite to save the mutant population. While not exactly better than the first, it is better than most original movies. It starts off wonderfully, like the first movie never ended. The production design was consistant with the first movie, unlike the Batman franchise. And the action was superb and top-notch. My only problems are some characters dont get as much screen time as they should, Cyclops for example is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. But he does make the best of it. And the character 'Lady Deathstryke' should have been more developed. She hardly spoke at all. But the biggest problem (while still small) is the movie is a bit anti-climactic. It does have a climax, but a bit toned down for the X-men. Just a bit. Other than that, its an exciting story with a very brave ending. Everyone gave a good preformance. Most notably, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro). The movie progressed the X-Men storyline very well (unlike the Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers.
