Hereditary," Overrated seen it all before horror
",This film is all over the place & even steals scenes from a silly film like 'Poltergeist'. The overacting from zero talent trollop Toni Collette is very distracting.Scary? maybe once or twice from that 'click click' girl.,5,0,0,15 April 2020
Just Go with It," Nicole Kidman ruined it for me
","Everyone was funny in this, except that preposterous serial film killer Nicole Kidman. Who said she could do comedy. Who said she could do anything but marry Tammy Cruz & become famous for being famous. Nauseating tart.",5,0,0,15 April 2020
Zodiac," Good movie but bad hairstyles
","Hate it when contemporary movies try too hard in setting up time periods, this case being late 60's early 70's, with bad hairstyles & fashion that looks false, worse than the original bad haircuts.
Otherwise this was a good movie because of suspense & acting.",6,1,5,12 April 2020
The Exorcist," Classic that never fails to shock
","My only grievance is that some dialogue isn't fully brought across from the novel, causing some minor scenes to be not explained properly. Other than that, I've been re-watching 'The Excorcist' once a year since I was a kid. I'm now over 50 & am still shocked by it. I am not religious but that gravel voiced little girl spitting obscenities really makes me believe in evil. Her pushing a crucifix (and mummy's mouth) in her privates really gets me every time.",9,0,0,12 April 2020
Gone Girl," Sucks to high heaven
",1 star for the idea only. The actual screenplay is full of ridiculous unbelievable plot twists. It's not supposed to be science fiction is it? Otherwise you could get away with unbelievable plot twists.I can't believe this film actually found an audience.,1,0,0,12 April 2020
Midsommar," First 1 hour led me in to be assaulted
","Initially drawn in by the opening intrigue. Interesting premise, realistic acting.My eyes were then attacked by some very disturbing & disgusting sights that I'll never be able to forget. Why didn't I turn it off from then? Because like witnessing a very ugly shocking car accident, I just couldn't turn away.Oh and the fornication ? Oh my... Wtf??? Was it a comedy?There really is NO point for a film like this to be made except for some psychopath film maker to get his rocks off.",4,5,7,15 April 2020
Halloween," Ignore the imposters, this the real deal
","I remember how fearful I was first time seeing this original Halloween - the scene where the door slowly opens & the man is standing there with a white sheet over him like a ghost, glasses on. The girl sits up in bed & giggles, teasing him, thinking it's her boyfriend, but as her facial expressions change, you see her realise, this is no joke. I saw it on a little old black & white portable TV but the impact of that first watch was incredible.All sequels & remakes are cash grabs milking the original hot cow for all she's worth.The reasons this film gets 9/10 from me not 10/10 are: -
<ul><li>the low budget affects the technical quality of film, making it slightly fuzzy to watch</li><li>the pacing is sometimes too slow with scenes of the teenage chatter</li><li>Jamie Lee Curtis grates on my nerves</li></ul>",9,3,3,12 April 2020
