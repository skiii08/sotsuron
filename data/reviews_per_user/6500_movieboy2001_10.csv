Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious: Chapter 2 is scary, but isn't James Wan's best.
","Check out my reviews on www.themovieboy77.comStaring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey, Steve Coulter, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell.Directed by: James WanInsidious: Chapter 2 takes place a short time after the incidents in the first film. Josh Lambert gets his son back from 'The Further', a world full of ghosts and dark forces. Josh, however, starts acting weird and evil forces start to terrorize the family again. This time, there are a lot more twists and turns.The opening scene explains some more information of Josh's origins with the afterlife when he was a child, and things start to make more sense as the film goes along. The origins of the black veld bride are explained and you start to feel that the family is in danger as they try to solve the mystery to stop the haunting.The films scares are effective. The film has a 'haunted house' feel to it, which is an aspect I love about horror movies. There are a few cheap jump scares, but the scares are mostly due to the intensity of the story. The tone of Insidious 2 is different from the first Insidious. The first insidious, while suspenseful, took time to ease you into the story, while Insidious 2 got right in your face from the get-go. The first Insidious was more about the family and the quest to get their son back, Insidious 2 is more about the afterlife and the origins behind the reasoning of the haunting. As things start to unravel, you feel more on the edge of your seat. You really start to feel that everybody is in danger.The whole movie plays out very well, but I felt the final act to be somewhat disappointing, and at points, comical. It had a bit of a 'Shining' feel to it. I won't give it away, as the ending is the most important part of the film. Although, the twists were very well done. As you watch the film, you can't help but give a 'oh, that makes sense' reaction.Patrick Wilson plays a more 'sinister' Josh Lambert. I'm starting to become a fan of Patrick Wilson, who was also in James Wan's 'The Conjuring'. I enjoy his calming presence to the roles he's played in James Wan's films. He abandons his calming roots, and goes into a more angry character. He brought a lot of suspense to his scenes and, at times, made you hate him a little. I enjoyed the choice to give the afterlife more of a back story, and while some may find the origins a little comical, I find it to be quite haunting. Although, at times, the film seems a little too busy, jumping from story to story, making you feel a little lost as to what is happening.This is said to be James Wan's last horror film, which gives me a very bittersweet feeling. The guy is a great horror director, but it's great that he wants to branch out and do more things. To me, Insidious 2 is my least favourite from him, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was a great continuation from the original, but after seeing The Conjuring, I know the man is capable of doing more than this. The film, sometimes, relies on cheap jump scares, which takes the affect away from the story being told. I've never felt that was the way James Wan wanted his horror movies to be portrayed. He is a great story telling, and doesn't need to rely on jump scares to be scary. I'm looking forward to seeing a lot more from him in different genres.Grade: B",8,3,6,23 September 2013
Gravity," 'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins.
","'Gravity' is about two astronauts who are stranded in space as their space shuttle is destroyed by space debris coming from a destroyed satellite. They must struggle to survive and get back to earth before it's too late. I have never seen a film quite like this before. It's visually stunning and has a very emotional element to it that is hard to ignore. I must say, lots of tears were flowing from my eyes. The cinematography is breathtaking. The whole movie felt like I was actually in space with these two astronauts, experiencing what they were experiencing as they tried to get back home.I saw 'Gravity' in I MAX 3D, which is probably the best format to see it in. The 3D was perfect, and this is coming from a guy who hates 3D. There are only a few films I have seen that actually worked in 3D and this definitely tops them all. Most of the films setting is in space, and I must say, the visuals were absolutely astounding. Every details of space seemed to have been made to absolute perfection. An Oscar for visual effects will be given to this film. If it's not, I've lost hope.Steven Price's score was the best I've heard in awhile. It's definitely one I'd love to listen to on an off day. The music really made the movie just that much more emotional. Alfonso Cuaron is well known for directed 'Children of Men' and 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban', so we know what the man is capable of. His talents are put on display more than ever in this film. He also wrote the screenplay, which is really well written. There's only so much you can talk about while in space, but the screenplay was perfect with such an emotional impact.I've always had a soft spot for Sandra Bullock. She always gets to me, whether it would be making laugh or making me cry. She knows how to tell an emotional story and make you feel impacted by it. Her performance in this was amazing, with her ability to make me laugh and cry at the same time. I've never seen anything like this from her before. George Clooney was also great in this film. He played a calm and more laid back character. He has some great one liners as well.'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins. The film was visually and emotional breathtaking and is something that shouldn't be missed. I was originally not going to see it, but decided to take a chance. Thank God I did. I recommend 'Gravity' to someone who just wants to watch a great film. I guarantee you will be in awe throughout the film. The runtime is perfect. At just an hour and a half, you will leave the theatre satisfied. I'm happy that I'm getting to see all these great films. Usually, I skip out on them to go see the blockbusters. I guarantee that won't happen anymore.Grade: A+",10,5,9,20 November 2013
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim lacks intelligence, but makes up for it with eye candy and loud noises.
","Be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on themovieboy77.comPacific Rim takes place in the not-so-distant future. Where Monsters (referred to as kaiju- Japanese for Monster) are mysteriously coming out of a portal in the ocean. The humans counter attack with huge robots (referred to as jaeger-German for hunter), run by two humans, by connecting their minds through deep secrets and memories so they could synchronize their attacks.The plot is pretty generic and the movie plays out like eye candy. It's easy on the eyes and very low on plot and emotion. You tend to not feel bad for the world because it just seems so easy for the monsters and the robots to destroy it. Obviously, millions are dying but who cares. We are basically watch huge robots and monsters fighting each other to the death ! What else is there that we should care about?I will not take away points from a mindless summer action movie just because it's all action and no depth but I just felt like I couldn't care for anything or anyone who was having bad things happen to them. There was no emotional involvement or enough of a back story for me to get involved emotionally.The actors seemed to be overacting at part and, at times, seemed to be very wooden. I'd feel worse for your character if you just showed me that you actually cared about what's going on. Charlie Day was fantastic as the comic relief. He plays a scientist who is an expert on the Kaiju. I believe Charlie Day is great in every movie he's in and his future is a bright one. You also have a very funny cameo from Ron Perlman, who you may know from Hellboy, who plays a black market Kaiju parts dealer. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was also pretty bad ass. Although, through her intense emotional back story, you found it hard to care about what she went through. The characters don't react to it very well, which is disappointing because her story is the reason why she's involved in the project. Same goes for the lead, Charlie hunnam, who plays Raleigh Becket, who's emotional back story is the beginning to our story. After the beginning, you tend to forget what happens, as you are taken away through the epic battle scenes that take place.I must say, the action scenes were breathtaking and the CGI was just spectacular. I had chills every time a battle scene between the robots and the monsters was happening. Although, at times, it seemed very hard to follow as everything was happening so fast. I did see it in IMAX 3D, which made the experience enjoyable in terms of sounds and feeling, but didn't help the movie as the darker scenes were the scenes that were harder to follow, and more of the fighting scenes happened in the dark and in water. Rain and splashes from water seemed to have gotten in the way of the blows between enemies which made it hard for me to be completely blown away.Pacific Rim was your typical summer popcorn action flick. Lacking intelligence but making it up with visual eye candy and loud noises. Sometimes, that isn't always a bad thing. We expect this sometimes in summer movies. It's what we look forward to. For all of you thinking this is a Transformers rip-off, no need to worry. This is a smarter, darker take on mindless action. Not a lot of explosions or hot girls. Just something to have a little bit of fun with.Grade: B-",Null,2,5,21 October 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel isn't short on action.
","Man of Steel tells the origins of Superman, starting from his birth on Krypton to him learning to belong and becoming Superman on Earth. Superman must come to know more about his past so he could understand his special abilities. General Zod learns of Superman's destination and goes after him to get something that could help revive the deceased planet of Krypton, but not while putting the people of Earth, and Earth itself, in danger.Man of Steel isn't short on action. The last hour is basically non stop destruction, while the first hour and 20 is basically Superman's beginnings. The action gets a little over-the-top, with characters getting thrown through buildingsand I mean A LOT of buildings. Millions of people die as buildings are collapsing. It just gets a little too much. Although, the special effects were very well down and some of the action scenes were fun to watch. The random zoom-in during scenes were sometimes annoying. It was a bit overused, but it worked at times, especially when Superman was flying.The dialogue gets a little hilarious at times. A scene in particular is when General Zod, while fighting superman yells, 'either I die or you do.' I couldn't help but think to myself, who wrote that line? Of course, one of you are going to die. Superman obviously knows that. It was just one line I just couldn't stop thinking about after the film.Obviously, the few lines with dodgy dialogue weren't the actors fault. As a matter of fact, the acting was actually very good. Henry Cavill played a very good Superman/Clark Kent. He was quiet, but he looked great in the costume and looked exactly the way I envisioned Superman. Michael Shannon always plays a great bad guy. He was very animated as General Zod, and like I said, his few dodgy lines weren't his fault. He made the best of his character. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were also good as the emotional characters. Russell Crowe plays Superman's biological father Jor-El and Kevin Costner who plays the 'adoptive' father Jonathan Kent. The two fathers love their son and just want to see them be the best man he could be.The music was also very good. I always love Hans Zimmer's work. His work in The Dark Knight was a particular favourite for me. He never fails to make an action scene that much more epic or a emotional scene that much more emotional.I've never followed Superman very closely, so I can't compare it to the comic book or the old movies. All I know is that the film didn't mention Kryponite and there was no Lex Luther, which is okay with me because I knew it was an Origin story. I enjoyed Man of Steel. I waited awhile to see it, but I must say it was worth the wait and I will probably buy it eventually. I can forgive it for its flaws. I'm excited for the Batman vs Superman sequel coming out in 2015. Let's hope there's less random zoom in scenes.Grade: BPlease be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on www,themovieboy77.com",Null,3,5,21 October 2013
We're the Millers," We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before
","We're The Millers is about a pot dealer, played by Jason Sudeikis, who gets robbed of his drugs and money and his way of paying his drug lord back is by going to Mexico to smuggle some drugs for him in exchange for some cash. The Pot dealer decides the best way to get through and back through the boarder is to create a family and to go on a family vacation in a RV, because apparently, you don't get checked at the boarder when you're with your family right? Well, that's what the Millers believe ! And in movie world, that's exactly how it will happen. His family includes of a stripper, a gutter punk and his neighbour and some bonding and relationships ensue. Things go wrong with the smuggling and some bad guys come after them. They need to get the drugs to the drug king on time so they can get their money or else, they don't get anything at all.Looking beyond the stupid story, We're The Millers was surprisingly funny at parts. Jason Sudeikis is very funny and I'm looking forward to see him in more comedies. However, the film had a lot of vulgar humour and cheap laughs. Whatever happened to making good jokes and not resulting to penis and sex jokes?The humour was very low brow, but some of the jokes were funny. It just gets to the point where you get sick of the penis and sex jokes. We've seen it all before, even if it's done in different ways. In the film, a boy gets bitten in the penis by a spider. The boy pulls down his pants and you see his swollen testicle. If this scene wasn't added, I think I would have enjoyed it more. It wasn't necessary. It just seemed like a cheap laugh that I wasn't buying. People have their different tastes in comedy, and while I'm quite open to anything, it got to the point where I just didn't think it was funny anymore. The film had some funny lines, don't get me wrong, it just gets a little over done and makes you want the movie to end.I was surprised by Will Poulter. He played the nerdy type kid well and actually had most of the laughs. I've never heard of him before this, but I'm hoping I see him in more down the road. Emma Roberts was kind of a miscast for me. She didn't seem to play the punk type very well. I always see her as cute and innocent. Maybe I was just caught by surprised with how 'not innocent' her character was. Jennifer Aniston was basically playing the role she always plays. Only difference is, she was a stripper. She was great in Horrible Bosses. That role was a change from the same role we've seen her play since Friends.Would I recommend We're The Millers? Well, if you like vulgar humour, then yes. We're The Miller is one of those comedies that has a few laugh out loud moments, but it isn't something we've haven't seen before. It's one of those movies that shouldn't be taken serious because there's nothing serious about it. Just your hard R movie with an unbelievable story. Sometimes, those movies are great, and while We're The Millers was alright, it was too vulgarity.Grade: C+Please be sure to check out my movie reviews and entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com",Null,1,2,21 October 2013
Frozen," 'Frozen' is your typical Disney story about true love, but it's a different kind of true love that made me feel even more touched than a typical Disney love story.
","'Frozen' is about a princess who goes on a journey to find her sister, who accidentally uses her ice powers and ends up giving her kingdom an eternal winter. Joined by an ice trader, his best friend, who just so happens to be a reindeer, and a talking snowman, the princess must find her sister and return her to the kingdom before someone else finds her first.'Frozen' is your typical Disney movie. Fantastic music, humour and animation makes the wheels turn for this fantastic joy ride. Kids will adore the colours and characters that are brought before them, and adults will enjoy the humour and the music that they may remember from older Disney films.'Frozen' couldn't have come at a better time. With the year lacking great children's films, 'Frozen' comes out just before the holiday season, which is great marketing for Disney considering how many kids will want anything for Christmas that has to do with 'Frozen'. I recommend adults pick up the soundtrack. It's a fantastic listen as the music is just breathtaking.Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez do a fantastic job bringing this Disney Musical back to what made Disney movies such as Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid amazing. Kristen Bell, who voices Anna and who I've never heard sing before, does a great job keeping up with Broadway star Idina Menzel, who voices Anna's snow queen sister, Elsa. The highlight of the film is Idina Menzel singing the song 'Let It Go'. The emotion and her voice sends shivers down your spine and the scene while she sings it is just absolutely gorgeous to look at. The Demi Lovato version, which plays over the credits, is also very good, but not as good as Idina Menzel.Josh Gad, who voices Olaf The Snowman, does a great job playing the comedic sidekick character. Olaf adds to a long list of fantastic Disney characters that make you laugh. He does a hilarious musical number about a snowman who wants to take part in summer. The last half of the movie hardly had any music, which I would say would be the only disappointment. You have great performers such as Jonathan Groff, who some may know from Glee, and Idina Menzel. I just felt like they should have sang one more musical number.'Frozen' is your typical Disney story about true love, but it's a different kind of true love that made me feel even more touched than a typical Disney love story. The bond between siblings is something most of us can relate to, and throughout the film, you feel the bond between these two sisters. Take your children for a day/night out and go see this film. I guarantee the whole family will love it. Also, try to show up for the short film 'Get A Horse', which is a short film staring Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The short film brings back the old school Mickey shorts and gives a modern look to them. It's something you don't want to miss.Grade: A",9,1,4,4 December 2013
Prisoners," Prisoners is a well-acted, disturbing crime-thriller that will make you think about letting your kids wander off alone.
","Prisoners is a well-acted, disturbing crime-thriller that will make you think about letting your kids wander off alone. When two little girls are kidnapped, Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is set out to put together the pieces of the puzzle. He has Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano) in custody, a boy who owns an RV the girls were playing on, but let's him go because he has an IQ of a ten year old and he can find no evidence against him. Convinced Loki's not doing he's job right, Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Alex and torture him for information about his daughters whereabouts.The film is a 150 minute disturbing piece of work that will get to you if you have children in your life. It's a dark film that holds onto you and never lets you go. The entire time, I was thinking of my nieces and nephews and I must say, a film has never gotten to me as much as this one did. It was almost like I was in the film, living on what these people were going through, and I must say I was terrified to tears.The film had a lot of twist and turns. I suggest you don't read any spoilers, as the film is perfect without knowing what happens. Although, this is the type of film where people will probably want to check out spoilers, to know the fate of the young girls, I strongly suggest you don't.Hugh Jackman, who showed off his vocals and acting skills in Les Miserables, gives us one of the most sinister good guys characters you'll ever see. He's a very talented actor, and I feel an Oscar nomination coming his way. Who really surprised me in this film was Jake Gyllenhaal, who played Detective Loki. His character was very sympathetic to the case and I feel Jake Gyllenhaal deserves kudos for his work. He's grown into an amazing actor. I enjoyed him immensely in End Of Watch.Prisoners is one of those films you talk about after walking out of the theatre. The film is very twisted and suspenseful and I feel it's runtime was perfect for the film. Keep in mind, the film is very dark. The events that happen in this film can happen in real life, which I hated about the film, but that would be the point of the film. The film can relate to people with children in their lives and you'll just want to go home after the film and hold them. Will I ever see Prisoners again? I'm not too sure I'd want to be put through the haunting experience again. One things for sure, it was an amazing film.Grade: APlease be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com.",Null,1,1,21 October 2013
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years A Slave is the film of the year.
","12 Years A Slave is about a free black man named Solomon Northup, from upstate New York, who gets kidnapped and sold into slavery. The film follows the mans journey to survive and get back his freedom.I haven't seen a film quite like this before. It's one that doesn't let back on the cruelty and torture that was brought upon slaves in the 1800′s. It's wasn't comfortable to watch at times, but that was the point. You aren't supposed to think slavery is a light topic. 12 Years A Slave is a film that will bring tears to your eyes. They aren't treated this way, but most of these slaves are innocent. Families torn apart to serve others and who get tortured when something wasn't done right or they look at their superiors the wrong way..The performances were breathtaking. Chiwetel Ejiofor was just brilliant as Solomon Northup, a man who is fighting to survive and get back to his family. You can feel the mans heartbreak and fear just by his facial expressions. That's what makes a fantastic actor. Michael Fassbender, who plays a cruel plantation owner, was also very good. There wasn't a moment where you didn't hate him. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o was also fantastic and Brad Pitt made his 5 minutes of screen time as powerful and meaningful as he could. He played a Canadian Carpenter who felt strongly about the topic of slavery, and who gives a great speech about his feelings late in the film. Pitt plays the more sensible type in the film, and his performance will bring you to tears when you feel a sense of relief knowing there's a character with a heart like his.Hans Zimmer has to be one of my favourite composers. His music can break your heart, get your adrenaline pumping or keep you smiling. His music added to the heartbreak of the film. When tears are rolling down your eyes, it's hard to stop from crying out loud when his score comes on. I don't usually comment on a soundtrack, but Hans Zimmer was a fantastic choice for this film.The film length is perfect. I understand people can't sit through a 2 hour and 20 minute film, but with a film like this, it's great because of the impact the runtime has. You get to feel and see the pain that the slaves have. Needless to say, this film has taught me a lot about history, and how to treat people. To people who are looking for a light fun film, than 12 Years A Slave is not for you. Don't walk on thinking this is going to be all light and fluffy, because I can assure you, it's not for the light hearted. Slaves are being tortured and mistreated in the most brutal ways and you sometimes have to turn away or cover your eyes, but as I said, that's the impact the film is supposed to have on you.Needless to say, I loved 12 Years A Slave. It was a film that is great for a History class to go and watch. It's a great topic of conversation and will make us think twice about the way we treat people. 12 Years A Slave is the film of the year, but I know, with a year ending soon and still a lot of Oscar films to come, there's still a lot to look forward to. You get a rare type of film every few years. A film that will win a deserving amount of Oscars or will make you want to scream when they don't. This film is that film.Grade: A+",10,11,23,4 November 2013
The Conjuring," The Conjuring is probably one of the most compelling horror stories I've seen in awhile.
","Please check out more of my reviews on www.themovieboy77.comReview: The ConjuringAs I sit in the theatre with my friend waiting for the movie to start, I see a bunch of teenagers walking in. I then reminisce of the times I've went to go see Horror movies, where i have a bunch of teens either laughing or talking throughout the movie. This would occur in The Conjuring, but it wouldn't be long before it would go dead silent and everybody would get lost in the story.The movie begins in the early 70′s with Ed & Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators talking to two young ladies and a man about the 'Annabelle Case', a case in which a doll is possessed by a young girl who was killed in the home the three are living in. I won't give the rest away. The little you know, the better of an experience it will be.Next, we meet the Perron family. A happy family with no history of any demon activity until they move into their new home in Harrisville, Rhode Island. The next half hour will build up to the most terrifying story you will ever hear. Again, I don't want to give too much away.The acting is superb. Lili Collins is great as Carolyn Perron. Her performance reminded me of a young Ellen Burstyn from The Exorcist. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were also great as Ed & Lorraine Warren. They showed a lot of emotion and you couldn't help but be compelled to their characters.In the beginning of the movie, Ed Warren states 'We've been called ghost hunters. Paranormal researchers. Wackos.' in which Lorraine replies, 'But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren.' The two characters were more than just paranormal investigators. They were also parents. Their compassion for this family was the reason why you love the characters. Their willingness to help people and delicacy toward the case was just superb and wasn't played out to be some horror movie cliché. You could help but feel for every character involved.The film was unlike any horror movie you'll see. It didn't depend on blood and gore or jump scares to startle you. It was just a compelling and terrifying story with some visuals that may haunt your dreams for awhile. It felt like a 70′s horror movie. One that makes you want to sleep with one eye open.My only issue is the 'based on the true story' aspect of the movie. There is a scrolling text at the beginning of the movie revealing the story of the Warrens and before the title card, there's text saying it's based on a true story. To tell a story through film, I believe there should be some sort of real life interviews or proof of the facts of the story. It'll make it feel more real and may have pulled me in more, which at the time, I thought wasn't possible but after thinking about it, I would have given this film a perfect rating if I saw some truth behind the story.James Wan, director of The Conjuring, has also directed the first Saw film and Insidious, which are two different types of horror films but are still worth the watch. I recommend The Conjuring to anyone who wants a good story and great acting. It is very scary but there's something about it that just pulls you in. It makes you craving more. One thing is for sure, I will be talking about this one for awhile.Grade: A",10,1,3,21 October 2013
The Hangover Part III," The Hangover 3 is probably the worst in the trilogy, even losing out to the lack-luster 2nd instalment that everyone found to be too dull and boring.
","The Hangover 3 is the conclusion to the trilogy. The story revolves around Alan, who has been off his medication for awhile and is up to a lot of bizarre Behaviour. The Wolf Pack, which consists of his friends Stu, Doug and Phil, takes Alan on a road trip to Arizona to get some help, only for them to get stopped by Marshall. Marshall is after his half of precious gold that Leslie Chow stole from him, and taking Doug as insurance, he tells the rest of the wolf pack that they must get Chow and his half of the gold to Marshall in three days or else Doug will die. How are the Wolf Pack involved, you ask? Well, you need to watch to find out. That's if, you can survive the first 20 minutes.The Hangover 3 is probably the worst in the trilogy, even losing out to the lack-luster 2nd instalment that everyone found to be too dull and boring. The Hangover 3 manages to take away most of the comedy aspect of the first two and turn it into a dark thriller, which some may find a little bit too much to handle. The film manages to let you know what your in for in the first 5 minutes, with Alan driving with Giraffe on the highway only for him to decapitate it and cause a big accident. The scene is probably the funniest thing about the film, but even than, the scene wasn't even funny.The first hangover is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so to top that would be impossible. The Hangover 2, while at least tried to be wildly funny, was basically the same as the first The Hangover, but had nothing much to offer. The third strays away from 'The Hangover' formula and goes into a less comedic, more thriller type film. The film fails in that aspect and makes us wish the series ended after the first.I bought this film thinking I was going to get something funny. I love the first Hangover and could tolerate the second, but I didn't know this film would be this dull. It had nothing going for it, and concentrated too much on Leslie Chow and Alan, who may have stole the show in the first Hangover, but you get tired of them in this one. Maybe you can't have too much of a good thing.Grade: D",Null,2,5,21 October 2013
