Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Too much
","While even I have to admit there were moments where I laughed out loud at the idiocy of some of the people 'Borat' meets in his cross-country journey, this movie was just too much. It goes too far, is too crass, and while the idea is beautifully crafted politically, it loses its focus. You will surely enjoy his portrayal of the idiotic American (everything from bigot hick to religious fanatic to drunken frat boy), but the 'glorious nation of Kazakhstan' doesn't stop there. I could even put up with the defamation of our National Anthem and the constant barrage of sexual situations, but it goes even further than that! I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to movies, but I'm warning you now, Borat will have you leaving the theater in discomfort and confused as to where your 9 dollars went. The racist and sexist stuff I can take with a grain of salt, but it was the excessive (and pointless: the movie could have been terrific without it) nudity that finally pushed it over the top for me. Borat is just too much.",1,212,414,25 November 2006
