The Incredible Hulk," The Hulk returns with more effects, less soul
","Very few Hollywood action movies get it right. In this age of computer generated images in blockbusters, far too often, depth of character is sacrificed. They might thrill but fail to resonate emotionally. 'The Incredible Hulk' has plenty going for it with its action, but just ends up being an action movie with very little to care about.This movie seems more like a knee-jerk reaction to the Oscar winning director Ang Lee's more cerebral, brooding and introspective 'Hulk' (2003). Hard-core fans were put off by the psychology of it all and wanted more action. So, director Louis Leterrier falls into that trap and unfortunately goes the other extreme. It is clearly more interested in the action and loses out on a potentially touching if not more visceral underpinnings.The Hulk does not want to be a monster again and his love tries to help him against the wishes of her father. This plot line could have been further delved into without taking away from the action. The movie fails to do so.The opening credits encapsulate the story of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) when angry turns into the Hulk. It then continues from where the earlier movie left off. We find Banner in a South American town trying to find a cure. He also learns to control his anger. The army general, Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), is hell bent on finding him and extract that which makes him the Hulk and use it to make a weapon.He eventually finds Banner with the help of a mercenary Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) but the Hulk escapes and returns home. But Blonsky also turns into a Hulk like monster called the Abomination and they face off in the end.There is a new cast for this movie who really don't get much material to work with. Liv Tyler playing the love does a decent job and her scenes with Norton are tender. Roth playing the cold and ruthless Blonsky shines and injects the movie with some refreshing human edginess. Norton co-wrote the movie with Zac Penn. There were rumours that Norton was upset that the story of Banner was compromised for the sake of action and he even refused to do initial promotional work for the movie.The action sequences are clearly better staged than the earlier movie and even Hulk looks much more believable. The film makers have clearly worked on the CG imagery. But it is very hard to look into the Hulk's soul and see any kind of anguish and turmoil the character is clearly going through. The only emotion that seems to be relayed is anger. This struggle between Banner and Hulk is woefully under worked and the movie's biggest failure.The script is damp and could have done more with the humour. The other Marvel comic super hero movie 'Iron Man' was well served with a witty script and thismovie could have done with more light hearted moments. Since the film makers seemed intent on satisfying fans, for those looking for a thrills and not much brooding this move will deliver.",7,2,5,3 August 2008
Zodiac," There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer
","Zodiac is one of those movies that might prove rewarding to the patient viewers. The movie is about three hours long and is based on the 1986 book 'True Crime' by Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) about America's most sinister unsolved crimes: the San Francisco Bay Area serial killings by a person called Zodiac.In it's style and presentation it almost seems like you are watching a long episode of Cold Case and is quite unlike David Fincher's previous movies (se7en, Fight Club). This subtle,straight forward and no frills approach could be a let down for some people. It is also not a movie that would be suitable for any kind of mood. I want to say it's similar to Shawshank Redemption in that it takes its time to develop and grow over you, however its not that rewarding, because of the fact that the killer never gets caught. It does narrow down to one suspect, but the investigators could not find enough evidence to nail him.The movie spans a period of around 22 years starting on July 4th 1969 with Zodiac shooting Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau, who we later find out were very critical to finding the killer's identity or at least narrowing it down. In August 1969 the Zodiac letters begin to arrive. The first three are sent to Vallejo Times Herald, SF Chronicle and SF Examiner. The three letters had one part of a cryptogram each which according to him contained clues to his identity. He also took credit of the murders in these letters. Soon after these letters appear, four men go on his trail, a self-destructive ace reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), highly intelligent editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the homicide detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) who is accompanied by his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). These four independently and sometimes working as a team gather tons and tons of circumstantial evidence and get so obsessed with catching the killer that it takes a toll on their personal lives. Ultimately David and Robert come very close to proving that Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) is the real Zodiac, but there is no solid proof to their belief. However since the movie follows the book and findings of Robert Graysmith very closely so as an audience our perception is a bit skewed towards who Graysmith thought was the real killer. There were so many loose ends to this case that the case is still open in few Northern California counties, however SFPD shut the case down in April 2004.The tag line of the movie 'There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer', is very appropriate to the way each character is shown to throw away his life in the quest of Zodiac. It is in this aspect that the movie excels, however if you are expecting a thriller you'll be disappointed. There are few scenes here and there which create suspense, but they are few and the movie feels like a slow burn than an explosive suspenseful thriller. The direction is awesome for the kind of movie Fincher wanted to make and he recreates the 60s and 70s San Francisco successfully. However we've seen him make Se7en and Fight Club so something like this seems very 'normal' for him to do and normal at times can be boring.In terms of performances, Jake Gyllenhaal excels in the role of a geeky cartoonist who comes to life when he gets obsessed with the case. Robert Downey Jr. is funny and likable. It almost seemed that he was playing himself in the movie. Mark Ruffalo after starring in a few romantic movies, gets to showcase his acting prowess and he does a remarkable job as well. John Carroll Lynch as the prime suspect looks menacing at times.It's tough to be harsh on a movie like Zodiac where you can see that a lot of work has gone into this movie both in terms of direction and acting. The movie has an interesting story line and the fact that it is true makes it even more exciting. It's the approach which will ultimately decide whether you like the movie or not. For me it worked to a certain extent and I usually like watching movies like this on a DVD. So if you are like me you might want to wait for it to come out.",9,0,0,3 August 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Johnny Depp sings for his gruesome supper in Tim Burton's latest Gothic masterpiece.
","A dark cityscape opens Sweeney Todd, Tim Burton's adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical, but a baby-faced sailor (Jamie Campbell Bower) seems not to notice the gloom. Dismissing all the glories he's seen in his travels, he cheerily decides that there's 'no place like London,' in a voice chipper enough to force the sun to shine. But Sweeney Todd isn't that kind of musical. It needs a different kind of hero, and Bower is soon forced out of frame by the more troubled face of Johnny Depp, who sings, 'You are young. Life has been kind to you You will learn.' Life was once kind to Depp's Sweeney Todd. As a younger man, he was a successful barber with a beautiful wife and child. But the evil Judge Turpin (a perfectly cast Alan Rickman) decided to take Depp's family as his own, and had Depp arrested and deported. After more than a decade in exile, the newly bloodthirsty Depp returns to reclaim what's his, or failing that, punish those who took it away. He soon finds an ally in Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett, proprietor of a filthy bakery famed for 'the worst pies in London,' which she conveniently makes below Depp's old shop.The character of Sweeney Todd has been slicing up victimsand sometimes having them baked into pies by Mrs. Lovettin pulp literature, films, and plays since the 19th century. Inspired by a 1973 play by Christopher Bond, Sondheim's 1979 musical turned him into a pitiable monster whose thirst for revenge went beyond understandable to become sympathetic. Enveloping the tale in dark humor and lush, sometimes frighteningly romantic music, Sondheim's musical made Todd's story into an inspired, tuneful wallow in the darkest depths of human experience. Burton brings his signature visual style, and a pair of stock players for his stars, into this film adaptation, but he wisely follows Sondheim's lead, letting the music and spirit of the original piece show the way.It goes to some pretty dark places. Though it took 28 years to make it to the screen, this musical about revenge and its repercussions seems fitting for our revenge-steeped times. Depp and Carter commit beastly deeds, but they keep their characters' humanity front and center. Even Rickman's villain projects a surprising vulnerability, and though all three stars have clearly been chosen for their acting skills rather than their singing voices, the earthiness of their vocal performances keeps the film grounded in the grit and grime of a world that grinds up the innocent and the guilty alike. Those who try to turn the crank themselves get the worst of it in the end, but even they deserve a chance to sing about the love and hope that brought them so low.",9,0,0,3 August 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimate thriller , engaging viscerally and intellectually
","It is rare for Hollywood to make an action movie that can keep audiences captivated for its entire duration. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is that rare gem of an action movie that is engaging viscerally and intellectually.Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this third of the Bourne movies - based on the popular Robert Ludlum novels - along with director Paul Greengrass, who also helmed the second installment 'The Bourne Supremacy'.Damon's Bourne continues on his quest to find out what his motives for killing people are: He is fully aware that he is a killer but has no idea how he became one. And since he has amnesia he has to depend on vague fleeting memories to piece together the puzzle.He might be troubled but he is also resolute. He wants to find out how he became what he is. It is this resoluteness and the quest that is the heart and soul of the movie.The most exciting aspect of the movie is the momentum of the action. In essence it is just one long chase scene. It sets the pulse from the word go and for its entire duration does not miss a beat.The movie begins by jumping in exactly where the second movie ended and doesn't bother to provide any background details. For those who have not seen the first two installments, this movie will be slightly confusing.The chase scenes are exhilarating but not in a stylistic way. The director employs the hand-held camera technique, which makes us feel we are in the centre of the action. The action has an organic feel to it.In a one-on-one fistfight sequence there is no background music but just the sound of heavy breathing and cracking bones. Since it is in an apartment the two fighters resort to using a book, a rag and a toothbrush. It is a testament to the genius of the director that he creates engrossing action without resorting to explosions and blood.Damon fleshes out his role with great subtlety. And the cast is rounded off well by some fine performances. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy, the CIA boss who is responsible for catching Bourne.Scott Glen appears briefly as CIA director who just wants his subordinates to get the job done without involving him and the Oscar-nominated David Strarthairn is a company representative who is muscling in the operation to nab Bourne.The legendary Albert Finney drops by to play the man responsible for making Bourne a killing machine. Julia stiles is Nicky Parsons, a young agent who has known Bourne from the beginning and provides what little information she can to him.Another merit of this movie is the global locales. It jumps from London to Moscow, Paris, Tangier and New York. In 'The Bourne Supremacy', a pivotal development of the story where a key member gets killed takes place in Goa.Bourne speaks every language he will need to know in any place he finds himself in. Though the movie shifts locales the thread of Bourne's purpose runs clearly through and the pulse is steadily maintained.The movie has fared well at the box office internationally and is sure to boost the fortunes of Damon and the director. But on a cinematic level, the movie has just raised the bar for action movies and Hollywood is going to have to scramble to keep pace with Bourne.",10,1,3,3 August 2008
21," '21' a disappointing movie on all counts
","'21' is one of the most disappointing and dismaying movies to emerge from the land of dreams - America. It tells us that immorality is not just a modern motivating mantra, it is fine, if used in the right doses, no matter how many feelings or bones get crushed under one's enterprising spirit.The fact that all the debased characters, using a pack of cards to make a fool of the universe (and that includes us in the audience, watching their Casino Royale-meets-Quentin Tarantino antics), are based on real people doesn't make the film or its characters more interesting. It just makes them more annoying in their ambitions.The central character of a young, middle-class student struggling to make ends meet is played by fairly wooden actor Jim Sturgess, who just might become the latest teen sensation after this film. He has the right attitude of 'I know it all though I may appear stupid and dumb'.When you're young, you do stupid things - like taking on a massive gambling organisation in Las Vegas. But one presumes neither the film's director nor the professor-protagonist who trains his students into reckless and criminal gambling are young and stupid.So what makes the film's sassy premise - gambling your way to doom - such a good idea? There's no tangible explanation why a noble profession like teaching should be turned into a blackjack game. '' is the college-campus version of 'Ocean's 11'. Here, however, the glamour of gambling is much reduced since the protagonists with the cards are confused teenagers who should know better. There's a callow hero and a shallow mentor and the twain never meet as individuals.The other members of the blackjack team are woefully hazy in their depiction, as though the director didn't want to invest too much time and energy getting into the fringe players' lives.There are some expertly done shots of the casino's compulsions spilling into colourful chips in a splendid tumble. But that's it. '' is more about the hype and hip than the plot and script. There're no surprises in the way the maths team subverts its art into a Zen of vice.You really can't like these guys, let alone feel connected with them. Not when the young hero sells out his guru to the casino goons in return for his own freedom. He walks free. So do we. But after two hours of wondering which side we are on.",4,0,1,3 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," Yet another brilliant Movie from Coen Brothers
","'No Country for Old Men' is a grim and unsettling film that curiously makes its viewer beg for more of the same. In adapting Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, sibling writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, the team behind 'Fargo' and 'O Brother Where Art Thou?,' keep their quirky humor in check and stare unflinchingly at the worst humanity has to offer. As a result, the duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.The Coens have always penned lively dialogue ('We felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us,' says John Goodman, justifying his prison break in 'Raising Arizona') and demonstrated visual panache (the wood chipper scene in 'Fargo' is hard to forget).But the characters in 'No Country for Old Men,' despite being larger than life, seem more real and believable. It's much easier to get worked up over their outcomes than wondering how the broad characters in 'Intolerable Cruelty' might fare.It also doesn't hurt that the new film is loaded with several first-rate performers who can make potentially outlandish situations seem real. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Ed Tom Bell, a grizzled, third-generation lawman who has stumbled upon a grizzly case that makes anything he's handled before seem tame.An antelope hunter named Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the aftermath of a drug deal that turned into a massacre. The only survivor of the class is a mortally-wounded man who's only able to beg for water, which Llewellyn doesn't have.In what seems like a major stroke of luck, he discovers a case of money that no one at the site of the debacle has lived to collect. He takes it home to his trailer park, bewildering his wife (Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald).The seemingly untraceable fortune actually has several people eager to claim it. A flashy hired gun named Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) has the dual task of retrieving the money and finding another fellow who's after it.Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, obliterating his Spanish accent) may have been hired initially to find the cash, but he quickly leaves a trail of blood as long as the Nile. With his drooping bangs, Chigurh looks almost comical from a distance. His cold, brown eyes, however, betray how dangerous he can be. He murders anyone who gets in his way. And he often seems to dispatch people simply for pleasure.He's also as inventive as he is arbitrarily cruel. He can turn air tanks into a both a weapon and a door opener. Think of his as a Satanic McGuyver. Barden also projects the right blend of menace and buffoonery that makes each of Chigurh's attacks seem appropriately shocking.As Chigurh's quarry, Brolin is appropriately compelling. He may have been dumb to get himself in his current predicament, but he's resourceful enough to survive longer than anyone else who crosses Chigurh's path. Brolin has a likable sad sack quality to makes you wish he could get out of his grim situation.Following all of the sordid events is Jones' Earl Tom. The sheriff can read a crime scene with astonish accuracy, but correctly worries that it will take a Herculean effort to prevent a greater bloodbath. Jones demonstrates a fascinating vulnerability that belies his tough guy image and manages to make a character who functions primarily as a narrator engaging on his own terms.In addition to three terrific lead performances, the Coens manage to deliver some of their usual wordplay. When asked how dangerous Chigurh is, Wells simply replies, 'Compared to what? The bubonic plague?' And thanks to McCarthy's plot line, they also have some genuinely surprising plot twists. The film constantly throws off a viewer's expectations.'No Country for Old Men' is sometimes a difficult film to watch because it's unflinchingly grim and often leaves viewers to reach their own decisions about what happened.But the film lingers in the brain long after the credits start rolling and proves the Coen's can examine the frailty of the human heart as skillfully as they can manipulate words and images.",10,4,6,3 August 2008
The Dark Knight," 'The Dark Knight': Superhero Movies Get a Better Class of Criminal
","I can think of quite a few descriptions for THE DARK KNIGHT. But truthfully, it is very difficult to describe how the film went above and beyond my expectations. Christopher Nolan's latest is a near masterpiece that is smothered in atmosphere, and delivers all the thrills you'd expect and more. First off, while BATMAN BEGINS reawakened the comic book hero, the latest chapter offers up the best Batman ever. Nolan introduces a brand new character that he brilliantly shoots around, he surrounds the dark buildings with shades of blue and sweeps through the streets and alley ways. That character is Gotham City. Okay, this is not the first time we've seen his Gotham. But this time around it feels more alive and it seems to be closing in on the good and the bad, as criminal activity takes over what may have once been a beautiful, bustling city. It is so splendidly photographed, that every shot of this majestic land brings us closer and closer into their world. This is by far, his most daring and ambitious film. In fact, this is one of the few superhero film that is absolutely Oscar worthy. This is as good of a Best Picture as any film could be.As far as the plot is concerned, I think it would be better for you to know as little as possible. There is a very strong and effective story with a wonderfully written script by Christopher and his brother Jonathan. They give each and every character a real reason to exist. The dialogues are surprisingly smart, as are the people that live and breathe in this world of mayhem. And that mayhem, is mostly created by a nasty little character called The Joker. If you've seen the trailers for the film, it won't surprise you that Heath Ledger is great in the role. But he is more than great, he is absolutely frightening and brilliant. The character is evil incarnate, a man who feels no empathy and evokes no sympathy. He is referred to as a mad dog even by himself: 'I'm a dog chasing cars,' he tells his do-gooding nemesis. 'I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.' Backing up this notion with evocative cinematography, returning director and co-writer Christopher Nolan includes a near-silent shot of Ledger in pancake makeup leaning out the window of a Gotham City police car, hair streaming and the wind in his jowls, like a happy Doberman.'Madness is like gravity,' the Joker gloats at one point. 'All it takes is a little push.' Belief works the same way.The Joker is the world's first anarcho-terrorist; interested neither in power nor money, he simply wants to see things go boom. He is a close cousin to Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, but even that guy was taking orders from someone.Late in the game, suspended upside down from a bit of Bat rope, the Joker smiles (as he must) and tells his captor: 'I think you and I are destined to do this forever.' Alas, not.As for the rest of the cast, I would hate to see the wonderful Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent not receive the accolades he deserves. I've always thought he was a terrific actor, but he really delivers in TDK. Harvey Dent is a true hero in a mob infested world. He is a man for the people that wants to save his beloved city. Aaron approaches his character with such an honest and sincere performance. As he begins to let the violence and hate seep through him, he undergoes his transformation. In many ways, he is probably the most relatable character in the film. One of the things that makes The Dark Knight the classic it is destined to become, is the perfect casting of both Echkart and Ledger. A superhero flick can only be as good as its villain, and they don't get any better than this.Obviously, I can't go without saying how important Christian Bale is as Batman. It is such a pleasure to see an actor of his caliber playing a role like this. But Maggie Gyllenhaal is also a major improvement over Katie Holmes. I don't dislike Ms. Holmes as a actress, in fact, I find her quite charming. But Gyllenhaal comes across as a stronger, and more believable heroine.Aside from those I've mentioned, I also have to say that both Gary Oldman and Eric Roberts are a welcome addition. It was nice to see Oldman grow from the first film and it is even nicer to see the guy go against type again, as a non-quirky, oddball free character. He is one of the very best actors of any generation. How wonderful it is to see him as a regular part of the Batman mythology.Yes, I loved THE DARK KNIGHT. It is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil, and everything in between.Yet in the end, Heath Ledger's Joker, Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent, Christian Bale as The Dark Knight and a phenomenal vision realized by Christopher Nolan makes TDK easily one of the years best.",10,8,18,1 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is a blend of gripping drama and frightening reality
","For most of us diamonds are a symbol of status and wealth, but in the countries where they are mined it stands for nothing more than racial oppression and economic exploitation.Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is a blend of gripping drama and frightening reality that captures the conflict for the possession of precious stones.It is an edge-of-the-seat action thriller with morality as its subtext. It's difficult to find a superlative for Zwick's excellent craftsmanship which keeps you hooked till the end.As the story unfolds you gasp in shock, flinch in pain, shudder at the unrestrained brutality and by the time the movie reaches its climax you are dismayed and disgusted seeing the so-called civilised people losing their sanity in quest for diamonds.It is one of those rare films that leave you satiated but at the same time has lingering effect on the mind. You are haunted by the images of innocent children, who are kidnapped, brainwashed, drugged and forced to take up arms to terrorise and kill people.You are likely to have an aversion to the precious stones after watching the film.Set in Sierra Leone during the 1990's civil war, it revolves around a diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an ex-mercenary who can go to any length to possess a pink diamond found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsoun), a fisherman.Vandy is a victim of the civil war carried on by hell-raising rebels executing one of the most brutal military campaigns to make more money for themselves and the so-called sophisticated diamond merchants.During an attack by a rebel group, Vandy is captured and separated from his family. The rebels forced him to work in a diamond field and while digging for the precious stones he finds a rare pink diamond and hides it. But, before he could retrieve the priceless stone, the diamond field is attacked.What happens after that forms the climax of the film! Performance wise it is flawless! DiCaprio is simply awesome. He has certainly come a long from his days of 'Gangs of New York'. His maturity as an actor is evident in his two back-to-back releases - 'The Departed' and 'Blood Diamond'.His character has many shades in the film and he excels in each of them, especially in scenes where he brings forth his character's internal conflict.Djimon Hounsou as Vandy, one of the many Africans who dreams of a normal life, immensely impresses you with his performance. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Hounsou is indeed a highlight of the film.Apart from DiCaprio and Hounsou, Jennifer Connelly too impresses as a journalist who tries to expose the consequences of the conflict through her write-ups. However, she is aware that it will not have the desired effect on people tucked away in a safe world.She knows people will read it, discuss it and then go back to their routine lives.There was a lot of hype about Indian actor Gaurav Chopra sharing screen space with Hollywood biggies, but he just has a blink-and-miss role in the film.The director has not only succeeded in extracting the best from each of his actors but has also managed to put across a moral message without making it too preachy and melodramatic.'Blood diamond' is a must see.",10,4,6,3 August 2008
The Departed," Scorsese has simply complimented the original.
","n a strange twist of irony, a Hollywood movie borrows from a Hong Kong film hugely inspired by American crime classics. Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed' does seem to be influenced by 'Infernal Affairs' - the Hong Kong film released in 2002.Scorsese has simply complimented the original. The film's script retains the essence of the earlier film but also adds much more flesh to it.This is Leonardo Dicaprio's third film with Scorsese after 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator'.The plot revolves around Billy Costigan (Dicaprio), a cop pretending to be a crook and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) doing just the opposite. They both soon find themselves embroiled in situations where it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the good from the bad, as the line gets more and more blurred.Colin has been trained to be a mole by his gangster mentor Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy, on the other hand, realises that he will never be a good cop and so agrees to go undercover and join Costello's gang. As the story progresses, the pressure on the two becomes unbearable as they have to do things completely against their true nature ... and they fail.The movie's thrill factor is served well by a series of coincidences like when Billy and Colin fall for Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), the psychiatrist who treats Billy but is already involved with Colin. With a story where the main characters have to lie their way out of every situation, there have to be enough twists and the plot's ends are not tied up till the very last frame of the film.One of the strongest points of the movie is the acting. Both Dicaprio and Damon are excellent. They even begin to start looking like each other as they become more and more entrenched in their deception.Jack Nicholson, who is a legend in his own right, is brilliant in this role where he sinks his teeth with devilish charm and delight. His performance is electrifying in what is surprisingly the first time he has teamed up with Scorsese.Farmiga convincingly portrays a great mix of sex appeal and intellect.Alec Baldwin, playing the arrogant policeman, has some of the funniest moments with Wahlberg's Dignam. Martin Sheen plays the father figure Captain Queenan - the warmest character in the movie. He may not be ruthless but he is honest and dedicated.The violence in the film jarring at times but seems to be judiciously used for the right impact. It is not blood soaked as much as sprinkled. It fits in well with the gritty nature of the place, profession and people in the film.Scorsese has always been a director who has tackled grandiose themes like sin, redemption and loyalty. But in 'The Departed', he sticks to a more narrative framework but still tackles the themes albeit more subtly.The script is by William Monahan, which comes as a pleasant surprise considering his last script was for the bloated, flat and insipid 'Kingdom of Heaven'.Howard Shore contributes to the score but is helped by Scorsese's brilliant use of pop music, which is a trait of all his movies. There is an interesting mix of The Rolling Stones, John Lennon, the rapper Nas, Van Morrison and the Beach Boys.'The Departed' is pure entertainment in the mould of an American crime classic, but is sure to please audiences the world over.",9,1,4,3 August 2008
Hancock," 'Hancock' - just for action movie fans
","The glut of super-hero summer movies coughed up by Hollywood continues with 'Hancock'. Comparisons with the likes of the already released 'Iron Man' and 'The Incredible Hulk' and the yet to be released 'The Dark Knight' and 'Hellboy' are unavoidable; though it is clear that 'Hancock' falls short of all these movies.The movie is a wasted opportunity. Will Smith, the most dependable Hollywood actor right now, with his last nine movies topping the box office, plays an unlovable superhero who goes through a transformation.It is a very promising premise, but the writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan along with director Peter Berg seem to lose their bearings half way and allow the movie to take one of the most bizarre and wholly boring twists in any Hollywood movie this year.Not even the talented Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron and the dependable Jason Bateman can rescue or clarify this muddle of a movie.Smith is Hancock, the superhero with good intentions but bad PR skills and even poorer hygiene. He cannot resist helping anyone in need, but much to the annoyance of the residents of Los Angeles, he does more harm than good. His rescues end up costing the city millions of dollars in damages.One day Hancock rescues an altruistic but failed PR man Ray who offers to refine him and make him presentable as a superhero. This takes up the first 20 minutes or so of the movie and is actually pretty entertaining. The wheels start coming off when Hancock starts taking an interest in Ray's wife and the movie proceeds to explain this attraction.Since it is a blockbuster, the movie has the luxury of money and does a good job with the action sequences and special effects. But the true thrills in the movie are the scenes where Hancock is making efforts to be nicer and presentable.Smith, with his wholesome reputation, asks the audience to stretch their imagination in having to believe his crass attitude early in the movie. Fortunately, those scenes are few and brief and it is not long before he goes about smashing things.Smith cements his reputation as the most dependable action if not superstar in Hollywood right now. This movie will not have quite the shine as 'Independence Day' or 'I, Robot' and he displays much better acting skills in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' and 'I am Legend'. He was able to surprise us with his acting range.'Hancock' sadly doesn't even put up any acting challenge before him and that is another reason the movie is a wasted opportunity.'Hancock' never forgets that it is a summer blockbuster action movie, and in many ways it delivers in the way action movie fans would expect. They will not be disappointed. For those who can put up with a digressing plot line but not at the cost of some action and special effects, 'Hancock' delivers.",7,1,2,3 August 2008
