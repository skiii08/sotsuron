Catch Me If You Can," One of Spielberg's best
","Though 'Minority Report' seems to be generating the most talkthis year, it is this 'little' film from Spielberg that is the realhighlight of his recent body of work. Spielberg takes what would bea slight story in any other director's hands and turns it into butter: toparaphrase Walken in the film, Spielberg is the second mouse.Stealing the show is Walken as DiCaprio's IRS-plagued father.With his few scenes he displays a tremendous range, and bringsdepth to an underwritten character. But that takes nothing awayfrom the best performance of DiCaprio's career, as a teenageconman who can make anyone believe he's something he's not.Both performances, and the film, should be remembered comeOscar time.",10,1,1,26 December 2002
Unbreakable," Entertaining and cerebral
","Many will walk out of this film disgusted for one of two reasons:1. The film failed to be The Sixth Sense 2.2. The film was trying too hard to be The Sixth Sense 2.In fact, it is the audience that wants so bad to see The Sixth Sense 2 that many are not going to be able to appreciate this film for what it really is, or understand the comments it makes about our own fascination with and need for heroes. This is a much more cerebral film than its predecessor. It is slow-moving, deliberate, and cautious. This is very much a drama with strange, supernatural undertones. And those undertones are very subtle. While the previous film was a mind game with the audience, this is a mind game between the characters.The ending does have a twist, yes, but nowhere near the kind of twist The Sixth Sense had. It doesn't even try to duplicate that. It does change the way you look at the events you saw in the film, but not so much that you want to race back in and see it again to see if they pulled a fast one. It simply forces you try to make sense of the psychology of a certain character in the film.The one flaw to this film is the very end, where we are told the fates of two major characters. Perhaps, since the film deals with comic books, this was intended to be comic, but I don't think the filmmakers actually intended for the audience to laugh at this moment, which is what happened when I saw the film, with an audience that had, up to that point, been enjoying themselves.",10,0,0,24 November 2000
X-Men," A Solid Adaptation
","With the auspicious arrival of the new X-Men film, things are looking up for the comic book world in its increasingly unpropitious history at the movies. Joining Donner's Superman and Burton's Batman on the shortlist of truly fine comic book adaptations, X-Men looks to become the next major franchise. (Hopefully, it will fare better in the sequel department than the other aforementioned Warner Bros franchises.)Though Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan may have lead billing as far as the credits are concerned, this film really belongs to Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, as fan favorites Wolverine and Rogue, respectively. Though Stewart (Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellan (Xavier's old friend-turned-nemesis Magneto) form the intellectual core of the film, the emotional aspect, the connection to the audience, is conducted by Paquin's sense of alienation, her growing fondness for Wolverine, and his developing friendship for his new, young charge. Much praise will be heaped on Jackman for his portrayal of Wolverine, but kudos must also go to James Marsden (Cyclops) and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), for it is their by-play and chemistry that gives Jackman his best and most memorable moments. Had they not played so well off Jackman, Wolverine would not have come off so well as he does.How does the rest of the cast fare? Halle Berry (Storm) is the only X-Men to stand unconvincing in her role. Although it's not entirely her fault: she is simply given very little to do, and as a result fails to convince the audience of her capabilities. Marsden and Janssen are good in their roles, but more time should have been spent on showing us that they are in fact a couple. We are told that they are, but we never see it. Considering that much of the mood of the film and is derived from the triangle of Cyclops, Grey and Wolverine, it would have been nice to have been provided a glimpse into their private life.The only big failing is the score by Michael Kamen, which falls flat on its face. It's not merely inadequate; it's just plain bad. Had a good composer been brought in who could have developed motifs for the important characters, such as Rogue, Wolverine, Professor X and Magneto, things would have been considerably improved. Just a few notes would have been enough; somewhere between three- and seven-note combinations, to connect the audience sonically to the characters.Still, I highly recommend the film, and not just to fans of the comics. I think non-fans, people who've never even heard of the comic let alone picked up an issue, will enjoy it just as much. On a scale of 1-10, X-Men gets an 8.",9,0,0,14 July 2000
The Matrix Revolutions," A Brilliant Finale
","I cannot imagine the series ending any other way. The resolution,not only for the plot, but for each individual character, is completelyfitting. As the films repeatedly state, it's all about purpose.Everyone has a purpose. Morpheus's purpose was to find andtrain Neo. Trinity's was to love Neo, and to help him along his path(though she does, in Reloaded, get in his way; this sets him on yetanother path that she must help him to complete). Neo's purposewe all know. But even Smith has a purpose. And all complete theirpurpose exactly the way they were meant to from the beginning.Were any of these characters to have found themselves at differentplaces at the end of the film, it would not have worked.
I felt that the only solution was peace, not military victory, since Ifirst saw The Second Renaissance in The Animatrix. It occurred tome then that there was no way the humans could defeat themachines. Certainly not in one movie. If the entire human race wasdefeated in a true World War that saw the death and/orsubjugation of every living inhabitant, then the possibility of thissmall band of freedom fighters triumphing was nil. And then Irecalled the Councillor's dialogue from Reloaded: the machinesneed the humans just as the humans need the machines. Theonly solution was compromise. The two would have to find a wayto peacefully co-exist. Only then would the war be over. It was whatthe humans could not do in The Animatrix. The fear the humanshad for the machines drove them to war against them, and ledultimately to their own destruction and enslavement. It is only whenTrinity, Neo and Morpheus are able to put aside their fear and facethe machines as equals in Revolutions that peace is possible.
The movie wraps up the themes from the previous films brilliantly,at the same time telling an engaging story layered with excitingaction set pieces.",8,1,2,8 November 2003
28 Days Later...," Boring and derivative
","The worst thing I can say about this movie is that I went inexpecting a truly bad movie, and was disappointed: it was evenworse than I had thought it would be. This is unusual, as I amtypically pleasantly surprised by movies that I have lowexpectations for. This is the first time I went into a film with lowexpectations only to discover my expectations were not lowenough. The best thing I can say is that the performance of MeganBurns as Hannah is truly wonderful. But I cannot recommend abad film for one good performance.",7,6,12,30 June 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Better than the original
","Though it's become increasingly obvious that the Mission Impossible films have little to do with the television show they're derived from, that's not necessarily a bad thing.This film focuses less on action and more on the characters than the previous entry; or, for that matter, most action films of this day. Some will find this difficult to swallow, like a foreign food that the throat refuses to accept not because of a bad taste but because of the unfamiliar sensation it causes, which is too bad, because it actually makes for a great film, though not necessarily the one viewers will walk into the theater expecting to see.At center stage is the romance between Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), the latter a thief whom Hunt is assigned to acquire for his next assignment. Their by-play and chemistry forms the heart of the film, and the manner in which the rest of the plot plays out really depends on how these two characters care for and react to one another.For action fans, there are, of course, the great stunt and set pieces that one would expect, the majority coming at the end of the film. Those looking for a mind numbing experience with as little thought involvement as possible might wish to skip the first half of the film and go straight to the big finale. But for those who want a bit more from their action films, the film should amply satisfy. Recommended.",8,1,1,24 May 2000
The Mummy Returns," A worthy, enjoyable ride.
","I liked the new direction they took Evie, making her more like aCameron woman: tough. Very different from how she began in thefirst film, but it still works. I like strong women in film. I hate the'Help me, James,' you so often get in Bond movies. So seeingRachel come out as this tough broad willing to risk her neck andnot afraid to get down and dirty with the boys in order to save herfamily was very cool. Rick's a bit older, and more cautious. He's got a family now anddoesn't want anything to happen to them. His best moments arewhen Evie or his son, Alex, are in danger. Speaking of Alex, the kid (Freddie Boath, I think) who plays him isreally good. A fine addition to the cast. The rest of the returning cast is fine as well, especially Oded. Hegets beat up pretty good, but he's got some great scenes.Acting-wise, the film is strong. It's the effects that really mar the film. You can tell the movie wasrushed into theaters, unfortunately. They really should havepushed this back till November. The old Mummy effects andassorted returning tricks from the original look fine, but a greatmany of the new stuff looks bad. The hot air balloon, in particular,looks fake in almost every shot. And the final CG for the ScorpionKing, not too give too much away, is almost laughable. It reallylooks silly. I've heard complaints that Anubis's dog warriors lookedfake, but hey, they're dog warriors - how real did you expect them tolook? They're fine. They get the job done. There's also much less humor this time. The film is darker. Thegross factor has been pushed up a bit. What humor there isdepends a great deal on having seen the first film. What works, though, are the personal relationships of thecharacters. I really bought into Rick and Evie's relationship, andthat these people care for each other, and were willing to die forone another. There is a very interesting juxtaposition of theirrelationship and the one between Imhotep and Anck-Su-Anum,culminating in a final moment for all four. The way each reacts totheir corresponding counterpart in that one moment is the realresolution of the film, despite anything else that may occur after it.
As for the action, everything has been turned up a notch. While thefirst had a fairly long passage in the middle with only one shortaction sequence (on the boat), this film races from one actionsequence to another. It never really stops to take its breath. Somemay say this is a bad thing, but it never loses sight of the principalcharacters along the way, and the action is strong. The threat is also more real this time, culminating in the death ofone of the returning leads, rather than a side character like Benifrom the first film. It's a shock that works for its immediacy andpotency. Like its predecessor, the film is driven not by the men, but bywomen (and, in this case, children). It is Evie and Anck-Su-Anumwho propel the story forward, along with young Alex, and who forcethings to their eventual conclusion. Even The Mummy himselfalmost takes a back seat on the ride, as the O'Connells are forcedto deal with myriad bad guys. But he pops up every once in a whileto muss their hair and make up. To see an action film driven not bymen but by women is a rarity, and even more rare is one thatworks for a male audience. But this one does. All in all, the film is a fine sequel. I missed the humor of theoriginal, and the effects should have been given more time, but theaction is good, and the characterization is strong. This isn't just aremake of the original. They took the story in a new direction andturned things up a notch. The core of the film is the O'Connellfamily. If you buy into them and their relationship, and care for themas they care for one another, then you'll live with the occasionalawful CG and won't bemoan the lack of humor too much. If not,then it's going to be a very long film.",6,0,0,4 May 2001
The Green Mile," Good, but not great
","'The Green Mile' will doubtlessly be nominated for Best Picture. Which is unfortunate, as it doesn't deserve to be.Comparisons to 'The Shawshank Redemption' are inevitable, but, despite their similar origins, they are entirely separate entities, and deserve to be graded as such. However, 'The Green Mile' probably would have been better served by being a bit more like 'Shawshank'.Michael Clarke Duncan (in the role of John Coffey) and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb are the only fleshed out characters here. Doug Hutchison as a particularly nasty prison guard certainly stands out, but he is a caricature, which is the unfortunate truth of almost the entire supporting cast. Barry Pepper and Jeffrey DeMunn as fellow guards could have played each others' characters, and doubtlessly it would have gone unnoticed.The performances are not bad, by any means, but the performers themselves are given little to do. It isn't helped by the fact that every significant moment is announced to the audience by slow motion photography, swelling music, and sparks of light coming from the damndest places. Which is what the entire movie boils down to: manufactured emotions. People will certainly come away from this movie teary-eyed, with visions of Oscar dancing in their heads. But if you were to ask one of those people why they were weeping, they probably wouldn't be able to tell you. And not because it's indefinable. The movie simply does such a thorough and subtle job of pushing the right buttons that people don't realize they've been pushed.This is a good movie, and if you want a good cry, I certainly recommend it. But it's not one of the best films of the year, despite what others may tell you.",10,1,2,10 December 1999
WALL·E," Not just the best animated film of the year, but the best film of the year
","Minor spoilers ahead. Beware.Wall*e begins unlike any other Disney film I've ever seen. From the beginning the filmmakers are telling you this one is going to be different. From space we see the Earth. A song from 'Hello, Dolly!', of all things, makes its arrival. The happy-go-lucky tune about a better world out there somewhere is contrasted with the Earth the camera pulls in on: a world consumed by trash. The song drifts away like you're falling underwater and a slightly eerie cue from composer Thomas Newman, in one of his best works, takes over.We then begin to follow Wall*e thru his day-to-day ritual of compacting trash and building towers of the little boxes, some as high as skyscrapers. He's been alone for hundreds of years, and his only real company are a cockroach pet and a video of 'Hello, Dolly!' from which he learns about holding hands.Much has been said about 'propanga' in this film, to which I call foul. The story premise is that a lonely robot has been left behind on Earth. He's the only thing left. Everything else in the story comes out of that premise naturally. Why people were forced to flee Earth, what happened to them once they left, their dependence on machines and consumerism: it's all a natural product of the one basic story premise: What happens if humans leave Earth and one robot is left alone to clean it up? Anti-consumerism and environmental concerns, while present in the context of telling the story, are not a sermon to the audience. That's not even the message of the film.The real message of the film is connecting with others. Wall*e, the little robot time forgot, desperately wants someone, something to connect with. Meanwhile, the humans on the ship have become completely disconnected from one another. They've forgotten that the most important thing in the world is each other. It takes a little robot who's never had anyone to remind people of the importance of the person next to them.This isn't simply a great animated film, it's a great film. Period. It would be a shame if this got only Best Animated Film Oscar consideration, because it really does deserve nominations for Best Picture, Andrew Stanton for both Director and Writer (yes, I believe he should get a director nomination, which would be the first for an animated film), Sound and Sound Editing, Original Score and Original Song for Peter Gabriel's wonderful credits tune.It's difficult to put into words how extremely well made this film is. A good portion of the film is, essentially, a silent film, in that there is very little dialog. Most of the character depth is developed in looks, sounds, and minor voice inflections using the few words the robots possess. Walking out of the theater, I was reminded of Chaplin's powerful 'City Lights,' the beautiful love story of the blind girl and the homeless man who falls in love with her. Like Chaplin, Stanton and Pixar have managed to tell an engaging and powerful love story about two unlikely characters who happen to find each other, using few if any words. Wall*e so unabashedly loves Eve and is willing to go to any lengths to be with her, and you understand exactly what is going on in his head and in his heart at all times, even though he hardly speaks.As for kids, at first my thought was that it might not be the best for kids, that it might be aimed more at adults. But I must admit that at the end of the film, which I saw on a Saturday afternoon showing that was packed with kids, all that had been restless or talking to mom and dad early in the film were complete still like all the adults in the audience, staring at the screen, completely gripped in the final moments. In fact, more than 3/4 of the audience stayed through the credits. They simply didn't want the movie to end.",10,3,6,1 July 2008
Prometheus," Imperfect, but misunderstood ***Spoilers***
","I don't know how to properly review this movie without giving spoilers. It's like trying to describe the color yellow to a blind person. There will be spoilers in this review. Once more, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.From here read at your own risk: This film tries to deal (at times obliquely and at other times directly) with the creation of human life itself. It turns out we are the products of a science experiment gone wrong. Some unspecified time in the past, an Engineer, so they are called, popped by Earth and tried some special drug cocktail he'd made for himself. As we find results with other Engineer creations, it goes badly for him.. He dies, but not before leaving some of his DNA in our primordial soup for us to crawl from. Humanity develops, and the Engineers apparently find us worth hanging out with for a while, and even leave their contact info painted on cave walls, until about 2000 years ago, when they moved on to more interesting experiments. Aforesaid 2000 years later, a couple humans find the contact info and decide to pay a visit.Meanwhile, humanity itself have become Engineers. We, too, have developed new life in our own image, just as the Engineers did. David, played impeccably by Michael Fassbender, is the 'son he never had', as Peter Weyland, his creator says. Problem is, Weyland does have a child he doesn't consider worthy: a daughter, Meredith Vickers, played by Charlize Theron. This triptych of Weyland, David and Vickers really represents the core theme of the film: a creator trying to play God, and disavowing the life he's already created.Our intrepid crew arrives at LV-233. (It's worth noting that this is not the same planet from Alien and Aliens. That was LV-426. So if you're expecting this movie to directly set up Alien, it won't.) There they find a hologram of Engineers fleeing something unobserved. We find a room filled with canisters that turn out to be a bio-weapons cache. And like a child with a new chemistry set, crew members become exposed to various elements, each reacting differently, yet always violently. Like an accelerated natural selection.People begin to die. Nastily. Someone has an abortion. Nastily. Violent things happen to people we barely recognize. My main problem with the film is this aspect. There are 17 crew members on the ship. We get to really know 5. The rest are just cannon fodder. That and the final act requires some suspension of disbelief as far as how quickly people can recover from certain situations, like being knocked unconscious and having abortions. I felt like a good 20-30 minutes had been cut that could have made the film more complete.The tie-in with the Alien films really is just the question of the nature of the Engineers. Like Weyland with David, the Engineers had moved on from their offspring and were ready to concentrate on a new life form. And like Meredith looking to her father for approval, the humans look to the Engineers to tell them why. Why did they move on? There, of course, is no answer. How could there be? The Engineers don't care. In fact they want to return to Earth and wipe out humanity, which they meant to do 2000 years ago, except apparently someone turned off their alarm clock. What we learn about the Engineers is that they like to experiment with biology, with creating life. And interacting with that new life can cause rapid permutations. At some point in their past, this caught up with them. Or, at least, with the ones at this location. And, of course, the one that crashed on LV-426. Apparently it's a recurring problem for them.Thematically, Prometheus has more in common with 2001 than Alien. Imagine the Discovery had 15 crew members and the monolith turned 1/3 into monsters who tried to kill the rest until only one person was left.I did like the film. I enjoyed it, and hope the blu ray has an extended cut. I think the film needs it. But it's best not to go in expecting anything like Alien, because it's not.",8,1,5,8 June 2012
The Matrix," Derivative and unoriginal
","A lot of people are going to think this film is original, which is unfortunate, because it's not. It doesn't have anything new to say that hasn't been said going back to Fritz Lang's silent classic 'Metropolis'. It also takes itself way too seriously for a film that is really little more than eye candy and popcorn.Its effects have been done before but just on this scale, which the film should be commended for. However, the film feels like it was made with the story servicing the effects and not the effects servicing the film. It's like they had this idea for a really cool effect and figured out a story to write around it. That combined with the fact that it can't decide if you wants to be a pretentious drama or an action movie ultimately bogs the film down under its own weight.Recommended for people that like mindless action only; for people that think Lethal Weapon originated the buddy cop film and not The French Connection.",9,0,0,11 January 2000
Cloud Atlas," Destined to be a classic
","Most films exist purely for pleasure, to occupy your mind for a couple hours: take you to another world, let you forget about your problems, and you leave the theater $11 a seat poorer (not to mention what you spent on consumables), yet no richer for the experience. You paid for nothing more than a memory that, more often than not, is not particularly memorable.But every once in a while you do see something extraordinary. Something that makes you want to tell all your friends about the movie you just saw, and look askance at someone who says they didn't like it, as if to say, 'What movie did you just watch?' Or, perhaps, 'Oh, I'm sorry, were you expecting Transformers 4?' What Cloud Atlas does that is most impressive, to me, is that it asks us, as an audience, to expect more from our movies. Most of the movies we consider great have done this: Citizen Kane pioneered, among its almost innumerable technical advancements, non-linear storytelling; Psycho had the guts to kill off its main character 1/3 of the way into the movie, setting up similar shocks in future films like Alien and Scream.Perhaps Cloud Atlas's closest comparison, however, is 2001. Both were ravaged by some critics and fiercely embraced by others. Both asked questions about the universe and our existence in it without giving us answers, asking us only to ask questions of ourselves. Neither have neat endings that wrap everything up. Cloud Atlas will probably fair the same as 2001 commercially: that is to say, make little at the box office but have a long and rich life on video. (2001 ultimately played long in theaters, but in today's industry it's unlikely Cloud Atlas will have the opportunity to stick around as long.) This film is a singular experience. I can only speak about it in hyperbole, a language previously unknown to me. People will be watching this movie and discussing it for decades. People will become filmmakers because of this movie. It will be taught in film classes. I know I myself will see it at least twice more in the theater. And thirty years from now we'll look back at the list of films that were nominated for Best Picture for 2012, and we'll say, 'I can't even remember half these movies. Can you believe Cloud Atlas didn't win that year?'",10,13,25,27 October 2012
