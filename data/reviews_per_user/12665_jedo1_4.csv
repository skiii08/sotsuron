E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Just Too Manipulative
","I didn't like this film when I was ten, and twenty-one years later it's appeal is still lost on me.Substitute E.T. with a stray puppy and you've got a movie of the week, minus the lame glowing Christ finger. John Williams hammers home music cues, demanding nothing less than total elation at a flying bike.Guess I've got a heart of stone, but Close Encounters seems a much more honest and complex film about alien contact.",4,11,23,7 September 2003
The Fifth Element," Visionary. A colorful, fun fantasy.
","Those expecting hard sci-fi or deep character development should check their expectations at the door.  The Fifth Element is a product of childhood imagination, and it puts a spell on those willing to ditch logic and simply indulge in a little fantasy.  (Recommendation: See it widescreen and on DVD).",10,0,1,14 February 1999
Alien," The Best of the series
","Ridley Scott established himself as a master of atmosphere with this groundbreaking sci-fi film.  Space would never look the same with H.R. Giger's disturbing, sexually tinged visuals and Ron Cobb's grungey vision of commercialized space.  Treat yourself to the 20th anniversary edition DVD and see just how visionary this film was...and still is.",Null,0,1,3 June 1999
Event Horizon," Redefines Awful
","Isn't worth more than three sentences. Mediocre acting, derivative production design, shallow plot, and sloppy digital effects. Please skip over this one at Blockbuster and rent anything else...'Xanadu' would do.",1,8,17,25 October 2002
