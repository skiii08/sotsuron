The Rock," Great action/thriller movie
","As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies.I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all.The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either.It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.",9,2,2,6 May 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Way to dark and depressing for my taste.
","As a movie this is a very good movie. The scenery, the acting, the colors etc. are of a very high technical standard. To me personally however, this movie is much too dark and depressing for my taste.I cannot say that I am surprised that the movie is dark. The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.As I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.The acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.Unfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the quality of the film but a lot to do with my personal taste which of course is reflected in my ratings.",6,4,6,21 February 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Over-hyped mediocrity
","This is the third movie in the Hunger Games series. I better state right away that I have not read the books so I do not know how good the books are or if the movies actually follow the book. However, if the movies are any indicator then I will probably not bother to read the books. So far these movies have been a display in over-hyped mediocrity as far as I am concerned.The previous movies had a somewhat ludicrous setup with people running around in ridiculous hair-do and makeup. I was not too thrilled about it but at least it gave the movie some originality. So did the games themselves. This one lacks all of that. It could be any one of a dozen post-apocalyptic stories.The movie plods along at a fairly leisurely pace, sometimes it is quite dull and slow, with some outbursts of action. Katniss herself is really not taking much active part except for being a front figure and propaganda element for the rebellion. In order to milk the series as much as possible for money (I see no other reason why it was done) it was decided to break the third book into two movies. I would say that this movie is a good example as to why that is generally not a good idea.The acting is on par with the movie. It is decent enough but nothing to write home about. Then since most of the movie really is about Katniss hulking and moaning about the unfairness of it all it is maybe not too surprising that I found most of it somewhat uninspired and dull. The same can be said about the special effects. Actually I found most of them to be rather underwhelming. There were also a fair amount of lost moments. For instance the attack on the dam. It could have been made into something nice but instead we get a ludicrous display of a bunch of unarmed people running straight against machine guns planting some bombs and then poof goes a model dam.Having now seen three out of the planned four movies I am of course going to see the fourth one as well but I am definitely not going to be in a rush to go and see it.",5,5,6,22 March 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Decent action movie, still not my idea of a Mission Impossible movie.
","This instalment, the third movie, in the Mission Impossible series is better than Mission Impossible II although it has to be said that this is not that difficult as far as I am concerned. The movie is more balanced in pace and the stunts and action scenes are not so totally over the top and ludicrous as in the second half of Mission Impossible II. Having said that there are still lots of pretty outrageous action stunts. This movie also has a real bad-ass villain that would not have been out of place in a classical James Bond movie.The plot is as uninspired as one can expect from a Hollywood action movie. Hero crosses bad guys path and acquires something that the bad guy wants. Bad guy gets pi--ed off and grabs good guys wife to force him to get the stuff the bad guy wants. Big show-down at the end and bad guy bites the dust. Throw in a traitor in the mix just to mess things up at regular intervals. Nothing to write home about in other words.The entertainment value of this film, as of the two previous ones, comes entirely from the various, more or less contrived, stunts, tricks and action sequences in the movie. As one can assume from the movies budget the film delivers well in these areas.What I find annoying is that Ethan, again, finds himself alone and without support from the IMF team as well as having to deal with a traitor within. I find that kind of stuff tiresome to say the least. While I am in ranting mode I can also say that the silly idea of 'dying' and then getting kick-started again, especially given that the time between 'dying' and being kick-started again suffered from the usual lack of the concept of actual time elapsed so often being shown by Hollywood directors, was pretty silly.As I wrote, it is a decent enough action movie but I would really like to see a 'true' Mission Impossible movie where the team gets a mission and executes it with the full force of IMF behind them.",6,1,1,12 January 2016
The Equalizer," Very entertaining vigilante flick
","For me this vas a very entertaining vigilante flick. Denzel Washington is excellent in his role as a cold and calculating yet compassionate vigilante. The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.Although there is a red thread, started by McCall's first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.The main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.One thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.Sure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.On the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington's cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall.",8,0,4,7 February 2015
Skyfall," This is NOT a Bond movie!
","Me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of James Bond. Every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with Dr. No quite a few weekends ago. Last weekend we arrived at the Daniel Craig ones. I had actually not watched those ones before. I have to, grudgingly (I am a Sean Connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.However, today we watched Skyfall. What the f...? This is not a James Bond movie! If it had been just some other movie I would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. However, it pretends to be a James Bond movie and as such it is utter crap. It is a bloody Hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the Franchise, not to mention the old Bond fans.James Bond should be out hunting international villains. Villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma I might add. What we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because M didn't come to his rescue when he fucked up.The British Secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting Britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like Spectre or whatever. Having scenes with M more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a James Bond movie.The whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody Hollywood soap opera. And what about the new Q? A boring brat with a over-inflated ego. Not fun at all.Even the special effects are debatable. For example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it's path then for Christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!This is undoubtedly the worst Bond movie ever. My disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated.",1,3,7,19 March 2018
Iron Man 3," Not what I hoped for
","I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by this third instalment of the Iron Man series of movies. Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.However, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails it just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.What is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark's cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time.The end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.",5,3,6,30 August 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Anti BP propaganda but watchable.
","As expected this is a bit of a propaganda movie against BP but that was of course rather expected. It is still watchable. The dramatization is fairly well done and the effects are believable as well as enjoyable. If you watch it as a disaster drama and special effects movie it is definitely okay.As a documentary, well I would say that it falls short. The movie only covers the initial explosion. Once the platform is evacuated the movie stops. I am somewhat disappointed at that. I would at least have liked to see the attempts to put out the fire. Where are the scenes with the boats trying to douse the rig with water for instance? I would also have liked the film to cover the attempts to close the well, the technical challenges involved and the fight against the oil spill. This is not at all covered.I feel that the film attempts to ride on public opinion, pretend to be a action/disaster movie as well as a fact telling one and cash in on the accident. The action/disaster parts were well done but the movie left out a lot of the, perhaps less spectacular, drama around the accident. It is a shame because now it became a rather ordinary movie as well as giving a distasteful feeling they were just trying to make some quick bucks on the disaster.That also made the factual parts somewhat in doubt. I feel the movie is making a strong effort to portray BP as willful criminals. I am sure there is plenty of blame that should fly BP's way but at the same time one can read that 'On November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig.'. As always, things are not black and white and oil drilling is risky business after all.Anyway, enough ramblings, I found the movie okay, nothing more and nothing less.",6,3,5,2 March 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Bizarre story, enjoyable movie
","I was somewhat prepared to be disappointed by this movie due to its rather bizarre title and story but to my enjoyment I wasn't. I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie.The story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn't discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It's more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn't it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre.The film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There's enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. The axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we're used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it's a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things.There's a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That's scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There's also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all. How that managed to slip through is somewhat unbelievable.",7,1,2,12 January 2013
John Wick," Excellent, straightforward action movie without any unnecessary social and emotional nonsense.
","This is very much my kind of movie. Straightforward, lots of good action, our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense. Those who have watched the movie might wonder why I claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by John Wick's very emotional response to his wife's death and the subsequent killing of the dog that he received as a last present from her. What I mean with 'no emotional nonsense' is that John Wick is never second guessing himself, the movie never really tries to portray him as an 'ordinary' guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesn't go into some silly 'oh should I really pull the trigger' trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies. Sure, there are emotions in this movie. Rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guyseventually that is.The plot of the movie is, as I wrote, quite straightforward and classical. Retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy. Hit man gets pi--ed off and goes on a quest for revenge. People die (a lot of them). Hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end. In terms of story that is about it. However, such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way. As far as I am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very, very entertaining.Keanu Reeves is quite good as the hit man. So are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance. During the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into John Wick's former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated. The secret world that John Wick was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good old-fashioned James Bond movie.Then of course there is the action. It is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint. There are lots of action and it is good action. Sure, the ease by which John Wick picks off his opponents waiving his gun(s) in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it  so cool. The gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven together.One thing that I really like with this movie is that John Wick is the cool, cold, determined, not to be pi--ed off, killing machine from start to finish. There are really no slow parts or 'obligatory' scenes of doubt and self-recrimination. It is 'the bad guys will pay' all the way. This of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that I quite like in a story like this. For instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good, honest to God, fear. Fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pi--ed off.Needless to say, I enjoyed this movie a lot when I sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday.",9,2,5,24 June 2015
Gravity," Visually nice movie with mediocre story
","There is no doubt that this is a very pleasing movie from a purely visual point of view. This is probably a movie that would benefit from being watched in a good theater with its grandiose scenery.However, I have to say that I found the rest of the movie somewhat mediocre. The part that I felt dragged down the movie the most is that Dr. Ryan is behaving rather clumsily and amateurish first being real slow in obeying the order to evacuate and then floating around huffing and puffing, talking a lot when she should really conserve oxygen. Did they not give her the basic course before letting her up in space? I also found it soooo Hollywood that she was able to get onto the Chinese space station and seconds later it starts to descend into the atmosphere. In general I felt that the script writer was not really very technically knowledgeable.Overlooking these, unfortunately all too often occurring issues, the movie is fairly okay as a whole. Obviously I cannot agree with the glowing all-star ratings that some people have been giving it but it is far from the single star trashing that other people have been giving it. Technically it was very good with nice special effects. Bullock performed as well as can be expected with the script she was given. Clooney felt a bit out-of-place as a skilled astronaut to me but then he was not really in the movie that much.To me it was a fairly enjoyable popcorn movie.",6,0,2,2 March 2014
Fury," I cannot say that I liked this movie very much.
","I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.I can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.The movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the 'heroes' are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where 'Wardaddy' forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I'll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.Having said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.The pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.The 'last stand' at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our 'heroes' have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.The ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.",4,10,22,29 March 2015
The Maze Runner," Quite enjoyable 'young adult' movie.
","One thing that I liked about this movie from the start was that it was, in my limited experience at least, somewhat original. Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a 'young adult' movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.In my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.I did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way? Sometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.Bottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.",7,0,0,22 February 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One of the best of the new Star Wars movies
","Oups! I just realized that, for some reason, this movie had fallen between the cracks. It was quite some time since I watched it but I seem to have forgotten to write a post about it.For me this was one of the best of the new (after the original trilogy) Star Wars movies. It was fun, entertaining with plenty of good, old-fashioned Star Wars action. I generally do not like prequels but this time I felt it was nice to get a bit of the background to the statement that 'a number of spies died to get this information' in episode IV. We were even provided with a bit of an explanation as to why the Death Star had this silly weakness in the first place.The actors were doing a decent enough job of it. The chatty android was fun without being totally silly. It was a nice roller coaster ride of action, improvisations, and gung ho ludicrous stunts inside and outside of various forms of transportation means.As usual with Star Wars the science part of science fiction is somewhat lacking. What looks cool is what is put on the screen and screw science. When reading books I am more sensitive to such things but for a Star Wars movie it works well enough.Some people seem to be dissecting the characters and dialogue, trying to put logic into it as well as wanting to have more emotions and 'character development'. Come on! It is a Star Wars movie. It is supposed to be all action and visually stunning.On that this movie delivers. Sure the plot is not really the most developed one and has plenty of faults. The movie is till a hugely fun Star Wars based science romp though.",Null,0,2,30 May 2017
World War Z," Fairly okay two hours of entertainment
","As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.This is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that 'explanation' much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn't want to get involved. What the f? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.Anyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well.",7,2,4,31 December 2013
The Hunger Games," Okayish but really, why the hype?
","I had not really bothered to put this movie on my to-watch shelf since I felt it was not really my cup of tea but when my wife and oldest son wondered why we did not have it in our collection I thought, well, okay let us get it then. Actually I got the set with the two movies that have been released and yesterday we watched the first one.Well, as far as I am concerned, it is not a turkey, it is rather 'okayish' but I certainly do not understand all the hype. It is really far from a great movie. But then, I am probably somewhat biased since, as I wrote above, I did not really think this movie was my cup of tea. Anyway, it starts of with a lot of scenes in 'wobblycam'. I have not met any person outside of the movie industry and self-proclaimed so-called 'critics' that actually likes it when the camera wobbles around, scenes are blurred and you generally get nauseous by watching. Bad start! The backbone of the story is ludicrous to say the least. Part of the world leaves in luxury when the rest is starving. Been there, seen that. Every year a seemingly random selection of kids, not adults but kids, are selected to fight to the death under some silly pretext of 'preserving the peace'. As I said, ludicrous. The entire air of ludicrousness is enforced by the wacky costumes, makeup and hair styles of the people in the capitol. As I science fiction and fantasy fan I could easily live with this but, sadly, the movie made me only mildly interested in following the characters to the end.The acting in general is adequate but nothing special. Having said that it must be difficult to actually make anything out of some of the silly roles in this movie. I for sure would laugh my head off every time I entered a scene with all of those ludicrous (yes I know I have used that word a lot in this review, live with it) costumes. The main characters act like the children, with absolutely no clue what they are doing, that they indeed are. This is of course entirely in line with the story but still, the main character is spending a lot of the time running away and sitting around looking startled, sorry or depressed when the games start. I have to say that, at times, the movie felt a bit boring. I have liked several movies that are very slow but here it simply did not sit right.The games themselves with those dickheads in control and the changing rules, well they were mostly frustrating.This movie, to me, is a movie for a young adult audience. I have not read the books and I can see how this kind of story would work for a YA book. Personally I was not unhappy having seen the movie and now, having watched the first of the movies I will watch the rest as well but for me it was okay as a two-hour diversion, nothing more.",5,1,4,25 August 2014
Zootopia," Really good animated family movie
","This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",9,7,11,27 February 2017
Argo," Not my favorite genre but a good movie
","This is a good movie although the context of the movie is a rather sad one. It is definitely not my favorite genre but my wife wanted to watch it and it had received generally favorable ratings so I added it to my collection.The historical accuracy of this movie has been questioned. I honestly do not remember any details of the events of this sad episode in Middle East history so I cannot really judge this. As far as I know the general plot is consistent with reality and in this movie it is good enough for me. I fear that, if they would have made it 100% historically accurate, the movie would have turned into a rather boring documentary instead of a fairly enjoyable drama movie.Surprisingly enough the movie was quite funny at times. The dialogue between the movie-people when they were setting up the fake movie was sometimes quite hilarious. Some parts of the movie was rather tragic of course, like the Iranian mob taking over the embassy and the crazed idiots at the bazar.Other parts where a bit silly. Why did the Iranian security have to break down their own doors at the airport instead of just calling the tower and stop the plane for instance? And the cars chasing the plane was just rubbish. The plane would have gone much faster than the cars could go long before they caught up with the plane. Also the fact that the cars basically had to panic-break in order not to hit the barrier at the end of the runway meant the plane almost ran into the barrier which, given that it made a normal take-off, is just nonsense.In general it is a good movie although it is not really my type of movie and the movie's context, the take-over by the Iranian extremists, is a rather sad one.",7,0,0,11 January 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Better than I feared, actually quite good
","I have to say that this movie was better than I feared it would be and that it was actually quite good. With the first movie I was not overly thrilled with the concept of the reboot and the alternate timeline. I still am not too thrilled about that even though I can understand the motivation for doing it since it certainly gives more creative freedom.One thing that sets this movie apart from the movies in the original timeline is that it is much more of an action movie. Many of the movies in the original timeline was downright slow. The little fighting they contained was over in a matter of minutes and they often went to extreme lengths to talk themselves out of everything. This one is much more of a roller-coaster ride and Captain Kirk is much more gung-ho and impulsive. To me this is a very positive thing and the main point that makes this movie a good one.There are of course other things making this movie worthwhile to watch. The special effects are quite enjoyable. Especially combined with the fast pace and plentiful action. I think Chris Pine as well as the other actors where performing quite well in their respective roles. I quite liked Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan although I have to say that I did not like the Khan element itself. It just felt cheap to try and ride on one of the most popular of the original movies. They could easily have made the plot, or at least a quite similar one, work without the bad guy being Khan.Another thing that disturbed me was that they just had to wreck the Enterpriseagain. Not only that but it really became ridiculous how much they could wreck on that ship and she would still hold together. In some of the original movies it went overboard in the other direction. One shot and weapons, shields, warp drive and everything else useful would go off-line. In this one they make Swiss cheese of her and she still flies. While we are at it, the scene where Kirk realigns the warp core by kicking at it is fairly ridiculous as well.In general I think this is an enjoyable movie. Maybe not 10 out of 10 but definitely high up on the scale. I hope they continue to make Star Trek movies with this amount of action in them. Certain reviews that I have read states that this movie is dumbing down Star Trek or 'Star Trek for morons'. I must say that I disagree totally. It is not any dumber than many of the previous movies and it has a fast pace and level of action that many of the others lacked.",8,1,2,18 October 2013
Hot Fuzz," Quite funny, even hilarious, British comedy
","I was not sure what to expect from this movie that I found on Netflix a while ago while browsing through the catalog. The movie poster makes it look like a hard-boiled police action movie but reading the reviews it became clear that it was more of a comedy. I had not heard of the movie before but it generally got good reviews so the other evening me and the boys sat down to watch it.This is a fun movie. A good, old-fashioned British comedy. The core story could very well have been a serious crime story but the way it is implemented makes it so incredibly silly in a fun way. It starts off pretty much right away when PC Angel is told that he will be promoted but moved, because he makes the rest if the bunch of the dimwits at the precinct look bad, to a small British town where the most fun you can have is to watch the grass grow or get drunk and from there it goes downhill for Angel.His new colleagues are somewhat weird not to mention more or less useless when it comes to police work. The by-the-book Angel is getting more and more frustrated and his only friend is the son of his new boss, whom he arrested on the first day by the way. When the grizzly 'accidents' starts to happen the movie, in particular the explanations as to why they are 'accidents' and not crimes, become more and more absurd. The special effects guys seems to have learned a trick or two from the Monty Python gang when it comes to over the top gory blood splattered scenes by the way.In the final showdown between Angel and the totally wacko gang that keeps the town 'clean' by deadly serious methods is short references to great many action movies. The amount of shots fired and the ratio of misses versus actual hits is nothing short of ludicrous. It was just so absurdly funny that it is difficult to describe.If you are in the mood for some good solid British comedy then I can recommend this one. It is a very well done comedy and a lot more enjoyable than the get drunk and/or fall on your arse and/or and puke all over the place 'comedies' that comes thirteen to the dozen today.",8,0,0,11 November 2014
Deadpool 2," Marvel meets Kill Bill
","I have to say that I quite enjoyed this movie. Was there a lot of juvenile jokes? Oh yes. Was the characters sometimes over the top and silly? Yes again. Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.Despite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a'la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)Everything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.The action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.I definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she's hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?Most of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.The team of fellow mutant 'warriors' that Deadpool pulled together? Well let's say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat 'expendable' but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought 'What the f...?' and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.To sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually.",9,1,2,21 October 2018
Sleepy Hollow," A decent enough evening flick
","et us get this over with right away. I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton's work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.Unfortunately Ichabod's inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999.",6,1,1,27 May 2014
Ready Player One," I really liked this movie.
","I did not know what I would really think about it when I started to watch this movie. I hoped that I would like it but I was not sure what I would actually get. I used to like Steven Spielberg a lot but later in his career he's done movies that either was not my kind of movies or that I was simply not that impressed by. However, as it turned out, this one I liked a lot as you can see from my rating.As a computer nerd and science fiction geek this movie was of course right up my alley. I have thought other movies would be my kind of movies before but been sorely disappointed by ignorant and incompetent screen writers and directors trying to cash in on subjects that they knew absolutely nothing about. Spielberg did a good job of not screwing this one up.The core of this movie is of course plenty of action and computer generated special effects with a somewhat apocalyptic story to bind everything together. The story works but it is not really anything special and some of the stuff, like the loyalty centers, was frankly a bit silly. But, as I wrote, it works and does not get in the way so that's good enough for me.As the previously mentioned nerd and geek I absolutely loved the abundant references to science fiction, fantasy and gaming history and lore. For me those were soo cool. I will probably watch the movie again just to focus on the background and see how much stuff I can spot. Stuff that I missed when watching the movie the first time.The CGI effects and the action was also pretty awesome. The movie starts off right away with a great and absolutely insanely wild car race and continues to go strong from there. The battle at Doom castle at the end is just epic.The only thing that made me go WTF was at the end (SPOILER AHEAD) were Mr A$$wipe Sorrento finally catches up with the High Five's van and then he just freezes and looks at Wade with a silly look on his face. What the f... was that? Just stupid for no good reason.Well, few are the movies where there's nothing to gripe about. On the whole though this movie was great in my book. Also, I cannot say how pleased I am to finally watch a Hollywood movie that is not a remake or a sequel or a prequel or some other lame excuse to rehash a movie that has already been made.",10,0,3,23 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider Man for kids, not my cup of tea.
","I guess I should not be too surprised given the Spider Man character we saw in the latest Captain America but I have to say that I was, well, hoping for something else, as in something better.If the producer/writer intended to make a Spider Man movie for kids, and I mean kids, not young adults but kids, then this movie is hitting the spot. It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.The movie is childish. There is no other way to describe it. My memory of spider man is a quite serious young man with a sharp and witty tongue. Not the fumbling and childish Spider Man in this movie. His best friend may be a good computer geek but otherwise he is dumb as a door nail and just tiring to watch. His, supposedly adult handler is a screw up who, surprise surprise, is hanging up the phone because he cannot be bothered to listen to kids.The FX may be good as FX goes visually but it was also the typical, nonsensical Hollywood rubbish like boats that stays afloat forever despite being split in half etc. etc. The talking Spider Man suit appears to be programmed by the same guy who wrote the childish script.The main bad guy pretty much has zero charisma and is nothing but a simple thief. Same goes for his buddies.The SJW crap spread out here and there in the movie, especially in the Washington Monument scenes, was unwanted and just pissed me off.I am afraid that this movie missed its mark for me by a wide margin. I do not understand why it seems to be so bloody difficult for Hollywood to make a good Spider Man movie. I like Spider Man, the comics character that is, so I find the slew of substandard movies really disappointing.The only reason it doesn't get less than two out of three stars from me is because, as a kids movie, it is not at all bad (except for the SJW crap). It wasn't what I was looking for though.",3,2,3,26 December 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Good movie dragged down by Hollywood stupidity
","This is a good movie. It is pretty much what you would expect from a Fast & Furious movie. It could have been a great movie but it is unfortunately dragged down by some of the not too unusual Hollywood stupidity and arrogance towards the viewers.Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are perfect in their roles as old-fashioned, hard-hitting, fast-driving macho guys. Michel Rodriquez is doing a decent enough job as well but then I do like Michel Rodriquez so These guys are making a lot of the movie for me. The rest is not bad but more like filling out some empty space compared to Vin and Dwayne.This is of course a movie about fast driving, action and special effects. In those areas it does not disappoint. There are lots of fast driving and lots of action and special effects. Not all of it is entirely realistic of course. This is rather expected and I can live with it as long as it doesn't go to far into the realm of ludicrously unrealistic which it, sadly, did towards the end. Although the effects and fights themselves were quite cool the entire flight escape scene was just ludicrous. They were driving at take-off speed, both on the ground and in the air, for how long? 20 minutes? That must have been the worlds longest runway. This is what I call Hollywood arrogance towards the viewers. Do they really think the viewers are so stupid that they will just buy this? Or is it that they themselves are so utterly stupid that they do not realize how utterly wrong the entire thing is? For me this really dragged down an otherwise great movie.Otherwise the movie is a nice blend between macho talk, action, lots of fast driving, some humor, some more action, some more fast driving and lots of chars getting smashed. In short all the things that make up a good fun action movie. The story itself? Well, as far as I am concerned, fairly standard issue which held the action together reasonably although the basic idea and technical aspects, especially this 'EMP chip', where not very believable.On the whole, it was a good and enjoyable movie which good have been great if it were not dragged down by Hollywood stupidity.",7,1,3,4 April 2014
Underworld Awakening," A bit disappointed
","It's an okay movie but I do feel a bit disappointed nonetheless. The first two movies in the series where great ones. There's a three year wait between each of them, including this one, so you would hope that some effort would have gone into writing them.Unfortunately this is not so for this installment in the series. It's a fairly generic run-off-the-mill Hollywood action/horror stunt. The plot could have been written for a TV-movie. It's unimaginative and predictable standard fare. The bit where the ancient vampire and his coven are hiding in a cave, afraid to take a fight is just sad. Gone are the days of proud vampires.The film is really saved by its legacy, the fact that the effects are not too bad and that Kate Beckinsale is still starring in the lead role.",6,2,3,1 July 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Great superhero entertainment
","This is indeed a great piece of superhero entertainment. If superheroes and action, plenty of action, is within your sphere of interest then this movie truly delivers. There is even a story to support the stunts and special effects fireworks that is not too shabby. As a matter of fact, for being a Marvel-based movie, the story is more than acceptable.As the blurb states, our hero is meeting a few adaptation issues after having been awaken into the modern world. Luckily the movie do not fall into the trap of making some silly comedy out of it but keeps these parts at a reasonable level where it stays funny without ruining the movie or disrupting the pace of the real story.The story? Simple and not very original with the usual slew of traitors strewn about, you cannot trust anyone, our hero becomes a fugitive etc etc bla bla bla. It is however a pretty straightforward one which works quite well and is not getting bogged down in silly emotions and general idiotic behavior by our hero like for instance several instalments of Spider Man have done. Actually this is one thing that I really like with this movie. The hero is a true hero from start to finish without any of that modern Hollywood crap where the hero must be tarnished in one way or another to satisfy the directors and producers.As I wrote above if you like superhero action movies then there is little not to like with this one. Acceptable story, plenty of action, good special effects, a cool chick (hey I am but an ordinary male, I like female actors in tight costumes) and a clear hero. None of the actors are really doing a bad job of it and in general the acting is as good as one can expect when portraying characters that, after all, are be totally ludicrous in real life. Its 8 out of 10 rating at IMDb (at the time of writing this) is well deserved. I am astonished that some people seem to have voted it down with a one star rating. It is a Marvel-based movie. You might feel it is more or less good but the style of the movie should not really be a major surprise to anyone and there is no way in hell that it deserves a one star rating unless someone really watched the wrong movie by accident.",9,0,3,20 August 2014
Life of Pi," Beautiful to watch but hugely overrated as a movie
","I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended. We bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie.",4,2,4,17 May 2013
Doctor Strange," Excellent magical fireworks display
","It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.I have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.Doctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than 'a bit'. He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.The time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk's bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange's continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.What is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.Slowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.As the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.I am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.There were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.I rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.So, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.",10,3,5,12 April 2017
Interstellar," I cannot believe the ridiculously hight ratings Interstellar has received
","That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.The movie starts of with the usual 'I told you so' wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a 'save the human race' mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense! The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design? The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",4,5,11,5 April 2015
Pacific Rim," Great special effects movie with a totally ridiculous story
","I have to say that I enjoyed this pure special effects movie quite a lot even though the plot is totally ridiculous. Clumsy giant robots beating at alien beasts with their fists should be better than modern tanks and airplanes with modern explosive and armor penetrating weapons? As I said, a ridiculous story. Well it does not really matter does it because the story gives an excuse for some real cool special effects loaded action. Giant robots and alien Godzillas in the same movie. Cool, simply cool.Once you have gotten past the silliness of the story it is a very entertaining roller-coaster ride of action. The scenes where the robots and aliens go head to head is visually very entertaining. Sometimes they make you laugh as well. For instance the scene where Gypsy Danger (the robot) drags a cargo ship after it to use as a club.Unfortunately a somewhat somber mood is set right from the start by the fact that the Jaeger program is discontinued. Not because they are really defenseless as the movie blurb states but because dumbass politicians wants to save money as usual.As much as the robot and alien action is tremendously enjoyable I think some of my favorite scenes are the ones with Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau. I have always liked Ron Perlman and he is simply outrageously (as in funny) wacky as Hannibal Chau.The one thing I did not like with the movie is the ludicrous nonsense statements about the dinosaurs being the first attempt at an invasion. Whoever wrote that must be an idiot. Worse, the fact that it made it into the movie means that someone believes that the audience are idiots. When it then was followed by some green-religious crap that the atmosphere was not right but that we have now 'terraformed' earth for them by our pollution it was at least a star off just for that. I hate it when they put crap like that in the movies. It is an insult to the audience.Anyway, despite the dinosaur nonsense I found it a very enjoyable movie. Without that it would have received a near top rating but as I said, it is at least a star off due to that crap.",7,3,4,22 November 2013
Ant-Man," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.Having said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit 'what the f' when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.However, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.As I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children's room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.I really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.Bottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion.",8,13,24,9 December 2015
Oblivion," Okay movie, beautiful special effects
","In general post-apocalyptic movies are not my favourite genre. I did enjoy this movie though. The story is okay. There are some annoying holes, like why such and advanced entity needed humans the way it did in the first place, but I have seen a lot worse and it was well implemented overall.The best part of this movie is the special effects though. A lot of the scenery is really beautiful although at times somewhat depressing. The design of the hardware is simply cool. The fact that there is plenty of action is of course also adding to the enjoyment factor of the movie.If you scrutinize each element of the movie individually I guess you can say 'been there, seen that, done that' quite a few times. I do not think that would be fair though. With the amount of movies made since the dawn of movie making you can always find something that looks similar today. If you look at the movie as a whole I think it felt fresh enough and it did not in any way feel like a rip-off.Sometimes the movie went into slow mode / dream mode but I was never really bored. The balance between action and slower bits where okay as far as I am concerned.Bottom line: A quite enjoyable movie.",7,2,3,7 September 2013
Justice League," Great, straightforward Super Hero movie.
","This was my type of Super Hero movie. Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral stuff (mostly). There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.The movie was criticized for its 'overuse of CGI'. Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a lot of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.I am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.I liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman's 'truth lasso' was quite hilarious actually.The SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf's lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.
Steppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked...not so great, especially when talking.There are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.Anyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it.",9,1,1,2 April 2018
Man of Steel," Some cool action but Superman it is not
","I guess I am being stubbornly traditional here but this was not really the Superman that I grow up with. I am sure that a lot of people are not going to agree with me on this one but personally I was not overly thrilled with this movie.Sure, if what you wanted was a wild action ride and unchecked destruction then this movie will most likely satisfy you. However, as a 'Superman' movie it just did not feel right to me.The original story is tweaked and tinkered with too much. The Kryptonians, not only General Zod and his minions, are portrayed in a quite negative light. Superman himself project a hugely negative aura. Lois Lane gets to meet Superman and learn who he really is before he even starts to work for The Daily Planet. And so on and so forth The first part of the movie with the back-flashes, with Kal-El just trying to hide, getting bullied etc. is just sad and even boring. It is not until General Zod arrives that things starts to get going. However even then they continue to tinker with things. Apparently it is now enough to breathe Krypton-like air for him to lose his powers. This is just so wrong. Actually, the entire bla bla when they try to 'explain' his powers is just dumb. There is an established story behind Superman. Even though it is fantastic and unscientific just stick to it. It is a fantasy comic character after all. Leave it at that. The story itself is not bad but it is not Superman.Having said all that, when the fighting starts, the special effects and the action definitely have a high 'coolness factor'. Superman and General Zod wrecks more havoc than half a dozen Godzillas with a bad case of hangover. Actually the level of mayhem is bordering on the ridiculous but it was fun to watch. Unfortunately I have to admit that this was my enjoyment of this movie, to watch the special effects.",6,0,2,24 October 2013
Divergent," Fairly mediocre movie for the younger audience
","I should probably mention right away that I have not read the book-trilogy that this movie is based on. Given the content matter I might actually have liked the books. The movie? Well to me the movie was a rather mediocre one. As the blurb states the story is set in a dystopian future but we do not really get to know how they got there except the standard explanation that 'there was a war'. The world is a bizarre mixture of primitive post-apocalypse living and modern, futuristic tech. The division of people into factionswell to me it felt pretty dumb to begin with and the idea that some people could not possibly fit into more than one faction was absolutely ludicrous to me. How the hell was it supposed to keep peace by deliberately factioning people against each other? Okay, trying to get over these gripes, what about the rest of the movie. Well it was okayish I guess. It did give me the same feeling as when reading a young-adult book and I would say that this movie is most suitable for a younger audience. The story is rather predictable. There is the initial training part where Tris of course gets a few friends and in particular befriends one of her tutors. Not surprisingly there is also the obligatory jerk. The one thing that makes the movie a bit out of the ordinary are the induced dream sequences which are not too bad.Later in the movie Tris starts to discover the plot of the bad guys and of course goes off to save the day. Again these part are simple and predictable. The ease by which Tris and a few of her friends manages to infiltrate the lab/headquarters of the baddies is rather unbelievable. It of course helps that it seems like it is only the good guys who can shoot straight or fight worth a damned with a few occasional exceptions when the script calls for it.The movie is, as far as I understand it, based only on the first book in the trilogy so it is perhaps not very surprising that it ends with a lot of loose ends but, for Christ sake, they fight their way to stop the plot, taking down a lot of people on their way, and then they leave the chief mastermind of this despicable plot lying unconscious but alive on the floor just taking off. That just felt dumb! It is not a bad bad movie but I do not understand the high ratings some people seem to give it.",5,0,1,16 August 2014
Ender's Game," A bit disappointed actually
","First I have to mention that I have not read the book. It has been on my maybe-to-read list for quite a while but I have never gotten around to read it. Thus I cannot say how well the movie interprets the book but if the book is close to this movie I do not think I will bother reading the book.The entire concept, kids being trained to do the job of experiences commanders, is of course a wee bit ludicrous from the start but the way the movie was implemented did not really help. This should be the school of kids that was picked because they were geniuses but the only one that displayed any intellect to speak about was Ender himself. Worse, the school was filled with bullies that really had no clue and which were not only screwing themselves due to their overinflated egos but was prepared to screw humanity by beating up on Ender when they themselves lost. That utter dickhead, Commander Bonzo, just made me want to wring his filthy little neck from the first scene when he made his appearance.There were some cool scenery in the movie. That has to be said. The weightless combat was not too bad and the battle footage, both the 'archive' footage and the battle scenes at the end were quite cool.Speaking of the end. What the f? These aliens had apparently come to Earth with the intent of conquering us. Wiping us out for all intents and purposes. I did not really see anything in the movie that said otherwise. However, once it is clear that we (Ender) repaid the favor a bit more successfully it is all boohoo, sob sob. Not only that but he runs outside, finds an egg and goes on some pilgrimage to repopulate a world with Formics. That was just ridiculous.This movie was not what I hoped it would be. I was hoping for some real training at the battle school instead of this nonsensical game then followed by some heroics and suspense with the humans fighting off the big bad aliens. I fail to see what floating around weightlessly taking potshots at each other have to do with commanding carriers, battleships and fighter squadrons? Combine that with a silly ending that tries to make us fighting back be a fault and what could have been a good movie just turned into a disappointment as far as I am concerned.",5,1,2,7 March 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Excellent action and special effects movie
","This is a movie which you watch for the action and the special effects and pretty much nothing else. As such it is a excellent movie. The original story of Hansel & Gretel is essentially only used to boot this movie. The movie itself plays out when Hansel & Gretel are adult witch hunters.The movie is pretty much action all the way. It is fairly violent and goory action at that. It is not a movie for the kids. To me this is an advantage. I do not think I would have liked it as much if they had dumbed it down to a standard PG-rated Hollywood creation. I really enjoyed the hard-ass Hansel & Gretel duo kicking witch ass in so many way.The special effects are not bad and the medieval yet kind of modern weaponry that Hansel & Gretel swings around are quite cool looking. Not very believable perhaps but then neither are witches so The witches themselves are also fairly cool. Especially the witch-gathering near the end of the movie is indeed a grim (ha ha) collection of freaky creatures.I was not too thrilled about the idiot law keeper. His utter stupidity bugged me throughout the entire movie. I really wished they would have dragged out the end for him a bit more. Well he did meet a suitable end at least.Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you though this was to be 'just' a Hansel & Gretel movie the you are probably going to be disappointed. I knew more or less what I went for so I was just enjoying myself. I was surprised at the level of gore, exploding heads, troll-squished humans etc but, as I said above, I think it was a good thing that they did let it be done in the way the producer/director obviously intended for it to be made.",8,0,1,10 July 2013
Dunkirk," Quite a disappointment.
","I have put off viewing this film for quite a while. The main reason for this is that I am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. However a few days ago I finally did and, given all the hype, I have to say that I expected more, a lot more.Sure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. Acting, camera and all that is excellent. Unfortunately that is all there is.First of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? Dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. We get to see what? A few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two Fock Wulfes. To add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. This is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible.There are a few likable people in the movie. Like the Navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. The rest are either psychotic or morons.Realism? Not so much. Like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. Would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel?Then we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. Other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds.I would also have expected some pre-story. Some build up. But no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go.Quite a disappointment indeed.",4,4,5,1 January 2019
Captain America: Civil War," I did not like it at all
","Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.I want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only 'incriminating' the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.When I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.The few redeeming qualities of this movie is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.Technically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.",4,2,5,4 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Long-winded title, excellent movie.
","Personally I found this movie to be 2+ hours of excellent entertainment. This is one of these movies where I simply cannot understand how people can give one and two star ratings stating that it is garbage etc. I do not get what these people expected? Maybe they just have to complain? The original Harry Potter books are very much books for children or young adults and so is this movie. It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.The magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.If I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.On the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves a top rating.",10,1,2,5 April 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Not as good as the previous movie not to mention LOTR
","7 out of 10 stars would normally be considered quite okay and I guess you could say that this movie is quite okay. However, it has a reputation to live up to. As a movie in the Tolkien universe and with LOTR and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey this movie have a lot to live up to and, as far as I am concerned, it does not.As an action/adventure/fantasy movie it is a quite okay movie. It has a lot of action of course, a lot of adventure and a lot of special effects. Of course everything plays out with the Tolkien universe as a back-drop. I guess it is rather superfluous to mention that the movie is based on the book The Hobbit by Tolkien. However it is here the problems start.In my review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey the first thing that I mentioned was that you should be aware of the fact that the movie did not follow the book in any great detail and that this was quite okay since the extensions were well made. Well, it should be no surprise that the first part of this statement is valid for this movie as well. Unfortunately, whereas the first movie felt like a fluid extension of the book this one feels like it is just full of fillers.There are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of action but it really feels like it was just put in there as fillers to showcase the special effects. Speaking of special effects, quite a few of them where rather unimpressive I have to say. The scenes where the dwarfs went down the rapids in barrels frequently looked plastic and artificial. The scenes with Smaug was not too bad even though he was quite overused but the parts around the forges was just plain ridiculous. I know it is fantasy but come one, getting them started and producing tons and tons of molten gold in a few minutes not to mention riding on molten metal without getting burned was just silly.On the whole I found it an enjoyable movie but I was expecting more.",7,0,1,19 April 2014
Non-Stop," Okay but not as good as I hoped
","Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson so when a movie comes out with him in it I generally get it without too many questions asked. It has been a somewhat varied experience. This one is somewhere in the middle of the range I would say. I did indeed have higher hopes for it.The basic story is quite good but I never really felt very thrilled about the implementation and I more often than not felt frustrated by the various jerks not believing Bill and Bill's clumsy attempt at convincing people that he was a good guy not to mention controlling the passages. For being an air marshal Bill did not seem to be very good at it. I known he was supposed to be a former drunk but still It is still a decent enough movie though which rolls on at a reasonably decent pace. I never really felt compelled to pick up my tablet and start to read something while waiting for the boring parts to pass as have happened with a few other movies. Well, at least not very often. It is not really an action movie though and the scene at the poster is pretty much the only high-octane action scene in the entire movie which was also a bit disappointing. Sure, there are some quite good fights between Bill and various other characters but I would still put this movie more in the thriller genre than in the action one.The media jerks and the way people seemed to control things outside, or rather not control things, the plane was also really frustrating. I would really have sued the arses of those media dicks afterwards given how they downright slandered both Bill and air marshals in general without any real proof. What happened with innocent until proved guilty. Oh, yeah right, I forgot, that has no meaning to todays media people.Sadly enough the thriller part never got that thrilling either. I feel this is due to the rather clumsy way that Bill went about things most of the time. He never really gave a professional appearance. This goes for the cop that happened to be on the plane as well by the way. I felt he was really behaving just like some scared member of a mob rather than a trained professional. When the villain was finally exposed and the reasons for the events where explained. Well, let us just say that I went 'meh' at that point. On the good side Liam Neeson did make a rather good performance given the kind of script he had to work with.On the whole it is an okay movie though which is worthwhile to watch but, as I wrote, I had my hopes set a notch higher.",6,0,1,5 July 2014
Django Unchained," A pure Tarantino blast when he is at his best
","This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. It is a pure Tarantino blast. The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment.The main actors are playing their roles very well. The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a' la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.The movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his 'Damsel in distress'. It still has quite a bit of 'Tarantino humour' sprinkled around in it though.During the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an 'attitude' towards African people. It is tempting to say 'nigger haters' but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad sh-t happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less.As usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the 'unnecessary violence'. I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is 'only a movie'.This is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. I enjoyed it immensely.",10,0,2,18 May 2013
X-Men: Apocalypse," A good super hero and special effects movie
","X-Men Apocalypse is typical of what you would expect from a Marvel X-Men movie. Light on story and depth and heavy on special effects and action. In short it is exactly what I, as a Science Fiction and Fantasy geek, would expect as well as hope for.The X-Men faces a new threat in the form of the worlds first mutant. Naturally said mutant is really a Übermutant vastly more powerful than any 'normal' mutant. Equally naturally this Übermutant is set on a path of world destruction and domination. I quite liked this villain. He is a good all evil and powerful bad guy and a worthy adversary. No nonsense about trying to make the villain likable or trying to explain why he turned evil or such like. This guy is evil, he is the bad guy, he needs to be taken downfull stop.As I wrote the story is not the most elaborate one around but it is a good one within the confines of a Marvel super hero movie. It gets the job done without being overly stupid or silly. It is set in the 'prequel' universe created by X-Men First Class. The movie adds a few new X-Men to the ranks of Professor Xaviers team. Some of them thanks to the manipulations of Apocalypse although they start out on the bad side at first.The movie moves along at a decent enough pace and, as was mentioned, there are quite a few action sequences and special effects thrown at the viewer throughout the movie. Personally I found the special effects to be quite good. Even stunning at times. I am quite a bit of a special effects nerd so of course this pleased me a lot.The movies ending certainly opens the door to future X-Men movies and I for sure would like to see the franchise continue. I very much enjoyed these almost two and a half hours in front of my TV set.",8,2,4,31 January 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Mediocre movie made watchable by the SFX action
","It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.There are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.The main villain, Electro, was  well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.Then of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhinoas some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy! The entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out.",5,4,12,8 September 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," silly and somewhat childish but rather funny sci-fi comedy adventure.
","This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.The main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.The story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.Speaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie's tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.On the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.",7,0,3,13 December 2014
Evil Dead," Good ... for a gore-feast style horror movie
","It should not really come as a surprise to anyone that this movie is a bit of a gore-feast. I have to admit that I have not seen the original movie from 1981 so I cannot comment as to whether this one is better or worse. Personally, I thought it was quite okay and a step above the classical B-movies that these kind of horror movies frequently turns out to be.The story is not really very original. Not that it had any chance of being that since it is a remake after all but the 'group of young people get stuck in cabin in the woods while evil things make bad things happen' was not really the most original one already when the first movie came out. It is a straightforward enough horror movie story and it is quite well implemented.The special effects (read gore) is well done and not too ridiculous and over the top as in some movies. Some may of course consider that the gore levels that we talk about here are always over the top but then this is obviously not a movie for you so do not watch it. Of course there are some ridiculous moments in the movie though. For some reason they never seem to be able to make a horror movie without them. There is the always present dumb guy that stops and feels sorry when the demon starts to whine in the voice of his girlfriend or sister even though he knows it is a demon for example. The amount of punishment these people take and still walk around is also a bit ludicrous. Warning, slight spoiler ahead! I especially think the scene where Mia pulls her arm so hard that she separates it from her hand is just silly. There is no way she would have the strength to do that and there is even less way that she would be able to walk around afterwards. She would have passed out from shock at the very best.Anyway, as I said, no one seems to be able to make a horror movie without some silliness in it so I cannot say that I was very surprised. In general it was a good movie though. Well implemented with a fitting scary mood in a lot of the scenes. I have to say that I liked the fact that there was no hysterical teenage beauty queen and actor wannabee running around screaming her head off all the time. Actually, that is another thing that elevates this movie to a slightly higher state than the traditional B-movie state of most horror movies. The acting in general was quite acceptable.In general it made for an enjoyable movie eveningif you like gory horror movies that is.",6,2,3,21 October 2013
Jurassic World," Decent Hollywood entertainment
","The last movie review I made I started off by saying it was a movie you mostly watched for the special effects. Well this one is pretty much the same. The plot is pretty much predictable. The characters are fairly mediocre. The bad guy is a standard Hollywood villain which means that he is utterly despicable but boringly predictable and serves little more purpose than instilling bad feeling, which of course he does pretty well.The movie starts 22 years after the original theme part met its premature demise. The 'you should not play good' prophets can say what they want, I think the idea of reviving the Dinosaurs (without the reckless gene manipulation stuff) is a quite cool one and I would certainly endorse the idea of they could make it work. I really do not care much for the nonsensical stories of these movies where there is always some thoroughly stupid Hollywood villain that screws things up with some ludicrous evil scheme but, unfortunately a lot of people seems to buy into that stuff and think it is 'what could happen'.Anyway, having said that, the story is not bad for this kind of movie. It generally holds together although the stupid plot of the main villain really did (censored) me off. It was the usual dumb-ass stuff where you could see where things were going from the moment the dumb-ass in question opened his mouth.I did like the hero although I was pretty much a stereotype one. I did not really like the equally stereotype woman lead character and I certainly felt that the silly nonsense about a couple in the process of divorcing sending their kids for a vacation with their aunt who obviously is not interested in the well being of the kids. Typical soap opera material.This is a special effects movie and the special effects where not bad. I would not say that they where wow impressive but then that might be due to special effects overload. Today you are so used to wonderful special effects that it takes a lot to impress you. At the time when the original Jurassic movie was released one would have gone all wow over the effects in this movie but today they are just 'just' what one would expect. Still good though.If you are looking for a good plot, well then you are going to be disappointed. It is pretty much standard, brain-dead, Hollywood fare in that department. I really fail to understand why they constantly fail to provide anything remotely intelligent in terms of plot. Are the average audience really that stupid? Well, having offloaded that bit of frustration, and parked my brain in the closet, I did indeed enjoy the movie. It was pretty much what I expected nothing more, nothing less.",7,7,17,22 October 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Classical John Woo over the top action feast. Not a good Mission Impossible Movie.
","This is a decent enough mindless action movie with a lot of over the top action but it is not really a Mission Impossible movie. The movie starts of reasonably well being somewhat intelligent with a bit of Mission Impossible feel to it. It is actually almost a bit slow at times. However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.As with the first movie if it would not have been labeled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly brain dead though, Hollywood action movie. However, I have higher expectations from a movie labeled Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise is quite okay as Ethan Hunt. Dougray Scott is okayish as the bad guy. Sometimes he projects the right big bad and mad bad-guy attitude but sometimes he is just silly and just as over the top as the action scenes. He is supposed to be a mastermind but he comes out as a thug a' la a not so intelligent drug baron in many scenes.The action scenes? Well, they are classical John Woo material. Fast paced with a lot of stunts and things that go boom. They are also, as expected, hugely over the top and unbelievable. They provide a enjoyable visual experience but, as I wrote above, they are not really what I would expect from a Mission Impossible movie.The romance between Hunt and Nyah is the typical Hollywood, let's throw in a sexy girl and some superficial attraction, which develops from get lost to I love you in the matter of a few hours of contact, between the lead character and the girl. Meh! I get the impression that the people that have created these movies so far have not really watched a single full season of Mission Impossible.",5,0,1,1 January 2016
Logan," Allow me to disagree.
","I believe that I am about to disagree with quite a few people now. You see, I did not like this movie.Not that this came as much of a surprise to me. What I got was pretty much what I expected. From a technical point of view the movie is quite well done. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are doing good jobs as always. The action scenes are good. The cinematography is not at all bad. If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting.For me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made.Wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs.The entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go (censored) themselves so that he can continue to self destruct.The bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X- Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of 'enhanced' humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie.By the way, why the (censored) do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight?The story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about.The movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting. I know a lot of people seem to like it but I cannot understand why. At least not if you are a X-Men fan.",4,12,27,21 July 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A good action / special effects / super-hero movie.
","This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another 'standard' comic book villain a' la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.Overall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.",7,2,7,20 October 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Magnificent...and excruciatingly boring.
","I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.I remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where's the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.However, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there's only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.In the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.So,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.I hadn't actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:'Critics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films - and one of the most controversial - Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity - and folly - of mankind.'It's pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called 'critics' are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.What the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there's really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap 'the folly'. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.Sure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably 'interpret' the hell out of any movie and 'find' whatever message you want but it is still BS.Well, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",6,3,4,27 January 2019
Elysium," Unfortunately as bad as I expected
","Be warned that this review contains spoilers.Unfortunately this movie was as bad as I expected. I got it to my collection since it was one of the 'big' movies this year and it was a sci-fi movie. Given how much it is bragged about the fact that the director have also been behind 'District 9″, which I did not like at all, on the poster I really did not have my hopes up very high though and I was not surprised.The entire plot is rather ludicrous from the start and it is filled with social messages about wicked industrialists, oppressed poor, wasting of limited resources etc. etc. bla. bla. Add in the usual working class hero stuff, a heroin to care about and a sick kid for some additional 'compassion effects' and that is it. These social 'them and us', 'the elite and the rest', type of movies have been done so many times and they are equally boring every time. I just do not like movies that try to force some message down the viewer's throat. I watch movies to be entertained.Even if you try and ignore the social messages that you are force feed the rest of the movie is also just not very good. For example they have this big space station where the majority of the population is not allowed and still they seem to not have thought about any defences whatsoever. They have to shoot down advancing shuttles by hand-held rockets using 'sleeper agents' on Earth. That is just nonsense. The entire concept that you can 'reboot' the main computer system to take control and turn everyone into citizens of Elysium is also fairly ludicrous.The ending where everyone indeed suddenly becomes citizens of Elysium is just plain dumb. They send down a couple of automated shuttles and they are supposed to heal and fix everyone? And what about the fact that Earth was supposed to be ruined in the first place? As I write, just dumb.This is just another nonsense movie with a 'social message' that got way too much money from Hollywood. The only reason it didn't get an even lower rating is because there are some nice special effects and action scenes in it. That and the acting is not bad. Matt Damon & Co does as well as can be expected with this nonsense script.",2,3,8,24 December 2013
Taken," A very good action/thriller flick
","This is a very good action/thriller flick. It currently holds a 7.9 rating at IMDb which it certainly deserves. The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).I generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real bad--s, I-kick-the-sh-t-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.The movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.This is really a textbook action/thriller movie. A very enjoyable hour and a half indeed.",8,3,4,8 March 2013
La La Land," Surprisingly okay to watch
","This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.This movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia's bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.Everything else about this movie isokay. Okay acting, okay story etc. As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.I cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.I did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!Anyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.",6,1,2,6 July 2017
From Hell," Quite nice Victorian drama although the ending is quite tragic
","I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit 'splattery' but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.",7,0,0,14 October 2014
Jack Reacher," A good straightforward crime/action movie
","When looking for something to watch the other day I found this one in the program tableau for Cine+ Premiere on CanalSat. Not a movie that had caught my attention before so I decided to have a go at watching it. I have to say that I have spent 130 minutes in worse ways. I found this movie quite good.It is a pretty classical crime story where it appears that one guy is the guilty one without a doubt but the truth is of course a bit more complicated than this. So our hero, who just to complicate things storms onto the scene also being convinced that the guy did it, have to unravel how the real bad guys managed to frame the poor sod.The movie is a fairly hard boiled crime story and a cross between Columbo, Dirty Harry and something else. It is reasonably intelligent, holds together without too many holes and quite well implemented. There is some decent good old detective work combined with a fair amount of action ranging from fist fights to car chases and shootouts. The major complaint I have is that Tom Cruise is really not the right guy for the role. He does not look half as tough as the character he is trying to portray.Other than that it is indeed an enjoyable movie. It is perhaps more of a grandiose TV-movie than something you (or at least I) would go and watch in a theater (then since I got a proper home-cinema system I rarely go to the theaters at all any more anyway) but nevertheless quite likable.",7,1,2,18 December 2014
Joker," Is this a bloody joke?
","This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f... kidding me?The only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.The 'Joker' in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.The REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.The movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it's qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.However, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that's Hollywood today.That the politically biased and elitist so called 'critics' on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy 'review' site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.",3,3,12,19 February 2020
Edge of Tomorrow," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I have to say that this movie was surprisingly enjoyable. I did have my doubts about it. I always have doubts about movies that manipulate time. I guess one advantage the movie has is that it does not really involve time travel and changing the past to influence the future but 'only' resetting a day and living it over and over again.The entire concept is of course still totally ludicrous. Even if we forget about the feasibility about resetting time altogether there are just so many things that are wrong with the concept. For example, is time reset all over the universe or just on Earth? Both of those avenues create their own issues further down the line of course. Even if we try to forget these larger issues there are the issue that as soon as Cage altered his own behavior from one repetition of that day to another he would alter the chain of events and what he knew was the events in the previous repeat would no longer be certain in the one he was living right then. Not to mention that he had a longer and longer chain of people to convince on a single day and still get the job done.Okay, enough harping about that. If you manage to lock out all these annoying issues with the story what remains is, as I wrote before, actually a fairly enjoyable movie. It is primarily a science fiction action movie of course and the action as well as special effects are not bad at all. We get treated to plenty of the classical déjà vu scenes were Cage tries to convince people by predicting their immediate future in minute details. Classical and very not innovative but well done and I have to admit that I am a bit of a sucker for these impress-and-surprise someone scenes. On the whole the movie managed to use the basic concept of reliving the day and make it feel reasonable fresh despite it not being a entirely new idea. The fact that the acting was quite adequate and that both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt made a good performance as far as I am concerned of course helped.Naturally the movie builds up towards the climactic battle against the alien central organism and of course everyone (who Cage managed to convince) have to throw in their lives to get Cage in position for the final attack. Personally I liked the ending although I have to say that I was a bit miffed that the writer did not manage to come up with some more imaginative ending scene between Cage and Rita though.Bottom line, an enjoyable movie well worth watching.",7,1,3,24 October 2014
Con Air," Good solid entertainment
","This is one of those movies which are simply good solid entertainment. The fact that I do like Nicolas Cage, even though he is at times really lousy at choosing which movies he participate in, is of course an additional plus.Naturally I do like the performance of Nicolas Cage in this movie but John Malkowich is also great as the main bad guy and Steve Buscemi is perfect as the nutcase although his role could have been a bit more expanded upon. The rest of the actors are doing nicely as well although it always saddens me to see Colm Meaney playing a dumbass and/or bad guy after his role in Star Trek.The story is not really bad although it has the usual Hollywood mistakes here and there. The ease by which they pick locks in this high security flight is somewhat laughable and I seriously doubt that they would have been able to haul the plane out of that desert junkyard in flyable condition in real life for instance. Still, it is not a bad story and it works for moving the movie forward.There are plenty of action and it is mostly quite entertaining. Sometimes it is a bit silly and rather unrealistic of course but, as I wrote, mostly it is quite entertaining. The ending is definitely a bit on the silly side with the plane touching down on the Las Vegas Strip. This bit felt like the producers realized that they had some FX budget left and just had to burn it.Anyway, on the whole a quite entertaining movie.",8,1,1,24 August 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Great fantasy adventure
","The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needles to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien's but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.Still, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.Anyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.The story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.I have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid though. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping to the end that he would meet a gruesome end.On the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a 'Tolkienesque' atmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",9,6,11,30 April 2015
Murder on the Orient Express," Why?
","I am a great fan of Agatha Christie in general and Hercule Poirot in particular. When yet another remake of Murder on the Orient express came out I was somewhat hesitant. After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.I guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder...why? As a movie it is not too bad but as a Hercule Poirot movie, the classical Murder on the Orient Express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. Edible but not at all what you paid for.To me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.The movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.Then there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!And do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.I can go on for some time here so let's move on.Technically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.Part of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like ... props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that 'The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act.' and there seems to be some truth in that.The movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).",4,1,1,19 April 2018
The Conjuring," Fairly good classical exorcism type horror movie
","The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting? This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this 'ghosthunter' make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but Christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",7,3,4,16 June 2014
Wonder Woman," Good entertainment if you brain is tired.
","I quite enjoyed this movie. When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana's gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge. Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being 'realistic' superhero special effects.The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you're wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating",8,3,9,2 November 2017
Taken 2," Fully acceptable if you are in the mood for a no-brainer action flick
","I enjoyed this movie as a no-brainer action/thriller flick. Sure, it has a bunch of illogical and idiotic elements in but I have seen a lot worse. The movie certainly do not deserve the ridiculously low ratings that some people have given it.It is perhaps not as good as the first movie, mostly due to the silly bits and pieces, but as a plain vanilla action/thriller it is certainly passable. I generally do like Liam Neeson. I did like him in the first Taken movie and I do like him in this one. The other actors with the possible exception of his wife and daughter are mostly there to fill up the scenes.After a semi-dull beginning which is pretty much just setting up a reason for them all being in Istanbul, Bryan and his wife is, surprise, surprise, taken and that is pretty much when the action starts and from there on it is pretty much action all the way.As have been mentioned, there are a lot of stupid things happening in the movie. Dropping grenades in the middle of Istanbul seemingly without anyone really reacting for instance. Bryan's daughter have failed to take a drivers licence in the states several times but still, when thrown into a car with a manual gear stick, she handles the car like a stunt driver. Then we have a violin player that sits in the same spot all the time? Not to mention crashing into the embassy while being fired upon by the embassy marine guards and then they can just sit there in the wrecked car, in front of the embassy, while Bryan calls for help from some guy playing golf in the states.It is clear that the Luc Besson didn't really put realism very high on his agenda for this movie. But then this wouldn't be the first time for him. Overlook the silliness and you have a decent enough action/thriller flick. At least I enjoyed it and I am normally not too forgiving when it comes to stupid and unrealistic stuff in movies.",6,0,0,6 April 2013
The Wolverine," Good entertainment but stop short of being great
","This is definitely a good and entertaining movie. For me however, it falls short of being great due to a couple of things that I really did not like. Be warned that the rest of this review contains a few spoilers if you have not watched the movie before reading this.The movie begins quite well. I liked Wolverine getting into that bar taking revenge on the idiot hunting bears with poisoned darts. Then it did not continue so well. My main issue is that they screw with Wolverines healing powers really early on in the movie so that he is handicapped for a good chunk of it. I really did not like that. Now this does not stop there from being quite a few cool action sequences. The fight sequence on the Japanese bullet train was quite cool although a wee bit too drawn out perhaps.Eventually he manages to get his powers back although the happiness does not last very long. In the final combat they actually deprive Wolverine of his adamantium claws and it doesn't look like he gets those back. What the f is that? Sure, he regrows his original bone claws but that is not the same thing. Wolverine should have his adamantium claws, full stop. This is something I really dislike with a lot of Hollywood producers and directors now. They feel that they have to create some shock effect by destroying icons and constants in the world of movie fantasy. Like blowing up the Enterprise over and over again. I just hate it and for me this is the one thing that really stops this from being a great movie. Either they somehow give him back his proper claws or they can just as well make a reboot as far as I am concerned.It is quite sad that they, I will not say ruined but at least, diminished the movie in this way. Otherwise it would have been a great movie. It has a lot of nice action, a not too bad script and Hugh Jackman is very good as Wolverine. Actually the only one I thought was somewhat si so is Dr Green who's acting is rather pathetic.All in all a good and entertaining movie that could have been a lot better if it was not for the Hollywood dimwits who felt they had to put something shocking in it and screwed it up.",7,6,10,30 November 2013
Black Panther," Overhyped as hell but still pretty okay entertainment.
","It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less...well...stupid!Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.",7,1,2,26 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The crappiest and most disappointing movie in a long time.
","As I write this review I have just had a thoroughly disappointing movie experience and it so just happens that I have some strong feelings about the source material for this movie so be prepared for a bit of ranting and a few more 'adult' words than usual.I have to say that I bought this movie only because I felt I wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.In the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.Let me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a f... joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a f... CIA agent? You got to be f... kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.Same stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.Weird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.Oh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?I had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman's car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.Okay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.I am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don't like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it.",1,5,11,17 April 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Great action, special effects, superhero movie
","There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.This one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.The movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.On the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.",9,1,1,29 March 2014
Lucy," I really liked this movie
","A lot of people appears to have gotten into some hate-mode when watching this movie. I guess they did not check up what the movie was really about before watching it. The movie is not perfect, it has its flaws, but a 1 or 2 star bullshit rating is hugely unfair. Personally, I really liked this movie. It is science fiction, pure and simple. If you expect science without the fiction, well then you should go and see some other movie. With Luc Besson both writing and directing and statements like 'merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic' in the blurb  well I got pretty much what I expected.The movie starts off making you think it is a 'simple' revenge story with science fiction elements in the form of the superhuman Lucy. However it gradually evolves into something else. Lucy knows that she cannot survive in her new state and it becomes a quest to preserve the knowledge that she has acquired while she still has the time and at the same time dodging the drug dealers that are the cause of her situation in the first place.Lucy is great. Her powers and how they develop are awesome. I really like surprise effects in movie and books of the kind that you get when someone like Lucy reveals her powers to the 'mundane'. Especially when the revealing means swatting a few bad guys. This movie is full of moments like that. It is quite a roller coaster ride of action with Lucy exhibiting her growing powers. Not too surprisingly the movie is also full of scientific bullshit and plot holes. I do not really care. I'm in for the ride and it is a fun ride.Scarlett Johansson is very good in her role as Lucy. Most of the other actors are OK although the Asian drug boss could have been better. He came out more like a brainless thug than anything else. Certainly not as the mastermind of a criminal organization.The ending was a bit unsatisfactory compared to the rest of the movie though. I was a bit disappointed that the big fight at the end more or less was done without Lucy. The long cinematic sequences where Lucy wondered about in time and space felt a bit like yawn-filler-material. The actual ending, well that 'I am everywhere' bit was really been there, seen that, done that. Also, if she was indeed everywhere, why the hurry to create that fancy memory stick? Anyway, apart from that I really enjoyed this movie.",8,4,10,12 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I feel this one is better than the first one
","I still do not agree with the 9 and 10 star ratings but I feel this movie is slightly better than the first one. This is primarily because Jennifer Lawrence's character is more mature and she seems more comfortable in the role. She is no longer an immature, naive and lost child. At least not most of the time.The entire setup is still as ludicrous as before. It is a silly and depressing background scenario and it is definitely not my cup of tea. The people running around in ridiculous hair-do, makeup and showing a severe lack of intelligence is not making things better.The enjoyment of this movie comes when the games finally start. These parts are definitely better than in the first movie. The various dangers are well done, the effects good and there is an interesting overall theme to the arena and the dangers instead of randomly throwing new menaces at players that seemed to be the strategy in the first movie.To me the enjoyment of this movie is in the games themselves. This is probably because I just do not like the rest of the plot. The depressing scenario. The nonsensical and/or oppressive behavior, backstabbing etc. etc.",6,0,9,14 September 2014
Godzilla," Somewhat entertaining movie with a lousy script
","Why must Hollywood scriptwriters of some genres of movies, especially monster, superhero and horror movies, so often think that the audience are total idiots? Or maybe they themselves are severely lacking in brainpower and do not understand the level of trash in what they spew out. In Godzilla scriptwriter Dave (David) Callaham should have a special dishonorable mention for ruining a promising movie.The movie started of with the obligatory nuclear power plant scenes. When it started I first thought, oh no not the blame nuclear power scare again. However, as it turned out, this was not so. Unfortunately, this was pretty much the only good part in the entire script. The rest of the script is just a collection of illogical, unintelligent garbage.It starts quite quickly when Ford's father suddenly pulls of his mask, takes a sniff, and declares that there is no radioactivity in the air. Only a scientifically ignorant idiot writes something like that. Then we have the scene were the soldiers rush into The Nevada nuclear waste facility and checks the inspection hatch on every door until they find one where there is a light only to discover that the monster have broken free and left a gargantuan hole. A huge monster have broken through the walls of a nuclear waste facility leaving a whole big enough to drive a battleship through and no one would have noticed until some marines goes around and inspects the doors on the inside? Again, you have to be pretty unintelligent to write a scene like that.The entire plot is basically the same unintelligent mess. They follow the creatures around until they reach civilization. First then do they actually try and do something. That is just so nonsensical. In the case that a huge city-destroying creature would approach any large population center it would be blasted way before it reached it. Also, when they do attack they fire some light weaponry and maybe a tank gun or two against it. If millions of people were at risk I think it is not a very far fetched belief that the military would throw everything they had at the threat. And do not get me started on the hair-brained scheme of luring out the monsters to the sea with a nuke. What a load of bullocks! Okay, so with all this ranting, why did I give the movie as much as 6 out of 10 stars? Well, I am a fan of huge monster movies and the parts where the monsters rampage around destroying things or slugging it out against each others are great. Unfortunately this is pretty much the good that can be said about this movie.",6,3,4,21 September 2014
Looper," Proves that time-travel movies are difficult to make
","I am normally fairly hesitant concerning time-travel movies because it is next to impossible to get them right. They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.This movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying 'but if this happened now then that couldn't have happened then and vice versa'. Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: ''This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg'.Anyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn't defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.As if time-travel itself wasn't bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of themexcept our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.The ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list.",6,1,2,24 March 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Very fun secret agent movie although it had some silly parts.
","If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.Gary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.Gary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallel. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.The movie has all the 'goodies' of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent 'stuff' like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind's nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so that the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.On the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.All things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned.",8,2,7,2 August 2015
The Hangover Part III," A bit of a letdown
","I suspect that there was a desire to avoid making a movie that was just a repetition of the two first Hangover movies. Unfortunately what we ended up with is rather mediocre and not at all as hilarious as the previous two movies.First of all, there is really no hangover involved. This means that the entire let-us-discover-what-insane-things-we-did part is gone. Instead we are treated to a much more conventional comedy story. As I story I guess you could say that it holds together much more than the one in the previous movies but that also takes away a lot of the fun-factor.Alan is as frustratingly stupid as always. I never really thought this guy was that funny but more served as a vehicle to put the rest of them into silly situations. Mr Chow is the same lying and cheating bastard as before. Actually I think this guy is quite annoying as well and the dog chow eating scenes is just silly and disgusting. The movie as a whole is a decent enough comedy but where the previous ones where really sticking out above the sea of 'mediocreness' this one is content to float on the surface. It is just another comedy in the crowd.Actually the only two really hilarious parts where the first ones with the giraffe, although they were a bit cruel to the poor giraffe, and the last ones in the middle of the aftertexts.An enjoyable movie but only just.",6,0,1,28 October 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Ehhh, what the f... happened?
","I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering 'What the f... happened?'.Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.One thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one, that it was a no BS, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden 'shops' for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.In this movie he is forced onto a job by a real a--hole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said a--hole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same sh-t no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more 'permanent' setback than the other).Worse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some stupid drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.There are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a'la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood's entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is  unbelievable.I did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.Having said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.Overall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",6,2,8,24 June 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Wacky, action and effects loaded...although I missed the old Mad Max
","I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.It is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.As with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of 'what the f' feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.What I think was my latest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules! Still it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",7,0,3,26 October 2015
Warm Bodies," A quite different zombie movie. Not bad.
","This is a quite different zombie movie. I think it can best be described as a romantic zombie movie with a humorous touch and some action thrown in for good measure. It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the 'shot everything that moves and when it doesn't move anymore shot some more just to be sure' type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words 'romantic' and 'zombie' is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.I think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R's thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies' magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.This is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.The special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The 'bonies' are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.Unless you are totally allergic to zombies I would recommend watching this movie. I would especially recommend it if you are not normally into zombie movies. You are likely to be surprised.",7,0,1,30 July 2013
The Martian," If you do not think too much while watching it was fairly entertaining.
","This is a movie that I have to say that I have a bit of a difficulty in rating. Quite honestly I was sorely tempted to remove a star, or even two stars. Why? Because it is full of Hollywood nonsense, scientific errors, it is rather predictable and it did feel a bit like a Apollo 13 rip-off. Why did I not remove those stars? Well, it is rather entertaining even if, at times, I squirmed in my seat.The movie starts of with a somewhat implausible event where a unexpected storm hits the Mars camp which forces the ground crew of the Mars mission to hurry back to the launch vehicle before it tilts over. The launch vehicle gradually tilts a degree at the time. Is it just me finding this strange? Would storms on Mars defy the usual rules of weather dynamics that they would exert a constant pressure which would cause a slow but constant tilt of a construct like that. No gusts, no change in pressure? And why would it gradually tilt at all? Once the force would be enough for the landing struts on one side to leave the ground it would pretty much tilt right away. Okay, I am being picky so lets give that a benefit of a doubt for the time being.Obviously one guy is lost during the dramatic events. This is equally obviously 100% predictable. The fact that the guy is still alive after the rest of the crew blasted off is obviously also 100% predictable but then, this you should have pretty figured out from the title of the move after all.A lot of the rest of the movie is following this guys quest for survival on Mars using the left over equipment at his disposal and the NASA crew on Earth trying to rescue him. Yes the NASA crew on Earth does discover that he is alive which, again, is pretty much predictable. Of course this gave Hollywood the opportunity to add a utterly dislikable political bureaucrat that is pretty much in the movie for one reason and one reason aloneto be dislikable. Personally I just found him tiresome. But then, Americans seems to like these kind of people given the kind of trash that we see being pushed towards the upcoming presidential electionsfrom both sides! There are a lot of good stuff in the movie. Even though it is rather predictable there are some suspense in it, there are a lot of good scenery, and even though you pretty much knows what is going to happen you do feel like cheering for the hero. Given the script I think a lot of the actors did a rather good job of their roles.If the script writers would have brought on some decent scientific advisors I would say this would have been a great movie but it was frequently goofed up with issues that was just stupid. Like digging down a nuclear reactor a few feet in the ground. What the f good was that supposed to do? And the constant use of simple plastic and duct tape to seal the environment. Yeah, right. Sure, Mars do have some atmosphere so it is not vacuum we are talking about but then in other scenes they seemed to assume almost zero atmosphere and made quite a bit use of explosive decompression effects.Okay, okay I am probably nitpicking quite a bit here but, unlike many Science Fiction movies, this one tries to give an impression of being within the realms of realism and it is just too full of classical Hollywood mishaps for my taste.As I wrote above I still think it is a movie worth watching. It has some suspense, it is well done from a photographic point of view and the actors are doing a decent job. I think 7 out of 10 stars is a fair rating but it should certainly not have more.",7,1,1,4 March 2016
Furious 7," Explosions, fast cars, fighting, more explosions...I liked it!
","This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike 'Mr Nobody' but I have to say that I quite liked him.Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not? Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer.",9,71,86,23 August 2015
