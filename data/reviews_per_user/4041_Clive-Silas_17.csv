Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just as bad as the other three, so what's the problem?
","I certainly wouldn't class this film as being 'unworthy' of the original trilogy - it's just as clunky as the others, and certainly maintains the original 'Star Wars' feel - in fact it's remarkable how little Lucas' directing and writing style has changed in twenty-two years (he has no directing credit and only one partial screenplay credit since Star Wars in 1977). People constantly call him a 'genius', but I'm not sure he even understands the film medium at all! When it comes to the script, the fact that Lucas has complete control over his material means that he's his own worst enemy. If he didn't have total control, there might be someone else empowered to say 'It needs to be clearer when Amidala is Amidala and when she's Padme' - 'Don't waste this forcefield bit - lets have some explanatory dialogue' - 'Cut Jar-Jar Binks'. To my mind, there are four major flaws in Phantom Menace:1) The whole Queen Amidala / Handmaid Padme thing seems to have been badly thought out - when is 'Padme' really Padme, and when is she the queen? Why does whoever is being the queen at the moment (ie geisha makeup on) have to speak in that ridiculous accent? All this could have been easily resolved by simply having a scene between the two of them, or removing the device altogether. (After all, why did they do the switch? This plot device is only of use if the stand-in gets killed - otherwise it didn't really seem to matter if the handmaiden was actually the queen in disguise.) 2)As villains go, Darth Maul was distinctly lacking. The first time we saw Darth Vader, we heard the breathing, we saw that his own subordinates were extremely frightened of him (Maul doesn't even *have* any subordinates!) and he broke someone's neck. Later on he assists in the callous destruction of an entire planet! In Menace, when we get to the climactic battle between the Sith Lord and the two Jedi, Darth Maul's total death toll is: zero. Maul is not really a character in the same vein of Vader, of course - in fact he is little more than a fighting machine, but Lucas let the hype machine take over, a course of action guaranteed to result in disappointment. As is casting your fight director in a pivotal role, causing you to have to cut all his lines (I'm just theorising here).3) Everything that involved the character of the boy Anakin Skywalker was utterly, utterly contrived. He's nine years old (although looks much smaller!), but he has build his own droid; he has built his own pod racer (a project which involves being able to obtain and/or put together two jet engines that wouldn't look out of place on a Boeing 707). He has to win the race, so he does. Later on he's told to sit in a safe place, so he sits in a handy space-rocket which he sets off accidentally while he's simply trying to fire the guns. But what we really want him to do is have a space battle and destroy the droid ship. What can we do? It's alright, the spaceship is set on autopilot and flies up to the droid ship on its own. In the meantime the crash helmet fits him perfectly! He crash lands in exactly the right place, but don't worry because the battle droids never fire on anything until it's cooled down, restarted its engines and raised its shields.4) There wasn't a single unexpected or unpredictable event in this entire movie. Everything is laid out, and everything goes according to plan (even the bits which don't go according to plan are predictable). For example, in order to get off the planet, it is necessary for a boy to win the big race. He wins the race (in fact he is the only survivor) and they get off the planet without any difficulty. But what if, instead of winning, Anakin had been knocked out by the cheat, Sebulba, and ended up seriously injured? We create an unexpected situation, which would require an unexpected solution, and possibly the healing of the injured Skywalker could have been another aspect of his 'special powers'. This is elementary storytelling - but Lucas appears to have forgotten everything he ever knew about that.I think Lucas got too wrapped up in the the graphical creation of all the 'worlds' of the film, and the merchandising opportunities. Some people have asked 'Why didn't they cast a real actor as Jar Jar Binks?' to which the answer is that the complete digital creation of an entire character was at least part of the reason for his genesis. Binks is therefore a product of both the above mentioned Lucas obsessions. These factors have blinded Lucas to the importance of character to a film, regardless of the story or environment (not a mistake you'll ever find Spielberg making). In addition, the dominance of digital animation over the whole of this film must have acted as a considerable restriction in certain aspects - no reshoots or additional scenes are possible, because it involves another month of post-production while the CGI is done.However, leaving all that aside, I think the film is certainly watchable, it's clearly an introductory phase of a deeper story, and it's extremely pretty to look at. The Pod Race is very well done, and Ray Park is an absolutely stunning swordfighter and fight choreographer. I think Ewan Macgregor can be a lot better than this (but you can't make bricks without straw, ie some decent lines to speak).",4,0,1,9 April 2001
Minority Report," McKee was wrong: you don't need a great final act.
","This film has a fascinating and original premise which is unfortunately not explored to its full potential, but also contains some of the most intelligent and visionary future actualisation ever brought to the cinema screen. Amazingly full of non-Spielbergian features - such as after a hard and successful day's precrime fighting, our protagonist is then immediately shown buying and taking drugs, or the lascivious kiss suddenly planted on John Anderton by the elderly Dr. Hineman - the film nonetheless contrives to remind you who the director is at certain points, like the schmaltzy final shot or the lack of nudity when displaying male fantasy images. Those elements aside the entire film works as a much better Kubrick homage than the mawkish A.I.As others have mentioned, the film sometimes doesn't know what it should be pursuing as a theme. The sheer injustice of arresting and imprisoning (apparently without due process) people who haven't even committed any crimes does not seem to come into the purview of the script, which seems to decide that the injustice arises when one of the three pre-cogs disagrees with the other two, and that the inventors of the system arbitrarily had such 'Minority Reports' summarily and automatically wiped from the 'testimony'. Witwer (Farrell) represents the 'enemy', the villainous Attorney General who wants John Anderton and Burgess out of their jobs - oh, wait, that means he must be on the side of Justice and the American Constitution. Hang on, no, it's OK, he wants them out on their ears, but he wants to make PreCrime national, so it's alright to hate him. No, now I'm confused because it looks like he's a hero again! I guess that's not a bad set of ambiguities for a character, now I come to think of it. Incidentally, Witwer's name adds to the general atmosphere of bereavement (Alderton has lost his son, and the precogs have been deprived of a normal life) - Witwer is German for 'widower'.Very few films in the supposed Science Fiction genre have been so clear-eyed and intelligent in their depiction of the future. Of *course* all the major advances in science and technology are going to be put to the advantage of marketing and the benefit of the large corporations (although I do think that in 50 years time the TV show 'Cops' might actually have changed its theme song - 'Bad Boys' by then being regarded as classical music, presumably). Unfortunately, some of this technology is so perfect and seamless that the only way out of Anderton's obstacles for the scriptwriters involved them having to dig enormous holes in the plot. It is simply not credible that the security checks did not remove Anderton as 'authorised personnel' the second he started running. This led to the enormous implausibility that 2054's state-of-the-art 'deep freeze' prison can effectively be broken out of with the aid of one person wielding a gun. There were other problems, too, like the fact that three murders successfully take place during the course of the movie, despite the oft-stated claim that the Precrime department have stopped all murders for six years. Could the cops only get there on time if Tom Cruise was with them? So it seems...So, what did I mean by my subtitle? If you've seen Adaptation, the legendary script guru Robert McKee appears as a character and expounds some of his theory of scriptwriting to Charlie Kaufman: 'I'll tell you a secret. The last act makes the film. Wow them in the end, and you've got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you've got a hit. Find an ending, but don't cheat, and don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina.' Minority Report is the movie that proves that this is actually nonsense. If there's a good enough premise and you can get a more than exciting trailer out of the main body of the movie, your last act can be utter rubbish, as is the case here. All the 'Wows' in this movie come before Anderton's arrest - after that it really does get a little ho-hum. They even made a terrible bosh of the ex-wife, upgrading a minor character, introduced sometime in the middle of the movie, into a major protagonist?? But the public forgave that and everything else and gave this movie a certain success.Tom Cruise does a very good job with good strong support, at least partly because he handles the little touches of humour very well, and (for once) is not afraid to look a little silly, as when he chases his own eyeballs down a corridor.Samantha Morton is an absolute revelation and absolutely un-missable. You literally cannot take your eyes off her whenever she appears. This is another reason for the failure of the last act, since she is off screen for most of it.'Wait........ wait.............. wait..........'",8,1,2,9 January 2004
The Others," Did there have to be a séance?
","Without spoiling too much I will say that I was slightly disappointed that a séance was performed at one point in this movie, with the implication that a genuine connection with the, shall we say 'spirit world' was made. Even the movie Ghost knew better than that! All 'professional' mediums, without exception, are charlatans and con artists, and promotion of a rational viewpoint in life is not helped by otherwise intelligent movies falling into this particular trap.And it is an intelligent movie. For the most part the film manages very well to tell its story in little revelatory bits and pieces, whilst keeping the tension high. It even manages well the part where the returned father actually being dead is so obvious to the audience, although Grace and the children (of course) don't recognise it. It is handled in a way that it doesn't matter. He's there for character and plot development, not shock value.The problem arises in the final act of the film. It's at this point that, not simply because of the plot, but something in the way it was written, lit, shot, acted, edited together: somehow one is suddenly no longer watching a movie, but an episode of television melodrama. Maybe it is because the movie doesn't finish with a cathartic climax with, say, the house burning down or something, but rather one of those ambiguous twists which reminds you of 'Tales of the Unexpected' or 'The Twilight Zone'. But also (again without going into too much detail) there is a marked increase in phoney looking period detail, and the look, acting and writing suddenly puts one in mind of a rather sub-par episode of 'Poirot'.Despite all the praise received from professional critics, my view was that Kidman's performance was the weakest of an otherwise excellent little ensemble (particularly Alakina Mann as the daughter who is just fantastic). I was especially keen to see the magnificent Eric Sykes, who seems to be getting more work as he gets older. For non-British readers (and indeed anybody under 30), I would like to point out that Eric Sykes is not just a consummate character actor, he is also one of the funniest writers and performers this country has produced, beginning over 50 years ago with his collaborations with Spike Milligan on the legendary Goon Show, and right up to the 1980s with his own sitcom, 'Sykes'. He's still acting on stage and screen, despite having been profoundly deaf for many years.",7,0,0,21 May 2003
Malcolm X," Uncompromising
","I turned this film on accidentally last night, and just left it on screen while I found something better to watch.  An hour and a half later I still hadn't turned it off.  Utterly engaging central performance by Washington.At first (once Malcolm X gets to prison and meets Brother Baines) one is impressed by the power of the arguments used, and the value of truly understanding the history of black repression.  Your heart goes out to Malcolm because of what he is trying to achieve, which is that the African Americans take control of their own destiny and make their own prosperity, by eschewing crime and drugs and all the other easy escapes, and instead to promote a moral life of education and achievement.  Then, gradually, almost without you noticing it, the other aspects of Malcolm X's views come out: the sexism, the Anti-Semitism, the segregationism.  This is what I meant by my subtitle.  This film does not compromise in its portrait of a figure it admires - it does not sweep the uncomfortable facts under the carpet.  I also like the way the film sees everything from X's viewpoint.  We don't find out about Elijah Muhammed's shenanigans until Malcolm X does, and there is only the slightest hint that the NoI leadership had turned against X before he finds out the full shocking truth.If Spike Lee has a fault, however, it is in not allowing powerful images to speak for themselves.  The demonstration outside the police station comes to an abrupt end when X raises his hand and points:  everyone shuts up and quietly shuffles off.  A brilliant scene with an unmistakable message.  So unmistakable, in fact, that the police chief, Peter Boyle repeats it for our benefit: 'That's too much power for one man to have.'  Hey, Spike!  Malcolm demonstrated the power of the masses, and his own power over them, in a brilliant, non-violent way.  We got it!Of course the most egregious example of this was the coda, which repeatedly told us that Malcolm X is a much-denigrated figure who nevertheless deserves our honour and respect.  Well, why did Lee spend millions of dollars making a 3 hour film about him then?  Did he suddenly lose all his confidence as a filmmaker?  Did he think that, having sat through all three hours, we would still not quite understand whether Malcolm X was admirable or not?  Hey, Spike!  Anyone can put together a montage with an upright-sounding voiceover.  Only Spike Lee can make 'Malcolm X'.  You did a good job, leave it alone!",Null,2,7,30 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The greatest exponent of the filmmaker's craft...
","Let us not be in any doubt - this isn't high cinematic art, neither is it trying to be. But it is the greatest exponent of film-making *craft* since Lawrence of Arabia.Peter Jackson's achievement with The Lord Of The Rings can be described as nothing less than phenomenal: To shoot three $100m movies at the same time over a full year and a quarter; to do such thorough planning for every smallest detail of production that they planted the gardens in Hobbiton a full year prior to the start of shooting; to assemble a cast and crew with the primary concern that everyone should get along well, in order to minimise problems caused by personal friction; to have computer developers working to create new and improved methods of image creation, leading to the creation of such aritificial intelligence marvels as the MASSIVE virtual army engine; to oversee the operations of up to six filming units, and to do it in such a way that the work of each comes together as a seamless whole.To do all this, and at the end of it have a series of movies which the world has taken to its heart without betraying the fans of Tolkien's work, is simply a miracle.More than most other movies of any kind, and certainly more than any other big budget blockbuster ever made, The Lord Of The Rings is a labour of love. No megastar egos marred the filming progress - every single person involved simply put their heads down and worked as hard as they could to create this cinematic masterpiece. And this dedication and commitment shines through every frame.In creating the theatrical version of The Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson sacrificed character scenes for storyline exposition. I personally would have made the opposite decision. Either way, the extended version available on DVD, with those character scenes reinstated, is a much fuller richer experience than the original cut, and being able to see it is an enormous privilege. The additional material in the form of approximately 5 hours of documentaries charting every stage in the creation of this epic, should become required viewing at every film school.",Null,0,0,20 November 2002
The Village," A comment on many bad reviews.
","This is not about how good or bad the movie is. This is about reviewer after reviewer effectively blaming M. Night Shyamalan for not providing the 'scariest movie evah' promised by the advertising campaign.People, do try to wise up. Films get made first, and then they get promoted, invariably by entirely different people. MNS made the film he wanted to make. It had elements of suspense and horror, and mystery, and historical drama. Some of those elements were excessively played up in the advertising campaign, but that advertising campaign did not even exist until the whole movie was already in the can.I'm not going to pass judgment here on how well MNS achieved what he set out to do, but it's patently obvious, if you sit and watch the movie with an open mind, that The Village is not a horror movie, it is a love story. Just because a movie isn't quite what you were led to believe it to have been, does not make it 'the worst movie ever made'. Comments like that are unjustly denigratory to a studiedly unemotional yet seething with undercurrents performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the absolutely revelatory acting of Bryce Dallas Howard, who made Ivy Walker an unforgettably luminescent character.",Null,1,2,4 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A more adult Harry Potter movie.
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban went on general release in the UK yesterday and I caught a late-night showing. This movie is a phenomenal addition to the series, very much darker both figuratively and literally, the child actors are really developing nicely (Grint, for example, is far better than he was in Chamber of Secrets) and director Cuaron put in lots of little visual touches that wouldn't have occurred to Chris Columbus in a million years. One strange thing is that the entire geography of Hogwarts has entirely changed. Both Hagrid's cottage and the Whomping Willow are in totally different places from the previous movie. However, this is not to denigrate the art direction which seems to be better than ever. One major addition to the general set is the workings of the giant Hogwarts Clock, used as a backdrop or for fly-through again and again, to great effect. Also notable is the bridge from the castle to Hagrid's cottage, a fine example of distressed woodwork.Atmospherically the movie is almost totally different from its predecessors. The colours are muted and the sky is always overcast, actually sometimes to a fault - the emotional involvement one should have felt when Harry was first riding Buckbeak was muted by the gunmetal tones of the landscape he was flying over. Beautiful indeed, but not in a 'children's fantasy film' way. This is a quibble. Really the style absolutely suited the much darker ways of the plot. The Quidditch match, which takes place, as in the book, in a driving rainstorm, is an absolute tour-de-force of terror without the gimmicky camera-work prevalent in the first two films. The Dementors, in particular, are extremely well handled and are the backbone, to me, to what I found the most terrifying sequences in the whole Harry Potter saga so far. However, there are also fun parts - particularly the Knight Bus, beautifully translated from the description of Harry's nightmare journey in the book, and a brilliant piece of design in the bus itself. The book is followed almost too faithfully, resulting in little for the much-anticipated Gary Oldman to do as the mad, bad and dangerous to know Sirius Black. But David Thewlis very effectively fills in the void as Lupin. Michael Gambon has stepped so seamlessly into Richard Harris's shoes as Dumbledore that I never remotely thought of comparing their performances. Gambon is no less Dumbledore than Harris was ... in fact he might be a little better.One does hope, however, that when the DVD comes out, they make an 'Extended Edition' rather than put the deleted scenes in a separate section as they have hitherto. In the released film it is all too evident, on occasion, where cuts have been made.",8,0,0,1 June 2004
The Usual Suspects," Flawed, but fascinating
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS****
First of all, I have to confess that I had inadvertently found out the answer to 'Who is Keyser Soze?' scant days before seeing the movie for the first time.  Which makes it impossible to watch the film correctly, where you are made to believe that Gabriel Byrne is Keyser Soze.  We see Keaton being killed at the start, and I believed it because I knew he wasn't Soze.However the montage by which the detective realises the truth was extremely well done, and it was still worth watching the movie for that.The film has three flaws: Keyser Soze is built up throughout the film as being 'The Devil Himself', but nothing he does is any worse than anything the other characters do: when they hit Kobayashi, Baldwin casually kills the two bodyguards; they all machine-gun a number of Hungarians (who could be simple sailors for all they know).  The Rat is cowering in his cabin, more frightened of Keyser Soze than anything else.  Well, if he's frightened to die, a huge gun-battle is in progress and its odds-on he's going to die anyway.  Then Soze actually turns up and, um, shoots him.  Big deal.  The story of Soze killing his own family is just that - a story (whatever the ending).The second flaw is when they do things for filmic effect rather than good sense.  This is particularly notable in the scene where they hit Kobayashi. They are careful to take Kobayashi to an empty office so they can talk to him before killing him (a courtesy not extended to the two bodyguards).  He is thus given the opportunity to talk his way out of it.  Then the cons follow him up to the office on the top floor.  Then they presumably make their way home.  In all this time, there is a bloodstained lift with two dead bodies in it!The final flaw is that the whole 'end sequence' of attacking the boat is one of those long sequences of men running around in the dark and shooting people.  It's very common in action films (particularly of the heist type) and I think it should cease.  The audience don't know where they are, who's shooting at what, what the battle plan is.  When the whole point is who was where and when, I think the action needs to be made a lot clearer.",Null,3,4,22 October 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Please can the Wachowski Brothers from now on be banned from writing their own scripts?
","I had high hopes when Link said of Neo's flying, 'He's doing his Superman thing', and we cut to Neo flying so much like Superman it looked like a deliberate parody. But, sad to say, that was the last drop of humour in an all-too-humourless film which takes itself far too seriously.Whatever happened to the days when the action blockbuster was fun? Sure the action sequences are absolutely phenomenal (the freeway sequence was a masterpiece of continuity - that sequence should win Reloaded the Best Editing Oscar by itself), but we, the audience, have to work so hard during the rest of the movie.No-one designs action sequences better than the Wachowski brothers, but they really have no idea about good story structure or believable characterisation. I thought Morpheus's speech and the love scene between Neo and Trinity should have been the precursor to a major climax near the end of the movie, not just stuck in for no apparent reason at the half hour point. The rave was just a sweaty waste of time. There was supposed to be some kind of love-rivalry thing going on between Morpheus, Niobe and that other captain? But it seemed to be forgotten. At the UK premiere, the cast were publicly annoyed with the critical roasting the movie has received from the media. One can't blame the cast for biting back a little; they absolutely worked their butts off seven days a week for an entire year, doing high intensity kung fu and other stunts. But all that hard work for amounts to, at best 40 minutes of a two and a quarter hour film. The parts that attracted the most criticism, i.e. all the talking, was probably shot in three weeks flat, but it takes up nearly three quarters of the movie.I said that nobody designed better action sequences, but the Wachowski brothers lack imagination in the actual filming of those sequences. Without Bullet Time even the kung fu scenes would be boring. There is no artistry in the camera-work, as there is in the fight sequences of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, (or any number of John Woo films) for example. You sit watching Keanu Reeves hitting large numbers of people in unvarying and unimaginative side-on mid-shots. Bullet Time, when used, gives it the requisite 'wow' factor, but why do we get no closeups of hands, feet or faces? You hardly feel anyone is really being hit at all, particularly with the apparently small repertoire of sounds used.Fair play to the cast who did their best with poor material. It's not that the dialogue is especially clichéd, it's that the Wachowskis pick all the wrong words to express what they wanted to be said. When Twin #1 merges back into his brother's car and says, 'We are getting aggravated', this is just acceptable. Then Twin #2 says 'Yes we are' and you just cringe. 'Is this good for us or bad for us?' says Trinity. Neo says that every floor is wired with explosives and she looks to the front and says, 'Bad for us.' Then the whole confrontation with the Merovingian is like that as well, and one gives up. It becomes too painful to watch.They really, really needed a star to play The Architect. Someone of the stature of Morgan Freeman, Sean Connery or Gene Hackman. No-one else could sell a scene like that, and Herman Bakaitis certainly didn't.One thing can be said to The Matrix Reloaded's credit. Although this movie franchise has proved to be very successful, the makers actually aren't in it for the money. However much the sum of its parts fail to add up to a watchable whole, the sequels are not rip-offs. The producers are serious about the film and what it represents. They just haven't got the knack of making it meaningful to a thinking audience. Another redeeming feature of the series from this point on, is a refreshing absence of the amorality that characterised one or two scenes in the first movie - this time there is no wholescale massacre of innocent people perpertrated by the supposed 'good guys'.The saving grace of the whole series is the superb quality of the technical achievement. In The Matrix Reloaded, the freeway sequence in particular, constitutes the greatest piece of what I shall call 'cinematic engineering', since the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959).",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Darker, better acted .. just not completely thought through.
","***Slight Spoilers*****
To get the full experience, you need to buy the DVD and check out the Additional Scenes.  As with Peter Jackson's 'The Fellowship of the Ring', Christopher Columbus seems to have specifically targetted those all important little character-defining, relationship-building scenes as victims of the editor's blade.  In particular, any scene which referred to Harry's gradual alienation from the school body and his own doubts about his identity and heritage were removed completely, to the detriment of the film.Nonetheless, a fine effort by nearly all involved.  The movie very well captures a darker and much more sinister tone, underscoring more confident performances from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermione.  I must say, however, that Rupert Grint as Ron, the best of the three of them in the first film, seems to have lost his ability to do more than two emotions, one of which is grossly over-acted fear.  As he has gained other movie experience since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, this was a considerable disappointment.Unfortunately, the genuinely frightening scenes of hung cats, giant spiders and Harry himself apparently going mad, were rather cut down at the knees by a somewhat drab climax (although some of this may be down to the book's resolution.)  This was not helped by the very poor and completely unconvincing performance by the actor who played Tom Riddle.  It beggars belief that Columbus and Heyman couldn't find someone better.  It was also surprising on one or two occasions that they couldn't find a better take of a particular shot than some which appeared in the final cut.  **SPOILER AHEAD** For a 'flashback' sequence, they got a different actor to play a young Hagrid, and shot him with his face in shadow.  This was somewhat jarring - as if anybody would care that a supposedly younger Hagrid had wrinkles!Richard Harris gave a fine, valedictory performance (in fact sadly he looked even haler and in better health than in the first movie).  It's just a shame that Dumbledore's role appears to be to behave like every schoolchild's dream teacher - lax, overindulgent, willing to put down other teachers in front of the children - thus rather removing any reason to retain any respect for him.  Maggie Smith reprised her Miss Jean Brodie act again, but her reduced involvement was a little bit sad.  Miriam Margolyes never puts a foot wrong, so she's always money in the bank.  Kenneth Branagh playing Gilderoy Lockhart, a part he could sleepwalk through, suffered from an insufficient exploration of exactly what Lockhart's supposed to have done (but didn't) that merits everybody's hero worship.  In other words we only saw the egotism right from his first scene, rather than see the hero and then realise the egotism and the feet of clay as we get to know him better. However, I was tickled to see that Rowling had cast his first appearance in the form of a book-signing - the book version undoubtedly contains more pointed satirical swipes at the activity in which she had become very experienced during the time since her first book was published!The effects were very well done, particularly Dobby the House Elf - for my money the most convincing CG creature ever created.  (Freeze frame him while he's moving - I defy anyone to tell the motion blur from the real thing). The light comes off his skin absolutely flawlessly, although they went to the trouble of 'showing off' this facet in the scene where he hits himself with the lamp.  'Showing off' the effects was in fact a besetting sin during this film.  They start the film with a landscape of suburban Surrey (seemingly more densely packed with houses than Hong Kong!) before diving into Harry's bedroom window.  Then a magnificent vista of Hogwarts as the camera flies into the main refectory window.  Then another magnificent shot before going through a skylight in the greenhouse.  Then a wonderful flying shot of the Quidditch field before we cross the wall and join the play.  I was truly rolling my eyes by this last shot.  One of those per movie from now on, please, Mr Columbus.",Null,0,0,8 May 2003
Vanilla Sky," Worth a look, but fails to go for the jugular.
","A reasonably intelligent psychological examination of the nature of love, lust and life in general. Experienced movie goers get clued in to the kind of film we're watching right from the opening when Cruise cruises around a deserted New York. In some ways this was probably a mistake since, although a lot of what happens seems to make no sequential sense, we already know to distrust what we see. This detracts from the emotional involvement required to get the maximum impact. I personally didn't even believe that Sophia was remotely real and was quite surprised to discover that she did, in fact, exist.Stories of this nature are more satisfyingly terrifying when the ultimate basis of the main character's experience is psychological. Unwilling to go all the way, the makers of this movie draw the tooth of insanity by creating a pseudo-science fiction explanation for all that has gone before. As is frequently the case when people not fully versed in the genre attempt science fiction, this story has a gaping logical hole in it, which need be plugged only with a single line of explanatory dialogue which was not forthcoming. We are all familiar with the concept of cryogenic freezing of a corpse after death, with the idea of being revived in the distant future when the battle against death itself has been won by our descendants. But this film takes the idea one step further - that you can spend your 'death' living out a fantasy - a 'Lucid Dream'. What they completely fail to explain is how exactly a dead person, a corpse with a dead brain, which is being deep frozen in order to cease all activity and the changes wrought by time to enable revival centuries hence; how such a dead body, then, is supposed to *experience* the said Lucid Dream. Such an ability represents a victory against death even better than physical revival would be. You wouldn't even wait to die in order to experience a perfect life from whatever moment you wish, you'd pay large amounts of money to experience such a thing without dying. So why bother with the antiquated idea of cryogenic freezing of the corpse after death (necessitating Aames to have undertaken a suicide that was impossible to believe in, knowing the character) when he could simply have decided to get frozen and live a better life?Tom Cruise is very good as the man who sees a different kind of life possible through the sight and brief encounter with Sophia, and later excellent as a man dealing with the solitary life of a disfigured man. However, Penélope Cruz is considerably less adept at displaying exactly what it is supposed to be that Cruise is falling in love with, although this is really down to her part being underwritten.To the user whose comment asked for a response to his theory that the whole thing was an examination of David Aames fear and rejection of his own love for Julie (Cameron Diaz's character), I'm afraid that user has been blinded by the fact that the woman is played by Cameron Diaz. There is absolutely nothing in the film or in her performance to suggest that she is anything but the villainess of the piece, the ultimately suicidal, violently obsessive stalker that she is intended to be. Diaz plays the part very well and courageously, and any attempt to see her character as being any better than she is supposed to be is basically a detrimental opinion of her performance.",6,3,6,3 January 2004
Blade Runner," The last great science fiction movie, a flawed masterpiece.
","I was growing up when science fiction films started coming back in vogue, only now with budgets to match their ambition. I was 12 when Star Wars was released, 13 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind appeared. Just as I was turning to adulthood at 17, along came this completely adult science fiction movie. Sad to say, however, in the intervening two decades, not one film has managed to handle a science fiction concept in quite so intelligent a manner. Couple the deep themes of the nature of humanity and the nature of death with Ridley Scott's absolutely inimitable visual style, Rutger Hauer's powerhouse performance as Batty and Vangelis' seminal score and this movie swiftly acquires the deserved status of a classic.That was the good. Now let us briefly examine the bad. The opening establishing shot of Los Angeles, 2019 is of course a classic of its kind. Subsequent lingering shots of futuristic buildings, however, tend to hold up the pace of the movie, often at crucial points of plot development. Apart from being unnecessary they are too long for their own good, frequently extended to allow the traverse of a supernumerary flying vehicle.In addition these shots don't display any of the brilliantly noir claustrophobic atmosphere of the dialogue scenes, so much so that they sometimes seem to have been inserted from a completely different film.The film does have its longueurs. The second act sags alarmingly while Deckard is investigating the photograph and the snake scale until finally we get some action with Zhora's retirement. Later on when he's chasing Pris, we can see that she's waiting for him in Sebastian's flat, so the lengthy shots of Deckard making his way up the Bradbury building only serve to increase impatience rather than suspense.It seems churlish to criticise Harrison Ford's performance, particularly since it at times contains some of his best work - particularly the love scene with Rachael - but for the first half of the film it is very obvious that Blade Runner is the first serious film which he has to carry on his own. There is a palpable lack of consistency in his characterisation, as if Ford hasn't decided who Deckard is, yet. In reaction to things Bryant is telling him about the new 'skin jobs', he screws up his face in an attempt at scorn which comes across as expressing the need for some kind of reaction, but not knowing what. He apologetically calls Rachael and asks her down to the bar, and suddenly turns into the worst kind of self-regarding galoot. And the Jerry Lewis impression during the interview with Zhora - it's just *wrong*.One problem with Deckard's characterisation isn't Ford's fault at all. As the 'old Blade Runner' with all the 'old magic', it sometimes seems as if he's never met a replicant before. In all his retirements he leaves himself almost ludicrously open to attack, and escapes by sheer luck each time. It would have been better to demonstrate his prowess when retiring Zhora, Leon and Pris and show that he has met his match with Batty.Regarding the famed (not to say precedential) 'Director's Cut'. I know I'm in a minority amongst Blade Runner cultists, but it seems clear that in cutting the original version of the film the way they did, the studio evidently knew what they were doing. Shots of vehicles flying around the city go on for too long; Scott's battle to retain his 'Unicorn Dreams' sequence is legendary, but having put a portion of it in, it's clear that the unicorn's 'horn' is artificial, and it comes too early in the film for the connection with Gaff's unicorn origami figure to be evident to anyone other than die hard fans who already know what to look for. Elimination of the voice over certainly had many proponents amongst fans of the movie, not excluding myself, and of course it did have very many bad points - 'Bryant was the kind of guy who in the old days used to call black men ni**ers' (they cut the very worst one, I had to read it in the published script: 'I've seen 'em laugh, I've seen 'em howl. I never saw one cry.'). However, the removal of the voice over has had one rather distressing side effect - it eliminates the character of Gaff almost entirely. Without the voice over there is no indication that Gaff is after Deckard's position, and scarcely any sign that he is a Blade Runner himself until the very end of the movie. The frustrated look on Gaff's face as he observes Deckard's survival now has absolutely no context.After twenty-one years I now feel freer to express a few niggles, happy in the thought that the movie is old enough and certainly classic enough to take a little criticism. It still remains one of my all-time favourite movies, and, as a science fiction fan, one of the very very few movies to treat its genre with respect and intelligence.*2007 EDIT* News arrives of 'Blade Runner: The Final Cut' along with the real story of what happened at the time of the Director's Cut. It seems that Ridley was actually too busy with _1492 (1992)_ (qv) to genuinely supervise the creation of BR:TDC - he simply told the studio to take off the happy ending and the voice over, and they seem to have taken him at his word but in addition thrown everything else in if they had a negative of it. The result was the movie which, in retrospect, it's hard to believe anybody could have believed Ridley Scott actually had anything to do with it. With the new version, they have apparently taken note of my comments above and have even undertaken some reshoots (with Ben Ford, Harrison Ford's son) to fix the second act flabbiness. I very much look forward to the real Ridley Scott vision.",10,0,2,16 August 2003
Bruce Almighty," The guts of this movie were ripped out - see how in the 'Deleted Scenes'
","Obviously we've seen this kind of movie before - the hook here is Jim Carrey and how his manic persona handles the responsibility of infinite power. Unfortunately the one bit of true Carrey-fication is the one you've all seen in the trailers where he mimes 'I've Got The Power' and sets off the fire hydrant.This film resolutely steers away from exploring even the tiniest potential in the ordinary Joe who is given the powers of God. I was shocked when I realised that the entire movie was going to more or less be about Bruce and his relationship with girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston).The structure and story arc made no sense; the first thing Bruce does with his Godlike powers is engineer a night of superb lovemaking, but there was no hint that this was a problem between him and Grace. When Grace and her sister start talking about how 'tonight's the night' that Bruce will propose, you wonder if Bruce is actually in the same movie, since a reluctance or otherwise to commit to Grace was completely absent from his characterisation. When their date turns out to be the most romantic dinner in the world, you the viewer know that it is in the way of these things that he isn't going to propose, but you are left mystified as to why, and when it transpires that it is all just to announce that he got the Anchor job you are left feeling that Carrey has suddenly turned Bruce into a completely different character. Later on in the movie Grace rounds on him and sarcastically yells that what she wants is a 'Boat, and sacks of cash'. This is puzzling because he had not manifested any particular materialistic tendencies around Grace - we didn't even know if she had seen the flash new sports car he was driving. And why was the only apparent consequence to answering everybody's prayers in the affirmative being everybody winning the lottery, ending up with $17 each? Surely a high school kid would have written a few more scenarios into a script about an omnipotent guy?However upon viewing the Extras on the DVD, we discover that a lot of this important stuff was contained within scenes which were deleted before release. The restaurant scene actually ended with Grace berating Bruce and pointing out that she had been waiting for a proposal; subsequently there was a scene in which he took her to a mansion he had created for them, in the car he was now showing off - setting up Grace's sarcasm later on. It has to be said that the mansion scene in particular was poorly thought through and unconvincing - he just got a promotion at work and now he can afford a multimillionaire mansion? And she 'buys' it? On the other hand, there should have been *something* in its place. All those prayer consequences had been shot, but were cut 'for pacing' (although it may have been to eliminate a plot hole - God shows him the bad consequence of one decision which is actually down to God's foreknowledge of what would have happened if Bruce Almighty hadn't intervened; but if Bruce has *all* God's powers, then presumably he would already know this?) The director's commentary on the deleted scenes reveals director Tom Shadyac to be two things: talentless and spineless. If he wasn't cutting essential plot scenes for pacing, he was doing so because 'Jim was coming across too dark, and preview audiences didn't like it', or 'We were worried that people might get offended.' For heaven's sake, Tom, any director worth his salt would at least *pretend* that these changes were forced on him by the studio, instead of on his own initiative having gone out of his way to make his own movie suckier. One consequence of this cutting was to dramatically weaken Grace as a character, leaving Jennifer Aniston completely wasted.Morgan Freeman as usual is just money in the bank. There is nobody you'd rather have play God, but it is a shame to see it happen in this movie. Carrey does his manic facial act with no context other than that it's Jim Carrey so you expect it of him. In the outtakes his crazy mugging has the whole crew in stitches, and you can't help feel that they must be laughing because he's the star. That consummate professional Jennifer Aniston scarcely cracks a smile during these events, I notice, particularly when Carrey practically molests her while making his silly face. And Carrey can't do schmaltzy redemption, upon which at least a third of the movie relies, to save his life.One final point - every visual aspect of this film screams Los Angeles and Southern California, even to a Brit like myself. There is not the slightest feeling that this movie is supposed to take place in northern New York State.",4,0,1,2 February 2004
The Matrix," Go see it, but *not* the best sci-fi film ever.
","A lot of people have rated it as the best movie they've ever seen. I ask all those people to start thinking of other great movies of the past, even if you restrict yourself to science fiction movies - think of the characters you fell in love with, and the performers who brought it all to life - then try to imagine some of those actors, those characters appearing in equivalent parts in The Matrix. Think of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard (from Blade Runner) as either Neo or Morpheous. Think of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley (from the Alien series). Think of the witty dialogue and excellent character interaction of writers Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams. You can think up your own examples. Then compare it to what we've actually got in The Matrix. It just doesn't stand up.Storyline: You can see that at the script stage, the concept works very well as being a marvellous 'coup de cinema', when Neo wakes up and the 'real world' is revealed for the first time. But the advance publicity told you all that before you even got to see the movie. I don't believe in picking holes in plot points, unless they rely too heavily on coincidence - it's not an easy thing to build a foolproof scenario to achieve the high concept you have for the movie. But I will say that generally in any movie you are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. In this situation, however, all I could see was that Morpheous and his friends were determined to wake the whole world up to the fact that they are living in an enormous dank sewer, under a gunmetal sky, with apparently no other living creatures or vegetation on which to survive. Or they could stay in The Matrix (what we call 'real life') and remain 'slaves'. I was with Cypher's (Joe Pantoliano) side all the way - better fake steak that's better than the real thing, than physically real but otherwise totally unappetising food which resembled some kind of edible snot.Regarding the action, I have two points to make: a) If I see one more helicopter flying alongside a glass skyscraper, so help me.... b) There is such a thing as 'too good'. I originally wrote how pathetic it was that high speed fight scenes were so obviously speed ed up film. I now know that in fact the film wasn't speed ed up, but Reeves and Fishburne were moving so fast that it looked like it was. A little slower and they'd have had ten times the impact.Here was a film where the dialogue could have done with some serious polishing by a script-doctor. Imagine, if you will, if Sean Connery had been cast as Morpheous - can you see him saying the bland dull-as-ditchwater stuff that Fishburne was trying to make so much of? No of course not, and Connery would have made sure of it by calling in his favourite script doctors (like he did for 'The Rock'). Why didn't the studio step in? Did they make a mistake and think they had the Coen brothers instead of the Wachowski brothers? There was no characterisation whatsoever - we didn't know anything more about Morpheous, Trinity or Neo at the end than we knew at the beginning. About the only fully rounded character was Cypher (which was why he got all my sympathy). Trinity's interactions with Neo, in particularly, needed to be ten times better to achieve anything like the meaning and emotional fulfilment for the audience that that relationship merited.The remainder of the cast did their best with poor material. Keanu Reeves did what he always does. I don't know what it is, but it isn't acting. Reeves is a star because he infallibly picks smash-hits to be in (Speed, The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), so they keep sending him scripts. But I cannot think of a single Keanu Reeves star-vehicle which wouldn't have been better with anybody else who just had some presence and charisma.I'd like to deal with the deficient morality of the film. It's very easy to say 'It's an action movie, so lots of bad guys will need to be killed', but 'Terminator 2' for example, is a very violent action film which has a moral sense. In 'The Matrix' not one of the bad guys are killed (they are only software constructs, after all), but lots and lots of innocent policemen and security guards are just wiped out, and, what is more, by the supposed good guys! Morpheous tries to explain this away by telling Neo to regard every human as an enemy, but this doesn't expiate the wholesale bloodbath which occurs when Neo and Trinity are just trying to get into a building. Why wasn't that sequence put together as a Kung Fu spectacular, with all the human opponents merely stunned? The last shot of that scene shows just the elevator as the doors shut on Neo and Trinity, and broken bricks and plaster and all the devastation which has just been wreaked - there is not a single dead body in the shot. This sanitised view of what constituted a totally unjustified massacre on the part of our heroes failed to make me feel better about what they had just done.I think it's easy to get carried away when a big-budget movie has an interesting and (relatively) original premise, and the visual effects do a good job of showing it off - but these factors do not make a truly satisfying film.",6,0,1,2 January 2001
Casino," Scorsese lets the Goodfellas style overwhelm any substance.
","I have not yet seen the last hour of this movie - it's sitting on a video tape at home.  But last night I sat through the first two hours, and although I wasn't bored, I was reviewing what I had seen in my mind, and frankly it didn't add up to much, really.  It was almost the same rags-to-whacking-people-to-riches-to-whacking-each-other-to-rags story of Goodfellas, without the sense of humour.More seriously, for Scorsese as a filmmaker, was the absence of any real involvement in the relationships between the characters.  Why Ace and Nicky are best friends is never really explored - all we really see between them is animosity.  Sharon Stone is a beautiful woman, but I was hoping to see something more to indicate exactly why it was Rothstein fell in love with Ginger, other than him telling us so.  The line about trust at the very start of the film is important, but never really seems to be followed up, as it is clear that not only did Rothstein not trust his wife from day one, he was never given the remotest reason to.  Ginger's obsession with riches and jewellry is demonstrated, but never explored, other than perhaps to indicate that she had no taste in jewellry!I could see absolutely no reason for this movie to be as long as it was, except that it included a lot of scenes that, made by a different director, would have ended up on the cutting room floor.  The whole sequence about the bosses getting annoyed about being skimmed from their skim, to the KC operator moaning about his expenses, to his mouthing off to his parents in the Kansas store, was an utter waste of time (and the faux-reality acting of the mother complaining about his swearing, was a major change in style which only served to jerk you out of the movie you were watching.)Scorsese made his name by handling different films with different styles, but still making them inimitably his own: Mean Streets is different from Taxi Driver, is different from Raging Bull, is different from The Color Of Money, is different from Goodfellas.  Not many directors have sustained such diversity and originality over 20 years.  But Casino lacks the originality of its predecessors, and it lacks the emotional heart which is essential to any good film.",Null,1,2,23 September 2002
Donnie Darko," I don't agree with this movie's message.
","********CONTAINS SPOILERS***********I have seen many recommendations for this movie, one from a close friend who's opinion I value, so when I saw it cheap on sale as a DVD, I bought it, thinking it was about time I gave it a go.  Well, the upshot is I don't like it.  That's not to say that I think it was a bad movie; certainly it was well written and competently acted and, give a sigh of relief, does not fall into the Hollywood mainstream.So why didn't I like it?  First of all, I think it's something to do with the style which writer/director Richard Kelly decided to do it.  FRANK, the mysterious figure of Darko's apparent hallucinations, is dressed in a rabbit suit.  This leads one to think of another famous movie with a six foot rabbit, Harvey.  Certainly from reading the synopses of this movie - something like 'The world is coming to an end and only Donnie Darko knows anything about it' - one might have thought that Donnie Darko falls into the same category as Harvey and other movies in which the protagonist sees things that other people can't and consequently appears to everybody else to be a madman.  (Blithe Spirit (1946) is another example.)  However, there is a crucial difference between Harvey and Donnie Darko.  Harvey works because the audience *believes the protagonist*.  However mad or drunk James Stewart acts, the audience knows that Harvey is real and that Stewart's behaviour is consistent.  What we see in Donnie Darko, however, is a character set up as emotionally disturbed.  He sees a mysterious character, who tells him to do things - bad things, illegal things - and Darko does them.  He's responding to the 'voices in his head', and the fact that we, the audience, also see Frank, does not alter the fact that we see Darko from our point of view as normal people do.  The consequences of these actions reveal some evil in one case and lead to tragedy in another.  At the end, however, we see Kelly resorting to what we Star Trek fans refer to as 'the rewind button', and consequently we can interpret (here comes the SPOILER) the entire movie as being a paranoid delusion of Darko's.  Apparently the tragic outcome no longer occurs, but then neither does the revelation of genuine evil in a character thought of by the locals as good.What all this amounts to is that the message of this movie appears to me to be 'Paranoid schizophrenics really *are* better off dead!' which I'm sure Kelly didn't intend.  But because of the style where what was in Darko's head was never seen outside his head, it is the unavoidable conclusion.As a general work of moviemaking, there are a number of flaws.  Although Darko and his fellow students are described by Barrymore's teacher character as apathetic and emotionally detached, I feel the script takes emotional detachment far too much to its heart.  The revelation of evil I spoke of is the discovery that Swayze's inspirational speaker is in fact a child porn merchant.  But we don't remotely see what this involved (apart from a few lines about a 'dungeon' in his house) and after the revelation we never even meet the character again.  Then again, Kitty's defense of him occurs in one scene but has no further consequences.  Kitty's character is inconsistent - she is a religiously-inclined woman who wants an innocent Graham Greene short story banned, yet she also apparently choreographed a troupe of 13-year old girls to dance in the sexiest manner possible.  Is there a connection with this, her devotion to Swayze's character, and his predilections?  It simply isn't explored.  The character of Donnie's love interest, Gretchen Ross, isn't formed fully enough for us to be able to either empathise with her or with Donnie's fascination for her.  After he asks her to 'go with him' and she says yes, she doesn't appear again until after Donnie's talk with Mrs Thurman (a long-awaited reappearance from Katharine Ross, incidentally) in which he confesses his fear of dying alone. This is a fundamental structural flaw - it's almost like Kelly forgot about her in the intervening scenes.I'm afraid that whatever concepts Kelly has of time travel indicate a woeful ignorance of the extensive literature on time travel, both by scientists and in the realm of serious science fiction, causing everything to be said by all the characters on this subject to be vapid pseudo-intellectual rubbish which didn't make the first step towards explaining the ultimate working out of the movie's plot.Supposed stylistic elements like the use of fast cutting, hand held cameras, mixed slow and fast motion, had no contribution to make to our understanding of the story or the characters, particularly Darko, and came across as a rookie director putting those things in to attract attention to himself.",Null,1,2,25 April 2004
All the President's Men," What reporters really do.
","Every now and again I see a great American movie from 20 years ago, 30 years ago, and nearly every time I say, 'They'd never make it like that nowadays.' Here we have yet another classic from the era when believe it or not the studio's first question wasn't 'How does this appeal to the 16-34 demographic?'  Nowadays movies go out of their way solely to entertain, and generally in the most mindless way possible.  This movie was from an era when they often wanted to make movies 'to *inform* and entertain.'  And in this case, their idea of entertainment was not to add needless action or sex sequences, but simply to put Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Hal Holbrook and as distinguished a set of character actors you could get playing the Washington Post staff, on the screen and just let them get on with it.By just showing exactly what it is investigative journalists do - ie make phone call after phone call, write down what they hear and then join the dots, made this movie very fascinating and informative, even if the viewer was not able to keep up with exactly who had done what and who was being accused of committing what crime.",Null,1,1,10 March 2004
