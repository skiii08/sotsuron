Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Mirror Idea of/in BORДТ
","Yes, laugh can change, more efficient than any violence! Some said that true art could save the world, and when I think of this saying, I can not imagine more appropriate work of art to show this motto in the better way.This is a film against adopted conformism in the society. It is film about world changing with fresh and new Ideas that crave to break through. This film could actually change the mentality. Nothing is more powerful than good humor. The story is reality show with a guy that is comic book character. The masquerade trick succeeds because everybody wants to know a guy who does not know how to speak English well, and whose background is poor and uneducated. The character is actually Satiric mirror, a Procrustes bed, that no one could escape the fatal judgment. Now, everybody thinks as he's less then modest appearance that he would look good in the mirror. Actually, every real life character is doing what he/she is trained by the society to do. He went to all classes, races and ages, and picture them in all of their sincerity. He pictures both 3rd world reality with parallel picturing, though well encrypted, of the 1st world reality. Reality of the 3rd world is economic crises and 1st world reality is hypocrisies. He attacks them both with one hand. His manifest, blunt and indecent, as the whole film is indecent, is marked with his pronunciation of United States of America, as leading country of today's modern world, which he maybe hold responsible for both world economic crises and domestic hypocrisies. Do not hold just to this meaning, as all sequences has so many different layers, nifty put. First layer is comical. Second is social engagement. Third is political rebellion. It has so many great and noble ideas put into it, and film itself is though saying bad and vulgar things, fighting for true virtue, as if you are seeing objects in the mirror, what is left is right, and what is right is left. Moreover, his character is total negative by which he wants to inspire something positive. Both mirror like and comical/social/rebellious like declaration and light motive of his film is, like typo, like non-intentional error, when pronouncing 'US and A'. You may imagine what he meant with 'US', but 'A',is pronounced funny. There should be put 'I' instead of 'A' to catch its meaning. 'I' means The Mirror. The Artist.True genius could think of that trick to fool all of the world, even 'US and A' movie censorship. Sasha is one of a kind. What he did with his performance art is like what Whitman did with his poetry. Both arts could be considered as 'Barbaric Yawp's of their time against silly conformism of their environment.",10,0,0,5 May 2012

","How I was surprised! I started to watch this film, with so many bad notes made upon it. Like witch hunt. I am Serb, and I had problems when go outside of my country why being a Serb. They said in the media that it is both 'a bad film' and 'Serbs are again presented bad', so I did not go to see the premiere, which I now really regret. Film is excellent, it is mine opinion.Thank you Angelina, because you did more for this region with this film, then all the politicians and movie makers from region did.Politicians never started to talk about this 'hot potato' subject, really, truthfully, yet it is of extreme importance to be talked about. Artists from all kinds waived that subject, fearing this kind of criticism that Angelina suffers. She has suffered true media mobbing, totally out of any reason and/or real arguments.Why? Because it is love story, and story about man's essence in the war. It can be watched more times then one (already did second view) because it has many layers in it. Everybody expected I do no know what. Classical war action, maybe? War atrocities? Nothing of this is brutally depicted in the film, because the film paid maximum attention to the viewer. It is gentle speaking of real truth about war in Bosnia.Not all Serbs are criminals. Who watched this film carefully, COULD HAVE seen it. Film was not about taking sides on who is guilty for war in Bosnia. It is almost Orwellian love story between two young Romeo and Juliet, who could not resist so much hate around them to develop their love.Film has a strong message: Give chance to love! Now about some solutions of Angelina: I really liked the beginning, because nothing was said about the bomb. It is really unimportant for the story. Scenario was sharp, not neglected.Lights were kept natural, because of documentary style, to tight viewer to his seat, like he is there, like the story is live and ongoing. All characters were like shaken, like half-developed, because they are half-developed, they can not show their true faces, because only war and hate are aloud to show their face. All characters are in the middle, having nowhere to go, just to obey, or to be killed, like puppets. Yet, if you look the film twice, or more carefully first time, you will see the characters.Going from America, it is as original, and as good, as no film I watched in ten years. It really moved me. Not only me, but my friends too. Yet, when film is great, and radically about something, even love, it always picks up bad critics, or suffer to be ridiculed.I hope, when time passes, and much more people watch this film carefully, people from all 3 sides will thank you.Until then, I must say my thanks first. Thank you Angelina, for this excellent film, as a man whose country was part of the conflict, and as big movie fan. I did not like much new American films, as for watching them you do not need no brains, just eyes. Your movie gives me hope for American film. There are some true artists in America, after all...",10,27,72,21 April 2012
