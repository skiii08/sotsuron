The Blair Witch Project," Boo.
","When I watched this back in 1999, it was supposed to be the dawn of a new era of horror movies, I like the Blair Witch Project, but the hype never really went anywhere did it? A mediocre sequel followed, a collection of spoofs and rip offs but no new wave of horror films. It was executed well by the production team, and the cast did a great job creating 'reality', the promotion team also deserve some kudos for making people buy the fact it was real!",Null,0,1,20 December 2002
Alien 3," Fincher Style
",Alien 3 is the third best part of the Alien saga but under the helm of David Fincher the audience gets a brilliantly dark movie. It was disappointing but what did we suspect!Weaver is reliable as ever but the support cast are not that good really!6/10,Null,0,2,20 December 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Right Place, Right Time.
","1980's Zemeckis, Lloyd and Cartoons...Is there any better combination!?!In a time where Zemeckis could do no wrong, Christopher Lloyd was good and Bob Hoskins was for some reason becoming a MEGA-Star...they made 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'What else do I need to say?This film was made right on time, you could almost say it's a kind of farewell to the traditional cartoon (yes, yes the Disney films etc...), because ten years later Computers would take control!!! I know there were other successful 2-d movies after W.F.R.R but this film had so many characters of old regardless to who they belonged to in the 1940's. The film is very much what you see is what you get, it's crude in places now but still a movie I can watch time and time again!Joel Silver was great aswell!",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Alien: Resurrection," I'm Sorry But Ryder's Hot!!!
","Will there be a Alien 5? This film doesn't help anyone's efforts to push for a fifth movie. They got there main star in Weaver to re-appear as Ripley, they got a great visionary director in Jeunet. They got an actress who at that point was still a huge star that couldn't do that much wrong (well you know what I mean!).But none of that counted for me because in my opinion this film sucked!Miss Ryder...I Forgive You",Null,0,0,20 December 2002
Alien," (Dubbed) AAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!
","Star Wars for grown ups? Oh no it's completely different! This is a chilling suspence thriller all the way!A bunch of astronauts on there way home to earth...they get a distress call...they don not ignore the call, and they embark on some visitors of the 'Oh my God NOOOOOOOOO! Argggghhhh!' kind!Maybe Ridley Scotts finest 116 minutes!",Null,0,1,20 December 2002
American Pie," Hmmm Got Get Me Some Pie
","American Pie is a funny film, the fact is that most people that see it some how try associate themselves to the character with cries of...'That is so me!'Half the time its not, but that doesnt matter!Jason Biggs is good as Jim, the shy kid on his mission to 'do' Nadia (Molly Shannon). Sean William Scott is the other notible performance as Stifler.The others however are wooden too much of the time!",Null,1,1,20 December 2002
Aliens," Damn These Guys Are Ugly
","When one of the tag lines suggests that....'THE ALIEN HAS BRED...' ...How do you respond to that!Aliens is a brilliant follow up to the brilliant Alien, but I think Aliens just beats Alien in being better entertainment.I'd be worried if I got onto any kind of transportation to see Sigourney Weaver get onto! Can anyone be so unlucky!?!THIS TIME IT'S MORE!",Null,0,2,20 December 2002
1941," It Wasn't THAT Bad
","Spielberg doesn't make appauling movies, he just can't, it's not in his gene! 1941 came close, critics hated it, Spielberg hated it, I liked it. It's no where near close to a great film, but for what it is, its a amusing look on paranoier in the USA after the PEARL HARBOR attack, alas it would be many years before they'd even talk about an equilivant to 9/11 (Dont get me started on that issue!)",Null,1,2,20 December 2002
