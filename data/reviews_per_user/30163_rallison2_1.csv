The New World," Time well spent
","In this day an age of rush, rush, rush, it is nice to see a movie that takes it's time to tell the story. The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is told fairly close to fact. The times are gritty and the story is appropriately so. Give this movie time and you will not be disappointed. The dialog is minimal but the story clearly develops it's absence. The performances are strong, but I do wish a bit more had been explained. I did have to return home and look a few things up and was more than a bit surprised to see how factual this was as it flies a bit in the face of what we were 'taught' in school. I hope the movie-going public will give this film a chance as it looked stunning in previews and did not disappoint.",9,7,15,20 January 2006
