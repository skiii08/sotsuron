The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I get people why don't like this movie
","I've read the book, i know what is going happen and it was perfectly adapted into this film. People expected to see some good civil war action but that is not the story. It's about the back story of a civil war. Katniss isn't a front-line soldier to fight with her bow's blazing. She is a girl, she got pushed around by politicians, she doesn't want to a part of any of this. The acting is very good, specially Lawrence, Sutherland and Harrelson. Peeta is still annoying, just like in the other movies. The book was written by a women where a girl is main character and written in first person. Of course there is a love triangle. It was bad in the novel, bad in the movie. But it is good political thriller, very different from the previous film, excited to see the next.",9,15,46,24 November 2014
