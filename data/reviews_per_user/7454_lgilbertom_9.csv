The Ring," The Ring, a Urban legend. (Little Spoilers)
","The ring is a mix of the terror and suspense. The story remember a urban legend, a reporter played by (Naomi Watts) discover thats some strange in the death of her niece. This fact is connected with a video-tape, she find that anyone that watch this video, die in seven days. The reporter and her 'friend', try to dig the whole thing before that their time fade out. Some facts are reveled: the origin of that video, the explanation (more or less) of the deaths. However, there are some pieces in the story that remains untouched. Don't expect a typical happy end, in this movie. This simple basic plot, give a birth of a very good movie. The story is plenty of suspense and the terror is psychologic. Anyone that love terror and suspense will love this movie.",8,1,1,22 February 2003
Minority Report," could be an excellent movie
","SPOILER Minority Report, could be an excellent movie. Ok, this movie has a great plot and the actors make your job very well, and in the beginning and the middle of this movie works well. However, close to the end some logical mistakes are made in the movie. Just an example, would be very easy to prove that John Anderton don't kill Danny Witwer. First, Agatha will can testify the innocence of Anderton, second the gun used to kill Danny was left to Anderton in the place of the first 'crime' and the pre-crime police officers known that. Also, was easy for Anderton's wife infiltrate in the place that in principle should be a security installation. For this reason, a cast 7 for this movie.",5,1,2,6 August 2002
We Were Soldiers," A good war movie
","This movie was one the best war movies that i saw recently. Has a solid plot don't show the Vietcongs something like a demon but just people that fight for their believes just like the Americans. We were Soldiers has also a great supporting cast and good performances of Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot. All right, always that i saw Elliot i think 'yes sergeant', this man looks like a sergeant. This is a good movie but has some flaws so i give 7/10.",7,4,7,2 January 2004
"I, Robot"," A good movie but don't match with Asimov vision.
","*** Minor Spoilers ***Will Smith play Spooner a cop that investigate an apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning. Spooner is a Robot hater, because of something in his past. He think that a Robot kill Lanning, but no one believes because of three laws. In his investigation he find Sonny a very peculiar Robot. When he find Sonny this robot is a key to uncover a kind of conspiracy.I, Robot is a good movie but i read Asimov since that i have 13 years old and this movie don't fit in Isaac Asimov vision. I all his books was very difficult a robot make some harm to a human being. Normally, when a unusually robot was 'create' or discovered is a human that try to make harm. The logical defend by Vikki in this movie was negated by some Asimov books.
So this movie is good but only take a few thinks of Asimov ideas and he deserve a movie just like Blade Runner was to Phillip K. Dick.",7,0,0,12 August 2004
Resident Evil," Good movie
","My comments there isn't exactly SPOILLERS but you was advised.
The basic plot-line is a great corporation has been developed a new virus and an 'accident' occurs and the virus is free. The computer to avoid the virus spread, kill everyone in the base and there are only two survivors. A elite team is send to the installation and verify 'what a hell is going on' and switch off the computer (because the computer kill everyone in the base of course). Well, the problems started because the computer dislike of the idea to be switch off, but this is only the beginning. The tone of the movie is Gothic and a little creepy and has a touch of 'matrix'. I explain, there is a sequence where the character of the Milla Jovovich kill some 'DOGS' and a normal person NEVER does this things.These comments are enough to get a good idea of the movie, the actors works well, specially Milla, the special effects are very good. The some actions scenes are fast and brutal others has a creepy tone but are well worked. Ok, the script could be a little more elaborate but is good enough for this kind of movie. But there is an important thing, the end of movie is consistent with the basic background of the movie.In my opinion if you see this movie you will have a good time :).",7,0,0,16 August 2002
The Transporter," Disappointing
","I expect much more of this movie, when star to see i think: Cool. However, very fast the movie become a mess. The plot could be interesting but with exception of initial one, there isn't fun in this movie. Really i don't understand what going wrong but the fact is the movie doesn't work. For me see this movie was very disappointing.",5,0,0,26 May 2003
Signs," It's a good suspense movie (minor spoilers)
","Signs is a good suspense movie, with good performances of the Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The basic plotline is Gibson a man that lost his wife and faith, one day found strange circles in his farm. His first clue, is some guys was responsible for this strange marks. However, the true is very different, aliens are responsible for this marks and prepare an invasion. This fact will be affect very deeply the life of Graham's family.This movie is basically about fear and lost, the suspense is a little impaired, because the aliens are shown explicit and clear in the middle of the movie. In my opinion, there are some aspects in the movie that are little artificial (About aliens and water), but this is a minor flaw. My general impression, is that Signs is a good movie, with a good story a solid performances of Phoenix and Gibson.",8,2,3,24 September 2002
Identity," This underated movie is a solid entertainment
","************** Spoilers ******************************The movie justify perfectly his name Identity. Identity began with a strange car accident. The former detective and driver Ed (John Cusak) was responsible for this 'accident' and try to help Alice York. Alice is married with a strange husband (George York ) and more strange boy Timmy York. After some attempts, trying to find a doctor, all they finish in a strange motel (This motel was building in a older cemetary). One by one, all characters a are trapped in this place including weird manager Larry. Ed was transport a actress Caroline Suzzane (Rebecca De Mornay), latter arrive the detective Rhodes (Ray Liotta), who is transporting the prisoner Robert Maine that is a murder. Also come to this place, the prostitute Paris (Amanda Peet), who is traveling alone when her car broke. Finally, arrive the young just married couple Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott).

It's something hard to explain but is very intriguer, and so solve the true is almost impossible to find the solution without a clue. I almost find the murder because his actions are very suspicious his look is very strange, but i suspect of the boy for wrong reasons. Because I believed that this movie, was a sobrenatural film. When i realize this not a sobrenatural movie i discarded the boy as suspect. This movie is very very good, i give a 8 in IMDB but i believe that deserve a 8,5.",8,0,1,18 July 2004
X2: X-Men United," Still is a good movie (Some Spoilers)
","Some Spoilers ---The X2 has a very interesting beginning when Nightcrawler try to kill the President of the USA. This sequence is amazing, but other sequences are nice too, like the invasion of the Xavier's Mansion. However, the following sequences don't have the same impact that the initial ones. How i expect, the attempt to kill the president was plot by Striker with the single objective to exterminate all mutants. As usually, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great in his performances but the good surprise is Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler). I have disappointed with manage giving to Cyclops, in the comic books he is a leader but in the movie he is almost a character could be dispense. This is going on since first movie and i had a hope that in this movie Cyclops could be better. Unfortunately this don't happen, i doubt, but maybe in the next movie...",7,0,0,13 May 2003
