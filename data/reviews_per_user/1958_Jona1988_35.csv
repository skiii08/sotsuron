Whip It," Extremely predictable but still entertaining
","It doesn't take long into Whip It until one knows pretty much how the story will turn out in the end. The story is one that has been told many many times before. The conflict between mother and daughter, bad team that manages to become the best and so on. Still I enjoyed this film so perhaps this kind of plot type hasn't been done to many times yet and not yet with roller derby theme at least. Actually there was maybe one thing that I didn't see coming but it still is not enough to make Whip It it's own kind, definitely not, sadly. This is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut and she has done a very good job. So even though the plot is very simple it is executed greatly. The scenes are brilliantly done both how directed and acted. Ellen Page is great and perfect in the lead roll as the cute shy girl. All the acting is so well performed that one doesn't care that much that some of the stuff is pretty silly overly emotional and way to sweet. There are some scenes were the acting is so hyperactive but still one feels the overacting is meant to be so and not that it's badly done. The music which is a bunch of popular songs by various artists is well chosen for the feel of the film. Even if I get the feeling that the script is kind of thin the characters are really good, which is probably thanks to the good acting. Of course Ellen Page is the one who shines and not just because she is in the main role. The whole tone of the film is kind of hyper but they also manage to create a sense of substance thanks to the strong feeling the viewer gets for the heroine. The humor works well with some really great hints to some classic films that everybody knows. Still I feel the humor doesn't take such a big place, but that is fine because if it had it would risk to take focus away from the other important positive aspects. Whip It is a simple, foreseeable but somewhat funny movie. But I'm not disappointed because for me it didn't seem like a film to have very big expectations on just simple entertainment. After reading some other reviews I found that it had received very positive verdicts but I felt they were a bit overrated, it is good but not that good. Whip It is a fun feel good comedy, worth seeing 6/10.",6,1,5,16 December 2010
Blade Runner 2049," Does the original justice but also dares to be more than just a rehash
","Blade Runner is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It may be my favourite ever actually. So, when after years of rumours it was confirmed that a sequel was too be made I was mostly sceptical. Long overdue sequels fail more often. For every Mad Max: fury road there are a lot more Indiana Jones 4 or ones that fall somewhere in between like Prometheus. When it was announced that Ridley Scott would not return as director some fans probably reacted disappointed, but I was actually positive. If he had really wanted to make a sequel he would have made it earlier. Denis Villeneuve was an excellent choice to take the reins. Prisoners and Sicario were great and I mostly enjoyed Enemy. Then the release of Arrival just made me more confident. I happy to say that Blade Runner 2049 managed to more than live up to the amazing original. What is so great about this new movie is that it does the first one justice while it dares to be more than just a repeat. The story, characters and even the look of the film differs quite a bit from the original. A new filmmaker doing a sequel to a classic might feel pressure to just try and imitate the original creators. But having seen other movies by Villeneuve one sees clearly that he has made the movie like he wanted and not tried to make a Ridley Scott film. I think that even if one did not know you could see that the two movies are made by different filmmakers. The plot is excellent and has the same types of themes as the first one, such as questions of humanity. But the actual story is of a different type than the original. It takes quite a number of twists and it turned out not at all like I had thought it would be. Compared to the first movie this one actually has more plot. The movie has many big actors and they all do great some even with kind of limited screen time. Ryan Gosling is great in the lead. You really feel for his character. Also he is not simply Deckard version 2. Ana de Armas performance deserves mentioning. Everyone knows Harrison Ford is in the movie it's no spoiler. His performance is great and especially it doesn't feel like he's just in the movie for fan pleasing. He seems to put more effort in this role than he has in a long time. The last couple of movies he has felt like he would rather retire. He also doesn't just play Deckard like before but he plays Deckard thirty years later. Things have happened since we saw him last. Enough cannot be said about cinematographer Roger Deakins and his role in the creation of the experience that is this movie. It looks amazing and also amazing in that it's a continuation of the world we saw in the first but still not the same thing again. They have put great detail and thought into the technology in the world. They have really focused on the continuity that the world really feels like the world we saw in the original but thirty years later. I'm so relived that the movie also does not get bogged down in references and call-backs to the original. This movie creates memorable moments of its own not simply by reminding you of all that was great in the first one. I heard there was some problem regarding the composing of the music but none of it shows in the finished movie. Hans Zimmer has created a brilliant score that has the same feel and style as Vangelis but without just reusing his melodies. Some have complained about the length of the movie but that was never an issue for me. There are parts that slow down but I can't see how they could have cut it down without losing stuff and making stuff feel rushed. But some modern audience not familiar with the first one might very likely be bored. This movie is made by people who liked the first one for people who loved the first one. I have already seen it more than once and like the first one it really benefits from more viewings. There is so much more in this movie than meets the eye.OK so finally which movie is the best? Like I've repeatedly stated the movie separated itself form the original enough to be judged just on its own. But if I must choose then the original is still the best. Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels I have seen. It lives up to the original Blade Runner while somehow managing the feet of feeling like an amazing movie just on its own.",10,6,13,25 November 2017
Black Swan," What a performance!!
","I haven't seen any other film by Darren Aronofsky so maybe I didn't know exactly what to expect. Still my expectations were very high, having heard much praise for it. I was not the least disappointed but also very impressed.If one thinks this is a movie about ballet well it's not. The story starts out with kind of straight forward events but it soon starts getting more and more deep and unpredictable. I'm soon at full focus, the film really grips one to attention. I feel I for a long time had little idea what twists the plot would take. What is impressive at the same time is that even tough is gets deeper I never lose any track of the ongoing story. There are some plot points that I feel I have seen done before but this is no problem. Totally original plots are long getting rare. Natalie Portman has been the subject of much of the praise for Black Swan and it's definitely not without reason because she is just great. At first she plays the kind of innocent girl like she often does and does well but as the story gets more scatter-brained her performance turns into her part of her life. But it's not just she who shines in Black Swan, they all make close to outstanding acting. Vincent Cassel is brilliantly disturbing interesting character. Barbara Hershey brilliantly creates the mother which the viewer feels both sentimental for and frustrated at. Mila Kunis I did not expect as much from but she is great and I feel actually competes with Portman for the spotlight here. The depth and focus of the story lies in the psychological aspects that are really tough and at times almost to the level of disturbing. The story is both gripping and smartly told, I feel one should and most likely wants to see this more that once. Might get hold of exactly how everything was and one might as well notice thing you didn't grasp at first. And then is the dialogue which is likewise well done. Both because the actors deliver it so well but it in itself is great, impressive writing. Black Swan is a great movie both on the inside and on the outside. The story brilliantly tries to mess with your head and the visual design and acting is a pleasure to watch. The music perfectly fits to give the right tone of the film. After the film was over I wanted to analyse it with others. The story is deep and interesting that one might even feel the need to kind of resolve how some things were. Sometimes I can get annoyed at movies that leave things to the viewers interpretation. At times the writer can seem lazy. Here this is not a bad thing as in here I feel this is the feeling Darren Aronofsky wants to give. The plot is exciting and maybe even provoking but never frustratingly so.Black Swan is one of the best movies of 2010. A thrilling psychological thriller.",8,1,3,8 March 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Action pleasure!
","The first Mission: Impossible was pretty enjoyable in my opinion, not great I thought but good entertaining action thriller worth more than one screening. I've never seen the TV-show so the plot was very different. I liked the first movie my but my reaction to John Woo's sequel was not quite so well. Number two was so crappy in every way apart for the entertaining action. There was almost no plot just a slap in the face of everyone who thought the first one had an interesting story. Action movies seldom have amazing stories and MI2 was to stupid even for an action movie. It is interesting how with Mission: Impossible 3 they managed to take a bit from both previous movies and make the best one yet. The plot in the first movie was pretty complex, maybe a bit too much and the plot in number two was to simple. This manages to place itself in the middle. No award winning writing but perfectly enough for this kind of movie. Tom Cruise is great and his character has some depth and development in this. Ethan Hunt feels more like a human than a superhero this time. This film contains quite a few characters of importance to the plot. There are several big names in this. Fishburne and Pegg are great additions. Michelle Monaghan actually has a character unlike the female in the second movie who seemed to be there only to be eye candy. The villain this time Philip Seymour Hoffman is a major improvement and by far the best bad guy in the series. It's not his scheme but the performance that makes his character intimidating. With his cool voice and serious appearance unlike the ridiculous villain in the previous movie. The action scenes have been toned down in this but in no way making them less entertaining quite the opposite actually. John Woo does cool action but this is much more satisfying. MI3 does feel like a step towards 007 kind of spy movie. No problem in that for me at least.Final summary Mission: Impossible 3 is a greatly entertaining but mindless action pleasure. Style over substance definitely but a good one of those.",7,1,2,15 January 2012
Iron Man 2," A big letdown
","Some quick thoughts on one of the movies I was looking most forward to this year. I loved the first Iron Man movie, but I found the sequel massively disappointing.The main problem is the story. It's must be described as a mess. It has the same problem as Spider-man 3 containing way to many characters with different plot lines making the story crowded. But also is the fact that simply none of the plot lines are interesting and it all feels so thin. Superhero movie aren't expected to have any award winning writing but if I compare to the first Iron Man this is shockingly weak. I mean this is directed by the guy who did the first one. Iron Man 2 has this lack of effort feel to it. The action scenes feel likewise. Would not say bad just dull and rushed. The acting also is so and so. The returning ones are great but the new ones not so much. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell do OK i guess but their characters are just badly written. Far from their best performances. And the character Black Widow just feels shoehorned into the plot. I can't blame Scarlett Johansson for how bad I felt her character was. Another problem I want to mention is that the film contains a lot more and actually to much humor compared to the first movie. There should be jokes but here I feel they step over the line from funny to silly. This highly anticipated superhero sequel ends up as a rushed, uninspired and way to childish action-comedy.",5,10,23,30 April 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Fun ridiculous entertaining
","I really, really like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's films. I loved Hot Fuzz the first time i saw it, not as good second time but still. I had heard from many that Shaun of the Dead is actually even better and after finally seeing it I can say I agree. Not just better, Shaun of the dead is one of the best comedies I have seen in quite some time. It's both very smart done and brilliantly funny. It perfectly knows what to put the focus on. The story is nothing that really matters much, there is one but it serves only the purpose of holding it together. Still one never gets the feeling that it is to thin, because you quickly into it get the picture that the story is not what will hold this up. I love the kind of humor this film has but it's not jokes and that kind of fun. An example when some are sitting talking and all seems normal but then the camera slightly turns. Much of the humor works kind of like that first everything is normal and then quickly something unexpected and funny is revealed. Sometimes music is used brilliantly funny in the same way. The film is violent but not as much as Hot Fuzz where I felt it became a bit overdrawn. Here it's used just enough. Like the story it's always over the top, unrealistic and extremely funny to watch. Impressive how great characters they managed to create, this being a comedy and not that long. Shaun of the Dead is not just a comedy like others, well of course somethings are but this movie just makes every aspect massively better than the usual stuff. Just lean back and be just as entertained as impressed. Shaun of the Dead is brilliant and a pleasure to see.",7,0,2,19 March 2011
Public Enemies," What should have been thrilling is boring
",Michael Mann has made some really great movies. Heat and Collateral are amazing. But he has made some weaker ones as well. Unfortunately Public Enemies belongs to his weaker. I had high hopes for this when it was upcoming. The poster of Johnny Depp clad in a trench coat and fedora hat and holding a Tommy Gun looked so cool. I imagined this as being like Heat but set in the 1930s. In several ways the setup is kind of similar. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale two actors at top of their game felt perfect as the leads. The criminal vs. detective thriller with both being the main character. Unfortunately it fails in all the things that Heat did so brilliantly. I've seen Public Enemies again after my first disappointed reaction but even when I tried to ignore my expectations on the director being Michael Mann and not to compare it to Heat Public Enemies is still a dull movie. The movie looks stunning I feel they have totally succeeded in recreating the 1930s Depression-era USA. But while the outside looks great it is on the inside that it is lacking. The story that is based on reality is actually a good one but the movie somehow still makes it feel uninteresting and completely devoid of any real substance . A major problem for the story is that we never feel anything for the characters. The actors do well overall but the writing is the problem also here. Johnny Depp fits well as John Dillinger. He looks the part and I can't say anything bad about his acting. It's just that his character lacks any real personality. I feel it's not really clear how the viewer should relate to Dillinger should we root for or against him. And this can be said about all characters in the movie there is no substance or development for any of them. I could not care less relation between Dillinger and Marion Cotillard's character. Christian Bale does well with what he's got but his character is less the focus of the story than Depp's. However I do feel that his attempts at an accent is very inconsistent. Unfortunate is that the action is just as bland as the rest of the movie. Michael Mann can or could direct tense edge of your seat action scenes. But the gun fights here are short and stale. It's just men shooting at each other but there is nothing creative about the action scenes. I'm not expecting these massive action set pieces and I know it's based on true events which seldom are as exciting as we like to see on screen. That doesn't matter. I think of Mann's Collateral which no is not based on reality but my point is that a skilled director can create thrill and suspense without that much spectacular action happening. Public Enemies is a well made movie only technically but lacking creatively. What should have been thrilling is boring. Actors struggling due to lack of characterisation. In the end this is not really a bad movie but it's not good either. Disappointing and forgettable I am sad to conclude.,6,2,2,12 December 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Perhaps the best video game movie I've ever seen.
","I had absolutely zero expectations on this film, knowing it based on a video game. Still the films crew such as director, actors and producer made me think this could be something more than the standard low budget B-movie video games usually evolved into. And I found it a mostly entertaining 2h. Sure the plot lacks any ounce of substance, loosely based on the games even thiner story. The part in the beginning is an smart hint to modern day politics. Character development is none. The actors are alright so I think the script is to blame, though I must point out that there is absolutely no emotion between Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton. Sir Ben Kingsley works alright as the villain. The humor really falls flat, except for Alfred Molina who steals the show every scene his in. However it at least succeeds somewhat in the action department. The action scenes are good fun even though some were a a bit to fast to understand what was going on. The violence is quite soft but it didn't bother me. The film recreates the games parkour action quite well, though they should have used it more. One scene were a character tells the prince he must open a door to let some soldiers in made me smile and think this is level one of a video game. However I don't think this will turn in to another blockbuster franchise for Jerry Bruckheimer. This will not be another Pirates of the Caribbean.Stupid but entertaining non the less. The flaws are many, far more the the good. Still this is the most entertaining and well made video game movie I've seen. 5/10 Hopefully one step further to finally a good video game adaptation.",5,2,5,30 May 2010
Taxi Driver," A masterpiece! nothing less!
","I'm a bit late. It took many years until I finally got around to seeing this film. I already knew it was a classic and folks I knew told me how brilliant it was. I had wanted to see it for along time but when preparing to watch it I still tried to keep my expectations on an moderate level fearing that it would feel overrated or old. After seeing it I was just like why did I worry? Taxi Driver is perfect.First the film has aged extremely well. Sure you can see it's been several years but thats not a disadvantage, quite the opposite actually. The look is just perfect to get the right feel of when it is set. The style of the scenes are brilliant and the way the filming is done is just as brilliant. Soundtrack well chosen to set the feel. Some may think it's a slow movie but it is not. The pace at which the story is told is perfectly chosen. Travis Bickle must be one of the most gripping characters ever. Even though the film is under 2h one gets so close to him I really feel the loneliness that drives him to desperation. Is Robert De Niro's portrayal one of the best performances ever? I would say yes, You talking' to me? The other actors are also brilliant, Jodie Foster is incredible. Amazing supporting performances make every character just as important as the story does. The character development is the central thing driving this film. Don't mistake this for an action film because it's not. A very disturbing film but the reasons lie much deeper than visual brutality. The story slowly builds up to something which one might have an idea of what is. Still I sit at total attention to see what will happen next. The ending shootout must be one of the strongest endings I have ever seen. Sad but still hopeful. Short but in a intense way. The way the camera zooms over the scene when the fight is over, genius. The speech from the thank you letter, very emotionally sad. The ending is kind of open to analysis, works great sometimes I can find it frustrating with open endings. Not here, I immediately thought out what I think happened. Someone said it's the kind of movie you watch once, good but not to see many times. I do absolutely NOT agree. Right after the ending I wanted to see it again and again.Taxi Driver is strong, disturbing, thought provoking, sad, interesting and important. It is all here. Martin Scorsese's definitive masterpiece and Robert De Niro best performance. Taxi Driver holds up still today just as incredible as it has always been. One of the greatest ever! 10/10",9,0,0,22 January 2011
Shutter Island," In the end a good story but still flawed film.
","With names like Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio in the credits I felt like this could and should be a great film. And the beginning of Shutter Island immediately put my hopes up even higher. It set the tone of a crime thriller set some time ago. But after a while I began feeling somewhat uncertain about it. The film continues slow and doesn't really take off. The tone given by the atmosphere and music manage well the sense of mystery but still I don't sit at the edge as one would have thought. Suspense is something that is totally lacking in this film. A lot of dialogue and the story moves forward so things are happening but it still doesn't really capture my attention in the way one had hoped and thought it would. The acting is good but I somehow feel Leonardo DiCaprio isn't perfect in the lead, nothing wrong with his performance but he doesn't fit the character. The actors who really steal the show are Sir Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, they are simply brilliant in all their scenes. However I feel the characters in this film are a bit wooden and hard to relate with. That the viewer doesn't feel much for the characters is a big weakness for a film. But the acting and directing is good so maybe the script is to blame. This brings me to the dialogue which at some parts feel pretty poor and some things that the characters say seem really awkward. The film gets better towards the end when some more interesting things start to happen. There are some strange twists and gets somewhat hard to keep up. The ending resolves some of the things that were set up but also asks some new questions which are left to the viewer to figure out how hold together. But this isn't a bad thing absolutely not, I felt the movie lifts at the end to become alright entertainment. Some surprising twist takes the plot away from any thriller type movie.The plot is in the end pretty good and entertaining. I have not read the book. But the execution could definitively have been better. The film is presented as a mystery thriller but it lacks any real suspense, other problems include character development and very repetitive music and sound effects. Shutter Island turns out to be quite empty of substance. Good but not that good, I had expected more. Shutter Island is an entertaining film but sadly it's nothing more than just alright.",7,0,1,4 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Just a good movie
","Let me start by getting one thing clear, Captain America is not a bad film. Just a major let down at least for me. It is actually quite alright movie overall but that is overshadowed by the disappointment streaming from because of what it could have been. It felt like it could and even would succeed in being more than just the average Marvel superhero movie. The trailers seemed really promising but after having seen the whole film one realises that there was nothing more than what was shown in the trailers and also stuff looked like being great turns out to be not quite so much. The set up is practically the usual becoming a true hero idea but still gets some fresh feel being set during WWII which I feel is not just a set piece and works fine. Even with the serious tone it sets there are some standard superhero silly stuff but never that it takes the overhand, it works quite alright. The tone, settings and old fashioned war music are the good parts of this. But sadly the lesser good parts seem to weigh over. The action which not seldom are the central parts of superhero movies feel really weak. Some critics have pointed out and enjoyed the kind of old time fight scenes, comparing them to Indiana Jones. OK they are old styled but that doesn't automatically make it great. The problems are a total lack of suspense or thrills, one never ever gets any feeling of excitement of what will happen and what cap will do next. Yes I know he is the hero and can't be really defeated but still one can create interest in action scenes involving those also. The cast is kind of good. Tommy Lee Jones is best not surprisingly. But Chris Evans just does not quite catch it, he looks cool once he's become Cap but the charm and substance in the performance to create any real relation between him and the audience is missing. When one is supposed the feel some sympathy or whatever I just give it a shrug of the shoulders. Red Skull is another failure. He seems to just fill the role that a hero needs a enemy. Hugo Weaving doesn't do a bad performance the problem is rather the directing or script. A villain in this kind of film is not scary but Red Skull is neither interesting, he is just there because he must. He is doing some evil stuff but at the end I've just forgotten what it was and why. A weak bad guy doesn't really create any thrill for the good guys fight against him. The rest of the minor roles are however perfectly alright, Hayley Atwell, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci all very good. None of the Joe Johnston movies have had much of character development. I was worried when I first heard he was making Captain America. So I understand almost all I've pointed out here is negative but the thing is that the movie was such a disappointment and could definitely have been better. It's a alright movie but nothing more. It's better than THOR but my anticipation for The Avengers has declined again, which began with Iron Man 2. Not a bad movie but nothing more than just a good one, 6/10.",6,0,2,29 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Satisfying and well simply great!
","Maybe the film company felt that by splitting the book into two movies they could make twice as much cash. But after seeing Part 1 I feel that even if money was the motive it was the right choice for the quality also. I was very satisfied with the film.The seventh book was a great ending to a brilliant series. However if one splits it on the middle I think the first half is considerably weaker. The infamous camping parts where the book really started to drag. So one could expect the adaptation of the first part to feel a bit slower also. But I was positively surprised by how well they have succeeded, the film is not just very good on it's own but might even stand out as one of the better in the series. The series has gotten more and more mature for each film. Not just the tone and violence but also the characters, their emotions and such. It's great fun to see how the characters grow and the relations between them develop. It all works brilliant. I think the films have done well in capturing the feel of the characters form the books and in this film you get to follow them even closer. All the actors make a great performance. New additions to the cast Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans are good and suit there roles fine. The tone of the film is pretty gray and sad like the story, but they have done it well to get the right feel without making it dull and empty. The film stays on track and keeps the right tone all the way. Doesn't add any unnecessary jokes and no cheesy scenes or dialogue which has happened in previous films. No attempts to make the film both mature and childish, something one could fear they would try. The action scenes in the Harry Potter films has never been the strong point. The characters and story is still the best but the action has gotten better and this is without doubt the best yet. Thanks to being split in two the story telling is much more detailed and done in a more graspable pace. The story has gotten more complicated but I feel it's easier to follow whats going on here than in Prisoner of Azkaban. I can't imagine how the story could be told in a good way in just one film, doing it like this was the best way.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a superb film that greatly lives up to my expectations. All aspects of it are really well done, story telling, character development, depth and emotion, even great action. Looking forward to part 2 which I feel has all the capacity, meaning even more thrilling plot to be even better!",8,0,0,13 December 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Great movie that more than well lives up to the book!
","I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(Män som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, and it's good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he plays the role really down to earth, the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsgård. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore. Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie, even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense, necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it. So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en. If I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie, definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great as a thriller on it's own.",8,155,250,22 December 2011
Being John Malkovich," Great weird film!
","Being John Malkovich is really a one in a kind, never seen anything quite like it. But there are many strange films out there and that a film is different doesn't necessarily make it a good one. Being John Malkovich is very strange but it is also just as good.The story is like completely insane but manages to keep getting more and more interesting the longer it goes. Never knowing what is to come next. The plot is exciting at all time but what I found a strong point was the characters. All the actors are great in creating characters as unpredictable as the rest of the movie. I feel there is no one that is really a good guy and neither a big bad one. Not a bad thing like many movies with characters one can't relate too, because here the roles have such substance an the interest for seeing what will happen and what move they make next keeps me on the edge of my seat at all time. Eventough this is a film that interest in all it's weirdness I feel that is more a character driven picture. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are so greatly unpredictable, hard to fully get a hold of and Catherine Keener is really disturbing but in a good way for the film. John Malkovich himself is great in making himself feel even more awkward than the audience about what is going on, he is funny and one even comes to get some kind of bond to him. Brilliant dark comedy, it is funny and interesting in all it's weirdness and disturbing, sad and will somewhat mess with your head specially the psychological aspects delivered by the characters. Unlike many weird films Being John Malkovich manages to deliver much more than just awkwardness. Charlie Kaufman delivers a script unlike anything else and director Spike Jonze with amazing performances form the cast creates a completely unique film. Everybody needs to experience Being John Malkovich.",8,1,3,9 February 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Some laughs but nothing more
","It takes under a minute until you know what kind of movie this is going to be, some sort of slapstick comedy. It's not a bad thing, not at all and it started quite funny. An impressive number of stars in this film. George Clooney is the one that really stands out, and Ewan McGregor is also good. Of course they are the leads so they are the ones you see most but I feel the rest of the well known actors are just alright and nothing special. Their seriousness combined with the movies silly tone works well. But about half ways in I get the feeling it's starting to drag. Some funny bits appear now and then but the plot is just blank. Sure there is a story but it's neither interesting or even really funny. One gets the feeling it's just there to connect a bunch of jokes together. The movie has minimal action so if anyone thinks it's a war film then it's not, the war parts are nothing more than a set piece. Soon one realises that jokes can't carry the movie as a whole. Like I wrote earlier about half ways my concentration begins to dip, I stop caring where the plot is heading. When it ends I shrug my shoulders and nothing more. Not a bad 90 min but neither that good either. Sure slapstick comedies seldom, maybe never have any really substance but this film had absolutely nothing underneath. Because there is no real character development I don't care much for the ending. Not that there is something particularly wrong at the end but it just feels like nothing. That several things make no sense I've long stopped thinking about, but I suppose one can't expect that from a comedy. My reaction leans to the negative. A bit disappointed sadly. I figure I was expecting something more from this. It's not a very bad movie but it's not good either. If you see it you sure will feel it's an somewhat enjoyable 90 min. But my verdict is no more than 5/10.",5,1,4,8 September 2010
Bridesmaids," Good humor and also some heart
","The Hangover with women instead? The answer is both yes and no. I seem to be one of few who were kind of cool towards the Hangover, sure it was good entertainment but nothing special and there are much better recent comedies out there. Or maybe it is because comedy is no longer any of my favourite movie types.But now for the somewhat surprise after this gray introduction: I really liked Bridesmaids. It was great fun all the way through and to my positive surprise it isn't just a bunch of jokes strung together by a simple plot that serves no other purpose. Bridesmaids also has a story that feels worth following. I would categorise Bridesmaids as a drama comedy. That is I think one of the main reasons I liked it. There are both parts of laughter and wanting to see what happens next. OK so the story is good but it's not great. At the time of writing this review the movie has been nominated for best original screenplay. According to me it is not that good but I don't know all the competition. At the start I stated that it still is somewhat like The Hangover and that would be the funny parts. The humor feel the same kind with awkward situations and serious acting in pretty absurd happenings. Works mostly great. And so the acting? It is most of the time good. It is the kind of forced dialogue and over the top behavior. But I don't mean it in a bad way it is how it should be for this kind of comedy. Kristen Wiig fits well in the lead and manages well to create the character the viewers care for even if you don't entirely sympathize with. Rose Byrne is just as good as the rival. But the performance that stands out enough to take the spotlight ever time she appears on screen is Melissa McCarthy. The audience laughed at every thing she said, well almost. Her character and her acting was perfectly humorous. Still does she deserve a best supporting actress nomination? I'm not sure but it is true that funny movies seldom get the attention of the big ceremonies like the academy awards so maybe it just feels strange. I don't think I have that much more to say about Bridesmaids.It is a very good comedy, not great but it might be the funniest I saw the previous year. The fun stuff is great and it still doesn't get stuck and start going on routine. Thankfully the movie also has some emotional substance coming from a well written story. Bridesmaids is a movie that absolutely deserves to be seen and then one will want to see it again. My grade 7/10.",7,2,4,3 February 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Best MI movie by far!
","Yes! like my title of this review states this is the best movie in the Mission Impossible series so far. So far because by the success of this I can imagine the producers are eager to make a fifth one. And the success this has been at the box office is well deserved. I can't really say I was a big fan of Mission Impossible until recently, I have never seen the TV show and the first movie has a more classic reputation than it actually deserves. Still the first one was an interesting somewhat different kind of thriller. The first two sequels were far weaker, MI2 was complete crap with almost no story and ridiculously over the top action, number three was a step forward and a pretty entertaining mindless action movie. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is Brad Birds first live action movie and it almost but not quite lives up to his great animated ones. One thing that this movie managed better than any of the previous ones is the story. The plot of the first one has become known for being complicated while the second has a plot so stupid a retard would be insulted, finally the third film had a clearly flawed but worked acceptable for a mindless popcorn flick. With MI4 they have found the right balance, the plot is understandable without going so far as becoming so simple it's silly, it is serious and interesting without going to the incomprehensible. The story is not Oscar worthy material but it's perfectly considered for this kind of film. The actor's performances are great. I might actually go so far as claiming this has the best of the series. It was great that they expanded Simon Pegg's role. According to me he is better that series recurring Ving Rhames. He supplies some humour without just being a simple comical relief. Tom Cruise is at his best here. He might be a weird guy in real life but as an action actor he is great. Ethan Hunt has grown to this hero one actually cares and wants to follow, his own character not just a James Bond wannabe. Jeremy Renner is a rising star and good here as well. Still his role was smaller than I had thought, it is important but doesn't take any focus away from Hunt. OK the character development might not be chokingly deep for an action movie, definitely not but more than necessary. Mikael Nyqvist as the villain is great. Having seen him in many Swedish movies it fun to see him going international. With this villain I feel they went for the more is less approach and it works brilliant. You don't see a lot of him and when you do short clips. Makes him feel mysterious unlike the over the top Dougray Scott in MI2. I enjoyed the bad guy in the third movie but I must say MI4 had the most memorable in a not easily achieved way. But this is an action flick and that is also where MI4 really succeeds and more than one might have expected. Of course you knew the effects would be top notch but they blow you away not just in that way. Not only are they great visually but it is also very well thought out. There are several scenes that are really clever. Again I must praise the director making this the most well made film in the Mission Impossible series. When I saw the trailer featuring Eminem I got somewhat uneasy. But not to worry this always feels like the MI movie that it is. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the best in the MI series in as good as every way plot, character and action. An outstanding action blockbuster!",8,4,8,8 February 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Impressive and surprising!
","I was greatly impressed by this new Planet of the apes film. Since the successful reboot of Batman reboots have become way popular in Hollywood maybe too so. But after Tim Burton's Planet of the apes remake I think reboot was the only way to go with the series. And whats more this is not just starting the same story over again. Insteed they have managed to create something fresh. This film focuses very much on the drama and it really works. There will be action but the emotional themes work great. So much that it never starts to drag, go over the top or just feeling out of place. The story has clear themes of moral values which at least for me made an impression and actually were the main thing making this film so worth following, not just the action. Not saying that there is no action because the is and is is really well done. Through the movie there is quite some talking about science but it nothing that you need to follow closely and it is of course most made up fictional but is is successfully used to ask questions of moral, animal rights and science gone to far. The effects used to create the apes are absolutely brilliant. Made in the same way I guess as Gollum in Lord of the rings and also starring Andy Serkis. Without these effects the emotional substance that the film manages would have been lost even though for the story's sentimental themes. James Franco might not look entirely believable as a scientist as he still looks quite young but it doesn't matter for the movie and he makes it up with a great performance in bringing the right emotional feeling for the relation to the other characters. Fun to see Tom Felton in his big first post Harry Potter film. He plays the same kind of bastard as in those movies.This is the most different Planet of the apes movie. Focusing on emotional substance instead of the dystopian themes of the previous movies. I really liked Rise of the planets of the apes and would rank it as second best in the series after the first one.",8,1,2,18 February 2012
The Lives of Others," Gripping!! Great both for the realism and story
","This film is just brilliant. It gives an instructive and frightening representation of life in the former eastern bloc. If you are interested in history and especially the cold war you will find The Lives of Others is fantastic. Very providing of fact about how things were in those times. It really captures the tone and gives an amazingly realistic descriptions of the totalitarian rule of East Germany. They want to show you how it worked back there, this film is definitely not any anticommunist propaganda. So well done it feels like it really was made back then. But the film doesn't just succeed in the presentation of the atmosphere and factual representation. It also provides a great story with gripping characters. The acting is absolutely brilliant, Ulrich Mühe is amazing in the lead. The story is one which really builds up the longer it goes. Not meaning that it starts slow absolutely not, it starts out great and just keeps getting better and better. The story keeps going up never tripping over, makes it brilliantly all the way to the end. A rare story that manages to hold up all the way. The plot is so good and well executed. You are never sure where it's heading and you always sit on the edge longing to find out what will happen next. The films tone and pace is very sad, cheerless and slow moving. This works nothing less than perfect. Still it happens things of importance almost all the time so it is a film which requires you to pay attention to keep up with what is happening. However it won't be a problem to maintain concentration at a film so fantastic as this one. The Lives of Others is just as much entertainment as an experience. What they show you really makes one think. Might call it somewhat of an eye opener if you are not well into the subject. Thought-provoking and relevant even today. Something you really ought to see. Brilliant 8/10",8,1,2,14 October 2010
Kick-Ass," Awesome! This movie kicks ***!
","Kick-Ass is a superhero movie that uses a mix of high school comedy, teenage romance, extreme violence and most of all satire. It works absolutely perfect. All aspects are here, cool action, interesting characters, great humor and also a clever plot line. Feels like a really original superhero film and I will go so far as claim it is one of the best I have seen. It's simply brilliant. So the film is really violent perhaps one of the bloodiest superhero films ever. But it's not just for the sake of it. The action scenes feel in a way like they are both gritty and suspenseful but also totally over the top at the same time and of course so entertaining. The humor is great, some jokes are funny just on their own and others are parody of other recent superhero films. I guess in many ways this is a film for the geeks but also viewers that are not totally into the superhero genre will find a great time here. This movie is itself a superhero adventure but at the same time satire, a play on the superhero genre, comic books and popular culture. But the whole plot is great written and actually deeper and cleverer than most in the genre. It's much more than just a parody. The whole adventure is great but just as much interesting are the characters. The character's ordinary life is just as engrossing. The acting is superb. Chloë Grace Moretz is the standout both in her performance but she hers is also the most interesting character. But Aaron Johnson fits his character just as perfectly. I like most I think have not been a fan of Nicolas Cage in a long time but this was his best performance in years. This is one of the best films of 2010. I don't read much comics anymore and I didn't know anything about it so Kick-ass was one of the year's positive surprises. The most original superhero film in years and also one of the best. Kick-ass is amazing!",9,2,5,21 October 2010
The Hurt Locker," Great realistic modern war experience
","If you are looking for this big action heavy war film this is not it. As far as I know(I have no experience of war luckily) it feels like a really believable representation of life in a modern war. The story follows a group of soldiers whose mission is disarming bombs. But the plot is not actually the point in this. Rather it wants to shows you what war life is like and how people may be affected by it. And the film really succeeds. I was quickly drawn in. Many films that attempts to show realistic presentations often become slow moving and even boring. The Hurt Locker brilliantly avoids this, both being a great thrilling war movie and also managing to say something to the viewer. The visuals are great and documentary style that really fits the tone and message. The action is greatly done in a kind of bleak toned down way. Done in with the same feel as the tone of the story is. The acting is really god. For a movie that focuses on the consequence on the soldiers the acting is essential. Sad, exciting, thrilling and always moving. It may be the kind of movie that falls into the category great movies you only watch once but it is a movie you should see once.",8,1,4,2 September 2010
Clash of the Titans," Extremely dull.
","Almost impressive that a film I had so low expectations on still managed to disappoint. That the story would be extremely thin came as no surprise, but what I had hoped for was a entertaining adventure movie that one could just lean back for 2h and enjoy the action. I really liked Louis Leterrier's last movie The Incredible Hulk. But I was shocked how poor the action scenes were in Clash. The cgi looked bad especially Medusa and the fights were confusing and hard to follow, like the crabs.The film is full of well known actors, but the characters feel really plain and boring but I would blame the script which gives the actors nothing for character development.This is a film that is so simple that you can see it without thinking. 3/10The music was much better in the trailer than the actual movie.",3,0,1,4 May 2010
Mission: Impossible II," Mildly entertaining action and stupid plot
","When people arrived at the cinema for this movie I imagine the film crew stood at the entrance saying something like 'Welcome in for this screening of MI2 but please leave your brain outside'. Well symbolically speaking but that really describes this movie. I heard several saying that the plot of the first movie is so hard to understand and I can agree somewhat. It took me a few viewings to follow it completely but it's really not that sophisticated one then realises. Well anyway seeing the sequel one wonders if the producers said something like 'So people thought the plot of the first was complicated so lets just disregard any story for the sequel'. I'm not against mindless action movies, sometimes it's really comfortable to just lean back and not think a lot but just enjoy. However if find myself not being able to suspend my disbelief here because MI2 is not simple but rather completely stupid, treating it's viewers as retards. According to the trivia on IMDb the screenwriter claims he wrote the story around action scenes that John Woo had thought out. It must be true! Many of the action scenes come out of nowhere whatsoever. I go like what the hell is going on with the story? Not in a way that I don't understand but that you understand to well that is makes less sense than a Donald Duck cartoon. It goes so far as one scene Ving Rhames close to turns to the audience and clearly explains what is happening now, why they have to do this thing. Who does the filmmaker think the viewers are? Even underaged would see this as ridiculously easy. The actors play the typical stereotype one expects form this kind of mindless action movie, the hero is so cool and the villain is evil in every way. I'm no hater of Tom Cruise because I can distinguish between his work and him in private which I mostly try to ignore, he seems to be quite a weird guy. Dougray Scott is well enough as the villain and it feels somewhat too bad his career never took off. Thandie Newton has no other purpose than looking hot. The style of the movie is just like you expect from John Woo but actually even more extreme of every of his trademarks. You won't get action more over the top than this. It's looks good but the first film wasn't even near this type so this doesn't quite feel like a sequel, had they just changed the names one wouldn't even know. So the action is good but it's just too much. Not even James Bond would get away with this, don't get me wrong I love the 007 movies. Add so much cheesy dialogue and dramatic music and I'm somehow embarrassed when I once watched this with someone that knew nothing about Mission: Impossible. The action is great but Mission: Impossible 2 goes from simple to insultingly dumb. Sorry I can't take this movie, it barely passes for the acceptable grad which on my scale is 5/10.",5,1,3,8 January 2012
Avatar," Brilliant on the outside and OK on the inside.
","James Cameron's long awaited return to cinema! His first feature film since Titanic. Cameron has always been a filmmaker who brings something new, so of course the hype was really high for his next film. And information of what Avatar was going to be just kept increasing everyone's anticipation for it. This looked like something different. Cameron has long been a favourite filmmaker for me. Terminator 1 & 2 are definitely on my list of best movies ever. So did it live up? Well Avatar is a great movie. It is not an amazing one. The expression style over substance has been used many times and by me before but Avatar is exactly that. Cameron ones again takes the special effects to new heights and also reintroduced 3D to cinema. Technically the visuals are a masterpiece one could say. Also the design and creativity of the world and creatures is great. Not on Star Wars like levels but Avatar looks pretty much flawless. The whole movie has this very epic theme to it. The action is also great as should be expected. It's not as mind-blowing as his Terminator movies or as intense as Aliens or as ridiculously (in an entertaining way) as in True Lies. But Avatar is better than most released at the same time. However, it is underneath this brilliant surface that the flaws are. The story is Avatars weakest part. It totally lacks in originality. It borrows heavily from many different sources. I feel that even if one has not seen a lot of movies Avatar is unfortunately very predictable. You can early sense where the story is going. It is a story that entertains rather than surprises. It is the writing that lacks. Cameron's earlier movies had great dialogue and memorable quotes. Avatar honestly doesn't have those. And then we have the actors. Unfortunately, if I shall be honest Sam Worthington is not a charismatic actor. But it's not all his fault. Cameron can create amazing characters but here they feel thin. None of the actors here are bad but their characters are weakly written. The characters have this predictable feel too them in the same way as the plot. Not bad in any way just nothing more than pretty standard. All this said sounds so negative, the problem is just that I guess my demands on James Cameron are so high. Avatar is a very good and greatly entertaining movie. Technically amazing but when you see past the brilliant effects this is not the masterpiece some were expecting and some are claiming. 8/10.",8,2,3,25 September 2016
The Artist," Brilliant actors, clever plot, overall unlike anything I've seen before.
","More than seldom I can feel that award shows tend to praise the kind of special, small production and unknown films. When one first got news of The Artist when it started winning all these prises one could definitely get the feeling that it was that kind of critically praised film that the generally movie audience would pretty much ignore. I mean a black and white silent film today doesn't sound like the kind that would make many hundred millions on the international arena. But when it after winning those academy awards and getting a cinema release where I live I decided I would give it a chance and it also felt like quite different from anything else I have seen in cinema. Turns out I was more pleasantly surprised than I have been by a movie in years. The film is absolutely brilliant with many successful factors. First and for most the acting is outstanding. Jean Dujardin really deserved that Oscar and the supporting actors are also great. As a silent film it would be essential that the acting is great. Even if there is some subtitles at times it is not very often for most the film relies on the actors managing to make the viewers understand what is going on and what the characters are feeling. They do it brilliantly. There is however background music all the way through the film. It would feel pretty blank if it would be totally soundless for 100 minutes. The music also is used to tell the feeling and tone of what is going on. Like when Valentin is expressing shock the music is high and dramatic. The story is both a homage to the silent era and a great tale. It's a very emotional story that really grips hold of you. But there is quite a lot of humour as well. Still it is greatly considered to not go so far as being silly and taking away focus from the plot. Hearing the description of the film as a silent, black and white, comedy-drama I could easily fear that it would feel slow and overdrawn. It may just be my preconception that unique dramas are like that but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not so in any way. The running length at less than two hours is perfect. Over all the film fits perfectly in the middle, not overdrawn and not rushed. The Artist is a brilliant movie. The opening is kind of slow for a while but one soon gets into it and after it never let's go. While I would not quite praise it as a masterpiece The Artist is a close to perfect movie 9/10.",9,1,4,10 March 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," Manages to deliver in ways that will entertain viewers of all ages
","What I find so impressive with How to train your dragon is what I also stated in the title of this review, it has something for people of most ages. Also the stuff that will be enjoyed by the younger and the more grown up are not necessarily always the same things. I shall explain further what I mean by that. The story works great in that it is perfectly considered for the younger group. But I think the older part of the viewers will feel that the story just works well, not that it's bad or to thin in any way but just nothing special for them. What the more grown ups will find so brilliant is the humor. The humor is brilliant, specially the dialogue. The dialogue is so fun to listen to. But the reason is not really the jokes which I don't think have such a big part. The voices are brilliant and the dialogue is spoken in slack tone that make me laugh out loud just hearing it no matter what exactly is being said. The film also contains so parts of slapstick humor which all will find funny and it doesn't take a to big role either. Personally I found the humorous parts of much more entertainment than the story which filled it's part enough but not anything more. One other pleasure with this film is the animation, both technically and aesthetically. The humans look funny which is great but this is more a film about dragons and those also are the biggest viewing pleasure. Not only are they superbly designed but the way they move and specially the faces is massively impressive. The dragons behavior makes me think of cats and they definitively studied real animals for the animation. The dragons are both cute and fun to watch. There are some sentimental scenes in it to. What is impressive is that the emotional stuff more come from the visual rather than like more often story depth. The flying scenes are very impressive in the design and actually makes me think of Avatar, yes I think it's done on that level and I haven't seen dragon in 3D. Does the movie contain some moral message. Others have commented that it has, often I don't like when movies try to hide some message under a great production like some kind of propaganda. However even if someone maybe thinks this has some point to make it's nothing that I took any really note of so one can enjoy the film just as a piece of entertainment and that all which I am thankful for. How to train your dragon is a brilliantly entertaining piece. Perfect humor and effects, the part I enjoyed the most. Also it has a great story for the younger and works enough for the older to. When the film is over I feel like I could soon see it again and enjoy it just as much. I give How to train your dragon a 8/10. Great!",8,2,3,27 March 2011
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges is amazing!
","Jeff Bridges does his absolutely best performance ever in Crazy Heart. He is really so good the film is worth seeing even if you have no real interest in it any other ways. Maybe someone could point out that the story doesn't really deliver anything that hasn't been done before. I can agree with that to some extent but with this film it doesn't matter, Crazy Heart is so well done. The characters are all great achievements, somewhat thanks to directing and script but the acting is what lifts the film to it's hight. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Colin Farrell manage to create characters that you become so interested in one sits on strict attention for the entire movie even if any big surprises remain absent from the plot. Even if it has many great aspects it is Jeff Bridges who carries the film. He really deserved the academy award for this. His character feels so real that under the films length of under 2h one gets a closer relation to him than few other can master. Maybe the story works so well because it is done in a so realistic way. It really feels like something that could be true and many times real life can lack surprising twists. I never get the feeling the plot is simple instead it feels like it's real. The film is sad and gripping. One comes to feel much for Jeff Bridges's character and the stuff he goes through. It is sad and a bit fun at the same time, a depressed dark humor. The feel-good kind of film. Even though like I stated it's not a film with lots of plot twists, but still I never sit thinking: I know what will come next, because it has such a soul I just want to see what happens to the gripping characters. The style and pace that it's told at is absolutely perfect for the story. The film is under 2h which is just enough, the film is at a low pace but not in a slow way rather I get the relaxing feel. Then the music which I loved so much. The songs are great and the performance by Bridges and Farrell are brilliant, very impressive! Crazy Heart is often a sad film, sometimes depressingly so but it's one that also makes you happy. However it has something more than the average feel-good film. I think one could say they have done much, very much with little. Crazy Heart really has a heart and a very deep soul.",8,2,3,8 February 2011
Kong: Skull Island," One of 2017 most entertaining movies!
","I had no interest in another King Kong movie. Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was a boring rehash. When I first heard there was coming another I was like well they have to drag the franchise out for another try. Several big actors were to be in it but I had never heard of the director. But then the trailer and marketing for it started coming and it looked quite interesting and also and maybe especially it looked different. So eventually I actually went to the cinema to see Kong: Skull Island. Luckily that I did because this is really a movie which should be seen in the cinema.Kong: Skull Island is the definition of a popcorn movie. Where the 2005 movie was drawn out and almost pretentious this movie wastes no time to get to the action and adventure. The action is outstanding in entertainment. Obviously there is a lot of cgi. However I'm not against computer made effects just for no reason. Some things are hard to do in other ways and as long as it doesn't feel like it's used for laziness sake it's fine. And in this movie it works fine. The action in this movie was among the most exciting I saw last year. Some complained about the characters being thin and while that criticism does have a point I don't think it matters much here. This is a fun action adventure that doesn't need deeply developed characters. They are not what's important. They are just enough for this type of movie. And the performances are good. Samuel L Jackson is the bad*** that he always is and does so well, Tom Hiddleston gives us a glimpse that he could definitely play James Bond, Brie Larson works well with what she's got even if it's not a lot. The best is John C. Reilly, his character is the most interesting and performance the most entertaining. Simple they may be but they do all have some distinct personality. Minor complaints are that many of the quotes that are meant as jokes don't land but for me it wasn't a big issue, the movie is funnier in other ways. Like previously stated I knew nothing about the director who it turns out had only directed one other movie but he totally nailed this one. He gets great performances even if the script probably didn't give much to work with. I love the look of the movie, the style it's done in. The shots of helicopters flying over the island and Kong silhouette against the sun. It could have taken this grim and gloomy look which I'm so glad it didn't. Another thing is the music, while there is tunes that are written for it the movie uses a lot of songs from the era when it is set which works perfectly. Having a lot of well known songs can work greatly in the right kind of movie but not all. Kong: Skull Island was one of the most surprisingly good movies in 2017. A movie that knows what it is and embraces it. It's campy and over the top and I like it. No one would claim it to be any amazing piece of work but I believe the filmmakers totally know it and all for the better. I have seen a lot of 2017 movies and Kong: Skull Island was while definitely not the best but one of the most thoroughly entertaining. See Kong: Skull Island if you haven't already. I have several times.",7,1,1,30 March 2018
Inception," Christopher Nolan's dream thriller
","Inception is Christopher Nolan's sci-fi/ heist thriller. Matrix for a new generation? I've heard some making comparisons between Inception and The Matrix though in my opinion Inception is not groundbreaking on that level I do see similarities. Christopher Nolan is a great director and I like all of his movies. Inception got some big praise when first released and rightly so it is a great movie. Is it his best? Not quite for me but close. A lot hold it up as this so called smart science fiction and the story is indeed quite complex so it did take more than one and two viewings before I pretty much think I understand most of what was going on. The plot is clever and very creative. It's not totally watertight I'm not sure if all makes total sense at the end. Some of the rules of this whole dream world aren't entirely clear all the time. But after the movie is over I feel it doesn't really matter. I'm not demanding or expecting award winning writing. The concept is interesting, different and creative. Inception is an awesome movie blockbuster experience. Which brings me to another point. Inception looks absolutely stunning. The action is awesome and the tension is intense all the way through. And even if the action is very exciting in not overdone. They manage the impressively balance between the thrills, story and characters. The movie is long but doesn't feel so. I'm at full attention at all times. The actors are great. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and he does really great in this. Also Inception is kind of different movie than he usually does, he's not usually in blockbuster action movies usually more dramas. The character drama involving his character is really engrossing. I was actually more taken by the character's experience that the plot. The sci-fi elements are exciting but I was positively surprised at the character development. Well DiCaprio's character anyway. While there are many big names in this it is him that is the clear focus of the story. Nolan has a few his regulars and some new ones and they all do a fine job. But their roles are supporting and well admittedly none of them that deep. One thing I would like to point out is the music and sound effects. The music is very good the same kind like Nolan's Batman movies which is obvious because it's the same composer, many directors have their regular collaborators. But I wanted to mention the sound because I feel it is used more than usual here. Not just as music in the background to set the tone but there are these loud sounds when some things happen and it works great. The sound effects, music and especially explosions are really loud when held in comparison to the dialogue. Clearly intentional and someone could feel annoyed I think works definitely to this movies advantage. Inception is a awesome movie going experience. It really succeeds in pretty much all, a clever creative plot, spectacular tense action and characters and even the music must be praised. It's not a masterpiece or breaking new ground in action. The plot is creative but it's not perfect. Not much of a flaw in the end. Inception is one of the best action movies in years.",8,1,3,14 December 2016
Prometheus," A OK movie but no more than OK.
","And so it has arrived, Ridley Scott's maybe/maybe not prequel to his classic ALIEN. Well does it deliver? Maybe/maybe not. I've seen this has been high on many lists of most anticipated movies in 2012. But what was seen of it in trailers and alike leading up to the release didn't wow me. It looked really great visually but what one could make out of the plot seemed strikingly similar to the original ALIEN. Two writers with doubtful records made that not unexpected. The crews all talk of how this shouldn't be seen as a prequel in the normal sense makes me wonder if they really wanted to say: Don't get your hopes up. Why would one not what to do a prequel to one of the most liked sci-fi movies ever? Feeling unable to live up to it is one big reason. So what about the results? Well the resemblances to ALIEN turns out in many parts to be true. So far that one could somewhat view Prometheus as a re-imagining of the original. The ties to the original are there but they are very loose so it feels pretty much like just fan pleasing which is disappointing for us who wanted a real backstory. The visuals are stunning as is expected. The 3D in my opinion was fine in that it was there without being forced, necessary? no but not annoying either. The acting is also good Noomi Rapace did well and while not standing up to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley still managed a good performance. However the far best performance is Michael Fassbender as the android David. He continues the prove himself as one of the big names in acting at time of writing this. The others also do well in their performances. But still the entire cast never manage to reach the reality and substance of the original and also as a stand alone movie it is not very deep stuff. There are few that touch or grip you. Still I think that the kind of emotionless characters are to blame on the script not the cast. The acting is mostly solid but the characters not so. While the effects are stunning the film is really lacking in the suspense. There are some jump moments but they are few and short. The style of the suspense one would expect to be like the original but it fails at most. When you also don't care much for the characters you don't feel appalled or sad when someone drops off. The plot apart from being similarly to the original in the structure it also on its own is far predictable. Even if you have no experience of the series or so you can pretty much guess where it is going and the lack of suspense does not help. And as many more have pointed out the story asks many questions but provides few answers. The links to the ALIEN saga are weak so I'm not referring to those questions but ones that the film itself asks. The film on it's own has several strange and hard to interpret moments. It was written by the writers of Lost and sequels are likely to come but still it makes one frustrated.To sum up Prometheus is a alright but flawed movie. Most surprisingly weak is the thrills and suspense. All the technical aspects are stunning but the characters and story are seriously lacking. If you expect background to Scott's original you will be disappointed and also in it's own this is a story the asks more than it answers. Ending this with a quote from another reviewer: Not as frightening as ALIEN or as thrilling as ALIENS but still alright. Ridley Scott's return to the Science fiction genre. Leaving the cinema I can't help but feeling: Was that it?",6,0,6,12 June 2012
Toy Story 3," One of the best threequels in one of the best trilogies.
","It seems many third instalments often fail to live up to the standards of the first two. Examples according to me: X-men: the last stand, Spider-man 3 and Terminator 3. Not so with Toy Story, after years of rumors, hope and despair Pixar finally returns and delivers all I wanted and dared to hope for. It has been a couple years and one really sees that technology moves forward and it's not just the 3D. Toy Story 3 has it all: the humor, parody(Star Wars, Jurassic Park), animated action that succeeds to even thrill. But the thing that Pixar are so good at and especially in the Toy Story movies is that they manage to create such a relation between you and the characters. Some may say but it's a children's movie, but it doesn't matter because if you've grown up with the series you want to know what will happen to Woody, Buzz and the gang. Not just is it the characters so deep but the plot is so well done, it has such substance. I found myself starting to chew over the relations between toys and an owner and how this change when grown up. The plot is so smart and really touches ones feelings. The ending so sad and at the same time just as hopeful. How an animated children's movie about toys brought me to the brink of crying I don't know, the next time I see it I wont be able to hold it back. Amazingly impressive Pixar. Not made just for money but because there is a good story to be told. So funny, thrilling, even thought provoking, visual outstanding and so sad. A movie to see again, again and again. Everyone should see it.This is not just one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, not just the best threequel (sorry Return of the king), but even one of the best movies. Without doubt the best movie of the 2010s so far, it will be hard to beat.Should there be a Toy Story 4? I'm very divided.",9,1,1,5 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Well it is the best in the series yet.
","I liked the third book best(haven't read the forth yet though). Definitely not my kind of books but they are still an alright read. It's somewhat fun to see visually the story ones just read. But I thought the first film was really poor, i most ways. With the second it got better(even if I felt the second book was the weakest) but still a weak effort compared to many other adaptations. Thankfully with the third movie the improvement in quality continues. Positive, sure quite a lot could still be better but I myself was mostly satisfied.The story stays with the book pretty well which was good but so has the other two mostly. However what was done better this time around was the plot, in that it didn't feel like it rushed forward and painfully lack in details which I often think movie adaptations tend to do. Even if you've not read the book you will have little problem following what is going on. Sure it's vampires and werewolves but really Twilight is the usual teenage love story. Absolutely not unique. Aimed for teenage girls but I think even others can enjoy it once as a 'feelgood' film. But I admit the romance gets a bit long-drawn and doesn't make perfect sense at times, but of course that is the central thing of the story.The action was very bad in the first film. Yes the action may be a side thing to the love triangle but still a flaw. The third book has the most action so I felt it vital that those scenes should improve. Thankfully the action has gotten better, it's not great but it worked well enough. Some of the wolf cgi looked somewhat flawed a places though. An improvement enough at least.The acting is no big problem according to me. A bit wooden some but you get a feeling for the characters. I have no big complaint over the actors they chose, even though not everyone looks like you've yourself imagined from the books but thats often the case. Kristen Stewart is way prettier than you imagine Bella in the books. Definitely not a problem.I'm no fan of the book so had no real expectations. But it was an mostly entertaining movie experience. Quite a bunch of flaws but an improvement over the previous two. The action, storytelling, maybe even the acting has gotten better. Overall a satisfying adaptation that will please the fans. 6/10",5,0,8,7 September 2010
Spectre," Craig's most traditional Bond movie is his third best
","It's good, it isn't great but it's good. Mendes had a tough challenge following up Skyfall and while he can't reach its heights Spectre is still a entertaining movie. So about it. Right from the start this feels more like a pre Casino Royale Bond movie than any of the previous Craig reboot movies. Many of the Bond films follow kind of the same structure and this definitely has more of the classic set up. It also has more humor than Craig's other ones too. Most of it works but some jokes fall flat. It's fine because it never gets silly and while this is Craig's most lighthearted movie it still is more serious than most of the older ones (not License to kill). The movie opens brilliantly, I will say this pre credit sequence is among the best in the entire series. Wonderfully shot and tense action. In the context of the movie I didn't mind Sam Smith's theme song. However after that the movie soon slows down. The story soon starts to feel less and less interesting after the stellar opening. Wouldn't call it weak just no more than average and some themes feel a bit to similar to previous movies. Always entertaining but never surprising. Exactly the same can be said about the action. The action scenes are well done but nothing special and I feel many of them are too short. Apart from the opening it lacks any wow action moment. I say that the movie starts better than it ends, yes unfortunately it actually gets weaker as it goes on. On to the acting. Daniel Craig is as outstanding as we know he would be. Against the odds he has made the role his own. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw have settled into their roles well. Naomie Harris is quite a different Moneypenny than the previous ones but maybe that's the point and I must just get used. Léa Seydoux is beautiful though her character is undeveloped. Seydoux and Craig have some good chemistry but nothing will ever bet the him with Eva Green. Seydoux as a Bond girl feels pretty standard, nothing bad about her but nothing out of the ordinary either. Monica Bellucci is a great actress but totally wasted. To bad all the hype about a different take on Bond girls did not come true. Christoph Waltz is alright as the villain even if he can't live up to his predecessor Javier Bardem or Mads Mikkelsen. He does well but the character introduction is unfortunately so rushed. Neither his character nor his scheme are much fleshed out. Disappointing is also Dave Bautista's Mr Hinx who I had hoped would become one of the more memorable henchmen but while he looks big and intimidating he becomes nothing more than that. This movie is also overlong. A movie can be long if there is a big and good story to tell. Spectre divides it's running time wrong, as some scenes are drawn out while other stuff is so rushed. On the whole Spectre is a entertaining but flawed and sad to say unspectacular flick. It's easier to criticize that to praise. So this review sounds more negative than I meant it to. Third best of Daniel Craig's 007 movies. And I really hope he does one more.",6,1,4,1 January 2016
The Nice Guys," Great movie! Shane Black does what he does the best!
","A buddy-cop action comedy written and directed by Shane Black. It's what he does but he does it so well. Really well The Nice Guys is a great movie. It does have many of his trademarks but still I don't think he's just rehashing himself, not at all. All filmmakers have their own thing and of course some more than others but I won't complain. All of Black's movies do have many similarities, even Iron Man 3 had elements of the buddy movie that he most often or always uses. I have had high hopes for The Nice Guys ever since I first heard of it quite some time before it was released. I'm happy to say that it delivers. Shane Black is a great writer and The Nice Guys does have a better plot than one usually expects in the action genre. It takes a number of unexpected twists and honestly after my first viewing I was not totally sure how it all hung together. But I've seen it again more than once and it pretty much makes sense now. This movie gets better on a second viewing. One seldom expects or demands that an action movie should have an award winning script and I wouldn't claim that The Nice Guys does either but still it's great to see an action movie where you aren't completely sure were the plot is heading all the time. A buddy-cop, crime mystery, thriller, action, drama comedy would be to completely describe it. It has a little of all actually. And a surprising amount of depth actually. It is a detective thriller. The character drama and plot are I feel just as important as the action, maybe even more so. The characters and acting is just great. Gosling and Crow have great chemistry and fit their characters perfectly. But the real standout like many others have stated is Angourie Rice as Goslings daughter. She turns out to be pretty much one of the main characters. At first one might get the expression that she's obnoxious and irritating but this soon changes. There is of course some comedic relief here and there in the movie, most of the jokes come from the interactions between the three main characters and some slapstick also but it's never overdone. Not every single joke lands but by far most of them. While there is humor this is actually kind of a serious story and with sad characters. The main characters are not really heroes but rather deeply flawed and struggling. Tragic comedy in a way. It feels more plausible so you can more related and care for them. The action is well made and also feels like down to earth but in a good way. It feels tense and thrilling without being this massive spectacle that goes on for too long. Not as much action as some might expect but in my opinion it's just the right amount, I feel the detective and thriller moments are just as exciting. Probably the idea is that it should feel kind of like it not just takes place forty years ago but that it's made then as well. I have no experience of 1970s USA so I can't tell if it's a totally realistic presentation but I think so, it feels so. The Nice Guys is one of the best movies of 2016. Great characters, clever plot, action, humor. See it!",9,3,6,4 November 2016
The Social Network," I 'like' it.
","When I first found out that there was going to be a film about the founding of Facebook I wasn't really interested. But then I heard that it would be by David Fincher it immediately became something to keep an eye on. The film sounded really strange, a drama film about Facebooks creation. Well I didn't really know anything about that event but could a website be enough to make a film of, unless it was a documentary. Since David Fincher is one of my favourite directors and hasn't made a bad film since Alien 3 I kept hopeful that this still could be something worth watching.When the rave reviews started coming in I was surprised but still held my expectations down. The trailer looked great but that has fooled me before.The film turned out to exceed all my wildest hopes. One clearly sees why this is not called Facebok the movie, because it is not really about the website. It's a story about people, friendship, betrayal, money and much more. So even if not interested in Facebook this is a great movie. The story is great and brilliantly told, actually very deep emotionally. Aaron Sorkin is the master of razor-sharp dialogue. Not just is it gripping because the characters are real and the story is based on actual event. The acting is among the best I have seen in ages. Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, even Justin Timberlake are simply amazing. So there is much talking in the film, not like Fincher's usual kind of movies but no less brilliant. The camera work is superb just like always. It goes at a quick pace but it's never any problem to keep up. The music is great and perfectly chosen for the tone. It's funny and sad at the same time. I don't care much if it's accurate portrayal of what happened. They have succeeded great in not taking anyones side. It is left to you to decide who is most right. But it doesn't matter since it's one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. Never has 2h gone so by so quickly.The Social Network is the best film of 2010 and maybe one of the biggest surprises ever, better than I ever dared to hope for. David Fincher's best film since Fight club. The material that they based it on turned out to be pretty good stuff but never did I even imagine that this could be so amazing execution. When it was over I just wanted to see it again and again. The Social Network is fantastic. The movie for a generation!",9,0,1,23 October 2010
