The Lobster," More absurd than necessary
","The Lobster is a very difficult movie to assess. Its premise is so ridiculous and absurd that it's bound to be a divisive movie that isn't for everyone. The first half in particular is a difficult sit through, as due to their absurdity, many story elements seem completely random at first. It's only halfway through that things seem to click together, and an impressively cohesive story emerges. I'm actually so impressed with the underlying story, that I believe this would have made a terrific science fiction movie if played a little more seriously. It is basically a movie about a dystopian future in which people are forced to become married or run the risk of being turned into an animal, or being hunted if trying to avoid this outcome. There are some very interesting reflections on the pressures of society to find a partner and the superficial ways that people get together and pretend to be someone else in order to avoid ending up alone. Interestingly, the fugitive group of loners is equally as radical in their approach, forcing their members to stay alone and punishing them for showing any type of romantic affection towards another. I see this broadly as a remark on society in general, in which there are extremists on both ends of the political spectrum, each hating the other, but neither one being particularly desirable from a neutral point of view. Like always, the truth is somewhere in the middle. I found myself being thoroughly engaged in these ideas, but at times were taken out of it by the absurdist nature of many of the scenes. The deadpan and deliberately wooden acting is quirky and interesting at first, but grows tiresome rather quickly, and the dialogue seemed very scripted and unnatural (as it was intended). I also personally didn't think it was as funny as the writers hoped I would think, being left confused and frustrated at some scenes rather than laughing at them. I'm sure many will disagree, and believe the absurdity is at the core of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked without it. Indeed, it might have run the risk of being a little more run-of-the-mill if played more seriously and left in less capable hands. However, the underlying ideas were so strong that I really don't think it needed the excessive absurdity. I believe this might be a case of the writers underestimating the quality of their screenplay and throwing in some quirky things to make it seem a bit more alternative and anti-mainstream than it needed to be. Even the central concept of turning into an animal if failing to find a partner within 45 days was superfluous to the main story. The movie would have worked just as well if a different type of punishment was presented. Or at least it could have been given a bit more prominence. The fact that the animals that are walking around were once humans is being mentioned in a throwaway line or two, but never really fully explored. I'm not saying it should have been a full on dark and gritty science-fiction drama. It could have retained its satirical outlook, which suits the story quite well. It just went a little overboard with trying to seem as weird and quirky as possible, which is a shame as The Lobster is now mainly being remembered as 'that weird movie in which humans turn into animals', even though there's so much more to this great story.",7,2,4,23 February 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great production and superb Rami Malek make up for some story-telling weak points
","Going into Bohemian Rhapsody, I heard so many conflicting reports about its quality that I had no idea what to expect. Critics disliked it, audiences loved it. Usually that means the 'truth' is somewhere in the middle, and I was surprised to see myself leaning more towards the audience side as the movie went on.That's not to say I don't see where the criticism is coming from though, and I actually agree with quite a bit of it. Particularly the first half of the movie is rather shallow, well-executed, by-the-numbers nostalgia porn. Many scenes are made and meant to be viewed with current day knowledge, which makes for some cheap gags and winks to the audience but not particularly compelling story-telling. The recording sessions, while well-executed and full of energy, add very little other than a game of 'who's who' of Queen's greatest hits. As someone who appreciates Queen's music but didn't grow up with it and don't have a particularly large (nostalgic) fondness to it, this didn't really do much for me.All that being said, most of these issues go away in the second half of the movie, when it's a lot more insightful into the person Freddie Mercury. The key moment that changes my view on the movie is when Freddie first confronts his sexuality with his fiance. It's the first real moment of character that he gets other than just being flamboyant and it hits like a bombshell, mainly because of Rami Malek's powerhouse performance as Freddie Mercury. From there, the film focuses much more on Freddie Mercury's character, and his flaws, and it becomes a much better film because of it.Together with the incredibly energetic and well-executed music scenes (other than some very noticable audience CGI at the final performance), it overall makes for a very pumped up and positive movie-going experience. The role that Rami Malek plays in all of this is crucial. He gives it his all and it elevates the movie to another level. It's definitely worth seeing for his performance alone.",8,3,4,11 December 2018
Justice League," There is so much wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.
","Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even h√≠s plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction. Then there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers. However, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.The rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.Cyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.And of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.They even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout. Then there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.Secondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return. If they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.Overall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.At least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe.",2,284,504,18 February 2018
The Favourite," Mesmerizing and hypnotizing
","'The Favourite' combines an everwinding script with technical excellence and powerhouse acting, making for an overwhelmingly positive, almost hypnotic experience. It's easily Yorgos Lanthimos' most accessible movie, which still makes it very absurd and satirical by you average movie standard, but storywise feels more conventional than his previous outings, which I consider to be a positive thing. Whereas for instance 'The Lobster' felt a little absurd for the sake of being absurd, the absurdity in 'The Favourite' comes from its absurd settings and characters, inspired by real life British politics and the monarcy in the 18/19th century. It is absurdity that makes you think 'Man, life was weird back in the day', rather than 'Look at that character doing silly things because the writer wrote them as silly'. It's exaggerated but still largely believable.There are a few areas in which 'The Favourite' excels beyond its overall solid script. On a technical level, the camera work is top notch, constantly twisting and turning, making use of all sorts of different camera tricks to highlight the absurdity of the setting. I especially love what they did with the lighting, constantly making use of natural candle light to only focus on the characters' faces and drown out the dark background. There's an especially beautifully shot scene between Emma Stone and Nicholas Hoult's characters taking place outside at night entirely in the dark, seemingly only lit by old school braziers. It gives the movie a much more authenthic feel.Musically, it's pretty great too. There's your average choiry, organy score that you'd expect from a period piece, which is executed very well. More impressive are the moments where the music becomes very minimalistic, nothing more than a constant rhytmic drum, which gives off an incredibly hypnotic vibe that could last for 10 minutes at a time. It does a great job in drawing you in.However, it's the acting which truly makes this movie stand out. The main trio of actresses are all exceptional in their own very distinct way. Rachel Weisz plays the more distant, seemingly harsh and coldhearted character who you believe can turn to murder at any time. Emma Stone on the other hand plays the instantly loveable, somewhat clumsy and endearing character that only Emma Stone can play. What's great about these two performances is that over the course of the movie they become much more layered and there's more than meets the eye for both characters. Your sympathies constantly shift between the two, which is a testament to both the writing and the versatility of the actresses.As amazing as Weisz and Stone are, it's Olivia Colman that truly steals the show, like she does in anything she is in. It helps that she gets the more meaty scenes in which she can let loose and go all in, but it's her quiter moments and her subtle facial expressions that truly sell her performance. She can go from absurd, childish, and over-the-top, to heart-broken and introverted and back all in the course of a single scene. She has the most absurd things to say and do, but she's also the most human and loveable of them all. I'm stoked that Colman's finally getting the recognition she deserves, because I genuinely believe she is the best actress working today.Despite me being overwhelmingly impressed, there are some flaws that I need to address. In particular, the movie struggles in its third act to come to a conclusion. The story seems to fold onto itself a few times, and extend beyond a natural ending point, making the movie seem longer than it truly is. At the end, I thought I had watched a 2,5 hour long movie, when in reality it was under 2 hours long. The script could have used a little thightening up in that regard, particularly because it also loses some of its trademark absurdity by the end, making you slightly lose some interest.These minor storytelling faults not withstanding, I did genuinely love this movie. It may not be for everyone, and that's entirely fair since Lanthimos' previous movies weren't really for me either, but the combination of technical excellence and superb acting alone makes this movie a must-see in my book.",9,2,5,28 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Wildly entertaining and surprisingly bold and unconventional (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD)
","Avengers: Infinity War is popcorn spectacle of the highest order, bringing action scene after action scene with barely any respite. It sounds almost exhausting, but because of the large variety of both characters and locations, it never gets stale. Almost all the Avengers gets their moment to shine, and all add to the plot in an organic and interesting manner, though team Captain America seemed to draw the short stick because they were easily the least impactful group. There are some really cool new combinations of superheroes (like Thor and Rocket, and Starlord and Iron Man) that actually feel earned after 10 years of build up. It reminded me a lot of Game of Thrones, that after scattering the main characters they're finally all being brought back together in interesting combinations that you did not think you needed but now can't imagine not existing. Thanos is a suprisingly great villain, both menacing and in a strange way likeable and understandable. Despite his appearance, he's a lot more than generic bad guy that just wants to destroy the world for no particular reason #6. It takes a bad film like DC's Justice League to realize that such organic and cool superhero meetups combined with a good villain is really not all that easy to achieve. The actions sequences are mostly great, because of the aforementioned variety in characters and locations. I love how every superhero has their own unique fighting style and it really shows on screen. You never feel like 'who exactly was that?'. Every character is distinguishable from the others and work together in a grealy entertaining way. You just got to love Spider-Man making use of Doctor Strange's magic portals to give a quick example of a great team-up. The boldness comes largely at the end, with some really daring choices made by the writers. The biggest being that the villain actually wins at the end, in this weird The Leftovers meets Inferno (the book) kinda ending. Of course you know that there's going to be a reset of sorts and that most of the characters who died will come back, but at least in this movie, the unstoppable villain actually proved to be unstoppable for a change. That's very refreshing and resulted in some rather emotional scenes towards the end. Of course there are still some flaws in the film. Despite the film's ballsy ending, the real death count is surprisingly tame and filled with relatively minor characters. Loki is the biggest one, but he kinda had it coming after several fakeouts. I really thought one of the original Avengers would kick the bucket, and was pervertedly unsatisfied when it didn't happen, again similar to Game of Thrones and the lack of major deaths in the latter seasons. Particularly Iron Man and Thor's potential death scenes were set up to a lack of payoff.The scene between Vision and Scarlett Witch would have meant more if we cared more about these characters. As it is, we've barely seen them throughout the years and a few early romantic scenes between them didn't really add all that much to it. This is where the lack of own films for these characters really is evident the most. The parallel scenes between Thanos and Gamora were a lot more effective because we've seen a lot more of particularly Gamora, although I still think it would have helped if we had a bit more of that interaction in previous movies.And as much as I loved the ending for having the bad guy be victorious, it really is diminished quite a bit by the knowledge that there will be a reset of sorts and the deaths aren't real deaths. It's once again really similar to Game of Thrones and the main character that died but we all knew would be back the next season. I'll admit it's a bit of a catch-22 though. If instead they would have killed off some more minor characters that might believably stay dead, you'd be left with the idea that conveniently it's only minor characters that perished, whereas the point of Thanos' plan is that anyone can be killed off regardless of importance. Still, because of it being the likes of Black Panther, Doctor Strange and Spider-man of whom we know there are sequels in the making, it does diminish the impact of these moments, though I still found them quite emotional. Despite these flaws, I was highly entertained and captivated by almost all that transpired on screen. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the better superhero movies out there. It has so many great (action) moments and a surprisingly bold narrative for a superhero movie. I can't wait to see where they are going next, as long as they find a way to not make the events of this movie seem like a complete red herring and entire waste of time.",9,0,0,30 April 2018
Mulholland Drive," Surrealism taken too far
","David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' is in many ways a hypnotic, well-directed and well-acted piece of surrealistic film. I'm still somewhat unsure of whether it is artistic genius or pretentious schlock, but right now I fall somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. I acknowledge the ambition and artistic integrity that went into making a movie such as this, and just how dinstinctly David Lynch and wildly different from any other movie it is. It's a very visceral movie experience, relying mainly on ambient music and visuals. At the same time I am also highly aware and annoyed of the fact that this is a movie that deliberately barely makes any sense without some sort of pre-conceived notion of what is going on.On first viewing (which is what I'm basing this review on, as I only just watched it for the first time), it's nigh impossible to understand what is happening. Only after reading up on the plot of the movie does some of the events fall into place. Some might see that as a plus, that it has many additional layers that get unravelled on repeat viewings. I would agree with that, if there were any initial layers to process. Instead, from a story perspective I got absolutely nothing out of it without looking it up, and that is a storytelling sin in my book.A large part of my frustration with the movie comes from the fact that the fantasy/surrealistic part of the movie goes on waaaaay too long in comparison to the 'reality' part. There are also no real hints that this is a fantasy/dream other than of course the fact that some bizarre stuff happens. This bizarre stuff happens equally in the 'real' section of the movie though, so that's not really very enlightening.Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for weird psychological tales with surrealistic elements, but if those surrealistic elements take up three-quarters (2 hours!) of the movie before coming to anything resembling any sort of sense, you have overdone your surrealism in my opinion. It made the end of the movie feel really rushed, as there was not enough time to properly connect the fantasy to the reality. If it was a more even 50-50 split, or if there were a few more specks of 'reality' interspersed into the fantasy part, I think it would have strongly improved my appreciation for the movie.As it is, I dig the whole hypnotic and surrealistic vibe of the movie on a visceral level, as well as the performances (especially Naomi Watts'), but the deliberate lack of any sort of coherent story just rubs me the wrong way. Which is a shame, because the underlying story beats that get presented at the end are actually really moving and deeply human.",6,2,5,5 November 2018
Mother!," A surrealistic masterpiece
","I can't pretend to understand everything/anything of what was going on in Darren Aronofsky's Mother!. I'm sure far more intelligent people have tried to dissect its ideas and worded them far more eloquently than I ever could. All I can say is that I was just consistently drawn to everything that was on screen, from the intriguing and mysterious opening images to their equally as intriguing and mysterious closing counterparts. I loved the slow build up from quiet discomfort and unsettling imagery to complete batsh!t insanity at the end. At the simplest and most superficial level , I just felt such a deep sympathy for Jennifer Lawrence's character. Watching people taking such disadvantage of her hospitality was harrowing to the bone. I guess that is some sort of metaphor for the destructive nature of mankind and how we treat Mother Nature, as well as other human beings. Again, I leave that for the more philosophically inclined among us to ponder. Looking at it purely cinematically, I thought it was gorgeously shot. There was a sense of discomfort and dread all throughout, without relying on cheap jumpscares or other gimmicks. Leave it to Aronofsky to give us plentiful colourful and gorgeous imagery. It had a very similar surreal vibe to The Fountain, another movie of his that I love. It came across as very organic and realistic, despite the obvious surrealistic nature of what was transpiring. Jennifer Lawrence was excellent, particularly in the first half of the movie. Seeing as she was the focus of pretty much every single shot, she needed to be. She was at her best as the friendly, but increasingly disgruntled and frustrated hostess. I do think in the more dramatic and loud scenes she has a tendency to become too screechy and somewhat over-the-top, but for the insanity of this movie, I think it worked. Javier Bardem's character is consistently sympathetic and frustrating throughout, a solid job by him as well as the rest of the supporting cast.All in all, another fantastic addition to an already impressive resume by Aranofsky. He is one of the best film makers currently around, and I am deeply excited and intrigued to see what he comes up with next.",10,0,3,9 January 2018
