Sucker Punch," You won't be prepared.
","Video game films are really popular nowadays. From Silent Hill, to Doom, to the slew of Resident Evil films there is big money in films that are based on video games or graphic novels, such as The Spirit or 300. Sucker Punch isn't based on a video game, and there's no graphic novel that shares its name, though there probably should be, and probably will be after someone sees the film and decides to create one, but it is done with the same style as these films. There's lots of fighting, and monsters and robots and other things usually saved for the video game.Baby Doll (Australian born actress Emily Browning) is locked away against her will, but her will isn't broken. She meets Rocket (Jena Malone), Rocket's sister, Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) and they band together to escape their prison, and along with it the evil Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino), before the High Roller (Jon Hamm) comes for Baby Doll. This is a fascinating film. The opening is one of the best you will ever see. Baby Doll kills her little sister by accident and is them put in a mental institution by her step father, but then everything changes. It's no longer a mental institution, it's a brothel. And the inmates are now dancers and 'working girls' at the brothel. This is the world you find yourself in. It goes further than that too as Baby Doll is forced to dance she imagines a world of evil Nazi robots and trolls as she and the others battle to get items to survive this world they've been trapped in. It's all pretty surreal, but beautiful to behold. Zach Snyder, the director, creates an amazing world, within a world, within a world, to enthrall us all with a visual epic beyond anything we've seen before.The acting by everyone involved is good. Emily Browning's Baby Doll is strong and self reliant, yet vulnerable and weak all at the same time, giving the character many layers. The stand out performances are from Oscar Isaac as the sleazy Blue and Carla Gugino's Madam Gorski. Blue is creepy and slimy and exactly the kind of person you love to hate. Isaac oozes his way through the performance from the first moment you meet him to the moment he's dragged away. Gugino's Madam Gorski is a bad, good guy. She's a woman that seems to be in control, but is as trapped as the girls she's meant to control. She plays the two sides of the character with complete believability. It must be said, however, that the film looses steam a little in the middle. After the 50 robot has been killed and the same shot is used again it gets a little boring, but then picks up again for the end. It would have been nice to see something a little different in the middle.All in all this is a film for those that love the video game style of film, and there a lot of you out there. It's a feast for the eyes, both the girls and the shots, and action junkies will love it.<ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>",Null,2,4,17 May 2011
The Way Back," Saoirse Ronan is back on the big screen in a film about the endurance of the human spirit. The Way Back is a travel tour-de-force.
","Saoirse Ronan has got to be one of the busiest young actresses in Hollywood, and it's well deserved. Coming off her best supporting actress nomination a few years ago at the Oscars for Atonement, she's gone from strength to strength. She starred alongside Michelle Pfeiffer in I could never be your Woman, with Bill Murray and Tim Robbins in City of Ember, and an incredibly creepy Stanley Tucci in The Lovely Bones. This week she's starring alongside Ed Harris and Colin Farrell in the escape film The Way Back.After being accused of espionage in Russia during the height of communism, Zoran (Dragos Balkur) finds himself wrongfully imprisoned in a gulag in the heart of Siberia, his only thoughts ones of escape. At the gulag he meets Valka (Farrell), a thug and gangster with a knife that Zoran needs to escape. He also enlists Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), the only American in the gulag, to help with the escape and together with a few others they manage to break free from the gulag, but that's only the start of the story. From there they need to travel, on foot, thousands of miles into India, the only communist free country anywhere near them. Ronan stars as Irena, a Russian girl the escapees pick up along the way.This is a moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir, the director. The locations are gorgeous. From the harsh snow covered trees of Siberia, a terrifying blizzard blowing through the trees, to the stark, barren landscape of the deserts between Russia and China as they travel over the sand. The viewer gets the full brunt of the harsh conditions these men needed to survive to get to safety. The performances are also great. From Balkur's performance as a man that needs to escape inescapable odds to right a wrong he didn't even admit, to Farrell's scary performance as a killer and psychopath that loves the people who put him in the prison he finds himself in. Ronan is great as a girl that gets help from men that shouldn't be able to give it. She has the right balance of vulnerability and strength to make her great to watch.All in all, this is great inspirational movie that anyone that who enjoys a good prison escape film should watch, and keep a close eye out; Saoirse is in a second film hitting the big screen soon, Hanna, the action, thriller co-starring Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana comes out May 27th.<ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>",Null,0,1,17 May 2011
Thor," Jump head first into the fantastic world of the Norse gods, who then cross over to become fantastic super heroes.
","Superhero movies are huge at the moment. Currently, the second Batman release, The Dark Knight, is the highest grossing film of all time, but going back far further than that, back to the 80's, when the original Superman was released. What an impact that had on film. Then, with Batman later, the era of the superhero film had begun. But those are both DC heroes, and, at the moment, Marvel seems to be the topic of the day. From the original Spiderman, which was a resounding success, a fourth re-vamped version being released later this year, to The Incredible Hulk and the two Fantastic Four Films, Marvel has taken the reigns. Thor is no exception.Born to the King of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) grows to be a great warrior, but he is too full of himself, and a little to keen to fight rather than talk, so when Asgard is invaded by a rebel group of Ice Giants, the inhabitants of one of the other realms the Asgardians control, Thor wants to destroy them. Odin orders him to stay in Asgard, but, with a little tempting by his younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the god of mischief, Thor and a group of warriors from Asgard go to battle the Ice Giants, needing to be rescued by Odin. After returning to Asgard Odin punishes Thor by banishing him from his home and sending him to Earth to live among the humans as one of them. On Earth Thor meets Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a physicist studying the great machine that allows the Asgardians to travel between worlds, but what she thinks is just strange weather formations. With her help Thor discovers that some things cannot be solved with relentless violence, and he learns the true power of love as well.This is one of the highlights of this year's movie calendar. The effects are huge, the action is pounding and the story is comic-licious. Every person performs their roles with precision. Chris Hemworth is both big and foreboding as the hammer wielding god of thunder, but at the same time brings a vulnerability to the character that make his plight completely believable. Anthony Hopkins is his fantastic self as the king of this incredible place, trying to groom his sons in the best way he knows to be good kings, and Natalie Portman is great looking. Her role in this film is not the acting stretch that she had in Black Swan, but a film like that comes maybe once in a persons career. She is a good science bound woman in this film and looks really good doing it. The stand out in the film is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He brings a devilish charm to the character that makes him slimy, yet sympathetic. You actually find yourself understanding his reasons for his actions, and partly empathising with him.All in all, Kenneth Branagh, the director, has done a great job with this film. Now we need to wait for Captain America, releasing August 5th, and then The Avengers, which is releasing sometime next year, and our comic filled lives will be complete.<ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>",Null,3,6,17 May 2011
