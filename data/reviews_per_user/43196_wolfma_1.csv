","This is a very good movie (great story), very funny (good dialogs), good visuals (the commercial makes the movie look more brown-in-brown than the movies is), great actors (Woddy Allen is just hilarious!) ... 9/10! Don't take the little ones. I do not understand why everyone believes be has to be able to drag his 3year old into the theatre just because it is an animated story! The movie is PG and probably because of the language, I think the language was OK for my 3rd and 5th graders, but nothing for kindergarten - your mileage might vary ...",9,0,0,18 October 1998
