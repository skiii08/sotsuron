The Avengers," The epitome of Hollywood.
","The epitome of Hollywood. Prepare to spend the next two and a half hours of your day in a movie theater feeling as though you are on a ride at Universal Studios. Don't get me wrong, it was extremely entertaining...but entertainment only gets a few points in my book when it comes to critiquing movies. It is very predictable and follows a plot line that a twelve year old could have come up with. No disrespect to any Avengers fans but it was extremely cheesy. Who would have thought that the Incredible Hulk was so strong? I wish that I could relate to not only the heroes but also to the villains. They are very alien-Esq and the movie felt more like Transformers than anything else.",6,4,13,6 May 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Dark and hilariously twisted film that is nothing about a Cabin in The Woods
","With each day that has passed since I watched this movie, I find myself giving this movie a much better and better rating. It is unlike any horror movie you will ever see. The epitome of a roller coaster ride, with the last half hour of the film taking you in a direction that you never imagined possible. Slightly humorous in the sense that it pulls us in and repels us at the same time. I want to look away, but it is just too much fun. For not knowing anything about the film going in, I feel that this was the type of movie where it doesn't matter what you know going in. Leave your expectations at home. It's not about a Cabin in the Woods. For those of you who feel that you can predict the ending, I can assure you that it is the last possible thing you could ever suspect.",9,2,15,17 April 2012
