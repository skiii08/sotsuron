The New World," The audience is going to be crying.
","I watched this movie because it has historical value. I feel that this story should be told the exact way it was. Altogether the film maker is trying to get the point of the migration from England to the new world. I feel he was also trying to get across everything wrong that we did in the past, so it may not happen again. The actors had limited wardrobe and acting had to be real. Examples as crying, or fighting, or yelling, or anger. There was a lot about this movie and it's historical accuracy that I found that could have been very very wrong. Simply because we have no first hand proof to confirm many of the things that happened. I can't really think of any movies that I could relate this too. Or make a connection with because in all honesty I don't watch older movies.
I really did enjoy how it portrayed the Indians by being fascinated with all of the Englishmen weapons, tools, and culture. I enjoyed how well they portrayed many of the fights being because of the Englishmen and what they wanted to take.
I did not enjoy how poorly the acting was portrayed with emotions.",5,0,0,30 August 2018
The Alamo," THIS MOVIE WAS CRAZY
",This movie I feel was one of the most historically accurate movie I've ever seen. It showed heavy detail on both sides of the Alamo and what it meant to the Texans and the Spanish. All together this movie was one of my favorites we watched in class. It has a great story line and transitions from scene to scene very smoothly. The acting in this movie was very good as well and it truly showed the pain that mexico and Texas had to deal with at the time.,10,1,4,15 October 2018
