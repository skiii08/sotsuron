Angels & Demons," Masterpice has been ruined.
","First of all: If I was Dan Brown I would sue Ron Howard for public embarrassment and ruining masterpiece.If you read a book, you see it's truly masterpiece, one of a kind. You cannot stop reading till the end because of extraordinary writing of Dan Brown.The movie is awful try to do something masterful like Dan Brown did.It's just that movie is too different, it contains too many changes.Like: Assassin, who is Algerian and strong, in the movie plays white man with glasses, not showing any strength at all. And he doesn't die in explosion! There is no reporter in the movie! The reporter is connecting the whole story together.Not to mention director of CERN.And at the end in the movie is elected wrong pope that in the book.IT'S JUST WRONG WHAT THEY DID.THEY RUINED MASTERPIECE.",6,1,2,23 May 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter
","My vote is 7/10. Why? All the excitement that was around all the previous Harry Potter movies is now gone. I haven't got any tickle when I was walking towards the cinema to see it. Neither, when I left cinema. Well, OK, new movie of Harry Potter may serve the real Harry Potter fans with new movie to see; once, twice and then that's it. Real movie for fans is to see for 45 times! No impression! Moments of movie were exciting, filled with music but as a whole movie I'd say it was boring! Harry Potter wasn't supposed to be boring! All the books are masterpiece written like once in a while! And not to mention differences between book and movie. It's normal to see abnormalities, but so many? Like I was watching whole new story! That's just wrong. If I would not be such a fan of writing J.K.Rowlings I'd rate movie 5/10. It was just made for money! Still hoping for the very good last part of it.",7,1,3,18 November 2010
