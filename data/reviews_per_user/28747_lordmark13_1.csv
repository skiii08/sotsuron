The Incredible Hulk," Deserves more credit than it is given
","I really believe this movie deserves a lot more credit than it is given. That being said I felt odd about Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. Norton fills the role of an emotionally distance awkward skinny man perfectly, but Bruce Banner is one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe, and that was not shown on screen. However, the scripting and directing was well done. The progression from not seeing the Hulk transformation at all in Brazil, slightly showing it in the University, and finally the full on transformation in Sterns lab. The visuals were able to capture the torment of his transformation with spine chilling accuracy(shoulders dislocating and relocating). And finally the underlying idea that Hulk wasn't completely invulnerable. He wasn't that overconfident invulnerability we see in Superman(where he can calmly fight crime). The Hulk had signs of weakness which keeps the character grounded through the movie. Finally, the movie was able to capture the potential for good and the idea that will power can overcome other struggles in your body was depicted very well. Finally the use of the iconic line 'Hulk SMASH!' was perfect. This is a movie worth re-watching.",10,2,3,13 September 2011
