Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Someone should stop George Lucas
","The first Star Wars movie was nice. During the 2nd I started to yawn. And the 3rd?? But it doesn't even stop there; no, lets make another three Star Wars movies and make some more money. Someone should tell Georgie-boy that it's more cute with bad effects in a movie than computer-developed ones. Star Wars number 4 is a really bad bad bad movie. I don't want to know anything about Obi-Wan Kenobi as young. And I don't want to see an ugly little kid play Anakin Skywalker. I'm content with Yoda having wrinkles and Anakin sounding like a computer with asthma. I DON'T WANT ANOTHER THREE MEANINGLESS MOVIES ABOUT THE STAR WARS!",Null,0,1,21 April 2002
