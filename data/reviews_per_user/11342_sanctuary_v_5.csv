The Avengers," Not as Good as people are saying
","That was one of the worst B.S. comic book movies ever. It's as bad as the first Hulk movie and the Green Lantern movie with Ryan Reynolds. Some of the scenes in the Avengers, from the beginning to end, were complete non- sense, very unnecessary, felt forced, lack creativity and almost amateurish. I don't understand the high ratings, and the high gross for the movie, which is attributed to the $50.00 (3D fees) per person. Are some of you people on some kind of drugs? Maybe Inhaling too much theater popcorn chemicals or something? Brain-washed by Joss Whedon? I loved his movies and TV shows, but 1hr and 40mins before we see any real actions? and You guys think it's a good movie? Come on, It's the same crap as the first Hulk movie. By the way, Ruffalo sucks as Banner. Ed Norton was great on the second Hulk movie. Stop sniffing the popcorn chemicals, please!!!",5,7,20,8 May 2012
Man of Steel," Spoiler Alert. Skip the 1st Hour of this boring Garbage
","There's an old saying (Modified to today's Generation) 'There's a sucker born every SECOND.' Spoiler Alert: The first half of this movie is so boring, I instantly thought about the Green Lantern movie, and how much I enjoyed it over this garbage, and I did not like Green Lantern. I hear some 'Suckers' saying how 'Awesome' and 'Great' Man of Steel is, and they are going to watch it twice or 3 times. Just because some movies make tons of money (Suckers) that doesn't mean that they are good (e.g.: Avengers = Boring) I pretended that this Man of Steel was The Eradicator or even Ultra Man, and it still sucks. David S. Goyer is the worst thing that happen to movies and Chris Nolan is just not a superhero director/producer . His Batman movies are not bad, but not good either. He just got lucky to direct an iconic character. Sorry 'Losers' he is not the 'Genius' that you guys think that he is.",1,12,27,18 June 2013
The Dark Knight," Horrible Movie!!!
","I went to see 'Dark Knight' because of Heath Ledger, only. 'Batman Begins' SUCKED, Chris Nolan SUCKS. 'Batman Begins' made no sense at all(For people with brains, that is). (Spoiler) First; Chris Nolan's direction was nauseating, there were too many camera movements during some action scenes, where they could have been better without. Second; Nolan under-used the best villain in the movie(Scarecrow) and mis-casted the other one(Ra's al Ghul-Watanabe should have remained and Liam Neeson should have been out). Third; During Bruce Wayne's training on top of the mountain, he was asked to execute a 'Perp', he refused, than started a brawl with the clan, burned down the monastery, killed most of the clan, including the 'Perp' that he refused to kill in the first place, and saved the life of the one person that he should have let die(No common sense at all). (Spoiler) I had hoped that 'Dark Knight' would be better, with less camera movements(Didn't happen). There were cameras rotating in circles around people just standing still(Very annoying and un-professional, it's bad for people with REM(That's 'Rapid Eye Movements' and ear infections). Nolan did used his villains well in the 'Dark Knight'. The Non-Traditional Joker was maniacal in a good way, Two-Face was well used, he did a great job, even Rachel Dawes was wonderful. (Spoiler) The bad part about this movie was the Batman himself. If all these people who commented on this movie, actually saw the same movie that I saw, they should also note that Batman did absolutely nothing in this movie, there was nothing 'Dark' and nothing 'Knight' about Batman. All he did was abused and brutalized the Joker, inside a police interrogating room, no less(Amazing), when the Joker was already dazed and drained. There was a couple of minutes of fist-fighting with the Joker on top of a balcony, but nothing confrontational, or face Two-Face(Ha-I made a funny).(Spoiler) There was a ridiculous scene, where a couple of citizens dressed as Batman, doing their own vigilante things, using automatic weapons, and costumes that looked like Batman's(How/where did they get those copied costumes?), fighting a hooded Scarecrow, I think(Nolan left us with no details). If it was the real Scarecrow, I'm sure he would have used his 'Fear Agents'.(Spoiler) The writing was bad for Bruce Wayne as well, he had a few tacky lines, that made him look more stupid and repulsive, instead of pretend-clumsiness from Tim Burton's Batman. If you have a brain inside your skull, save your money for the DVD, at least you will get more extras for your money. Ignore those 'Fanatic' nerds, who believes that 'Dark Knight' is a great movie. Watch it for Heath Ledger only, on DVD.",1,19,45,14 August 2008
The Wolverine," No words to describe how bad/terrible this movie is
","Spoiler alert everywhere!!!!! Watching Wolverine was like watching a Direct-to-DVD movie, or a TNT made-for-TV B-movie (And I enjoy TNT original movies). Before watching this waste, please leave your brain outside the door. The laws of Physics, Science, and Common Sense does not apply in this movie. Besides being boring for most part of the movie, the biggest problem was the acting. Those actors make Wolverine: Origin look like a masterpiece. Some of us knew that this movie was not going to be great, but for it to be worst than Wolverine: Origin? How is that possible? So many unnecessary scenes; from Jean Grey, to Viper-Lady (What was that about? reminds me of the Anime: Ninja Scroll with the Snake Lady Assassin shedding her skin), to fighting Yakuzas, to Hookers, to White Slavery, to running around everywhere, to Minjas? (And I love Ninjas too, just not in this garbage) What was the point of slicing off Wolverine's claws? I still don't get that part. They had a good villain like; Silver Samurai to challenge Wolverine, and Marvel, yet again, ruin it for all of us comic book purists out there, the same way Marvel ruined Iron Man 3 with the British/Hindu Mandarin. Jackman 'is' Wolverine, but he needs to say something when the writing and directing does not make any sense, even for a comic book character. Do not waste your money on this B-Movie, borrow it from an associate or something, when it comes out on DVD.",1,7,14,31 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," YOU PEOPLE NEED AN ENEMA!!!! - Joker (Jack Nicholson) from Batman
","How could some of you people (Brainwashed, Blind, Mentally Challenged, Something)give this garbage good ratings? The Adam West Batman Movie with the 'Bat-Shark repellent' was more realistic and believable than this retarded (Insulting) manure. The first Dark Knight sucked, the second one was good, this one is a waste of 'EVERYTHING'. Tim Burton's versions will always be the best and most true to the Batman myth and icon. Read the Batman comics in the Late 80's and all the 90's. Bane was a Latin character, not James Bond-like British. Bane was 'The Muscle' 'The Brute' 'The Goon' 'The Caveman', not 'The Brain', not a 'Criminal Mastermind' with a cult-like followers. What a piece of shiite. The Catwoman intro had been done before by Tim Burton. The same mistletoe scene and everything. Best Batman Comics to read: Detective Comics #583-594 and 601-621.Any Batman books by those 2 guys: Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle",1,12,23,5 December 2012
