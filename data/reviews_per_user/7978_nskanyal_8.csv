The Perks of Being a Wallflower," not just a typical teen movie; its for everybody
","Standing in the line for tickets, with all these less-than-20-years ahead of me, I was a bit worried, but this movie goes beyond being just for a specific age group and might be one of the best in the last couple of years. I haven't been in an American high school but don't have to, in order to enjoy, understand and relate to this movie. Charlie is a more-than-typical introvert who while being extremely bright and sincere, has severe problems making friends, but ends being the best friend to two seniors (Sam and Patrick). Sam and Patrick are free liberal souls (with their own personal problems), who on the exterior are polarly different from Charlie and they want different things in life. But, they care for each other, they like each other's company, and I think like everybody else they are bound by one common aspiration - 'to be happy'. I think this is one of those movies where you want it to move really slow and you are not waiting for what next to happen, but instead you want to fully absorb what is happening in that scene. My most favorite scenes in the movie are when Sam and Charlie are alone in her bedroom, and when they tell about their feeling for each other. Entire cast is great, especially Emma Watson, who was extremely graceful in this movie. Director Stephen Chbosky has done an amazing job, and might have created his career's best work. I would expect this movie to be at least nominated for academy best picture.",9,2,4,13 October 2012
Rang De Basanti," Its a beauty - A must watch movie
","For those who are yet to watch this movie, beware of any pre-conceived notions: First, its not a patriotic movie, but the tagline could not have been better - 'A generation awakens'. Second, this movie is not just being pulled by Aamir Khan i.e. this is just not his movie. It is much more than that; each and every character's role has been justified - a bunch of friends, each with a completely different personality from others. The guys (and gal) who just believe in fun/frolic, most of them are afraid of getting out of their college life cocoon, don't have slightest inkling of the real world, are always the first to complain about the system, and at the same time won't take any responsibility.Hats off to such a good direction by Rakesh Mehra. The way he has presented the idea of transition of wayward youths to something of today's young krantikari (similar that of 1920's pre-independence India) was simply amazing. Its a novel idea, presented brilliantly. A quite colorful movie with a real life touch. Few people complained to me its not so realistic, its not so easy to kill defense minister; oh! now come on - give them a break. It could not have been more real for a movie. Apart from that, 'spontaneous' dialogues by Prasoon Joshi, presented by Aamir Khan/Sharmaan Joshi were too good. I am really pleased to be able watch such movies from bollywood in my youth, when uptil 5 years ago, it was just that mushy/melodramatic stories. Seriously!! some very good stuff is coming out from the Indian cinema nowadays.",10,1,5,3 February 2006
American Hustle," The cast absolutely rocks
","what you have is one of the best performances of the recent times by the 'entire' cast (not just couple of them). Christian Bale is the master of makeover and is so much into character and at times hard to believe that the same guy played the famous caped crusader. Amy Adams was fabulous in 'The Master' and is completely convincing as a conniving ruthless seductress. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable, playing that crazy, eccentric and loud mouthed wife - she might be the best female actor to have happened in last few years and next decade or so belongs to her. Bradley Cooper is great with his funny hair playing that over-zealous fed who wants to shake the whole system. I might be stretching it, but Renner has that aura of Joe Pesci. I absolutely loved everyone in the movie. For me the story/plot was not the most original of all. If you have seen many of these, you know how it is going to end and who is gonna win. Sometimes, the predictable trying too hard with the cover of unpredictability (and all those twists and turns) can be off-putting. But, script is extremely tight and gripping. The chemistry between all the characters is almost natural. The dialogues are well thought and are timely hilarious. The camera and lighting, the costumes, hair-dos all take you to that 70-80s era. In all, a great job!",8,5,12,21 December 2013
Apocalypse Now," This movie is not from this world
","Were they not the real soldiers? Was it not the real war? Was that not the real horror? Have the people not really gone insane? Was the movie really made on this planet and by some mortal human beings? Was it a video documentary or was it a movie made 5 years after the real war? Yes, to all of the above, but I have never ever seen any movie so close to reality or actually real. It was not a war movie, it was not a drama, it was simply a deeply touching horror drama. I am still wondering what should I make out of this movie, should I feel anything, should I be sorry about anybody – if yes, about who?? American soldiers, Vietnamese, those tribals, each one of these or nobody? Coppola doesn't leave anything obvious and everything is open to your own interpretation – he is at his arrogant best. Man, it takes inhuman guts to make such a movie or even think of doing it. He was fortunate to supported by such a able and gutsy team of editors, script writer, screenplay writers, cinematographer and so many other people. I am really surprised and disappointed that this movie was not awarded academy for Film Editing – it's as ridiculous as it can be. My head still spins from imagining all these people living in those swamps and malaria invested waters for almost 2 years.Talking about the cast, I would rather say that movie and its makers go way beyond the cast. Any other actors may have done equal justice (if not less) to the movie. This may sound highly uncharitable, especially to Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall (I don't mention Brando – he was rather a waste, Coppola may have utilized that money somewhere else – am I speaking out of my shoes?? ). Sheen was awesome awesome and hats off to all his effort, and it was rather wise (or fortunate) not to have Al Pacino in his place, but the movie is not about Captain Willard, Col. Kilgore and Col. Kurtz, it about everything around each of them – it goes way beyond all these people.In the end, 'The End' will stay as my personal favorite for the most apt movie soundtrack of all times.10/10",10,4,5,12 August 2009
Blood Diamond," 'you find yourself a good man, alright Maddy'
","For me, there are three stories going on simultaneously in this movie. First is about the state of Sierra Leone and infighting over blood diamonds - this goes on in the background and forms the basis of whole movie. Second one is about Leonardo, the soldier, smuggler and the survivor, along with Solomon Vandy, the native, fisherman, and a father, and their search for the diamond and their lives in between. Third is the relationship between Connelly and Leonardo - I don't know if I can give it any name, but I don't think I have ever seen such a powerful unexpressed chemistry between two characters in any other movie (and I haven't seen Casablanca or Gone with the wind). There is no kiss, no hug, not even a handshake, there are just words, there are just unexpressed expressions through the eyes, movements of the throat and thats all you need (just to clarify I am more of a mafia, drama, biopics, history genre kind of a guy) Connelly is as beautiful as she has always been, even in her unglamorous journalistic attire, and is quite convincing in her character (perhaps too good looking). Leonardo is natural self, which means fabulous, may be at par with his Howard Hughes role in Aviator. In all, its a very tightly written gripping script - I watch it every time it is on TV (sometimes just to get to the last scene between Leonardo and Connelly). Pity that it didn't get any academy - I would have expected it to at least win for supporting actor or editing.",9,4,6,12 April 2013
Enemy at the Gates," simply awesome war movie - one trying to capture the human emotions
","I must have watched this movie more than 10 times and every time I have started liking it even more. First half hour of the movie is as stunning (or horrifying) as can be for a war movie, with young soldiers just out of their teens, moving towards an unknown destination, unaware of their fate/destiny, most of the times even unaware of the cause they are fighting for, forced to fight an enemy with superior arms. The way the human emotion has been portrayed is simply amazing - Danilov's liking (or lust) for Tania, for the same reason his envy and jealousy towards Vassili who was once his best friend, Sacha's believe in Vassili's victory, König's one eyed focus to get rid of Vassili.Generally, war movies lack in the thing that they show just story of one side. This movie prominently deals with the story of Russians, but there is a genuine effort to tell about Germans too. Definitely, this is a story of real people (and heroes) in a real war. An amazing performance by all the actors - Jude Law, Ed Harris, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and young Gabriel Thomson - and above all by director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Kudos to all of them.",10,3,6,18 November 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess, overboard, over the top?? - keep it coming, give me more of it
","Goodfellas was the gold standard - it starts with unimaginable intensity and it ends with the same. While, goodfellas has the best ever portrayal of how mobsters might live their life and think about others, TWOWS gets close to telling a powerful story about debauchery, greed and extravagance in disdainful, abhorrent and empathy-lacking life of wallstreet traders. As 'Rolling Stone' review says Scorcese has taken it over the moon, but you are going to completely love it. The movie is 3 hours long, but I could have controlled my bladder for 30 more minutes and taken on more of this magic. During all these 3 hours, I might have lost a little grip for a total of just 5 minutes. WSJ review says something about this being lengthy and being repetitive, mind-numbing drama. Really?? Suck it, grow up and learn something about movies and about storytelling.I have been waiting for this movie for quite some time now and it turned out to be even better than I expected it to be. Leonardo has added another very strong bullet on his ever expanding resume. The movie is all about his character - I think he is there on screen for 90% of the movie. That scene where Leo is high on Quaaludes and drives back from country club, might be one of the funniest and among the best ever performances. Perhaps, this might be his lucky year for the Oscars. Jonah Hill is simply awesome, right from the point where he meet Leo and wants to work for him. The script, screenplay and dialogues are off the charts. This is dark and crude humor (and at times crass and outrageous) at its best, and the filmmakers make no attempt to sway away from that overall theme. I think movie lost a little intensity towards the end, and probably the last 15 minutes were its weakest. But, in-all this is among the best of this year. Thanks yet again Mr. Scorcese for all the entertainment.",9,3,13,25 December 2013
Ran," Japanese cinema at its best - a gift from Akira Kurosawa
","Last night, I had this rare fortune of watching one more of Akira Kurosawa's magic 'Ran'. If you still haven't been able to lay your hands on it, make it the first thing on your priority list. How I wish, 'Seven Samurai' could have been made in color. This movie is a pure joy to watch  as good as are other attributes of the movie, the cinematographic excellence leaves any other movie ever made so far behind. I have liked 'The Last Samurai' for its imagery and amazing color presentation, but even that movie pales if compared to 'Ran'. Opening scene is spellbinding - music score along with those moments of deafening silence is way too good. No doubt, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made. Lord Hidetora is superiorly awesome (especially when he turns mad) and Lady Kaede at times seems to be even more ruthless than Nurse Ratched (was in 'One flew over cuckoo's nest'). Also, so many subtle and some not so-subtle references to Buddha are timely and apt. However, I would confess that movie is not perfect - the attack on the third castle is more or less ordinary, and I do wonder how even in that wilderness, Kyoami was able to maintain squeaky clean clothes for himself and his master. So, if you really love movies, go and grab it - a movie must to watch before you die!!!",9,4,9,21 December 2008
