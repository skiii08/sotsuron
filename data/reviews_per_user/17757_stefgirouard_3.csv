First Man," Great story bad technic
","Watched it in Imax
extremely disappointed with the shakky camera.
My wife had to close her eyes 50 % of the time...
Barely watchable...
Just stayed because of 70$ paid for the entry...",4,1,3,27 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Must see movie
","My wife, my daughter 13 years old and I we just love this movie!
If you want to enjoy two hours go see this movie.
Like Queen music, a mix of humanity, rock, life, love, family.",10,3,5,3 November 2018
Joker," Oscar get ready for Joaquin!
","I tough Joaquin Phoenix was on the top of his art in gladiator.
Got it wrong, with Joker he just killed it.
He will bring you in a dark dark spot of the human soul.
And the worst it's not looking fantasy at all.
an incomparable performance by Joaquin Phoenix.",10,1,2,19 October 2019
