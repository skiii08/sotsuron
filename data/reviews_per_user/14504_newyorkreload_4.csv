The Ring," One time special, the VHS is better then DVD...
","Me personally I found The Ring a bit creepy. But then again I let it be. I can watch any type of zombie movie that can be thrown at me. But this movie has a less then direct way of getting to you. An artistic approach to the typical what's 'behind the door' style of suspense really lets this movie push people's senses. When the movie first starts you won't really know where there going but after the first 15 there is a defining moment in the movie that will keep you weirded out for the remainder of the film. But as it's been stated before, only of you let it be. I heard a few rumors about this film that `It's the next best horror / suspense film since 6th sense'. So I dimmed the lights except a candle or two and challenged the movie to get to me. With the DTS on full alert (Try it in Pro Logic II for the hard core VHS guru's out there). I was well surrounded by the unique yet eerie sounds this film had to offer. And let me tell you the sounds are the money makers with this film. The plot can easily be put on paper; the film can be easily watched. But if you let the sound put you in the movie... be prepared to be crept out... for a few nights. I watched this on DVD but I have a good feeling for those of you that watch it at home on a quiet night on VHS. You probably will get a little more out of the experience of this movie then the rest of us...//NYReload  (10 out of 10)",10,1,1,11 March 2003
Resident Evil," This is not the game i know and love, but it still is a tasy treat.
",This movie could of been better if they stuck to the same story as the game. As a finished product it has very little in common with the game that it's based on. But as a single entity it's okay. To sum it all up. 'It didn't suck but could have been better'.,7,0,0,16 September 2002
From Hell," Se7en meets Sleepy Hallow
","If you've seen and liked 'Se7en' or 'Sleepy Hallow' you most likely will enjoy 'From Hell'. I viewed it on it's region 1 DVD with the DTS sound track. The first thing I noticed was the sound. It puts you right in the middle of an eerie environment that can only get more creepy. It really gives your surround speakers something to play with. Then there is the film. The scenes that stuck out to me best were the flickers of grainy, distorted flashbacks that i can best describe as 'Something out of a Marlin Manson Video'. The whole ambience fits both the story of a serial killer and the slums of old London. The makers of this 'almost epic' did a good job making it hard for the viewer to figure out who was Jack the Ripper. It was a relief to me since in the past couple years most crime stories end up being predictable. I've been told that this movie is based on a book. I haven't read it so i can't judge the film based on how well it fallows the book.
I give it 9/10 I was looking for a good old' crime story and it ended up killing more then just a couple of hours.",9,1,2,1 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded indeed, but I think a round is missing from this clip.
",I was lucky enough to watch a Wednesday night sneak prescreening of Matrix Reloaded. I must say this movie is full of eye candy. You can definitely tell where the money went. The weirdest part one may find will be after the viewing of over 2 hours of eye candy. You'll be home wondering what just happened. I don't want to give anything away but this movie definitely leaves us viewers with big expectations for November's release of Matrix Revolutions. Now there is no doubt that the masses waiting for 'Star Wars' or 'Lord of the Rings' to finished their tales will be content seeing this stories conclusion.It's just too bad we have to wait until November for it. 9/10,9,0,0,15 May 2003
