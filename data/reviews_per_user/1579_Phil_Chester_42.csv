10 Cloverfield Lane," Ruined by the ending
","Some great filmmaking on display, with fabulous suspense and mystery sustained so well for the majority of the running time. This was so good until the CGI fest at the end ruined it and threw away all the credibility that they had spent so long building. (Minus one star for that.) Part of the story recalls the 1961 Twilight Zone episode 'The Shelter' and the ending recalls 'A Quiet Place' (although that was obviously made after this). Both comparison films are better, though. Such a shame.",Null,0,0,9 October 2019
Source Code," A bit half-baked
","Definitely an interesting idea, but the execution is a little half-baked, especially the big reveal about Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Almost feels like a low-budget film given too much money for its own good, as it's too contained to be truly involving. Short enough not to get boring, but difficult to recommend.",Null,0,2,29 January 2020
The Young Victoria," Mixed feelings
","I have such mixed feelings about this film. I so wanted to like it - it has much to commend it, such as the excellent acting and gorgeous production design, but fundamentally the story is flimsy and the locations annoyed me - eg Ham House looks nothing like Kensington Palace (for which it is doubling), which really pulled me out of the story. Overall, the film really adds up to a big 'meh', but a nice looking one.",Null,0,0,1 September 2018
Fury," Hell that is war
","We all know that war is hell, and here is yet another film telling us that again. However, one of the strengths of 'Fury' is that it also shows that every stolen moment of respite that these soldiers try to make for themselves is also taken away from them by the hell that is war. By turns chilling and terrifying, you definitely get a sense of how senseless war is. Undoubtedly worth a watch.",Null,0,1,5 May 2019
Last Flag Flying," Another watchable Linklater film
","Linklater's films are always watchable, but this one is fascinating, because it's clearly an example of a project that has been 'cast up'. An underwhelming, 'meh', by-the-numbers script has had a stellar ensemble of actors attached and their performances lift the film to another level and make it more entertaining. There's really very little new or inherently great here, but the film is worth a watch nonetheless.",Null,0,2,16 June 2018
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Difficult to recommend
","Well, it's a bit 'meh', actually. There are some nice scenes from time to time, but it's all a bit empty. For a film with 'love' in its title, there is precious little affection displayed here. I can't help but feel sorry for Marisa Tomei's character, who gets used and dumped in such a heartless way. Difficult to enjoy and even more difficult to recommend.",Null,2,3,16 June 2018
The Babadook," Plays expertly on your fears
","I vividly remember as a child being afraid of the monsters in the wardrobe and at the end of my bed. This film plays expertly on those fears. It shows just how fragile a woman's mental health can be after a tragic life-changing incident. And it's so sad that her son is caught in the crossfire. Featuring 2 beautiful central performances, this film is highly recommended.",Null,1,1,19 September 2019
The Girl Next Door," Kind of all right
","Not great, but not bad either. Decidedly in the middle, with some seriously worn-out tropes, which border on embarrassing to watch 15 years after the fact. Mildly amusing, but it's been done better since. One of the most cringe-inducing aspects is the usual Hollywood problem of over-25-year-olds playing 18-year-olds. It just doesn't work, never has and never will. Also, the tone is a little difficult to gauge, with plenty of swearing taking it into R-rated territory, but then they pussy-foot around the sex, making it feel PG. It gives the impression that they haven't quite got the balance right.",Null,0,1,1 January 2019
Orphan," More of a thriller than a horror
","Very slow to get going and uses some seriously cliched tropes to set the story up. But, once the fuse is lit, the ride is really entertaining. Some great acting, especially by the children, and a very competent job all round by the rest of the cast and crew. Definitely worth a watch.",Null,1,2,19 August 2018
Midnight in Paris," Slight, but watchable
","For Woody Allen, this is quite shamefully weak material. What a great concept, but so badly executed, with paper-thin characters and appallingly laissez-faire direction. How far Allen has fallen since the heady days of Purple Rose of Cairo.",Null,1,2,10 April 2019
Milk," Powerful filmmaking
","Who'dathunk that a political drama could be so involving and watchable? Well, this one is. It feels very simple and straightforward, but Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk is so charming and powerful that you fall under his spell really quickly. You find yourself rooting for him, so when he finally wins his 4th election attempt, you almost want to jump up and shout in celebration. Very powerful filmmaking and highly recommended.",Null,0,1,4 August 2019
The Bodyguard," Silly, but entertaining
","Watching it well over 25 years after it was made, this is a really slow moving film, by modern standards. The plot is paper thin and Whitney Houston's performance is variable, but it's still somehow surprisingly watchable. Very silly, but definitely entertaining.",Null,1,2,17 February 2019
Pacific Rim," Almost pointless
","Long, drawn-out and insubstantial. A kind of Transformers for a more intelligent audience, but that really isn't saying much at all. There is some semblance of a story, but you don't care a fig for anyone and there's absolutely no sense of jeopardy. Overall, almost pointless.",Null,0,2,29 May 2018
The Lost City of Z," Slow, plodding and ponderous
","It's really rather dull. Slow, plodding and ponderous. Certainly doesn't reward your viewing time. There's precious little story here and what there is does not engage. Looks gorgeous, though.",Null,1,3,13 February 2019
Rush," Crazily entertaining
","On paper, this film has no right to be as crazily entertaining as it is. It's effectively a routine character study drama interspersed with some pulse-pounding driving sequences. But, oh, what characters they are, and so beautifully realised through the writing and acting. And what magnificent driving sequences - surely this is the film the F1 fans have been waiting for. Definitely recommended.",Null,2,4,8 June 2019
We're the Millers," Always entertaining
","This is so much more entertaining than you might expect. We've seen it a few times now and it never gets old. Ed Helms is a little under-used, but otherwise it really works. Definitely check your brain at the door and you'll smile your way through it.",Null,0,0,8 June 2018
The Lego Movie," Good in parts
","It's certainly entertaining up to a point, but the third act doesn't work for me. This film definitely thinks it's cleverer than it actually is. But, you can give it some slack, because the 'Everything is Awesome' song is so catchy.",Null,1,1,2 June 2018
Jackie," Glad we missed this at the cinema
","Unbelievably dull. Natalie Portman's 'authentic' accent is so incomprehensible that we couldn't work out what she was mumbling. Truly a Marlon Brando for our age. So glad we missed this at the cinema. Gave up watching after about 20-30 minutes. First time that's happened in years - we usually stick with a film to the end, but this one was just unbearable and, frankly, life is too short.",Null,0,0,29 May 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Missing: Script - If found, please forward to...
","Very slow and 'elegiac', which kind of fits the pace of the times, but it's also a meaningless visual tone poem in some ways, rather like a latter-period Terrence Malick film. Looks beautiful, as you'd expect from Maestro Deakins, and the actors do a really solid job, but where, oh where is the script? I couldn't find one and I had to sit through nearly 3 hours of this mess in search of it.",Null,1,7,2 June 2018
Tigerland," An easy watch, but clichéd
","Quite an engrossing and easy watch, despite the slow pace and slightly clichéd storyline. Farrell is impressive and Michael Shannon's cameo is an unexpected surprise bonus. There's nothing new here, and it feels very shoddily made for such a big budget film, but it's worth a look.",Null,0,0,23 May 2020
Liar Liar," Falls flat
","It's so difficult to get excited about this film. It's one of those classic '90s 'high concept' comedies, which are easy to describe, but always fall flat in the execution. Carrey doing his schtick is just painful to behold. Avoid. Unless you're a seriously hardcore Jim Carrey fan. And even then it might be a stretch.",Null,0,3,25 September 2019
Gone Girl," Pike is astonishing
","Like all of Fincher, this film is really lovely to look at. Rosamund Pike is perfect as the psycho Amy. But they did drop the ball a bit with the opportunity to play with the suspense over whether Nick is guilty of the murder. Story flow was a little bitty; it doesn't really build to a climax and just sort of peters out. It's still perfectly watchable, but it has some failings.",Null,0,0,22 June 2018
The Number 23," More miss than hit
","Joel Schumacher tends to have a hit or miss track record, and this is more of a miss for him. A potentially powerful idea is frittered away by Schumacher's obsession with style over content. The end result is OK and watchable, but it could have been so much more powerful.",Null,0,2,12 October 2018
The Game," Entertaining, but not great
","It's Fincher, so it looks and sounds fantastic. It's Douglas and Penn, so the performances are spot on. But it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders. Not emotionally engaging enough and too cerebral to really hook you in. Some great set pieces, but the coincidences required for the plot contrivance to work are just a step too far to be able to take it seriously. It's entertaining enough, but it ain't great.",Null,0,0,24 June 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," A near-masterpiece
","Another near-masterpiece by Edward Zwick; one of the greatest directors of our era. Quite small in scope, but so beautifully observed, with pitch-perfect performances, great casting and a suitably messed up script to reflect the workings of Fischer's mind. Really well done. My only beef is with Donna's sub-plot; it feels as if this whole thread exists solely for the cheap-shot tacky pay-off in the third act. Excising this material would have helped the film's pacing issues and improved the whole. I expect better from Mr Zwick, but this is definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,0,26 May 2020
The Imitation Game," OK, but only a passing resemblance to the facts
","It's OK, and it's entertaining enough in its own way, but it has barely any link to the reality of the story, which makes it really annoying to watch. And Keira Knightley's accent is simply ridiculous. Overall, 'Enigma' was so much better.",Null,2,2,6 October 2018
Silence," Nearly 3 hours of nothing happening
","Sorry, Marty. I know you're a filmmaking God and you've made some of my favourite films, but you've really messed up here. Looks great, well acted, but just SO dull to watch. It actually took me 6 sittings before I managed to get through this. Just not worth your time. Avoid.",Null,2,5,17 July 2018
The World's Fastest Indian," Touching and affecting
",A charming and life-affirming adventure story about a man pursuing his dream. Anthony Hopkins is so seductively appealing in a role that could have been written for him. Touching and affecting. Recommended.,Null,0,0,4 February 2020
Sinister," Pretty good horror film
","This is a pretty good horror film with some genuinely creepy moments in the first act that work very well. However, once the (POTENTIAL SPOILER) supernatural stuff came in, I was lost to the film - it's a personal bugbear of mine and I hate films where the solution to the mystery is some 'supernatural thing' happening. If they had said it was a supernatural horror before I saw it, I wouldn't have watched it. If you are into supernatural horror, then this is a very good example of one and you could add another star to the rating.",Null,0,0,20 August 2018
Love & Mercy," Confused
","Dull, confused and confusing. If they were trying to put you into Brian Wilson's messed-up head, they succeeded, for I had no idea what was going on. Avoid.",Null,0,0,8 May 2020
The Disaster Artist," Touching and funny
","A touching film about the power of friendship and brotherhood to overcome life's vicissitudes. And it's also a great laugh, with James Franco's impersonation of Tommy Wiseau worth the price of admission alone. Recommended for any kind of film fan.",Null,0,0,31 January 2020
30 Days of Night," Good-looking, but not frightening
","A good-looking, arty vampire film that fails to shock or scare. A great premise, but no real story progression, so it doesn't involve the viewer. Could have been better.",Null,0,0,24 February 2020
Music and Lyrics," A great premise, but no chemistry
","Hugh Grant is perfect as the washed-up '80s pop star resting on his laurels. Drew Barrymore is good as the ditzy plant girl who comes into his life. However, there's absolutely no chemistry between the leads, so when the romantic clinch comes, it's a bit out of left field. This makes it impossible to engage with the couple, so the only entertainment value derives from the knowing references to cheesy '80s pop culture. Fortunately, there are shedloads of those, so it's still largely a fun watch, but no real laughs to be had.",Null,0,0,9 May 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," It's kind of alright
","Like all mockumentaries, it kind of works, but isn't really funny enough to be a proper comedy. The tone is great and the archness of a fly-on-the-wall documentary is well re-created, but this is no David Brent and The Office work of next level meta-filmmaking. Overall, just mildly amusing, but with some great moments in amongst the average hokum.",Null,0,2,12 May 2019
Get Him to the Greek," Dreadfully bad
",Just dreadful. Terrible story and tone. An insult to your intelligence. Avoid.,Null,1,2,24 September 2018
Easy A," Lesser than the sum of its parts
","It's a great shame that they make such overt references to classic '80s teen rom-coms, such as 'Say Anything', 'Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles' &c., because what it instantly makes obvious is how much better those films are than this poor attempt. Easy A certainly has some moments, but the whole is lesser than the sum of the parts, making it a hard film to recommend.",Null,0,2,11 October 2019
Apollo 13," Compelling drama
","At nearly 25 years old, this film is still very watchable today. The launch CGI sequence looks pretty ropey by modern standards, but the dramatic tension and acting are still top notch. There's a large slice of American cornball every now and then, but on the whole it is a compelling drama and still very much worth a look.",Null,0,1,21 October 2019
Pineapple Express," Where are the laughs?
","This is kind of like 'Dude, Where's My Car?', but with more explosions, shoot-outs & car chases and fewer laughs. Pretty disastrous as a film, lacking any kind of coherence or entertainment value. Definitely one to avoid.",Null,1,1,10 May 2019
The Nice Guys," Terrible nonsense
","Just terrible. Begins interestingly enough, but then it falls apart, and by the midpoint it turns into a completely different film. A nonsensical, self-indulgent waste of time. Avoid.",Null,0,1,5 April 2020
Donnie Darko," Worth your time for sure
","It's coming up on 20 years old and we've all read those blogs about how it doesn't make sense, but this is still a very watchable film. One of the fascinating aspects is seeing the Gyllenhaal siblings and Seth Rogen in early roles, knowing how big they became in later years. You can definitely see the promise that they show here, so their subsequent careers are no surprise. This film is certainly still worth your time.",Null,0,1,11 July 2019
The Great Gatsby," Only for Gatsby adaptation completists
","Visually scintillating, which makes it very watchable, despite its failings. It has the momentum and stylings of an early-'80s Duran Duran pop promo, and just about as much meaning and profundity. Questionable casting in the shape of Mulligan and Maguire render the film flimsy and devoid of all impact. The Robert Redford version is still very much the definitive telling of this Great American tale, which has been much re-told. Only for Gatsby adaptation completists.",Null,0,0,24 May 2019
Sully," Pretty close to exemplary
","Tom Hanks delivers a beautiful performance (again). Clint Eastwood aids and abets with his usual light touch style and the story speaks strongly for itself. It's pretty much a text book example of how to make a film without needing too much in the way of flash and bang to get the point across. My only nit-pick is that Laura Linney as Sully's wife has a ridiculously under-developed role and I don't remember her even sharing a scene with her husband - they speak on the phone for the majority of the film, it seems.",Null,1,1,8 February 2019
