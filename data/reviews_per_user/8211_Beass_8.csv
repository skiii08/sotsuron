Casablanca," A classic !! :-)
","This movie is great ! :-)However, I wonder what kind of relationship Mrs.Lazlo/Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enjoys with Mr.Lazlo(Paul Henreid). In all their 'tender moments' together, they're kissing each other on the cheek and on the forehead ?? Do they have a platonic relationship ? Meanwhile the Rick Blaine(Humprey Bogart) and Ilsa(Ingrid B.) 'tender moments' are filled with more *passionate* kissing... Is it done so, just to make us (the viewers) prefer Rick's character or is it something else ??! :-O :-)) he he Maybe I'm just weird, but it seemed a little odd to me... How can she be 'torn' between a passionate kisser and a 'brotherly peck' on the forehead ? Hmmm...Anyway, there's nothing wrong with the movie. It's absolutely great ! Worth watching several times, in fact ! If not only to hear the famous lines being uttered... :-) A great classic ! :)",10,1,3,17 October 2005
Erin Brockovich," Excellent !
","Best Julia Roberts movie since 'Pretty Woman' ! Good acting, all around ! The story is very interesting although it is somewhat reminiscent of 'A Civil Action' with John Travolta. Apart from that, there were some great lines, and some very funny moments. The fact that the movie is based on a true story is definitely a plus. :-))I recommend it, if you like good drama.",9,1,1,7 July 2000
As Good as It Gets," My favourite movie ! :-)
","In my opinion, one of the best movies -ever ! I saw it in the theatres 3 times with different people, and it was great every time ! :-))  There's no wondering why Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt picked up Oscars for this movie ! My only regret is that Greg Kinnear didn't get his ! This is an excellent drama/romance/comedy. It makes you feel good and bad and all those feelings in between. :-)) It's a great movie to own too, as you can see it over and over, and still smile and laugh at the funny parts ! :-)) I , of course, have it in my favourite collection. :-)",10,0,0,2 August 2000
Snatch," Excellent fun ! Great movie !
","I loved it ! Very funny !! I was almost ROTFL. Great ! Best gangster/action/comedy since 'Pulp Fiction' !! Great actors ! Lots of great scenes ! Good music ! Some great transitions ! Likeable characters ! Even the nasty ones... A very interesting story.Outstanding acting by Dennis Farina, Brad Pitt & Vinnie Jones !Go see it as soon possible ! :-))I recommend it ! :-))Yours truly,Gualtier Maldee :-)",9,0,1,12 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It's NOT that great !
","Why ??-Because it is very repetitive, that's why.Here's the story in short:Bad man/creature/ghost/ting creates a powerful and evil ring. Anyone who possesses it and wears it becomes obsessed. Ring bad. Hence, someone (the hobnobs) must get rid of the evil ring. -so far so good. But then that's it ! From here on in, it's all travelling, fighting evil, more travelling, fighting more evil, even more travelling, and fighting even more evil. A pattern starts emerging...Yes, there are some nice effects and it looks real pretty, but the story blows chunks !!I don't care if the book is fantastic, I go to the cinema to see a good film, not a good book ! And in this case the film wasn't great.Special effects alone, does not a good movie make !",1,14,30,21 July 2003
The Green Mile," Excellent Drama ! :-)
","Yeah ! This movie, in my mind, is almost as good as 'The Shawshank Redemption' ! The plot is good, the actors are all great, and the music is fitting. I recommend it to people who enjoy watching good dramas, and academy award -performances ! Michael Clarke Duncan was nominated for his part, and Tom Hanks is excellent and should have been nominated... Lots of good scenes, maybe not suitable for the squeamish, since there are quite a few 'electric chair' -scenes which may be upsetting for some, but then these are not the scenes I refer to as 'good' either ! :-) I'm referring to the drama in the movie, and not the horror.I love Stephen King's 'normal' stories, they are great. Not such a big fan of his terror, blood and gore-stories, though -too weird for me. :-)",9,0,0,2 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," A wonderful film and a terrific story !
","The story is excellent and the actors all perform well. Never a boring scene. Good drama. Some scenes are even funny ! The plot is superb. I thought Stephen King only wrote horror-stories, but I guess I was wrong !If you see this movie on video, sit down and watch it all and LISTEN !  You have to pay attention! And then you'll love it !",10,0,0,15 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," A very scary movie !
","If you like scary movies, but you're not into a lot of blood and gore and splatter -you'll love this film. The story is good, the actors are all good; particularly the little boy, and the ending really makes you think. Surprise ending !The whole film is thrilling without being a run-of-the-mill movie.I recommend it.",10,0,0,4 November 1999
