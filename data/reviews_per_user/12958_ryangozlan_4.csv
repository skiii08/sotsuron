Black Swan," 'Black Swan' - Obsession Takes Control
","Though it is no masterpiece like Requiem For A Dream in my opinion, Aronofsky has made another good (but not excellent) movie in Black Swan. As I sat next to my buddy, he turned to me and asked, are we in a ballet or something? I couldn't help but laugh as I some would agree with that statement, though I was a little more open minded than my movie counterpart. There was scenes in the film that blew you away (and even made you feel a little uncomfortable), then there were scenes were you would have you saying enough ballet already, when is this scene going to pick up? Regardless of the films ups and downs, it managed to keep you interested for the majority of the film, which is what a good and director film does. There is little reason to believe that Black Swan won't be nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars, but in my opinion has a slim chance of actually winning, especially with this year's competition. Now, let's get something straight, I'm not here to rip this film to pieces, I'm just stating that my personal opinion that the film was a little different the most critics. With that being said, it is still a great piece of film making, with great directing, pace, and of course outstanding performances (especially from Natalie Portman).The cast in this movie was nothing short of spectacular. From Natalie Portman all the way down to Wynona Ryder, the acting in this film was extremely well done. Well let's start with the male lead in this role, played by French actor Vincent Cassell (Eastern Promises). Cassell was outstanding as the egotistical, seductive yet brilliant ballet teacher, displaying the characters strong, confident and desirable actions perfectly. The actor was able to make you hate him at times, but also respect him as well depending on the different scenes in the film. Mila Kunis, who is known for more comical roles, didn't disappoint playing Lily (or the Black Swan). Her ability to play nice and gentle, while also competitive and ruthless, really allowed for great character development with the other lead in the film, The Swan Queen herself, Natalie Portman. For those of you who thought Natalie could only play the sweet and gentle type, go out and see Black Swan because in this film she juggles her characters emotions perfectly. At first the actress plays the sweet and gentle Nina Seyers we are all use too, but quickly gets more in touch with her dark side, changing into an obsessed and evil girl immersed in her role as the Swan Queen (which eventually destroys her). The actress does a fantastic job toying with audiences emotions, playing innocent and graceful (as the White Swan) while also being guile and sensuality .The buzz has been roaring for her to receive the Academy Award for best actress, and I can now see why. Her performance was perfect, warranting her an Oscar nomination, and most likely a win. Though the movie could be perceived as horror, i'd like to think of it as more of a dramatic thriller. Aronofsky plays with your emotions so well, sometimes making you sad, while at other times absolutely frightened. His similar directing style to The Wrestler was present throughout this film. His use of playing to the actors back with his camera was done well once again, allowing for the scene to feel more real and suspenseful feel for the audience. His dark style of directing allowed for the film to give off that uneasiness feeling you experience with most thrillers. Even though some would think of this film as a ballet concert, Aronofsky does an excellent job of deflecting that focus with plot twists, lustful/thrilling scenes, and brilliant acting from his talented cast. Black Swan is a movie highlighted by obsession, jealousy, envy, sex and pure lust. It is a film that plays with your emotions, taking you on a roller coaster ride of gentle and moving scenes, to more disturbing and uneasy ones. It is a film that highlights how obsession and immersion of a particular role can lead to the downfall and life of a person who was once so gentle. It makes you think, confused, and intrigued at the same time, with great directing and performances alike. Although critics are raving about this film, I'm going to score it as an A- simply because it is not a movie that everyone will like, and doesn't muster up to Aronofsky's masterpiece, Requiem For A Dream. I will go ahead and say that this film is definitely worth seeing, and will keep you entertained for the majority of the film. For those of you who think they are going to watch a ballet recital, don't, as Aronofsky does an incredible job of shifting the focus of ballet into spooky, thrilling and captivating scenes.

127 Hours," Gripping, Intense, Emotional, & Amazing
","Gripping, intense, and emotional would probably be the three best adjectives to describe Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. I'll admit that when I first heard the news that someone had a literal panic attack during the screening at Telluride, I was super excited to see it, as it could only have meant that the film was truly genuine and amazing. My assumptions were correct, as Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Slumdog Millionaire script with the director) put together another great film, this time with the challenge of one actor on screen for the entire movie. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie, 127 Hours tells the story of real life climber Aron Ralston (Franco) and his struggle to survive after his arm gets trapped under a boulder while mountaineering near Moab, Utah. Going into a film like this, one would wonder how a movie with one actor and essentially one filming location could entertain an audience for about 90 minutes. Well, Danny Boyle did an excellent job of keeping people glued to the screen without taking away from the film and boring audience members. With his funky style of directing, amazing camera shots, as well as his ability to bring so much information and life into a one man show, Boyle tackled this daunting task beautifully. The directors uses of Ralston's fantasies, hallucinations, comedic relief, and the character's will to live all helped keep audience members interested, and wondering how and when this man would survive such an catastrophe. Now to the leading man of the film, James Franco. I will admit, before this film I had never seen Franco give an awe-inspiring performance in any film really, but 127 Hours was his calling card. People should take notice, because this guy can really hold his own both on screen and off. Franco gave a fantastic performance in this one, and really made the character of Aron Ralston believable to the audience (which is what good actors do). He played the role seriously, but also gave the audience the much needed comedic relief, evening out the intensity of the film with a little bit of good humor. This isn't an easy role to portray for any actor, and it seemed as though Franco tackled it with ease, playing a disgruntled and challenging Ralston, and the different moods and emotions he feels while being trapped. I would be insane not to give credit to both Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle for writing another excellent screenplay. Unlike their previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was an excellent screenplay, this one stands out more simply because of the limitations they had when writing it. Essentially, it was a dialogue prepared for one man to speak to himself for about 80 minutes, mostly through his hand-held video camera.This movie is getting the granny apple A it deserves; the combination of great directing, writing, and an amazing performance by James Franco, truly make this film a remarkable one. The ability to overcome challenges and limitations, like Boyle did in this film, is what I believe separates the great directors from the good ones. Furthermore, the pace, intensity, suspense, and even Boyle's added humor, all add to the amalgamation of this films success. The films funkiness, brilliance, and realism faze out the idea that there is only one actor on screen sitting in the same location for almost the entirety of the film. The real life Aron Ralston summed the film up perfectly during the emotional Q&A session at the end of the film saying 'Humans have no idea of their true potential or what the are capable of, given the situation they're in.' 127 Hours comes out on November 5, 2010, and unless you get queasy very easily, it is definitely a must-see.",9,16,31,13 October 2010
Thor," THOR Holds His Mighty Hammer Strong
","I will admit after seeing all the trailer and TV spots for Kenneth Branagh's THOR, I found myself a little disappointed as what to expect in theaters. After seeing this film on the weekend, I can't help but praise it, as it was a entertaining, action packed, mystical and even had some great comedic humor to compliment it. Branagh's takes on a mystical adventure with THOR and really seems to find the perfect balance between that mystical world and earth, while also lending to plenty of witty humor for the audience. This really isn't like all the other MARVEL films you have seen in the past and really separates itself because of it's originality of the story and the tremendous acting that accompanies it. Casting was done extremely well and the mix of British, Australian and American actors all blended in perfectly with their characters. Anthony Hopkins was picture perfect as Odin, King Of Asgard, Chris Hemsworth shows his charisma and powerful personality portraying THOR perfectly, and Natalie Portman does a great job as the beautiful love interest in Jane Foster in the film. Tom Hiddelston was also fantastic as the evil Loki, and all the other supporting cast members including Stellan Skarsgard and Idris Elba played their roles up to par. Kenneth Branagh really impressed me with his directing in this film. Firstly for a guy not known to do big blockbuster films he definitely hit it out of the park on his first swing. The pace was perfect and everything was very visible to see even trough intense and shaky battle scenes. His direction of the film allowed for an entertaining, hilarious and captivating film for the audience. He also did an amazing job of tying in the realms of Asgard and Earth together, making an almost perfect balance of romance, action and intruge on both planets. Thor get's an A- in my books simply because my expectations were exceeded above and beyond what I though I was walking into. With it's solid screenplay, acting, visual affects, humor and a tremendous action punch to go with it, THOR is everything you look for in an entertaining super hero filled movie. If you haven't go to a theater near you to check it out then I suggest you do soon, as this movie should entertain and suffice most looking for a journey of adventure, mysticism and creativity. I would also recommend you stay in your seat until the credits roll on through, as a small clip at the very end of them divulges some key infomation to the next installment, The Avengers.",8,1,3,16 May 2011
The Fighter," A Compelling True Story That Comes To Life On Screen
","After attending Alliance Films Canadian Premiere of David O. Russell's, The Fighter, I haven't been able to get the film out of my head. With great directing, outstanding performances, and a compelling story behind it, The Fighter was an excellent film. Already having tons of Oscar buzz going for it, The Fighter is a Holiday movie you do not want to miss. Sports Illustrated has labeled it as the best sports movie of all time (which is a great debate for any movie lovers) but regardless; this film has everything you need for an amazing sports media film.The film is strong from start to finish thanks to brilliant acting, and unbelievable direction under David O. Russell. What performance to start with is difficult, but how about none other than the leading man (or so we thought) himself, Mark Whalberg. Plain and simple Whalberg delivers a strong performance as a character he usually plays, a gritty Boston native, only this time portrays the underdog Mickey Ward. He leads with confidence on screen, playing the sometimes frigid and sometimes confident Boston underdog. Whalberg's love interest in the film, Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams, delivered an incredible as Ward's tough yet loving girlfriend. Melissa Leo was outstanding as Ward's mother (Alice Ward) and really should have people taking notice of her incredible talent and performance on screen. She played her part to perfection, as the controlling mother/manager knowing what she thought was best for her son. Now for the man who stole the show from everyone, Christian Bale. At first the role of Dicky Eklund was offered to Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, when they both dropped out, Whalberg talked to O. Russell and made sure he put Bale in this film. The actor (who is considered to be the best actor out there without any nominations to his name) will blow you away with this incredible, and Oscar worthy performance. Bale has done what Ledger had done to him in Nolan's Dark Knight; steal the main characters film from right out of his hands. His mental and physical (which you will see in the film) preparation alone, is the definition of true method acting from an unbelievably talented actor. The actor pulled off what I think to be one of the best supporting roles in years and should definitely walk away with the award at this year's Golden Globes and Oscars. The screenplay in this film, written by Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy, was nothing short of spectacular. I think the dialogue in this film really made the movie believable and allowed for it to come alive on screen in a big way. This film is the best sports film to hit screens in the past couple years and is worthy of the entire Oscar buzz that has surrounded it. With O Russell's directing complementing such a raw and powerful script, this film has everything you need in a feel good sports film. The fighting scenes were incredibly well done and captivate to the edge of your seat, having you cheer by the end of the movie. O. Russell really mastered and captured the audience with his new age Rocky film. I will give it the A+ it deserves as the acting; screenplay and amazing directing allow this compelling true story to truly come alive on screen. The film is nothing short of superb and in my opinion the new age Rocky we have all been waiting for. For a movie that took almost four years to make, juggling between different directors and actors during it's initial stages, Whalberg and his pal David O. Russell have pulled out an incredible movie worth the hectic and long wait. If there is one movie you should see this holiday season, The Fighter is it.",9,2,3,3 January 2011
