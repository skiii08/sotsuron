Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," re: One Person's Opinion
","Let me first say, I go to the movies for free--so I see a lot of films.This movie almost makes me embarrassed to be an American Citizen. It undoubtedly is suppose to be a comedy--and believe me it is funny! The humor is a vivid and graphic exploitation on the real United States of America. The problem is--however true--I found the behavior very offensive. The people who made complete fools of themselves should be ashamed. As a comedy I would rate this film much higher--though I just can't get passed some of things said and some of the behaviors of the people being made fun of. This explains a lot about our educations system and the direction this country is headed. These are the people who probably voted for Bush.",2,4,9,29 November 2006
