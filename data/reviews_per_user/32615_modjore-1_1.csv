The Incredible Hulk," HULK-Its what is was supposed to be
","It was fun, good action and was exactly what is was supposed to be. It's not supposed to be a cinematic master piece just good ol'super hero fun. It was 100 times better than the previous version which is all that matters. I have also read that people are complaining again on how the Hulk looks which is a shame because i think he looked a hell of a lot better than the first movie. If anyone has ever used a 3D program they would know how incredibly difficult it is to model a character like that let alone apply the materials, have it interact with live action environment etc etc etc. As someone who uses 3d software quite a bit i think he looked pretty bad ass, especially in the daylight battle scene on the college campus. All im saying is enjoy it for what it is. Was IRON MAN a better 'movie' yes it was but none the less, HULK was good and im excited for the Marvel Movie Universe to continue to expand and interact.",9,3,5,19 June 2008
