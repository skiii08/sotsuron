Blade Runner 2049," Simply the GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME
","The title says it all. Honestly, I don't think I need to develop any argument here, because all you need to do to realize this is true is to watch the film. So I say it again - the most amazing movie you will get to see in your whole life.I won't lie, I was really nervous about this film, then came the critics and all these reviews and I felt like it might actually be good - and you know what? It's not good, it's brilliant. It's what every filmmaker has tried to do, ever. This movie is for now what we can achieve best in filmmaking and storytelling. It is all any professional worked for...",10,43,144,4 October 2017
Super 8," Super 8, a masterpiece.
","Super 8 is really amazing! It's one of the greatest movie ever and seriously, just the teaser show you the intelligence of J.J. Abrams and how this story will be. When I watched the teaser for the first time, I didn't really understand that it was about Super 8, the film format. But when I saw the beginning of the movie, I understood this story. Maybe because I was 14 like the characters and I was making super 8 movies, I really loved this story but I think it's something more popular. The movie is about a destroyed family. The son was really loving his mom but this one died so he's now with the parent he didn't prefer and who doesn't understand his son. That's about that actually, and seriously, I'm sure that this movie is the most important for J.J. Abrams because that's his life (without the monster i hope). And all the persons who worked with him on that movie had this life too. To me, it's a masterpiece and you can say that this movie isn't interesting, that the end is weird or anything you want, I will love this story forever because it's true and real. If you didn't watch this movie, watch it now because you'll see that it will be a great journey and that after this, the entertainment won't mean the same thing for you. Thank you J.J. Abrams for that story you gave us.",10,3,6,31 August 2012
Godzilla," Excellent, perfect
","This movie is excellent. I have never seen a movie like this one. It's so perfect in everything. The script is logical and great, the shots are all nice and quite stunning, it's a masterpiece. And it's a really unique experience because we don't watch a destruction movie just like all the other monster movies there are, here we watch the story of the characters and not of the monsters, which is great. It's what's making this amazing, we care about who we should care. They didn't tell the story people wanted to be told, they tell the story needed to be told. So it makes it perfect. I have nothing to criticize except the size of the monster but it's not really important because again I say it, this is a huge amazing great movie!",9,13,28,14 May 2014
