Walk the Line," Best documentary ever made, guaranteed
","Listen to this, I am a 14 year old kid from the northeastern United States who loves hip hop music and EminEm, but after reading this review, you would never had guessed this about me. Having known nothing at all about Johnny Cash, I went to see this film on a Sunday afternoon with my father. I figured, 'Ahh, what the hell. I'll go keep the guy company, maybe learn a little bit about something I know nothing about, eat some popcorn, and make fun of some odd moviegoers with my dad.' I took my seat, relaxed, and after the first 5 minutes of the film I was already on the edge waiting desperately for whats going to happen next. Jaoquin Pheonix was Phenomenal, and throughout the film you care for this Johnny Cash guy as though he were your brother. Through his hard times you feel the pain; through his happiest moments you sense the joy; and through his music, you sense who he was. Even though I knew nothing about Mr. Cash, I had heard some of his songs, and let me tell you this, if I had sat in that theater with my eyes shut tight I would've thought that was Johnny Cash singing his own songs. Jaoquin put all his emotion into this film, and to the many critics say Witherspoon steals the show, I disagree.Now, when I say I disagree, I'm not saying that Witherspoon was bad, because take it from me, she was also phenomenal. Witherspoon, who played the role of June Carter, acted as Johnny's ambition, and without her, Johnny wouldn't have been able to survive. Witherspoon brings the joy into this movie, with all her pep and brightness. Her portrayal of June Carter is worthy of 100 Oscars, I just may give Jaoquin 101.Now, believe me, I wouldn't take the time to write this comment had I not loved the movie. I am usually more of a Dodgeball, or Anchorman kind of person, but this film may have just converted me to the Drama genre. Every scene in the movie hits you in the heart with something new, and there's no way to explain the emotion that you are forced to feel for the characters thanks to their stunning performances. Backed with a strong story line, this film is worthy of every award that is available to win. I mean, think about this, who really wants to see a couple of homosexual cowboys win awards, sure, they may give great performances, but being able to pull off the role of two of the most famous musicians in American History sounds a little bit more difficult to handle, and yet, the actors did just as good of a job. Give the Oscar to Walk the Line, it's the best movie you'll see in years. And if u disagree, well then maybe you should become a gay cowboy.",10,2,5,6 February 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not terrible, but we have definitely seen better from Ferrell
","Alright, I'm not saying that this movie was a big bust, but when compared to the past works of Ferrell, (and the movies I mainly refer to when I say this are Old School and Anchorman) this just isn't that funny, and the sad thing is, it definitely has the potential to be a great film! It has the goods for a great goofy comedy: great comedians, screwed up characters, and a gay guy, but it doesn't use these pieces to its fullest extent! It seems as though through every scene we are left waiting for that one funny part that just makes us crack up, as we are to expect from Old School and Anchorman, but we never get those big laughs (excluding a select few scenes), and this is a disappointment. The part that I laughed the most at was the bloopers at the end, and that usually isn't a good sign for a movie. I'll keep the review short and sweet, and I wouldn't highly recommend this film. Die-hard Ferrell fans will still see it anyways, and they will probably come out liking it only because they expected to. For anyone else, I might stay away from this one if I were you, it had the potential, but just never clicked.",5,0,2,4 August 2006
