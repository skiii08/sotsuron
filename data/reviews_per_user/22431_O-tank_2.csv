The New World," A Glimpse of Hell
","I have looked into the face of hell, and yawned. Hell is being locked into a theater and forced to watch Terrence Malick's ponderous 'The New World' for all of eternity. No thank you. I would rather find a rusty, sharpened piece of metal and gouge my eyes out.'The New World' is basically an exercise in patience. If you can watch a David Lynch film without falling asleep, than this might be the movie for you. It's visually stunning with the constant rippling of water and trees waving seductively in the wind, but a movie is more than its visuals. There are certain fundamental aspects that a movie cannot survive without. A coherent plot (are you reading this Lynch), intriguing dialog, and of course, convincing acting.There is no real plot to speak of. I can summarize it in short abrupt sentences that a caveman might use. Man loves girl. Man leaves. New man loves girl. Fin. There is no real dialog to speak of. The movie is mainly composed of whispered voice over that are as forgettable as the characters who say them. The characters are mainly forgettable due to the actors playing them, which is surprising, considering the obvious talent that Christian Bale and Colin Farrell (not including Alexander) have shown in previous films. Bale and Farrell maintain the same expression throughout the movie. Calling them wooden would be a disservice to ventriloquist dummies.Congratulations Malick, you are on my list, right between Uwe Boll and David Lynch. You are the Dr. Frankenstein of the 21st century. In your quest to create life, an abomination has been created. Who gave you the right to play god! My advice to the rest of humanity; do not spend one penny to see this abomination. Rather, wait for it to enter the $2 bin at Wal-Mart, shop-lift it, and burn it so that no trace remains.",2,4,12,25 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Nice Family Drama, Terrible Movie
","I must say, its nice to see how Tom Cruise develops from a jerk to a good father over the course of the movie but I DON'T REALLY CARE. Steven Spielberg is a great director, but he has let me down. He has turned a fascinating story about humanity on the brink of destruction, and turned it into a bland, PG-13 film. Parents, be sure to take your kiddies.For those unaware of the story, the plot is simple. Aliens come to earth, kill many. Its funny how those words seem to sum up the whole film. Actually, I would add a few more significant words. Cruise is Jerk. Bonds with family. The End.Even though I hated the film, I must admit there was a moment that I enjoyed, and superficial as it might have been, I still add a star to give this movie a total of two stars. The moment I am referring to is when the Jerk (AKA Snooze Cruise) is running from the tripods as the pop out of the earth. The tripods start vaporizing people and there is this one scene where a man's horrified expression melts away as he is vaporized. Purely special effects, but still cool.As I left the theater as soon as the credits began to roll, there was some clapping. I can only theorizes that the clapping came from people, who like me, were thankful the movie was over. My advice, wait until this movie gets dumped into the $2 bin at Wal-Mart...and then shoplift it. Thank you.",2,2,8,30 June 2005
