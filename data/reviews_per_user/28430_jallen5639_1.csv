The Finest Hours," Exciting
","The film began a little slow, but then... the tension begins and suddenly you find yourself riding to the top of the big hill on this wonderful cinematographic ride! The thrill began for me when the weld started singing. You know it is going to happen, but you cannot help but gasp and feel the fear. Unlike 'The Poseidon Adventure'; this film made me swear off going on a cruise. Some of the Boston accents were a little overdone; and some of the acting was a little forced. A little more time could have been spent on the primary character's back story. But overall, this film showed what true heroes are. I would not allow a child under 12 to watch this film, it is that intense.",7,1,4,12 April 2016
