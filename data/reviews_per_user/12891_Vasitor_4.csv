The Blair Witch Project," That was it?
","Question:  Would anyone ever watch this movie twice?  Answer: NO!  This is the sort of movie you would walk out on if it wasn't a massive 1:20 long. It has been incredibly over hyped for what it is.  It's amazing how many morons go into the theater believing that this actually happened.  This movie is just plain annoying, from the lines all the way to the camera work.",1,2,5,17 August 1999
American Pie," Grow up!
","Even for a teenie bopper movie, this one stunk.  The gags were so lame, so predictable as to make them utterly unentertaining. The previews practically tell you the entire movie.  Why the hell doesn't anyone in this film have a lock on their door?  That's pretty convenient for pathetic, formulaic comedy.",1,2,4,25 October 1999
Final Destination," Final Destination: Trash bin (some spoilers)
","Okay, I'll give this movie one credit.  The scene where the girl gets obliterated by the bus was shocking and somewhat original,yet totally unrealistic, much like the rest of the film.  Did you know that Vodka can be ignited just like gasoline?  or that a coffee cup hold about a gallon of liquid?  Perhaps that your computer monitor might blow up should liquid get inside of it...even while off?  Or get this--a house blows up, completely engulfed in flames--yet the fbi can get finger prints off a knife in the house, and footprints off the wood floor.  Right.  I especially love the kindness of people in this film--the bus that smashes the girl doesn't stop...guess he figures he'll clean up after he gets back to the station. But even beyond the unbelievability is the horribly contrived dialogue. The entire scene with the mortician I was just shaking my head, ashamed that i had paid $8 to see this crap.  I was actually laughing out loud at the final deaths in the film, they were so pathetically constructed.  They might as well have had bags labelled blasting caps lying around the garages in this film.  Do yourself a favor, and see Wonder Boys, see Drowning Mona, see The Whole Nine Yards...anything but this!",1,10,19,18 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Pathetic
","While it did spawn a nifty couple of sequels, the original Star Wars sucked. The rebels, so willing to die for a cause, seemed awful selfish in not wanting to sacrifice themselves to save the others.  How many ships did Vader blow up while in the narrow tunnels?  He'd pick off groups of three at a time, and each one would sit there and say, 'Oh no, he's locking on.  I'm being killed!' None of them seemed to be willing to slam on the breaks and smash themselves into Darth's ship, killing the villain and saving the day in one move.  Give me a break.",1,20,68,19 July 1999
