The New World," Loved this wondering lyrical film
","It's a long time since I went to a mainstream commercial cinema and was so taken by a film. In the style that Malick is known for, he seems to keep the camera, and therefore the viewer, in a mode that you feel is moving in and around and through real events unfolding. Yet the events also seem to be like memories recalled or dreams remembered.And the music... awe, jist great.I suspected I was onto a winner when several members of the audience dribbled out dazed and disappointed as they realised they were not watching the usual good ol' pap-and-violent-slush that the USA film industry pushes out.",10,3,7,5 October 2006
