Insidious: Chapter 2," Enjoyable horror movie
","Although I watched the first one it had been so long that I didn't remember most of it. I didn't feel like watching it again before viewing this one but I was quickly able to catch up and the memories of the first one came back to me. I will suggest that you have at least seen the first one before this one.This seems to pick up right where they left off the first one and the scares and jumps begin one after the other. Some of them are cheap for sure but what a horror movie without them? You then realize later in the film that these 'scares' are actually a warning, at least some of them are.There is also a bit of comic relief and while that might turn some people off, I enjoyed it because it broke some of the tension and build up. They are very quick and don't last too long as to completely change the course. In fact, in one scene these 2 characters do something that probably no character in a horror movie has done, and that is listen to the ghost who says something about 'getting out of there or she will make me kill you' after hearing this they immediately, without hesitation, they leave the room. I laughed out loud and you would think I was watching a comedy.Overall it was a good sequel and I'm glad I watched it. The story, while a bit complicated and hard to believe, kept me interested the entire time. Not many twists and turns, just a flat out good horror film and if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this sequel",6,0,0,17 July 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Have to wait a year for the payoff
","I've read all 3 Hunger Games books and this book was by far my least favorite. It's a much different type of book so naturally, this is a much different type of movie compared to the first two. It's much more political and not the action packed film that the first 2 were.It was a bit slow in the beginning while introducing new characters and such like most movies do. But this is a sequel, and you see at least 3 or 4 more new characters that are heavily involved in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is still the most interesting on film but even she couldn't save it.I just feel that it cuts you off right when it starts to get a little more interesting. What I did like was that it was only 2 hours and I know the new trend in Hollywood is to make the final book into two movies so they can fit in much more. (Also to make way more money) See it if you must but I wouldn't be concerned if you waited til it came out on blu ray and then watch Part 2 right after.",6,15,32,5 December 2014
Requiem for a Dream," A sad story
","I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I decided to watch this movie. Sure I read the plot on IMDb.com but didn't really know much of anything about the movie.It started off slow for me but picked up around the middle. I really loved the cinematography, I thought it was the best thing about this movie. I know this has high ratings but for me when you don't care about the characters, I lose a bit of interest.However, I found myself starting to care a little more towards the end of the movie. The final 10-15 minute sequence is simply brilliant. I loved it, it was my favorite part. Did I like what was going on? Nope, but the editing and mixing them all into one long sequence to really show what they've gone through was deep.I rate it a 6 because it's not a movie I think I will ever watch again. Many people will disagree with me but it is what it is.",6,2,4,28 January 2014
Captain Phillips," a great movie
","From the very beginning you get the feeling Captain Phillips is going to be something special. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as 'Captain Phillips' and from the opening scene, you can tell he is nervous about this certain job. The fact that this was based on a true story makes it that much more entertaining.On the other side you have the Somalia pirates. And their performances are just as intriguing because on some level after getting to know their background you want to know more. And if put in their position would do what they have to do to survive. This first real intense scene is when 2 boats start to go after Captain Phillips ship and it's a very well done action scene that if you explained it, you would think would be boring, but it was so well done you get the feeling you're in for much more. And it doesn't disappoint.The movie gets really good when the pirates are successful and are able to get on the ship. To see what protocol is when that happens was very interesting. The movie really picks up once the pirates are on the ship as they search for the crew. It eventually leads to Phillips getting taken away and held hostage.The scenes with Phillips and the main pirate in the small ship were great. The ship was so small and as the audience you could almost feel how little room there was in there. By now the military is involved and it gets even more intense.I won't give away the end but the final scene of how this is all resolved might be one of my favorite scenes of all time. It was done perfectly and it couldn't have been done any better. 9/10",9,1,3,14 November 2013
The Equalizer," Denzel is the man
","Any movie with Denzel Washington as the main actor I'm all in. My expectations are usually quite high as well because of him. Once again, he doesn't disappoint. Maybe I'm biased because I've read about how this is too slow for some people and while that might be true, as long as Denzel is on the screen, I'm hooked.It's not full of action like I mentioned before but when there is action, its very entertaining. It's a smart character that has a routine every day and throughout the movie you learn more about his back story and why he is the way that he is. It's a simple plot really as a young girl he becomes accustomed to gets beaten up pretty bad. He decides to make the people pay. Only problem is its the Russian mafia.The final action scene in a very large hardware store is fantastic and clever. It's about 20 minutes long and the kills are brilliant and original. There is one last shot that is a bit cliché but I'm OK with that. I had high expectation and I liked it enough to give it a solid 8/10.",8,3,10,4 October 2014
It," IT does the job
","I never saw the mini series or read the book but obviously have heard of the story. When you think of 'IT' you think of Pennywise the clown. What I didn't know was that 'IT' is just an evil entity that can take multiple forms to scare kids. Think of a boggart from Harry Potter where it turns into what you fear the most, this is just way more evil.The movie reminded me of Stranger Things but had a much darker tone with more mature adult themes, such as a relationship between a father and daughter, the loss of parents, and the death of a younger brother. The young cast all do a fantastic job with a few funny one liners to break the tension.There were a few good scares and intense scenes which I enjoyed. One minor problem I had was some of the actions these kids take in certain moments. However, they are just kids as opposed to adults making ridiculous decisions in a horror movie.Even if you don't enjoy horror movies, I think you should give this a shot. It's a little on the bloody side but nothing over the top, aka 'Saw'. A good solid horror movie.",8,3,5,23 September 2017
John Wick," An action film to enjoy
","An ex-assassin loses his wife to cancer, her last gift to him is probably the worlds cutest dog. This lasts for maybe a day or two as a couple young punks break into his home, kill his dog and steal his car. Turns out the guys who did this too him is the son of his former boss. Now you learn throughout the movie that John Wick is known by just about everyone in town. So why this kid didn't know who he was is dumb but its what makes the story take off.John Wick is an action film that you need to just sit back, watch and enjoy. Don't nitpick at the little things. Such as the dialogue being a little bit corny, or the many cliché's that occur. This movie has fantastic gun fight choreography. In my opinion, its in the top 10 for gun fights. I also liked the world they created. The world of contract killers was different from what I had seen in the past.The good guy is a likable character and you feel for him. You also despise the bad guys especially the son. Bottom line, its a good time and if you like action films, I highly recommend it.",7,9,19,4 February 2015
Gravity," People need to gravitate toward 'Gravity'
","By far, the best space film that's ever been put to film. The special effects are brilliantly done and I honestly believe it would've been better in 3D. I wasn't able to see it in 3D, but if the effects looked that good in 2D, it had to look 10 times better in 3D.Sandra Bullock is the main character here as an astronaut in space with a team of 5 if I remember correctly, and are working when they get news that a satellite has been accidentally hit and the debris is heading straight toward them. As seen in the previews, bad things happen and Bullocks character is left to float around in space. This happens in the very beginning of the movie so obviously you expect her to be rescued.It then turns into more amazing visual effects with some funny dialogue between 2 great actors until the more intense sequences begin again. I've been a fan of Bullock for a long time and this is one of her better films, I would put it right up there with 'The Blind Side'.This is what movie making is about, turning a simple story into something visually stunning with scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. 8/10",8,1,5,8 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Excellent...Period
","Rarely does a movie that I want to see completely blow me away in how much I like it, this is one of those rare occasions. Most people won't agree with me but this is probably now my most favorite war action movie. It might not have all the character development, but honestly that's really the only thing that people could complain about and I don't think it hurt the movie at all.The opening of the film are shots from real US Navy Seals in vigorous and brutal training. But this is important as you watch the movie because what the 4 Seals go through and the way they continuously get back up, it shows that the training is for a reason.From the trailer you know the story, the 4 Seals have a predicament, they can either kill the 3 civilians to keep cover or let them go and hike it back up this very large mountain where at the top has no cover and very rocky terrain. They know the consequences for each choice and in the end, let them go. It's a great scene as the 4 of them realize how hard of a decision this is.After this is when the action picks up for about the next 45 minutes or so. They become surrounded by the taliban, and as soon as the first shot is fired, all hell breaks loose. It might be the most intense gun fight I've ever seen and definitely one of the best I've ever seen. It felt real, like we were there with them. They don't come away unscathed like the rest of Hollywood movies where the heroes constantly are able to dodge these bullets. They are severely outnumbered but put up the best fight anyone could imagine.I don't know how accurate this is, but quite frankly I don't care. If what was shown on screen was even remotely close to what really happened, hats off to the 4 Seals because what they go through seems unbearable. The pain of several gun shots, falling down a mountain with hard rocks waiting for them at the bottom, while constantly under fire is insane. The fact that they did as much as they did makes me proud to be an American because these guys were true heroes.There is also great chemistry between the four main actors and even in the most intense scenes, a few lines make you laugh to lighten the mood a little bit. But on for a few seconds and its back to reality. This may only be the second week of January, but this will without a doubt be on my top ten list of 2014. I loved this movie and suggest everyone go and watch it. 10 out of 10 with no hesitation.",10,1,10,13 January 2014
Train to Busan," A fun thriller
","This is only the second Korean film I've ever watched, (the first one being 'OldBoy')and like 'Oldboy' I enjoyed this quite a bit. The story is about a father who has a strained relationship with his young daughter, so much so the daughter wants to leave him and live with her mom instead. The daughter wants to ride the train by herself to Busan, the father decides he needs to go with her to try and save what little is left on his relationship with his daughter.Once on the train the fun truly begins. The 'zombies' are relentless and people turn quite quickly after being bitten which I thought was awesome. Another aspect of the zombies was when the train would go through tunnels, the zombies effectively go blind. When a group of survivors need to get through a few of the train cars they use this to their advantage but only have a certain amount of time before the train comes out of the tunnel.You feel for the 'good guys' and there are some comedic moments to relieve the tension with a few one liners here and there. One problem I had was towards the end, some of the decisions that were made by the protagonist weren't really smart compared to the others that were made earlier in the film. But just a minor blip in what was otherwise a fun and entertaining zombie movie.",8,1,2,2 July 2017
The Maze Runner," A good passing of the time
","I started the book but didn't get very far. Not because I didn't enjoy it, just didn't have the time. Then I found out a movie was coming out and thought I didn't need to finish it. It's a very interesting concept as a boy awakens in an elevator of some sort and all he sees are a large group of boys staring down at him. He has no idea who he is or why he's there.As the movie goes along we learn about all the boys and where they are. There is a maze close by and no one has come out of it alive. Everyone also have a specific job and are categorized based on skill. The boy we first see remembers his name (his name is Thomas) and all he wants to do is get out there. His curiosity gets the best of him and runs into the maze. This leads to him killing a very large spider like creature. News of this back at the camp doesn't go over well as they believe consequences will be faced.Thomas and some of the others believe there is a way out through the maze. Others don't care and think that the rebel inside Thomas is causing chaos and whoever has sent these boys here will retaliate.It's an interesting story with a neat little twist at the end. I didn't know it was part of a series so the ending leaves you hanging but you can just read the books if you're too impatient. 5 out of 10 because while interesting it's nothing special.",5,1,3,17 December 2014
Memento," Christopher Nolan is amazing
","Well after years and years of hearing about how good this movie was, I finally sat down and watched it. I only wished I watched it sooner! Although I will say I'm glad I watched it now that I'm older rather than when I was a teenager. Appreciating a film of this quality doesn't come as a teenager.I read about how the film is backwards but it works so perfectly for the twist of an ending. Even though you're essentially watching it from end to beginning, every scene makes sense and you almost forget that the climax was shown first.Can't really say anymore for a movie released over 10 years ago, but I will say that this will now be added to my blu-ray collection. Fantastic film.",8,0,1,25 January 2014
This Is the End," A big mess
","You have to know what you're getting into when watching this movie because if you have no idea, you will think this is the dumbest movie ever made. The end of the world is happening and we end up following these celebrities trying to survive.For me, some things that were done were hilarious and others that were just plain stupid. Then again, you can't take this movie seriously. James Franco is hosting a party when the 'apocalypse' hits. A lot of celebrities at his part die leaving only 5 of them.I read a little bit of facts about this movie and read that half of the movie was ad-libbed. I've enjoyed all of these actors films and I don't know how some of the things that were done, were done with a straight face.This movie would be best to have on in the background while doing chores because you realize that you don't care about these guys but the things that are happening are funny. It's a bit over the top sometimes which turned me off a little bit. When you try to hard to be funny, its never funny.",5,1,3,25 November 2013
Oldboy," A twist for the ages
","I heard countless times how good of a movie this was from critics and fans alike. I watched a preview for it and what I saw was an action movie. While there is a few action scenes (one in particular that was beautifully shot) this is by no means an action movie. There are some cringe worthy moments of torture but it all works and not over done. Most of it happens on screen and you only hear what happens.The plot is about a man who was kept under watch in the same room for 15 years. He is released out of the blue and has vowed to find out who and why this was done to him. He meets a young girl named 'Mi-do' and they quickly find a sense compassion and love towards one another.As the story unfolds we learn about who and why. When we the audience find out the reason I was blown away. Not since I watched the first 'Saw' movie did I feel so shocked. It was one of the most brilliant twists I've ever witnessed and made me feel for the character even more because of it.I haven't watched the American remake and don't intend to after the horrible reviews and plot changes I read about. If you're a fan of movies and don't mind subtitles, I highly recommend this one.",8,2,4,23 May 2015
Don Jon," good debut
","For a directorial debut, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a good job. The acting, story and sex appeal is all there in 'Don Jon' a movie about the character Don Jon and his addiction to online pornography.First and foremost, there is plenty of nudity so if you're on the fence about it and that kind of thing disturbs you then don't watch it. Plenty of swearing as well. Won't get into detail of the plot but from beginning to end you're taken on his journey of addiction and relationships. Obviously he struggles and doesn't believe he has any problem.Towards the end it backs off the hardcore sexual scenes that are shown and it really boils down to him trying to fix the problem. A decent movie that was entertaining from beginning to end.",6,0,0,26 May 2014
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Another good Marvel movie
","Spider-Man: Homecoming might be the most light hearted movie so far in the Marvel Universe. It essentially begins right after Peter Parker has his fight in Captain America: Civil War. The opening is Peter filming his journey after being recruited by Tony Stark. Just a little backstory as to how he showed up in Civil War.Back to real life, Peter struggles with the normality. He wants so badly to be back with the Avengers that he's missing out on his high school experience.The villain in the movie is the Vulture played by Michael Keaton, who I really enjoyed in the role. There was a deeper meaning behind his motives which caught me off guard and I liked it.It's a fun film and isn't as intense as most Marvel movies. Tom Holland is a good young actor and his charisma was perfect as the new Spider-Man. A solid 8/10",8,0,3,15 July 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Cap is back
","Before seeing this film I had very high hopes. The previews looked amazing and the reviews were all pretty good as well. And it didn't disappoint. This might be my favorite Marvel movie yet. It has it all with the action, comedy and twists to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie.I personally didn't like the first one at all. I thought it was boring and didn't keep the audience interested. The action wasn't all that great either. But this one has you hooked from the start. You laugh a minute into the movie.Over the course of the movie things happen and it definitely sets it up nicely for the next Avengers movie. All these marvel movies seem to be episodes in a very long TV series but instead of episodes, they are high profile movies and I'm not complaining because I think they all keep getting better and better.Once again stay past the end credits...and I mean all of the credits.",8,2,4,8 April 2014
Pacific Rim," Just plain fun!
","While I wasn't completely blown away by this movie like some other reviewers I did enjoy this quite a bit. It's more than an action movie, it has a decent story to keep you entertained while there aren't battles going on.One comparison I've heard is that this is just like Transformers. These people couldn't be more wrong. Transformers is for pure entertainment and the story comes second. I feel like this movie was better at making sure the story was relative to the action that was taking place. I also think that when there was action, it was shot better. And what I mean by that is the camera doesn't seem to shake and you don't only get quick bits and pieces of the fight.What I would compare it too, would be the T.V. show, 'Power Rangers'. All of those episodes would usually end with a battle between an enlarged creature against the Power Rangers who combined their droids, zords, I can't remember. Anyway, think of that but with the action 100 times better! If you enjoy action, some funny one liners, and a decent story that brings it all together, definitely give this a shot!",7,5,8,27 July 2013
American Sniper," One of the best war movies out there
","I didn't know the story Chris Kyle before the movie was made. I've since heard a few things about him and one of the most frequent things I've read is that the reason he had so many recorded kills was because he went out of his way to do so. Regardless of whether this is true or not, it doesn't take away from this movie. This is a top five war movie in my eyes of all time. It doesn't just concentrate on the war part but on his family and home life as well. It's that conflict for him that's so compelling on screen.His first kill isn't how he envisioned it and maybe that changes him and takes him on this ride of emotions through his four tours. While at home, he's very on edge and his wife can tell he's changed. All he wants to do is go back, fight and protect our country. Not thinking of the consequences he's leaving behind at home with his family.The action scenes are tense and fascinating to watch. Especially the last gun fight that ensues after he does something not many people in this world can do. I was hooked from beginning to end and it was an unfortunate and tragic ending. If you don't know what happened to him, I suggest you read up on it. A solid 9/10.",9,42,87,19 January 2015
American Hustle," Favorite film of 2013
","As I've gotten older, I've learned to appreciate more than just action and comedy movies. 5-10 years ago, I probably don't see this movie. Needless to say, I'm extremely happy I did.It's a drama movie, but the chemistry between the actors is superb. And the way they interact and respond is quite funny. I laughed for probably half the movie. If most of this was improvised like I've read, than these actors deserve even more credit.Christian Bale's transformation makes him look like a completely different person. The very first scene is showing him doing his comb over and it takes a couple minutes and you just have to laugh.Amy Adams is gorgeous, period. She's a brilliant actress and this might be her most risqué role yet. She was perfectly cast and has a British accent for most of the movie. She's essentially playing 2 characters and I enjoyed every minute she was on screen.The others including Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and a cameo by Robert De Niro, are all perfectly cast as well. I loved Jennifer Lawrence and thought she had the best lines in the movie. Every time she was in a scene I enjoyed the movie even better.I hope this gets the best picture award it deserves.",9,5,12,29 December 2013
Nightcrawler," Well done Jake
","I always believe that when the main character in a movie isn't likable I lose all interest because I don't care what happens. This movie proved me wrong because of Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He plays a guy named 'Lou' who we learn in the beginning is a thief and sells stolen goods for cash. While driving home, he comes upon a car crash where a van pulls to the side and a couple guys with camera's hop out and start to film it. He overhears them talking about selling the footage and whatnot. He approaches them for a job and the guy tells him to take a hike, not that politely though.This is where he gets the idea and wants to do this himself. He buys a camcorder, police radio and hires a guy off the street to be his gps so to speak. He learns the LA cop codes and only goes after the graphic accidents. He becomes so successful he's able to buy a new car.About half way is when you realize how terrifying this guy can be. When he beats the cops to a crash, he moves a victim so that he can get a better shot. What's most important to him, is him and his success and doesn't care about anything else. The ending will sum of the type of person he is. I hated the guy, but he was interesting and I was intrigued at how far he was willing to go. A solid 8/10",8,0,0,1 March 2015
Baby Driver," Simply Awesome
","I remember first watching the trailer for this movie and not really thinking much of it. If not for the high praise of multiple reviews, I may have skipped this. Thankfully, I decided to give it a go and what a fantastic film this is.The movie opens with a bank heist followed by the getaway car chase that would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame. The main reason...its so much more realistic. This scene lets us know how good of a driver 'Baby' is, as well as how the music will play an integral part of the film.The acting is top notch all the way around with funny one liners from almost all of the characters. The action is fun, the music is better, and the story brings it all together. Highly recommend this movie. One of my favorites so far this year.",9,16,30,30 June 2017
Divergent," Didn't read the book...maybe that helped
","Everyone who had read the book and seen the movie told me that it was terrible. That it was slow and the acting was student film level. So going into it my expectations were low and I think that's why I enjoyed it more than most people.The acting is mediocre as well as the action scenes that go along with it. This takes up most of the movie but for some reason, I liked the main character and her dilemma. The whole concept is pretty cool and original. Some of the dialogue was very poor and I laughed when the scene didn't call for it. If you can look past all these flaws, I believe you get an original story with a few characters you can really root for. It won't win any awards or movie critics, but who cares? If you had doubts about this movie, drop them and give it a shot.",6,0,1,23 July 2014
Ender's Game," One of the better book to film adaptations
","As a fan of the book, I had some expectations going into this and it didn't disappoint. The first scene sets the tone of what Ender is capable of. His teachers see it in him to be a great leader and do certain things to see how he reacts. This is to determine if he's the one to lead the humans against the alien race.I wasn't able to see it in 3D but I feel like maybe it would've been even more enjoyable. The cinematography was beautiful to look at including the match arena. The matches themselves were also a joy to watch and Ender is given his own team and he dominates the competition.They didn't have everything in the movie that was in the book but that's expected and the parts that were cut didn't take away from the story. One small problem I had was the casting of Moises Arias, maybe it's because of what I've seen him in but I didn't buy him being this tough guy, even though in the book the description fits his body type.Bottom line, if you enjoyed the book you will enjoy the film.",7,2,6,14 November 2013
Dunkirk," Good but not amazing
","I never knew about the story of Dunkirk before the movie. Over 30000 troops are stranded on a beach as the enemy bombs them from the air time and time again. In this movie we follow 3 different stories that all intertwine together.First are a few soldiers that start on the beach and are trying their best to get off it. The second is a father and son who set sail to go and help the men on the beach. And the third are a few pilots trying to counter the planes that are bombing the beach.All the actors do a great job and I loved the cinematography. However, I think the hype that I heard about this movie let me down a bit. I felt it was a bit anti-climatic as well. I did enjoy how the 3 stories came together but other than that, my big expectations may have ruined it a bit for me. So while I enjoyed the movie, I wasn't blown away so I can only give it a 7/10",7,2,7,3 August 2017
The Lego Movie," Lego's Rule!
","I will say that when I saw the preview for this movie I wasn't too excited about it. I was never a fan of Lego's even as a kid and never really played with them. Only through the great reviews and word of mouth did I decide why not give this a shot and I'm glad I did.I didn't see it in 3D and it might have made it more entertaining with the way the special effects were used. It was a clever piece of work with the way they portrayed water, fire, smoke, and a whole bunch of different things.Even though most kids will want to see this, its the adults that will probably be heard most in the theater laughing. The jokes are more for the adults but because its Lego's the kids will have a fun time too. There is a bit of a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.Overall, its simply just a fun time at the movies that both the kids and adults will equally enjoy.",8,2,5,23 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Deserved the Oscars
","This has been reviewed quite a bit so all I'll say is that if you were on the fence about watching the film, just do it. The acting alone is fantastic and both actors deserved the awards they won. I didn't know about this story until I watched the movie. It's a sad story but also kid of uplifting.I don't think I would watch it again, and I say this because as good as it was, it was depressing and dark. It was amazing that when he first finds out he has the virus he's told he has 30 days to live. He ends up living for another 7 years. Awesome on his part and even though what he was doing was technically illegal it was all for a greater good, even though he was profiting from it.Again, I think if you're not sure about watching it, just do it.",7,1,1,8 April 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Easily the best X-Men
","Without a doubt this is the best X-Men movie ever made. The opening scene lets you know how awesome this movie is going to be. The action sequences are great. From what I remember, the action in the other films weren't all that entertaining in my opinion, but this one had it all. The Sentinals were brilliantly done and there powers are unmatched by any mutant.As you know, this film is about Wolverine going back in time to change a specific event so that the sentinels are never made. Here we see the cast from 'X-Men: Origins' along side Hugh Jackman. And the chemistry is there, it all works so well together. The main focus however, is on Jennifer Lawrence's character Mystique. She definitely gets a lot of screen time and well deserved at that.My favorite part in the movie though was the character Quicksilver breaking into the Pentagon to break out Magneto. It was by far the coolest thing in the movie and the actor Evan Peters is great. I wish he had more screen time. Maybe in the next film he will get his justice.If you're a fan of the films you will love this one. Plain and simple it's the best of the bunch.",8,0,2,31 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Got what I expected
","When I heard that 'The Hobbit' would be split into 3 movies, my first reaction was 'how???' Obviously, they have strayed away from the book but I honestly don't mind that at all. I enjoyed 'An Unexpected Journey' and I enjoyed 'The Desolation of Smaug'. They are what they are, an action/fantasy movie with fight sequences, CGI, and a few parts that make you laugh. I can see why people would be disappointed, after 'The Lord of the Rings' did so good and followed the books for almost all of it, they probably expected the same here. I don't blame those people either, 'The Hobbit' is a great book and the perception that it's being ruined is a valid point.Speaking of those action scenes, I enjoyed them thoroughly. However, on three separate occasions (yes three) elves show up to save the day. It was too repetitive for my taste.I also felt that for the movie being based on the dwarfs and Bilbo Baggins, they didn't have as much screen time as I thought they would. It's not until the last 25 minutes or so that they become the main story again. Leading up is Gandalf's journey elsewhere and a love story between an elf and a dwarf.But back to the last 25 or so minutes, that's when the most interesting story is on screen. The conversation between Bilbo and Smaug is great and pretty funny to say the least. The rest of the film is the dwarfs and Bilbo trying to outsmart Smaug and essentially kill him.The movie also ends sort of abruptly which might turn some fans off but what do you expect when it's a 3 part movie? It will probably disappoint the hardcore fans of the book but for a movie fan like myself, I had a good time and am looking forward to the third and final installment.",8,1,3,29 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Got what I expected
","I didn't read the book nor did I really want to watch the film but I was pleasantly surprised with it and I never got bored. I also liked all the characters and cared about them. Always a big thing when you care about the main characters.It's a love story no doubt about it. It was an interesting take on young adults who have cancer. I think some people need to realize that we take a lot for granted. The little things we complain about in our everyday lives are so minuscule compared to the things others go through. Yes I know this is a work of fiction, but there are real people out there dealing with the diseases these characters have to deal with.Shailene Woodley does a very good job as the main character and I for one believe she will continue to get better as she grows older. The chemistry is there as well with her and the love interest.Overall, it's a good movie but a bit depressing so I probably won't watch it again.",6,1,2,4 October 2014
Foxcatcher," Fantastic acting...but terribly slow
","As a casual movie goer who tries to watch as many as I can, I try to go out of my comfort zone with award season just around the corner. This got nothing but good reviews about how amazing of a movie and how fantastic the acting is. I thought the acting of the big three (Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo) were truly great. I enjoyed watching them in much different roles than I'm used to.The problem for me is that while impressive, the characters themselves aren't likable. The only likable character is Ruffalo who isn't the main part of the story for the first hour or so. The first hour is about Carrell and Tatum and what Carell's character Du Pont wants to accomplish. This part is boring and what he wants isn't something that makes you fix your eyes on the screen.Plain and simple, without the tragic ending this entire movie would be pointless. It's a disturbing portrayal by Carell and like I said before, he delivers a perfect performance, it's just the entire story as a whole is too slow. It also doesn't mention that before the ending that 6 years had passed or the fact that Du pont is a schizophrenic.People will probably disagree with my opinion, but I found this way too slow and uninteresting. Acting is great, story is slow and in the end tragic.",4,5,14,28 December 2014
Frozen," A good Disney film
","This had been getting such good reviews and talked so much about that I got curious and decided it was time to watch it. And maybe all that hype let me down a little because while I enjoyed it, it wasn't the greatest or my favorite Disney movie. It was funny, the songs were good as well, but overall it wasn't that masterpiece it was made out to be.The best character to me was 'Olaf' the snowman. He, by far had the funniest lines in the movie and couple that caught me off guard and had me laughing long after the actual scene. He carried this movie for me like the horse did in 'Tangled'. No doubt it was one of the better Disney films I've seen, but not the best at all.",7,5,9,26 March 2014
22 Jump Street," One of the best sequels ever made
","From the opening scene you know that this is going to be a fun ride. The chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill is simply brilliant. If you liked the first one you will LOVE the second one. It is one of those rare times where I believe the sequel is better than the original.This is an action/comedy but I would say that there is something you laugh at every 30 seconds. The things they make fun of are delivered with such ease that you wonder if most of it was improvised. The action scenes are pretty entertaining as well and the movie has a couple surprises that had me laughing well into the next scene. Also, I would definitely pay attention to the dialogue because some of the lines pass by so quick you may not get the joke.Bottom line this is one the best sequels I've ever scene and I hope they make another one.",9,1,7,5 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," a good sequel
","As there are plenty of reviews already on here I wont divulge into much detail and after this being out for almost 2 weeks, I would assume that most people have seen the movie already. I enjoyed it, this reboot of Spiderman is good and I enjoyed the first one as well, probably more than the sequel.The action scenes are fantastic and shot really well. The special effects are also good especially the fight scene between Electrode and Spiderman. The main problem for me was the dialogue. It reminded me somewhat of the Twilight films...and we all know how bad those are. But Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do there best and we get some quick comedic laughs because of it.The chemistry between those two are fantastic and it really carries the movie. It's quite the bummer in the final fight scene but if you've read the comics or any article about the film in the last week, you know that Gwen dies. The way she dies is pretty graphic for a PG-13 movie but again, the cinematography was spot on for the exact moment of death.Overall, if you liked the first one you will like this sequel. It's a fun action movie with a bit of a dark climax.",7,0,4,7 May 2014
Ex Machina," A decent thriller
","Ex Machina revolves around the intelligences of A.I. Oscar Isaac plays a character that has created a self aware robot. He owns the biggest search engine in the world and is also one of the smartest men on earth. He handpicks an employee who works for his company to come out to his secluded house in the middle of no where. This man's name is Caleb and he gets to test the robot and see just how smart she is.Right away, when Caleb first arrives to the house and meets Nathan (Oscar Isaac), you get a sense that this guy may be hiding something. As the plot unfolds and we get to see more of this house and what's hidden inside the walls, you realize this man has a dark secret. Nathan and the robot named Ava, bond quickly and Ava develops feelings for him. This leads to Nathan snooping around the property for other clues.The climax has a few twists that I enjoyed and the ending works perfectly. It was a good take on today's society and how we use so much technology. I wouldn't be surprised that if in the near future something like this is actually created.",7,0,2,19 July 2015
Jurassic World," The Park is back
","22 years ago we were introduced to 'Jurassic Park', the proposed theme park where we could go and see dinosaurs in the flesh. While the chaos ensued before the park could open, in 'Jurassic World' the park is open to the public and it seems to be doing very well. So well in fact, the owner wants a new attraction, aka dinosaur so terrifying even the adults will have nightmares.Predictable plot as this new hybrid dinosaur is much smarter than expected and easily gets out of containment. But this is when the action really picks up as they try to track it down before it's able to get to where the people are. Chris Pratt plays a former Navy Seal who has been working with four velociraptors. We see that they obey him and he's built trust and a relationship with each of them.There are more than a few scenes that are a nod to the original which I enjoyed, the pace of the movie also does a good job with a few light-hearted and comedic moments to relieve the tension. It was fun ride that was more than satisfactory and I'm sure there will be sequels in the near future. 8/10",8,2,14,15 June 2015
Prisoners," Simply brilliant
","This is the kind of movie that goes to show how a simple plot of two missing girls can turn into a very entertaining piece of work. Led by a terrific cast including Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrance Howard, and Viola Davis, what could have been a very dull and boring movie, turns into one of the most gripping and intense movies of the year.Jackman and Gyllenhaal are what carried the movie in my opinion. What do you do when you lose your daughter??? And as the detective, how do you help without crossing the line? These questions are answered and answered well from the first moment they notice the 2 girls are missing.Like in most movies, there is an obvious suspect and as the audience you follow along because really, how the movie is playing out, you start to believe it. The suspect is played by Paul Dano. Who does a brilliant job and you really don't know what his deal is. In my mind, I couldn't read him.At a running time of almost 150 minutes, you don't feel like you've been watching a movie for so long, which is a very good sign of a movie you will enjoy. Like I said, the acting is brilliant, on all levels and even though you rarely see the 2 girls in the beginning, you care for them and hope that it will be resolved and quickly. One of the best movies so are in 2013 and a 9/10 rating for me.",9,1,3,24 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Did it's job
","I've never read a comic book or graphic novel in my life. But the way that Marvel has brought this universe together is fantastic and I'm enjoying the ride. I don't care if the hardcore fans criticize it for not following or staying true to the comics. This movie was entertaining from beginning to end.It's a pretty simple plot. A robot or AI gone bad named Ultron wants to destroy the world. The Avengers need to stop him. Nothing complicated about it. There is plenty of action and quick one liners to keep the mood light hearted. I've seen others complain about the fact there are so many different characters but it worked for me. They were all interesting and have stories of their own.Plain and simple, if you are a fan of the Marvel movies this won't disappoint. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",9,1,6,3 May 2015
Elysium," Take a shot and watch it
","The movie starts off explaining how the world became overpopulated and how the rich people fled to a place called 'Elysium' where you can live for hundreds of years and be cured of any disease or handicap you might come across. Which, lets be honest, if that's how things turn out to be, might be pretty awesome.There is also a little back story of Matt Damon's character as a child growing up along side a young girl named 'Frey'. They are the best of friends and it's his promise to one day take them to Elysium.The cinematography might be the best part of the film. The way the world is portrayed as an overpopulated mess is brilliant in my opinion. A very grimy and dark place to live and you get the feeling no one wants to be there. And then you see Elysium and how beautiful it is. I also liked the way it was designed.Anyway, back to the story. Damon's character becomes exposed to a severe amount of radiation that will kill him in 5 days. The only way to survive is to get to Elysium. That's when the action begins and we get action sequences which are a bit gruesome but entertaining nonetheless. However, some of those scenes are shot with a hand-held camera so it becomes shaky which I don't like at all. But, it doesn't take away too much from the movie.Jodie Foster plays the villain who wants all the power of Elysium in her pocket. It doesn't get explained but I'm assuming on Earth, there is no more President or Vice President, etc. But in one scene after Foster's character does something without authority, she gets summoned by the President. So I'm assuming that means all the big authorities live on Elysium. Anyway, she doesn't like the way it's being run and wants to do something about it. It's just, I'm not sure if she was trying for a French/American accent or any accent for that matter, you don't enjoy the movie while she's on screen. But maybe that makes the movie work.Bottom line for me, if you enjoy science fiction movies, you will enjoy this one. It's an interesting take on what could happen should the earth become overpopulated. It's not as good as Bloomkamp's first movie 'Distric 9' but it had me entertained from beginning to end.",7,0,2,11 August 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Give it a shot
","Tom Cruise's last few films haven't been all that great. (Oblivion, Jack Reacher to name a few) So when I first saw the preview for this, I didn't want to be tricked into seeing another one of his movies because the trailer looked good. But word of mouth from several people got me to decide that I would give this a shot. And I'm very glad I did.Firstly, before seeing the movie I wondered if it was going to be repetitive considering the movie is about re-living the same day over and over again. But the way the plot moves along, it's actually quite refreshing with each passing minute.Along with the good action and special effects, there is also quite a bit of comedy involved as well. It's really a perfect mix of each. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised with the entire film as a whole and I think it might be a movie that if you were to watch again, you might notice something you didn't see the first time.",8,1,3,5 July 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," just OK
","The first Pitch Perfect was a pleasant surprise. It didn't do the big box office numbers this one is making. It seemed like they tried way too hard with a plot that wasn't necessary. This was your typical Hollywood sequel that they made purely for money purposes. While I did laugh more often than not, it didn't have the the spark of the first film.The plot is put into motion because 'Fat Amy' has a wardrobe malfunction performing in front of the President. The Barden Bellas are suspended because of it and the only way to get reinstated is if they win the 'World Championships'. Other than that, there's not much conflict besides a little debacle between the group. There was a character of Latino decent in which she only said things terrible about the race. Sure some of them were funny, but I found most of her performance annoying.Another thing is, while talented, Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) shouldn't be on screen as much as she should. The reason she was so good in the first one was because she had the right amount of screen time. She was essentially the second lead this time around and it was too much for me.The 2 commentators in the film are back and really are just there to make terrible jokes about women, race and anything else. I enjoyed it, but because it doesn't come close to the original I can't really recommend it. It's just an OK film.",4,6,25,26 May 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," 3 hours of fun
","I don't know a single thing about Wall Street but now all I want to do is find out more. This movie has everything, sex, drugs, swearing, comedy, and whole lot of fun.At 3 hours, the time flew by while I was watching this movie. The performances are fantastic, it was a side of Leonardo DiCaprio that I haven't see before. Jonah Hill was also brilliant and added the necessary laughs when they were needed.But don't expect a happy go lucky movie with only celebrations. It takes a turn to the darker side towards the end of the movie and really shows what can happen when you think you can break the law.You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll have a great time. So just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",8,1,6,1 January 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Acting at its finest
","If you're a fan of film and you love to watch movies then I highly suggest this movie. The performances delivered by the actors is quite simply some of the best I've seen in recent memory. What also makes these performances even better is the way this film was shot. It looked like it was one continuous shot from beginning to end so the actors had to be on point the entire time. One mistake and they have to go back 10 minutes to fix it.The story is about a former actor who writes, stars and directs his own play. He wants to feel relevant again after doing three 'Birdman' films. This is a homage to Michael Keaton playing Batman long ago. There are things that happen in this film that might confuse you but just go with it and it'll all makes sense in the end.Once again, the acting is brilliant and the story is interesting along with quite a few hilarious scenes. A pleasant surprise for me and one that I highly recommend.",8,5,12,8 February 2015
The Conjuring," Give it a shot
","I finally got to watch this movie and I wasn't disappointed. You may think that it's just like all the other possession movies with the haunted house and the dad not believing anything etc. But this movie is different. They seek out the help and find the Warrens.There is also a little back story to them as well which I found very interesting. Most times, the 'psychics' are just that, no back story, and are solely there for the purpose of trying to get rid of the demons.It's rated 'R' but their isn't any blood or guts or much swearing for that matter. It's given that rating because of how tense it gets. Their are typical jumps and scares and most of the time you see it coming but there are a couple that got me.If you're looking for a movie to scare you, this is a one that I would definitely recommend.",7,0,1,15 September 2013
The Wolverine," Awesome
","While I have never read a comic in my life, I have always found the movies entertaining. Some, more than others and this might be the one I enjoyed the most, with the exception of 'The Avengers'.Hugh Jackman as 'Wolverine' has always, in my opinion, been the best character brought on screen in the 'X-Men' movies. I had no expectations going into this movie, my only hope was that it was better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. And personally I thought this was a lot better.For starters, there wasn't as many 'mutant' characters. In 'Origins' it felt like they pushed all these different characters into the movie just for the sake of having them there. This movie felt more real, with real people who had emotions. The Asian cast was fantastic as well. They won't be well known, with the exception of Hiroyuki Sanada who as been in a few Hollywood movies, most notably, 'The Last Samurai'.I also liked the fight scenes more because it was more hand to hand combat as well as sword fighting. Being half Japanese, I really enjoy the use of samurai swords and it was a great, but too short, fight scene between Wolverine and Sanada's character.The one problem that I find with the X-Men movies is the continuity of them all. For example, (spoiler alert) at the end of Origins, Wolverine is shot and loses his memory. The first scene of this movie takes place before the events in Origins. Fast forward to present day after the events of 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. Which means when the Japanese commander sends someone to find him so he can say goodbye before his death, Wolverine shouldn't remember who he is, but he does and remembers those events. Then again, since it ends up being his dream, maybe that's the way he begins to get his memory back.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the next X-Men movie. Which reminds me to stay through the end credits to see a very tantalizing scene which leads up to the next movie. Bottom line, see it!",8,4,8,29 July 2013
The Croods," The Croods survive
","Like any animation movie my expectations aren't very high. The trailer looked good so I thought I'd give it a shot. While it was funny and had a good message in the end, there was no 'wow' factor for me. All the characters were likable and it had good action scenes and the overall film looked great. I enjoyed the land that was created along with the mystical creatures that were there.It's a good movie for the kids and even young adults. It's a movie both the parents and kids can enjoy equally. And when it comes to animated films, what more can you ask for? I'm glad I watched it and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a sequel.",6,0,1,26 May 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Better than its predecessor
","I enjoyed the first movie but after watching it thought to myself, 'well that wasn't bad, but I wouldn't watch it again'. The sequel however, I would watch again. Maybe it's because all these movies that have come after the Avengers are all tied together even more. Regardless, it was a fun movie with plenty of action and humor to go around.But like most people, I would agree that 'Loki' is by far the best part of this movie. The acting was fantastic and you get more interested every time he's on screen. The rest of the cast also does a good job as to not take this too seriously but serious enough not to make it laughable.As always, stay past the credits for an extra scene. Although I didn't get it, after reading what it meant online, it seems Marvel have very big plans for their characters. This sequel was better than the first so if you liked the first one, you will definitely like this one.",7,0,3,14 November 2013
Lucy," Lucita wapita
","An action movie with an interesting concept and a beautiful lead actress, what's not to like about this movie? Well, personally one of the main problems I have with movies is when the main character isn't likable (unless they are meant to be horrible) but even then some bad guys are likable.Lucy is put in a tough situation at the beginning of the film and from there the story goes. Drugs are put into her stomach to transport but after getting kicked in the stomach 3 or 4 times they leak into her blood stream and she becomes a butt kicking machine with the smarts of Albert Einstein times 100.She quickly is able to find a professor played by Morgan Freeman and asks for his help and opinion on what is going on. Obviously Freeman's character is astonished and very curious. The rest of the movie is the bad guys trying to get their drugs back. Lucy was 1 of 4 'packages' and she's stopped them from getting to there destinations.While Lucy is trying to find answers, she's not very kind and doesn't care much about other people and the consequences she leaves behind. What happened to her was terrible but before she's injected with this drug we didn't know much about her other than she seemed a bit trashy and not someone who you would particularly like. It's not that I didn't care about the character, it's that she didn't seem to care about any one else either which made her somewhat not likable.The action and premises were great and I really enjoyed most of the movie. But the ending was a bit weird and abrupt for me but I guess it made sense if you really think about it. A solid action film.",6,0,2,17 December 2014
Unbroken," Got what I wanted
","Not having read the book may be better when you watch the movie. I didn't read the book but heard a lot of criticism about how much is cut out of the book especially the ending. For me personally though, I enjoyed most of it. It was well acted, along with enough small humor and disturbing scenes to keep it interesting throughout.I didn't like that almost half of the film takes place when he gets stranded after the plane crash. 3 guys floating in raft can only be so interesting on film. It was an amazing feat that he survived 45 or so days out at sea and they had to come up with resourceful ways to survive. but 30 minutes of that was a bit much in my opinion.He then gets 'rescued' by the Japanese and goes through all types of torture. These scenes may be hard to watch but it's not graphic just disturbing. Yet this guy pushed through everything and made it to the end of the war alive.The last scene explains in a few sentences what happens after the movie takes place. This is what most people were upset about. Quite frankly, there is no way this could've been filmed and not have this movie be 4 or 5 hours. I feel that deserves a story of its own. For this particular film, I enjoyed it and got what I expected.",7,2,9,2 January 2015
The Purge," Interesting concept...but too predictable
","In the near future for one night all crime is legal. I personally don't think that this will ever happen but the idea caught my interest so I gave this movie a shot. While I wasn't bored, it had too many of the same moments. I counted 3 or 4 different times where a character should've easily died but instead is saved in the nick of time by another.There is a part in the movie that asks the question, 'how far would you go to save your family?' With about 10 people outside the families house waiting for them, all Ethan Hawke's character has to do is deliver the man that his kid let inside. Instead, he can't do it and the battle in the house comes to life.Then we get towards the end and after the family is saved, something happens and quite frankly I called it as soon as I saw it. If you're a fan of the genre you will more than likely enjoy it. The idea was good, but the execution just needed a little more.",5,0,0,28 July 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Another good film
","One of the most anticipated films of the year, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' doesn't disappoint. Taking place right after the events of the first film, Katniss and Peeta are a symbol for hope against the Capitol.As a fan of the books, this one was my favorite to read as the 'twist' in the middle of the book was simply fantastic. Since the trailer for the movie shows the twist, you won't get that full effect of surprise as you would if you were to read the book. Nonetheless, the reactions from the characters to the news is brilliantly done.When they get back into the games with the other tributes, the movie picks ups the pace. The action picks up and you finally get to learn a little more about the other tributes who had won the games previously.Overall, if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this one.",7,2,18,24 November 2013
Godzilla," Have an open mind
","I'll get straight to the complaint I've heard most about this new reboot of 'Godzilla'...that complaint is 'he's not in it enough' and maybe so. For the first hour or so he isn't on screen. The story takes the spotlight about a father who lost his wife in an apparent accident and his son who's been trying his best to forget about it. But the father, played by Bryan Cranston insists it wasn't an accident. He believes something else happened and has spent the last 15 years of his life trying to figure it out.Anyway, I personally enjoyed the fact that this wasn't your typical monster movie where the monster or monsters wreak havoc on earth and everyone runs and screams, buildings and monuments are destroyed and so on. Here, it was almost as if the camera was angled so that we see these monsters from the an actual human's point of view. And lets face it, if something like this would be actually happening in the real world people would be running for their lives. Sure, there would be pictures and videos but how many people would really risk their lives for a video or picture.When we finally get our final battle between Godzilla and the 2 two 'MUTO's', you won't be disappointed. It's a fantastic final fight between them and you end up rooting for Godzilla to come out on top. This might not be to everyone's liking, but for me it hit the spot. A solid 7/10 for me.",7,1,3,19 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Matthew Vaughn knows how to make an action film
","Every year there are a few films that fly under the radar. I'm not talking about the Oscar nominated films that are released in select cities and then a month or so later are released for the public. I'm talking about films that you just want to sit back and enjoy and instead walk away much happier than anticipated. Kingsman: The Secret Service is the first of 2015 for me.With the right amount of action and comedy, the director Matthew Vaughn delivers a film that most people of the genre will love. It's very violent and at times over the top. But the movie doesn't take itself seriously and after an intense scene the comedic timing by the actors are perfect.Because a young boys father saved a 'Kingsman', this particular character played by Colin Firth, vows to watch over him. This leads to bringing the boy to train to be the next 'Kingsman'. But first he must beat out around 10 other candidates. The series of tests that the recruits are put through are thrilling scenes to watch.The fight choreography gets better throughout the movie including a massive fight in a church and the final fight near the end. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes action/comedy. I would also just recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies. A solid 8/10",8,1,6,16 February 2015
Furious 7," A perfect send off
","If you watched Furious 6 & 7 back to back it would feel like one very long movie. 7 picks up right where 6 left off. However 3 or 4 years have passed since the events of the last movie. No need to go into detail about this film. You get what you expect, ridiculous car chases, death defying stunts that no human could possibly do, and yet it's so much fun to watch.The ending does give Paul Walker's character a perfect send off. Considering he had filmed about 85% of the movie, there were only a few times I could tell it wasn't him. Plain and simple, if you're a fan of the previous films then you will have no trouble sitting back and enjoying the ride. 9/10",9,2,5,6 April 2015
