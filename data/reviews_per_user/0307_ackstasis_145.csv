The King's Speech," 'Timing isn't my strong suit'
","'The King's Speech (2010)' has been getting a lot of attention this awards season, and not undeservedly; it's a fine drama. This true story is anchored around two characters characters, one a British monarch (Colin Firth), and the other a little-known Australian speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) with unconventional methods. The chemistry between the two leads is terrific, with Lionel Logue amusingly bouncing his eccentricities off an often-flustered King George VI. (The audience in my theatre responded very well to the lighthearted cultural jabs at Australia's expense).I've usually considered Helena Bonham-Carter to play very cartoonish characters, obviously due to her collaborations with husband Tim Burton, but here she manages to be rather understated and even graceful. Guy Pearce is good in anything (and yet he never appears for long enough), and here he's excellent as King Edward VIII, a haughty womaniser whose proposed marriage to American socialite Wallis Simpsons caused a constitutional crisis.For all its merits, however, 'The King's Speech' feels like too little butter spread over too much bread. The series of therapy sessions between Albert (later George VI) and Lionel are certainly entertaining, and monarch's war-time speech, guided by Lionel as though he were conducting an orchestra, was stirring enough, but I didn't quite feel the momentousness that director Tom Hooper was trying to suggest. One exception takes place in Westminster Abbey when Lionel, lounging casually on the coronation throne, asks his patient, 'Why should I waste my time listening to you?', to which Albert replies, clearly and firmly: 'Because I have a voice.'",7,1,2,22 January 2011
Angels & Demons," 'Open the doors, and tell the world the truth'
","Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published 'Angels and Demons' in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. 'Digital Fortress' and 'Deception Point' were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By 'The Da Vinci Code (2003),' all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But 'Angels and Demons' finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard 'symbologist' Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance. All flaws aside, I can certainly see future generations enjoying 'Angels and Demons' for its preposterous sense of fun.",7,18,34,8 June 2009
Vertigo," 'Give me your hand. Give me your hand'
","John 'Scottie' Ferguson has a fear of falling. As the detective dangles precariously from the unstable guttering of a tall building, he impulsively looks downwards to glimpse the distant ground seemingly rushing towards him, all the while paradoxically shifting further and further downwards to maximise his inevitable plummet. This optical effect, sometimes known as a 'contra-zoom,' 'trombone zoom' or even the 'Vertigo effect,' was invented by Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, and Alfred's Hitchcock's use of the technique is pivotal to the success of 'Vertigo (1958),' the director's final collaboration with James Stewart. Human eyes interpret the relative dimensions of objects using a combination of size and perspective signals, and the simultaneous forward zoom / reverse track, which alters perspective while maintaining object size, instantly perplexes our eyesight, triggering sensory confusion and successfully mimicking the dizzying sensation of acrophobia. It may not be an incredibly subtle means of communicating Scottie's vertigo, but it's effective, and, particularly in the film's second half, Hitchcock employs a seamless combination of subtle and blatant film-making techniques to polish his landmark thriller.Just a few nights ago, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of Alfred Hitchcock's classic thrillers 'Rear Window (1954)' and 'Vertigo (1958),' both starring James Stewart and both among the finest pictures in the director's distinguished repertoire. Both films deal quite substantially with the notion of voyeurism, a topic further explored in Hitchcock's crowning masterpiece, 'Psycho (1960).' 'Rear Window' was the greater crowd-pleaser among the two, replete with gleefully-dark dialogue and a delicious murder mystery glimpsed through the rear window of Stewart's cluttered apartment. 'Vertigo' succeeds on distinctly-different terms: though rather lumbering and morose in comparison, the film is easily the Hitchcock's most intense thriller, with little of the playfully-black humour to be found in most of the director's acknowledged classics. This being my second viewing, it was interesting to note a film divided into two rather-incompatible halves, one a leisurely, borderline-supernatural ghost story, and the other a vivid exploration of loss and obsession. It's a curious combination, but it's also an altogether fascinating one.The film's opening half concerns acrophobic detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), who has retired from the police force after his disability caused the death of a colleague. An old colleague, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), hires Scottie is surveil his wife Madelaine (Kim Novak), whom he tentatively suspects of having been inhabited by the spirit of a tragic-afflicted ancestress. Hitchcock confidently strings together a series of surveillance episodes, as Scottie tails Madelaine across San Francisco, observing her fixation with her nineteenth-century counterpart, culminating in an attempted suicide at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. These sequences move at an unhurried pace, usually with extended periods of silence, underscored by Bernard Hermann's eerie soundtrack. However, to one with prior knowledge of the story's eventual conclusion, these comprehensive episodes of observation seem rather superfluous, a deception that exists as a trifling footnote to the film's primary concerns, of obsession and doomed passion. In any case, Scottie soon finds himself falling in love with Madelaine, and, when she is tragically wrenched from his grasp, his own grip on reality begins to falter.The film's second half, following Madelaine's apparent suicide, marks a crucial turning-point in both the story and our perception of the major characters. James Stewart, long considered the 'everyday man' with his shy and polite demeanour, suddenly descends into darkened territory, emerging from his cocoon of self-pitying isolation only after attaining a streak of relief from the face of a passing stranger, Judy Barton (Kim Novak again). In a wretched bid to recapture the passion of his lost love, Scottie forcefully alters Judy's appearance to reconstruct Madelaine's image, and, in one of Hitchcock's all-time most powerful moments, the pair embrace in a hotel room, the camera spinning deliriously about them as their surroundings modify to momentarily evoke the memory of Scottie and Madelaine's final, blissful kiss. However, in choosing to construct a superficial duplicate of his love, Scottie has effectively thwarted any romantic future, and, when it is revealed that Judy and Madelaine were the very same person  the fabrication of an elaborate murder plot  he comes to realise that, not only had he initially 'fallen' for an illusion, but his own self-made illusion was equally unviable, if not more so.",9,5,7,7 July 2008
Come and See," Harrowingly realistic; the true horrors of war
","Russian director Elem Klimov's final film, 'Idi i smotri {Come and See},' is a masterpiece of the genre, a war film so disturbingly intense that it strays into the realms of psychological horror. Set in 1943, during the Nazi occupation of Belarus, the film follows the fate of a young boy, Florya Gaishun (Aleksei Kravchenko), who joins the Soviet partisan army. As the horrors of war unfold before him, Florya loses his idealistic preconceptions of combat, becoming confused and psychologically unstable. The entire film is witnessed through his young eyes, as his civilised world is thrown into turmoil and those that he loves perish at the hands of a merciless enemy.Much like Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now,' the film is almost surrealistic in its exploration of the horrors of war, constructing a hallucinatory nightmare of escalating confusion, fear, death and madness. And yet, despite this, the film manages to come across as being frighteningly realistic. Perhaps this surrealistic approach is also, paradoxically, the most realistic depiction of war. Young Florya is cast into a hellish world he simply can't comprehend; placed in the same position, I imagine, the experience would strike us as being one long, distressing and horrible dream. Florya seemingly even treats it all as such. With the ghastly events happening all about him, he can do nothing but stare with petrified shock and awe, as one who expects to wake up at any moment.'Come and See' boasts a string of remarkable sequences which will resonate with viewers for a long time after they see it. A series of bomb strikes tear apart a Russian forest, silently obliterating the mature trees as a shell-shocked Florya hears only the maddening ringing in his ears; Florya attempts to clamber through a thick, murky bog, feeling with each step as though he is getting nowhere; he awakens in the midst of a thick mist, his head resting on the carcass of a dead cow. Perhaps the most lasting scene is one in which an entire population of villagers is herded into a barn, and then consequently set alight. Words fail to describe the horror of watching the flaming barn doors still flapping wildly as the inhabitants fight with their last breaths to save themselves and their families. Meanwhile, Florya just stares, his blank, disbelieving expression infinitely more effective than any other actions would have been.Inexperienced teenager Aleksei Kravchenko is excellent in the lead role, which the director subsequently described as 'a very difficult role with extreme emotional states.' So arduous were the emotional burdens of the film that Klimov later expressed surprise and relief that young Kravchenko did not suffer any adverse psychological trauma during and after filming, which notably employed the use of live ammunition to maximise authenticity. His character is placed in situations that are, to us, simply impossible to fathom, and Florya reacts to these changes in his life with a sort of awed silence, sometimes anger. Young actress Olga Mironova, apparently in her only film role, plays a pivotal role as Glasha, whom Florya befriends in the early part of the film.The film ends with a simple but very disturbing montage of archive footage. As Florya attempts to symbolically destroy Adolf Hitler by firing bullets at his portrait, the black-and-white World War II footage rapidly rewinds: we see corpses at a concentration camp, a 1930s Nazi party rally, Hitler's services during World War I. As Florya fires more and more bullets, the images continue to reverse themselves, as though eradicating the history from existence. Finally, we arrive at a photograph of Adolf Hitler sitting on his mother's lap as a young baby. Unlike the Nazi savages who felt no remorse in torching entire villages to the ground, Florya cannot bring himself to symbolically murder this innocent child, even with the knowledge of the horrors he would later orchestrate. Is this morality the reason why wars are an inevitable consequence of human existence?Though the final reel does undoubtedly stray towards propaganda (the Russian citizens are clearly shown to possess superior morals to those of the evil, fiendish Germans), the entire film is executed so disturbingly perfectly that you are too engrossed in the spectacle to really notice at all. There is no clear resolution to the story. Of course, the valiant Soviets successfully triumph over the company of Nazis, but they then strike off for another confrontation. The War will go on forever, and Florya will never be given a reprieve from all the horrors he has witnessed. The original working title of the film had been 'Kill Hitler,' not specifically referring to the infamous dictator, but with a more general meaning. As Klimov explains in the DVD preface to his film, he meant the title to suggest that we should kill the 'Hitler' within ourselves, 'because we all have our demons in this or that measure.' However, after the title was deemed inappropriate, another was chosen from chapter 6 the Book of Revelations: '...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, 'Come and see!'''Come and See' was the final film that Klimov ever directed. Having experienced World War II with his own eyes as a child, he felt that it was a film that he needed to make, and, after doing so, he was no longer compelled to continue directing. The director comments, once again on the DVD preface: 'I don't regret that I made that film. It had a difficult pre-history and history. But one has to make it a difference once in a while, to commit something worthy. Herein lies the sense of creative work, when you can offer to people something real serious, real meaningful' Simply put, this is the masterpiece that he was born to make, and a single viewing will ultimately change the way that you view war.",10,19,25,4 July 2007
Love and Death," 'As empty experiences go, it's one of the best.'
","It's always interesting to observe Woody Allen in his various 'early, funny movies.' In the period beginning with 'Take the Money and Run (1969) and ending with 'Annie Hall (1977)'  a major turning point in both his film-making and how his talents were perceived by the public  we can see the director's work growing in maturity and intelligence. In 'Bananas (1971)' just several years earlier, Allen had melded an assortment of random gags into something of a political satire; many of the jokes worked, some didn't, and the resultant film was a funny, if bewildering, anarchic comedy with a clumsy narrative structure. With 'Sleeper (1973),' Allen looked towards the future, and his dystopic vision of a society gone haywire provided a comfortable combination of witty dialogue and nostalgic slapstick humour, even if some sequences retained touches of juvenility. 'Love and Death (1975)' is the most profound of his 'transition' comedies, and, in the classy setting of nineteenth century Russia, the comedian delivers his thoughts on life, death, God, war and sex  but mostly sex.'Love and Death (1975)' was obviously produced shortly after an Ingmar Bergman marathon, and the film is both an affectionate homage and an enjoyable spoof of 'The Seventh Seal (1957),' Bergman's memorable meditation on the nature of religion and death. The perfect bittersweet ending sees Death, cloaked in a white sheet, leading our hero in a Danse Macabre across the countryside. Also targeted by Allen's razor-sharp flair for parody are the epic Russian novels of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as 'Crime and Punishment,' 'The Idiot' and 'War and Peace.' A singularly-absurd recreation of the Battle of Waterloo, which  among other anachronisms  is catered by a New York hot-dog vendor, is also an amusing send-up of Sergei Bondarchuk's impressive box-office disaster 'Waterloo (1970),' and even Bonaparte himself makes a surprise appearance as both an assassination target, and to demand the completion of the pastry to be named in his honour.Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, in their third of many collaborations, work together perfectly as cousins (and later partners) who like to bicker endlessly about the meaning of life, their conversations descending swiftly into dubious pseudo-philosophical ramblings of which I was able to make neither head nor tail. With the exception of one bottle gag that wouldn't have been out of place in a Chaplin film, most of the humour is purely verbal, and Allen even experiments with breaking the fourth wall, a style of comedy that he would implement with astonishing success in 'Annie Hall.' In terms of story, 'Love and Death,' in spite of its episodic nature, comes together more completely than any of Allen's previous films, and the jokes are consistently funny enough to draw a laugh. Considerably funnier than that other famous historical comedy released in 1975 (if I may be so bold), this is one of Woody Allen's funniest movies, with more than enough intelligent humour to go around.",8,0,0,18 May 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," 'A Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right, and you go left.'
","Paul McGuigan's 'Lucky Number Slevin' was released in Australia under the title 'The Wrong Man,' and so you'll permit me to refer to it as such for the remainder of this review. The film, a hark back to the early days of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, is a slick and stylish crime thriller, with a clever plot  but probably not as clever as it thinks it's being. 'The Wrong Man' stars Josh Hartnett as Slevin Kelevra, a hapless young guy with the worst luck in the world. After walking in on his disloyal girlfriend, and being mugged in the street, Slevin goes to the empty apartment of his good friend, Nick Fisher (Sam Jaeger), only to be mistaken for Fisher by two gangs of rival mobsters  ruled by The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), respectively  and asked for the money that he supposedly owes them. This is a quick plot summary that is partly correct, and partly a complete lie, but that's exactly the point. This is a film that relies almost entirely on its twisting story, and without it the film would be basically worthless.The characters, despite an exciting ensemble cast of talented actors (with key roles also played by Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci and Lucy Liu), are basically cardboard-cutouts; nothing more than glossy caricatures. This, I think, is what drags the film a solid step downwards from the likes of 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' both films with well-developed characters and ripper dialogue. 'The Wrong Man' is basically played for straight entertainment purposes, never really trying to be anything more profound, though you get the feeling that  with all these twists and turns  writer Jason Smilovic thought he was being a genius. In his defence, I will at least admit that I never saw the big twist coming. In fact, I was impressed at how the actual twist was handled. Usually, it is reserved for the final act of a movie, ending on a high note but almost always leaving unanswered questions and gaping plot holes. 'The Wrong Man' times its big reveal with about half an hour remaining, before investing a lot of time into explaining the little intricacies of the first half. Of course, there are still a few unsatisfying explanations (how did anybody work out that Det. Brikowski has been the assassin twenty years earlier?), but at least the filmmakers made an effort.It seems a bit redundant to discuss the acting, since the characters were all so one-dimensional, and probably deliberately so. However, I will say that Bruce Willis was probably the most impressive as Mr. Goodkat, the enigmatic and highly-skilled personal assassin. Josh Harnett spends the first half of the film as the sympathetic, smart-mouthed innocent, but, by the end of the film, has somehow transformed into a dark, calculating shadow bent on bloody revenge. The transition is sudden and jarring, and it doesn't really allow the ending to carry any great feeling of resolution. The fact remains that we liked the original (innocent) Slevin infinitely more, and so we're left feeling somewhat betrayed by the path that the narrative has chosen. The mid-way switch from good-natured black comedy to bloody, violent revenge flick was also a bit mismatched. However, I did enjoy Lucy Liu's very natural performance as Lindsey, the chirpy and excitable young woman from the apartment across the hall.",6,1,2,6 October 2007
3:10 to Yuma," 'You know, squeezin' that watch won't stop time.'
","If there's one good thing to be said about remakes, it's that they raise awareness for the original films on which they were based. Before I heard about the upcoming Western to star Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, I would probably have never made the effort to track down Delmer Dave's 1957 film, which proved to be a suspenseful and entertaining gem. '3:10 to Yuma (2007)' was directed by James Mangold, and was part of the Western 'revival' that took place last year {along with the much-awaited 'Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)' and 'No Country for Old Men (2007),' which had significant traits of the genre}. Of course, whenever a picture is remade, it is inevitable that comparisons be made between the two films, and, because I saw them just one day apart, I gathered an good understanding of the strengths and weakness of each. Is James Mangold's film, with the monumentally bigger budget, a better film than its predecessor? The answer is yes and no.The plot for '3:10 to Yuma' is basically the same as the original film, though a few additional plot elements have been included, most importantly the added participation of Evan's son, William (Logan Lerman). Following a successful gold robbery that left many dead, notorious bandit Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is captured in the small town of Bisbee. A poverty-stricken rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), desperate to prove himself to his family, and especially his oldest son, volunteers to escort Wade to the town of Contention, where he is to be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Meanwhile, Wade's ruthless gang, led by loathsome second-in-command Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), prepare to rescue their leader, and to murder anybody who gets in their way. As the minutes tick closer to 3:10 PM, the other volunteers either retreat or are murdered, and it is left to one man to fulfill his duty and load the wanted criminal onto the locomotive.In adapting Halsted Welles' 1957 screenplay, which was based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas do a decent job of 'fleshing out' the straightforward story of the original film. The journey with Ben Wade to Contention is considerably more eventful than it was before, and the wellbeing of any one character is never assured. Additionally, Wade and Evans are given more opportunities to interact, making their respective actions in the film's final act more believable. Of course, given their previous participation in such 'dumb' flicks as '2 Fast 2 Furious (2003),' the screenwriters evidently couldn't resist a few action-packed flourishes, and the characters' fondness for murdering every human being in sight demands that a considerable amount of disbelief be suspended. Some killing here and there is certainly important to show that the bad guys mean business, but, with the biggest body count I've seen in a long time, I wonder if it was all necessary. No self-thinking bandit, however angry and determined, would ever pointlessly shoot a town Marshall after his surrender, lest an entire cavalry be unleashed on his tail.Where Mangold's film decisively matches its predecessor is in the primary casting decisions, with both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale delivering intense and compelling performances. Bale, as Dan Evans, is a unique Western hero, in that he's not very heroic at all, and might easily be dismissed as a coward. However, his resolution in delivering Wade to the authorities reveals a streak of gallantry that his prisoner comes to admire, and, in recognising his captor's heroism, Wade himself uncovers a sense of nobility within himself. Throughout the film, in the quiet moments dispersed within his chaotic lifestyle, Wade finds himself sketching the images he admires: an auger buzzard perched on a tree limb, the beautiful bar-maid naked in bed, and, finally, Dan Evans watching vigilantly from his rocking chair, shotgun cradled over his knee. Despite insisting that he is 'as rotten as hell,' we are shown a righteous side to Wade's personality, one that clearly detests the actions performed by himself and his gang members, despite the knowledge that, whoever these bandits killed, they killed them out of respect for him.",7,2,4,5 February 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time.'
","It seems utterly implausible that there exists anybody who doesn't love 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Undoubtedly one of the most riveting cinematic adventures every committed to screen, the film was released in 1981 to phenomenal critical and box-office success, and made the rugged, handsome, tenacious, whip-cracking treasure-hunter Indiana Jones a household name. The concept of the film was originally envisioned by producer George Lucas, hot off the release of 'Star Wars (1977),' who had wanted to homage and revive the cliffhanger adventure serials of the 1930s. He teamed up with rising director Steven Spielberg, who had also already hit it big with such successes as 'Jaws (1975)' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).' Together, equipped with a story by Lucas and Phillip Kaufman, and a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, they embarked on the production of perhaps one of the most exciting films ever made.The story itself, which takes place in 1936, is deceptively simple. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, at the time most noted for playing Han Solo in 'Star Wars') is a respectable tweed-wearing archeology professor at an American college. However, when he is not teaching rather dull lectures in which he represents archeology as a non-exciting profession, Jones is traipsing across the globe in search of treasured ancient artifacts with the goal of historical preservation, donating his pieces to the museum of Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott). We can only watch in awe as, in one of the most breathtaking opening sequences of any film, Jones navigates the perilous Peruvian jungle in search of the golden Hovito Idol, facing such pitfalls as an immense rolling boulder, poison darts and masses of deadly tarantulas. However, after acquiring the idol, Jones is outsmarted by his immoral and greedy French rival, Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), ultimately leaving Peru with nothing.After his return to America, Jones is approached by two Army Intelligence officers (Don Fellows and William Hootkins). The US military has intercepted a message from Cairo to Berlin, where the evil Fuhrer Adolf Hitler has ordered his men to uncover the legendary Ark of the Covenant, the sacred box reputed to contain the original stone tablets upon which are written the Ten Commandments. In his globe-trotting mission to discover the Ark before the evil Nazis can get their hands on it, Jones receives assistance from an old friend, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Once again, Jones finds himself coming up against his old foe Belloq, whilst a Nazi colonel (Wolf Kahler) and their resident torturer (a truly sinister Ronald Lacey) only add to his troubles.In order for 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to be such a success, everything needed to be done bigger and better than the audience had ever seen before. The film is essentially one lengthy action sequence after another, culminating in a terrifying, effects-driven climax when the Ark is finally opened. With the exception of this final scene (which was engineered by Lucas' company, Industrial Light & Magic, and is probably the only sequence that has begun to show its age), most of the film's daring moments were produced using old-school special effects and clever stunt-work. Interestingly, the brilliant, oft-cited truck chase sequence was actually filmed by the second-unit using Spielberg's extensive storyboards, with Harrison Ford's close-ups added later in production.There's no doubt that countless similar films had been released in the past, and Lucas and Spielberg drew a lot of their inspiration from other works. So what makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' so damn amazing? Probably more than anything, it is the wry sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast certainly looks as though they are having a grand time, with Harrison Ford greeting each of his character's new and perilous challenges with a soft sigh and an adjustment of his trademark fedora hat. The scene in which Jones nonchalantly blasts a cocky swordsman with his Smith & Wesson is one of the most memorable of all time, making you want to stand up and cheer for your favourite hero (the idea itself was conceived by Ford on the day of shooting, when, suffering from dysentery, he decided that he had had enough of filming that fight scene). An uplifting score from long-time Spielberg collaborator John Williams also helps make the film so very memorable.Unlike your typical film hero, Indiana Jones is not an invincible superhuman, getting decidedly battered and bruised at every turn. At one point, his rival Belloq remarks that they are surprisingly alike, despite their antagonistic attitudes towards one another. This is quite accurate; both adventurers often use suspect means to acquire the treasures they seek, the main differences between them being the motivation: whilst Belloq is driven by greed, Jones is concerned with historical preservation of important artifacts. Likewise, Marion is not your typical damsel-in-distress, a proud, independent bar-owner who is (usually) able to take care of herself. At the 1982 Academy Awards, 'Raiders' was nominated for a total of eight Oscars (including Best Picture, though it lost to Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Fire'), and it left with four, including Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It also received a Special Achievement Award for its sound effects editing.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was followed by two extremely enjoyable sequels, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)' (the latter being my very favourite of the series), and, just a few weeks ago (June 2007), filming for a fourth Indiana Jones adventure commenced.",10,0,0,13 July 2007
Deja Vu," 'You think you know what's coming? You don't have a clue.'
","Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's long-awaited third collaboration (and the much-anticipated follow-up to the brilliant 'Man on Fire') is not precisely the adrenaline-charged, unapologetically-intense thriller that many were expecting, but it is, nonetheless, a very interesting film, and, above all, is a load of fun.Denzel Washington plays Doug Carlin, a dedicated ATF agent who must investigate the horrific terrorist bombing of a New Orleans naval ship, a disaster that cost over 500 lives, including that of his partner. A sympathetic FBI agent, Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), recruits Carlin into his special task force, a team which scans the images produced by a futuristic surveillance device, capable of observing anything within a wide radius four days and six hours into the past.Carlin decides that the most effective course of action would be to survey a woman named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), whose murdered body was dumped in the water two hours before the actual explosion, meaning that her assailant knew of the impending disaster and intended on passing her off as just another unfortunate victim. However, throughout her surveillance, Carlin receives the disturbing impression that Claire can sense that she is being watched, despite her life playing by four days and six hours in the past.This is an exciting film, and I found myself constantly wondering what was going to happen next. The early events of the film lead inevitably towards a story of time travel, so it's no surprise when, taken off the case, Carlin decides that he's going to go back in time, not only to prevent the terrorist attack, but also to save Claire's life. And, of course, watch out for the most innovative and highly-original car chase since 'The Matrix Reloaded,' as Carlin cunningly pursues a vehicle that is exactly four days and six hours in front of him! As with many Hollywood time travel films, the filmmakers have been forced to substitute the logical ending with a more optimistic one, and the 'happy conclusion' seemed like something of a cop-out, especially since the film had tried so hard up until that point to match together the minutest of details. Nevertheless, this is a fun action film with an enjoyable twist of science-fiction, and you shouldn't go home disappointed.",7,0,0,5 February 2007
Casablanca," 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.'
","Ah, 'Casablanca.' What other film can evoke such powerful feelings of nostalgia, can exemplify so completely the golden period of Hollywood film-making? The year was 1942, and the world found itself in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Unlike anything our generation could possibly imagine, citizens were faced with an incredible uncertainty about their future. The Nazis marched across Europe, an astonishing, seemingly-unstoppable enemy, and the United States watched with bated breath from across the Atlantic. Most Hollywood productions responded to such ambiguity with fully-fledged, unabashed patriotism, and war-time filmmakers became obsessed with validating audiences' beliefs that the Allied forces would inevitably win out against Germany, and, indeed, many often concluded their pictures with unnecessary epilogues in which we've apparently already won. Such propaganda, while no doubt ensuring commercial success from war-weary cinema-goers, has regularly tarnished and outdated even the most otherwise-impressive contemporary WWII pictures, as the directors' willingness to simulate a happy ending strikes distinctly false from an era in which the overwhelming atmosphere was that of uncertainty and insecurity (see Billy Wilder's 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)).This is not to say that 'Casablanca (1942)' is not a work of American patriotism; indeed, it might just be the greatest example. The film owes its enduring legacy to how seamlessly director Michael Curtiz, and his troupe of writers and actors, was able to encapsulate the sentiment of the time in which the picture was made. The story ends with Rick and Renault strolling resolutely into the thick mist, their futures obscured by the fog of uncertainty that hovers before their faces. What will the next few turbulent years have in store for these heroes? Will they be overwhelmed by the enemy, or continue their noble fight for freedom? Following Operation Torch, the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, there were plans to film one of those dreaded propagandistic epilogues, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship. Owing to Claude Rains' fortuitous unavailability for filming, the original ending was left intact, and producer David O. Selznick was never more correct than when he concluded 'it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending.'When 'Casablanca' was first conceived, the filmmakers apparently had little idea they were about to produce one of cinema's best-loved pictures. A prime example of the studio-bound exotica that was popular at the time, and obviously a war-time off-shoot of Howard Hawks' Colombian aviation adventure 'Only Angels Have Wings (1939)'  perhaps also John Cromwell's 'Algiers (1938),' which I unfortunately haven't seen  the film reproduced the stuffy, humid climate and seedy, corrupt personalities of Morocco on the Warner Bros. sets, which ironically communicate more romantic charm than the real location could ever have provided. The film was shot by veteran cinematographer Arthur Edeson, who had previously worked on the wonderfully-atmospheric 'All Quiet on the Western Front (1930),' 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'The Maltese Falcon (1941).' His perfectly-framed photography suggests a mixture of stuffy melodrama, glamorous adventure and shadowy noir, though, interestingly, he avoids the sordidness of the latter style's successors, despite the wealth of suitably-seedy characters to be found in Casablanca. Framed through Edeson's lens, it seems that even the most squalid and repulsive of personalities can take on a curious facade of nobility.No less than six people had a hand in the film's justly-celebrated screenplay. The story was based on a then-unproduced play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's,' and was adapted for the screen by Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, with uncredited input by Casey Robinson. The Epstein twins were initially keen to give the film a few comedic elements; this would, no doubt, have made for entertaining viewing, not unlike a Howard Hawks picture, but might have detracted from the story's core themes of love, loyalty, regret, moral responsibility and self-sacrifice. Koch had perhaps a clearer understanding of the director's preferences  another wonderful film from Curtiz, 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),' also poses a vital moral dilemma  and chose to focus largely on the politics and melodrama of Burnett and Alison's play. That so many conflicting artistic ideas somehow melded together, not only into a cohesive narrative, but also into history's greatest screenplay, is a miracle to be credited only to the cinema gods, particularly in view of the fact that Curtiz commenced filming with an incomplete script that was updated daily.Perhaps another possible explanation for the film's unlikely legacy lies with the distinguished cast, borrowed from all over Europe. Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page were the sole American 'imports,' and assorted supporting talents were plundered from the United Kingdom (Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet), Sweden (Ingrid Bergman), Austria (Paul Henreid), Hungary (Peter Lorre) and even Germany (Conrad Veidt). Bogart, who had been typecast throughout the 1930s as a lowlife gangster, had been given the opportunity to show some humanity in Raoul Walsh' film noir 'High Sierra (1941),' but it was 'Casablanca' that proved his first genuinely romantic role, and, with several notable exceptions, the remainder of his acting career would comprise of similarly-noble yet flawed heroes. Bergman, despite having a rather passive role, was never more enchanting than as Ilsa Lund, and, photographed with a softening gauze filter and catch lights, positively sparkles with gentle compassion and a tragic sadness. Perhaps it's just the romantic in me, but 'Casablanca' represents one of Hollywood's most unforgettable accomplishments. Even as the film draws to a majestic close, and two men forge a lifelong friendship in the fog-ridden uncertainty of War, we immediately feel like asking Sam to play it again just for old time's sake.",10,1,3,11 June 2008
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 'Is he always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?'
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is simply a lot of fun, a good-natured hybrid of the hard-boiled film noirs of the 1940s and the iconic Hollywood cartoons of about the same time. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who  having also given us such classics as 'Back to the Future (1985)' and 'Forrest Gump (1994)'  we know is highly adept at providing excellent, wholesome entertainment, and this film is a glowing example of his talents. Meticulously crafted, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a technical marvel, faultlessly blending cartoon characters and live-action performances, without ever allowing the visual effects to overshadow the story. The $70 million film was a risky investment for Amblin Entertainment and The Walt Disney Company, but delivered handsome box-office returns (approximately. $330 million worldwide), almost universal critical acclaim and four Academy Awards (including one Special Achievement Award for Richard Williams' animation direction). The film is also unique in that, for the first time, it brought many of cinema's classic cartoon characters from different studios together on screen, mainly for brief cameo roles; including Mickey Mouse (Disney), Bugs Bunny (Warner Bros.), Droopy Dog (MGM), Betty Boop (Paramount Pictures) and Woody Woodpecker (Walter Lantz).The film was based on Gary K. Wolf's book, entitled 'Who Censored Roger Rabbit?,' and the screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. The plot for the film also borrows many elements from the film noirs of the 1940s, as well as some of the more recent neo-noirs, particularly Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown (1974).' The setting is Hollywood, 1947. For years, humans and cartoon characters ('Toons') have co-existed together, though relations have often been a bit frictional. The Toons, when they're not working for the major animation studios, reside in Toon-town, an entirely-animated city that is owned by childlike, gag-gifts supplier Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). After Acme is found dead, a hefty vault having been dumped on his head, zany and disaster-prone Toon Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is suspected of the murder, having recently discovered that his beautiful wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner and Amy Irving) had been cheating on him with the deceased. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a depressed, drunken and hard-boiled private investigator with a militant dislike of Toons, due to the horrible death of his brother five years earlier, at the hands of an unknown, red-eyed cartoon lunatic. After Roger is accused of murder, Valiant is pressed  against his wishes  to uncover the conspiracy and clear the rabbit's name.I genuinely believe that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' can rank with the very best animated films that Hollywood has produced. Just a quite scroll down its credits page reveals the hundreds upon hundreds of crew members whose tireless efforts painstakingly brought the animated characters to life; every single piece of animation was hand-drawn without the use of computers, and analogue optical effects were also used for adding shadows and lighting to the Toons. The way that the live-actors interact with their animated counterparts is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and no minute detail is left imperfect. These Toons cast shadows, break windows, smash plates on their head, slam doors and grab hold of humans, and all this is achieved convincingly. The main actors, especially Bob Hoskins, keep their performances astonishingly natural, despite presumably communicating with empty space a lot of the time. Even if you don't take the time to consider what a remarkable technical achievement the film is, you are still very likely to fall in love with it; 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a few months. At first it seems like a film that only children would enjoy, despite the occasionally dark theme (several murders take place, including the surprisingly shocking 'dipping' of an animated shoe). However, Robert Zemeckis has succeeded in creating that rare thing  a picture that is equally entertaining for adults and children alike.",8,2,2,14 October 2007
Minority Report," 'There hasn't been a murder in 6 years. There's nothing wrong with the system, it is perfect'
","Philip K. Dick was always fascinated by advanced human technology, and the effect that it would have upon both society and individuals. He also frequently proposed that there can be no single, objective plane of reality; our perception of time and existence is inescapably influenced by the meagre subjective workings of our brains. Dick's musings on reality and awareness, largely influenced by his experimentation with mind-altering narcotics, were ahead of their time in science-fiction literature, and it's no surprise that adaptations of his works comprise some of the genre's finest cinematic entries  including Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' Verhoeven's 'Total Recall (1990)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002).' Originally published in 1956, 'The Minority Report' is not one of Dick's richest short stories, really serving only to introduce the basic concept of precognition, and to briefly explore the relevant themes inherent in its mechanics; namely, free will vs. determinism. Out of this fascinating framework, however, Steven Spielberg has crafted one of the most breathtakingly comprehensive futuristic visions ever committed to the screen.I've always loved time-travel movies, mostly because they explore the intriguing notions of causality, determinism and fatalism. Though 'Minority Report' doesn't strictly qualify (since it's only information making the journey), it nonetheless grapples with similar metaphysical ideas, paradoxes and moral dilemmas. Can the Precogs truly be foreseeing the future if their visions result in the prevention of those future events? Is it ethical to punish citizens who have committed no crime, but may conceivably have done so in an alternate timeline? John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes unwaveringly in the merits of Pre-Crime, having lost his son in an unsolved kidnapping six years earlier, and being determined never to allow another such an atrocity to take place. However, his implicit trust in this 'perfect' system is suddenly shattered when he, Anderton, is accused of the future murder of a man he's never met. Convinced that he is being framed by an ambitious federal representative (Colin Farrell), Anderton goes on the lam, and, to prove his innocence, must elude and defeat the system he helped create.This 'man on the run' framework supplies the blueprints for a series of heart-stopping action and suspense sequences, with Spielberg exploiting possible future technology (such as self-driving cars, police jet-packs, and 'spyder' surveillance gadgets) for maximum thrills. The completeness of his future vision is simply breathtaking, with CGI used extensively but never intrusively. The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski resembles that of his previous Spielberg collaboration, 'AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001),' adding to the great tradition of visually-rich science fiction cinema. Washington D.C. in 2054 possesses elements of both a utopian and dystopian future. In the city's more respectable districts, where businessmen and politicians debate the future of Pre-Crime, the rooms are awash with light, deliberately over-lit and with extreme colour desaturation, the negative having been bleach-bypassed in post-production. In the city's destitute slums, known as the Sprawl, we witness the decadence of contemporary society, bathed in a shadowy noirish darkness, where blind drug dealers lounge in the shadows and spout wisdom like 'in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.'The concept of eyes  our primary means of perceiving the world  is very important to the film. They are continually used to identify us, but this technology can be bypassed through relatively inexpensive underground surgical procedures (performed in a manner that calls to mind the Ludovico technique in Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange (1971),' another film that explores the notion of free-will). Just as the eye can fool others, the visuals provided to our own brains have the tendency to mislead. The Precog Agatha (Samantha Morton) frequently uses the phrase 'Can you see?', in a manner that implies not just optical recognition but an otherwise-elusive greater understanding of human nature. The brightly-lit surroundings of upper-class Washington DC are merely a facade, designed to bolster the mind into a false sense of optimism and security, lest we remove our blindfolds to genuinely appreciate society's darkened heart. The Pre-Crime system may be perfect, contends Danny Witwer, but, if there's a flaw, it's human. In such a way, deliberate misdirection allows elderly director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) to hoodwink the senses and get away with murder.Steven Spielberg has often been criticised for an overwhelming need to end his films on an upbeat note. It's true that he likes to have his patrons leave the cinema smiling, and, over the years, I suppose that he's developed a rapport with his audience that he's hesitant about breaking; in a way, he's the antithesis of Terry Gilliam, who likes to end his sci-fis by kicking the audience in the guts. However, delve a little deeper into each films' themes, and often the outcome isn't as optimistic as we'd initially thought. The much-disparaged epilogue to 'AI: Artificial Intelligence,' carried over from Stanley Kubrick, is much sadder and despairing than we initially believe. Likewise, in 'Minority Report,' I've only recently become intrigued by prison warden Gideon's parting words as Anderton is lowered into indefinite incarceration: 'they say you have visions, that your life flashes before your eyes, that all your dreams come true.' Could the perfectly-just sequence of events that follows merely be the desperate longings of an imprisoned man? Philip K. Dick would probably have said so.",10,1,2,28 November 2008
Lifeboat," 'Dying together's even more personal than living together.'
","Alfred Hitchcock will forever be known as one of cinema's most innovative directors. Many of his most fondly-remembered films are often categorised as film-making 'experiments:' 'Rear Window' took place entirely in the one small apartment; 'Rope' was played out almost in real time, and was envisioned as a 'one-take' movie; 'Lifeboat' takes place exclusively on a tiny lifeboat in the middle of the wide ocean. However, in my view at least, to categorise these films as mere 'experiments' is to take away from the worth of the film itself. Hitchcock did not simply exploit these unusual scenarios as a mere gimmick to pique audience interest; he used them to his advantage, to maximise the emotional resonance of his films. And he did it better than anybody else could possibly envision.After an Allied freighter is torpedoed by a German U-Boat during World War Two, a handful of survivors of differing personalities and beliefs clamber aboard an unsturdy lifeboat and await rescue. Among the survivors is the Nazi captain of the U-Boat which sunk their ship, and the men and women must decide whether this member of the enemy is trustworthy enough to remain on the boat. As the days drag on and on without a hint of rescue, and with supplies of food and water rapidly dwindling, some survivors forge lifelong bonds with each other, whilst others slowly and surely turn against one another. Meanwhile, the crafty, innocent-seeming German, Willy (Walter Slezak), imperceptibly begins to draw his plans against his rescuers.A lesser director might have baulked under the task of making a continually-suspenseful 96-minute film set entirely in a lifeboat. Hitchcock, however, used the situation to his advantage, and the tiny set on which 'Lifeboat' was filmed (allegedly the smallest in film history), creates a constricting, claustrophobic atmosphere. The surrounding ocean landscape, presumably simulated using the director's favoured rear-projection, is surprisingly convincing throughout, with the black-and-white photography masking the obviousness of the effect which is often apparent in Hitchcock's later films. During filming, the cast members were exposed to the elements, which aided the realism of their performances, but also led to frequent illnesses such as seasickness and pneumonia.Solid performances were crucial to the film, and, luckily, the casting here is spot-on. Tallulah Bankhead gives perhaps the stand-out performance as Connie Porter, the selfish and arrogant world-travelling author. Each biting remark is delivered with magnificent pretentious poise, and many have suggested that Bankhead's character is not too different from the actress' own persona. The roles of the other survivors are played very well by William Bendix, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee, whilst Walter Slezak delivers a remarkable performance as the sly but strangely-likable German captain, whom you know isn't trustworthy, but you are tempted to trust him anyway.Upon its release, 'Lifeboat' was interpreted by many critics to be pro-Nazi, and its box-office performance was poor. Nowadays, the film is more often seen to be quite the opposite, as a piece of American propaganda and a good one at that. Based on a story by iconic American author John Steinbeck, one of the film's main themes is how dark situations can bring out the worst in a civilised group of people. When the Nazi captain is first hauled aboard the lifeboat, wealthy factory owner Charles D. Rittenhouse (Hull) fervently calls for the man to be treated civilly, as a prisoner of war. However, after witnessing the devious exploits of the Nazi, his attitudes perceptibly change. At the end of the film, when a young German seaman clambers aboard the boat, he is among the first to demand that he is tossed overboard like a worthless animal.The film's depiction of the enemy is quite interesting, though it is certainly not overly positive as many critics originally suggested. Willy, a fascinating character, is at first treated with some sympathy, but all this is cast aside when it is revealed that he has been hoarding food, water and a compass for his own benefit. The final line of the film, Connie's 'What are we going to do about people who think like this?' in response to the young Nazi's asking whether or not they are going to kill him, carries a certain note of irony. The characters consider the Germans to be barbaric for even thinking of such a thing, and yet the American survivors had almost been all-too-willing to murder Willy from the moment he came aboard the lifeboat. Perhaps the film is saying that, when it all comes down to it, the Germans and Allies weren't really all that different. Now there's a social commentary that wouldn't have been looked upon too kindly during the early 1940s!",8,5,6,17 June 2007
In Bruges," 'Maybe that's what hell is: the entire rest of eternity spent in Bruges'
","'In Bruges (2008)' is director Martin McDonagh's feature debut, and it promises excellent things to come. His film shows the influence of Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' but is mostly without the excessive stylisation of Ritchie's films. For two hours, the film delicately blends black comedy and action, exploring difficult themes of life and death, but in a manner entirely without pretension. McDonagh's highly-quotable screenplay ('they're filming midgets!'), despite an over-reliance on obscenities, enjoyed an Oscar nomination, but otherwise the film escaped most official recognition.After an assassination attempt goes wrong, two London hit-men take shelter in the unfamiliar Belgian city of Bruges. While the philosophical Ken (Brendan Gleeson) takes an interest in the city's historical architecture, the impatient Ray (Colin Farrell) takes to complaining at every possible opportunity. Eventually, the unique history and people of Bruges – including stunning local girl Chloe (Clémence Poésy) and an American midget actor (Jordan Prentice) – leads both men to reevaluate their lives, for better or worse. When specific orders are ultimately disobeyed, their disgruntled boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) reluctantly flies to Bruges to settle matters himself. 'In Bruges' contains several scenes that don't quite work: the midget's narcotics-fuelled rant about interracial warfare feels like forced drug humour, and the climax seems to operate out of ironic obligation rather than an understanding of character. However, Gleeson and Farrell share a chemistry that is amusing and often quite moving. The city of Bruges, whatever Ray has to say about it, is photographed with fondness and affection, depicted as a sort of historical sanctuary where time stands still. Two friends of mine plan on touring Europe later next year. Their proposed itinerary includes the staple capital cities of Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. 'In Bruges' may, indeed, have added an additional pit-stop to their journey.",8,1,3,26 December 2009
Chinatown," 'You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.'
","Upon its release, Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' was a critical success, and was lauded as one of the greatest neo-noirs of its time. Furthermore, over thirty years later, the film remains standing as one of the few post-1960 productions that can credibly be compared with the likes of 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Maltese Falcon.'Jake 'J.J' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a Los Angeles cop turned private investigator, who specialises in spying on and photographing cheating partners. Gittes is hired by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray to investigate her cheating husband, Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the city's water department. However, shortly after, Mr. Mulwray is found murdered in the reservoir, and the supposed Mrs. Mulwray turns out to be an impostor. Nevertheless, we know that the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) is tied into this mystery somewhere; how simply remains a matter of time.Polanski beautifully evokes the time and place of 1930s Los Angeles, never straying too far from that iconic film-noir style. Despite being filmed in colour, we are always reminded of the film's roots, complemented by Richard Sylbert's wonderful production design and W. Stewart Campbell's art direction. Missing, also, is the Jake Gittes narration outlined in the original script  this typical noir component was, no doubt, simply excluded for its redundancy. Through Nicholson's terrific acting, we already know what Gittes is thinking; we don't need to be told again. Furthermore, by not including narration, we only learn the newest developments in the crime as Gittes does, heightening the suspense and uncertainty of the ultimate outcome.Technically, the film is near flawless. John A. Alonzo's cinematography is stellar, as is the shadowy original score from the always-reliable Jerry Goldsmith. The acting is also top-notch, with Jack Nicholson notably receiving most of the acclaim, and picking up his fourth unsuccessful Oscar nomination for Best Actor (he would eventually win the following year for 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'). The supporting cast, however, is equally good, with Faye Dunaway brilliant as Evelyn Mulwray, legendary film director John Huston great as her wealthy, scheming villainous father and an enjoyably memorable cameo from Polanski himself as the knife-wielding thug who slices Gittes' nose.The shocking and tragically downbeat ending to the film certainly came as a surprise to me, though it probably wouldn't have to devoted fans of the film-noir genre. It is he with the money and power that ultimately emerges triumphant, we are told. When Evelyn is trying to escape her father, brandishing a weapon in his direction, Jake warns her to 'let the police handle this.' 'He owns the police!' she replies, before desperately shooting her father in the arm. Just seconds later she is shot down by police. Jake is led away from the scene, all too aware that it was his actions that led directly to this outcome. However, he is now powerless to do anything. The rich and the powerful have, and will continue to, get their way. Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.",8,0,1,9 March 2007
To Be or Not to Be," 'What he did to Shakespeare, we are doing now to Poland'
","With my supply of Billy Wilder pictures rapidly dwindling, I decided to turn my attention to the filmmaker who is generally agreed to have been the writer/director's foremost inspiration. Born in Berlin in 1892, Ernst Lubitsch began his film career as an actor in 1912, and writing and directing duties followed just two years later. He swiftly made a name for himself in German cinema, and, recognising the greater resources to be found in Hollywood, relocated to the United States in 1922, under contract with Mary Pickford. Talented writer Billy Wilder  also born in Germany  worked with Lubitsch on two pictures, 'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938)' and 'Ninotchka (1939),' and the influence to be found in Wilder's later work is unmistakable. 'Stalag 17 (1953)' was a courageous comedy picture in its own right, approaching Nazicism and prisoners-of-war in a lighthearted fashion, but Lubitsch's 'To Have and Have Not (1942),' released at the height of World War Two, is in a completely different league of audaciousness. War-time propaganda has never been so much fun!The picture opens with a peaceful street in Warsaw, where citizens are leisurely going about their business. Suddenly, everybody turns in shock, staring in disbelief at the person who has just sidled up to Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen  could that possibly be Adolf Hitler? It turns out that he is merely an actor engaged in a local theatre production, where famous performers Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Carole Lombard) are staging a Nazi satire. On the eve of opening night, political forces prevent the play from being performed, but those sets and costumes certainly aren't going to go to waste. After Hitler's army marches into Poland without warning, throwing Warsaw into disarray, it falls to these actors to prevent the leakage of top-secret Allied documents to the Gestapo. To avoid execution, Joseph Tura must deliver the acting performance of his career, all the while keeping an eye on his wife, whom he suspects of being unfaithful with a handsome Polish pilot (Robert Stack).The early years of the 1940s provided a unique assortment of Hollywood pictures, with war-time propaganda reaching its manipulative, patriotic climax. Most filmmakers responded to the current political climate with super-serious and often unconvincing drama, but a select few  including Charles Chaplin with 'The Great Dictator (1940)'  decided to unveil the comedic side of war, often layered beneath the tragedy of conflict and persecution. 'To Be or Not to Be' spends a few too many minutes on Robert Stack's comparatively uninteresting Allied spy, but, as soon as Jack Benny re-enters the equation, the farce kicks into full-gear. German-born Sig Ruman is hilarious as the bumbling Col. 'Concentration Camp' Ehrhardt, and Billy Wilder obviously thought so highly of the performance that he cast the actor as the very-similar Sgt. Johann Schulz in 'Stalag 17.' We always enjoy seeing our film heroes cleverly out-wit the foolish bad-guys, and when the bad-guys are none other than Adolf Hitler and his band of Nazis, victory is very sweet, indeed.",8,0,1,5 July 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," 'Aha, what's so special about the cheesemakers?'
","I was flipping through DVDs for something to watch, and suddenly found myself humming 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life' – so the decision was already made for me. 'Life of Brian (1979)' was the second of three original feature films by the Monty Python troupe (not counting 'And Now for Something Completely Different (1971)', which was a compilation of sketches from the TV show remade for theatrical consumption). The other two films – 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' and 'The Meaning of Life (1983)' – I'd watched back in 2006/2007, and found them not lacking in wry British humour, though I hardly considered them masterpieces of the highest order.I feel about the same about 'Life of Brian.' On the plus side, it really digs its heels into religion, with the crowds of Brian-worshipping disciples chasing the hapless hero (played by Graham Chapman) through the streets, interpreting his lost sandal as a divine gesture, and celebrating the presence of juniper berries as a miracle. The film is certainly less off-the-wall than 'Holy Grail,' with an abridged role for Terry Gilliam's distinctive animation, and fewer self-referential flourishes – except for a bizarre Deus Ex Machina involving an alien spaceship that breaks Brian's tumble from a tall building. The two songs are fantastic, of course: the first a Bond-like ballad belted out with the bravado of Shirley Bassey, and the second a droll, cheery closer about the joys of accepting crucifixion.",7,0,2,20 May 2011
Se7en," 'This isn't going to have a happy ending.'
","After years of experiencing dull, formulaic, clichèd so-called thrillers, it's always satisfying when a genuinely great movie comes along. I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher  after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien³'  firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint.The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen.David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act  shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines  the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before.Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work.The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself ('Envy') and David Mills ('Wrath'). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?",9,14,20,15 September 2007
I'm Not There," 'I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me.'
","Ask me a question about Bob Dylan. Whatever you just asked, I got it wrong, such is my knowledge of the man and his music. In preparation for Todd Haynes' latest film, a wildly unconventional 'biopic' of the iconic singer-songwriter, I briefly listened to a few extant Dylan tracks on my computer, including 'Ballad of a Thin Man' and 'Like A Rolling Stone,' as if these few brief snippets could offer me any genuine insight into the man behind the music. Nevertheless, I entered the film almost completely blind, unfamiliar with both the artistry of Bob Dylan and director Todd Haynes {from whom this was my first film}. Daring, baffling, infuriating, unique, artistic, brilliant 'I'm Not There (2007)' is all of these things; a wonderful piece of cinema from a bold and challenging director. In an attempt to understand the many facets of Dylan's personality, music and legacy, the film takes the peculiar path of representing the singer through six different characters, portrayed by actors of differing age, race and, indeed, gender; each separate personality charts just one distinct aspect of his persona.When I first heard that Cate Blanchett would be portraying one of the Dylan-based characters, I considered it nothing more than a publicity-minded gimmick. A gimmick it certainly is, but Blanchett, beyond all belief, makes it work flawlessly, swiftly disappearing into the guise of Jude Quinn, a 1960s version of Dylan at the height of his fame, at a time when much of his original fan-base was rejecting him as a 'sell-out'  most assuredly, a Best Supporting Actress win is in the bag at the approaching Academy Awards. The second finest performance, oddly enough, comes from young African-American actor Marcus Carl Franklin, who plays a talented eleven-year-old juvenile delinquent going by the name of Woody Guthrie {who, I was to discover, was one of Dylan's primary inspirations}. Also solid in their respective Dylan incarnations are Ben Whishaw, Richard Gere and Heath Ledger {the latter being rather difficult to watch considering his unfortunate death just one day earlier}. Christian Bale, a favourite actor of mine, is, regrettably, given very little to do. Though there's nothing inherently wrong with his performance, the 'mockumentary' format of his segment allows very little room with which to display his talents.What ultimately makes 'I'm Not There' such a delight, is that the film, quite deliberately, exists as a rather cluttered amalgamation of conflicting visual styles. The sequences with Franklin and Gere, for example, are exquisitely captured in vibrant colour, seeming to exist almost in a fantasy world. Ledger's scenes take place more-or-less in the real world, his character's family and marital problems unfolding amid dull surroundings and subdued colours. Bale's sequences, shot on 16mm colour stock, successfully evoke the feel of a typical biographical documentary, complete with an interview from former girlfriend Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore)  apparently representative of real-life folk singer Joan Baez, with whom Dylan had a well-publicised relationship. While Whishaw's brief Dylan sequences are captured with scratchy, grainy black-and-white film stock, Blanchett's segments are smooth and crisp. Steeped in surrealism, and very reminiscent of Federico Fellini's '8½ (1962),' the Jude Quinn sequences feature some of the film's most engrossing moments, particularly the brooding, fantastical performance of 'Ballad of a Thin Man' {from the 1965 album, 'Highway 61 Revisited'}.It goes without saying that a terrific soundtrack supplements the events on the screen, and, though perhaps running a few minutes too long, the film generally keeps a consistent pace. If Haynes' film is to be believed, then Bob Dylan was, and is, certainly an enigma, a personality whose motivations and inspirations may forever remain elusive. 'I'm Not There' certainly doesn't attempt to answer any of the begging questions about Dylan's life, and, indeed, through its convoluted narrative structure, Haynes seems to be contending that it's pointless to even try. Nevertheless, the film is a rewarding experience on many levels, the least of which being the pleasure of witnessing a motion picture unlike any other you're likely to see this year. If somebody like myself can admire and enjoy 'I'm Not There,' then this is proof that the film is certainly not just for Bob Dylan enthusiasts. However, if, like me, you didn't already know that the film's title was also the name of one of Dylan's unreleased tracks, then you might need to tread with caution.",8,1,2,24 January 2008
The Big Lebowski," I Was A Bit Underwhelmed By This Film...
","First of all, I love the Coen brothers. Just about every one of their films is stunningly written, with enough wit in their dialogue to rival Tarantino in his 'Pulp Fiction' form. Stunningly directed, riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters, their films are always a pleasure to watch.Jeff Bridges portrays Jeffrey Lebowski, a man who'd rather just be called The Dude. However, when criminals mistake him for a rich Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), a misinformed break-and-entry results in The Dude's prized rug getting urinated upon. 'That rug really held the room together,' a dejected Dude remarks, and so he goes to visit The Big Lebowski, whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence. Little does The Dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled rug...'The Big Lebowski,' like most Coen brothers' films, is certainly a funny and reasonably well-written story, however, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by it. A lot of the time, it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird, without serving any real purpose. I'm yet to work out the reasons for including the Stranger (Sam Elliott), whose cowboy-type character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story, with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle. The completely unnecessary breaking of the 'fourth wall' at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story. And how did the Stranger even know about the Dude's story, having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar? It beats me, but perhaps I'm just completely missing the point.However, these grievances aside, it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film, most of them arising from John Goodman's perfectly-played character, Walter Sobchak. With stunning comedic timing, the Coen film regular (Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou) hilariously spouts out his well-written dialogue, which usually (for no apparent reason) references Sobchak's own service in the Vietnam War, or otherwise belittles his under-appreciated and often-ignored bowling partner Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi).'The Big Lebowski' is a funny film, and well worth your time. However, I was simply unable to take it seriously as a film (nor should I have tried), so I couldn't rate it any higher. It just didn't have the professional class of the Coen brothers' other films...",6,6,12,5 January 2007
Fight Club," A Great Film
","If there was ever an award for the 'coolest' film ever made, it is fairly certain that 'Fight Club' would emerge with the honours. With its slick production design, its rebellious attitudes towards consumerism and authority, and an evident parallel with classic Nietzschian philosophy, the film received the admiration of a large proportion of its younger audience. Additionally, a cast of talented and instantly likable actors, and an excellent electronic score from The Dust Brothers, excels this film above others of its kind.Edward Norton ('Red Dragon,' 2002) plays the unnamed Narrator, an emotionally-unsatisfied car-company employee, who is suffering from debilitating insomnia and feels as if his life is going to waste. He discovers momentary relief from his troubles through attending regular medical support groups for diseases that he doesn't have. However, his dissatisfaction returns with the arrival of another 'faker' named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, 'Big Fish,' 2003).It is then that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, 'Ocean's 11,' 2001) enters his life. After introducing themselves on a plane, the Narrator finds his high-rise apartment engulfed in an explosion of unknown cause and, having nobody else to call, he seeks temporary lodging at Durden's crumbling and isolated residence.'Fight Club' is a superb film, and it's almost impossible not to like it. Edward Norton delivers a stand-out performance as the vulnerable and very confused Narrator, as he struggles to explore the notion of his own identity. This is a must-see film, and a second viewing to uncover the finer points of the story is highly recommended.",9,1,4,5 November 2006
Citizen Kane," 'I don't think any word can explain a man's life'
","Orson Welles' debut feature 'Citizen Kane' stands as one of the twentieth century's most revered films, and, indeed, the title of 'The Greatest Film Of All Time' has often been bestowed upon it, from as early as Sight and Sound's 1962 rankings, when it indefinitely dethroned De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves (1948).' After two viewings, I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time, but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that, however, 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939, in an unprecedented studio contract, RKO offered young prodigy Welles, fresh from his success on the stage and the radio, a two-picture contract with full artistic control (a promise that ultimately wasn't kept). Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick, Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pulitzer, but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane, poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream.Charlie Kane (Welles) rises from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' for the simple reason that he 'thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper.' Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing 'yellow journalism,' which, though frowned upon by most critics, proves immensely profitable. Decades later, after two unsuccessful marriages and a failed bid for public office, Kane sits alone in his massive, unfinished Xanadu mansion (the most massive, impersonal and even sinister abode ever to grace the silver screen), pining for the lost innocence of his childhood. This is the story of a tragic life, and the ultimate testament that money can't buy happiness.The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large 'NO TREPASSING' sign on the gate of Kane's vast and lonely dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the enormity of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, 'Rosebud.' With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. Following his death, the producer of a newsreel about Kane asks a reporter, Jerry Thompson (William Alland), to uncover the significance behind Kane's final words, a well-meaning but rather naive attempt to encapsulate a man's entire life in a simple seven-letter name.A criticism often levelled at 'Citizen Kane' is that it feels less like a warm, involving biopic than a formal masterclass in film-making technique. It's true that Welles was exploring largely unmapped cinematic territory at the time, and there's a certain sense of experimentation about the film. Mankiewicz and Welles constructed the screenplay as a series of fragmented, non-chronological flashbacks, each sequence filling in the missing parts of Kane's life, sometimes even showing the same event from differing perspectives. Greg Toland's elaborate cinematography makes unprecedented use of deep focus, in which everything in the frame  foreground, background and anything in between  is constantly held in sharp focus; the end result is a film that feels far more dynamic and 'animate' than anything preceding the French New Wave. All innovation aside, anybody who suggests that the life of Charles Foster Kane is somehow uninvolving really needs to revisit the film; Welles pours his heart and soul into portraying the arrogant, tormented and ultimately lonely millionaire, and it's uncanny how the director's own tragic career drew clear parallels with that of his most memorable character.",9,12,18,12 February 2007
The Birth of a Nation," 'The blight of war does not end when hostilities cease'
","D.W. Griffith's epic three-hour Civil War extravaganza is one of the seminal works of early American film-making, cementing many of the cinematic techniques with which Griffith had been experimenting in recent years, among them the cross-cut and the facial close-up. 'The Birth of a Nation (1915)' was also history's highest-grossing movie for three years (before being superseded by the Mabel Normand comedy 'Martin (1918)'). There's just one small problem... the film kind of celebrates the Ku Klux Klan. A lot of people have trouble getting past that. I don't think we should be too hasty in condemning Griffith as a racist: his career is peppered with sympathetic portrayals of African Americans ('His Trust (1911)'), Native Americans (The Red Man's View (1909)') and Asians ('Broken Blossoms (1919)'). One suspects that, in Thomas Dixon's novel 'The Clansman,' Griffith simply came across a story that he believed would translate well to screen, and did so accordingly.Regardless of Griffith's intentions, the second half of 'The Birth of a Nation' is rather unforgivably skewed towards Black vilification, depicting the KKK as a band of heroes valiantly restoring social order in the American South, after the freed Black slaves create a sort of dictatorial anarchy. Still, if this is considered evil ideology, then at least it's impeccably-crafted evil ideology. Griffith's mise-en-scène remains stage-bound in many aspects (the stage at Ford's Theatre even resembles one of the director's film sets), but I was surprised by the emotional strength of multiple dramatic sequences. Perhaps for the first time in his career, free from the constraints of the two-reeler, Griffith depicts characters whose emotions feel genuine. He constructs breathtaking battle-sequences using hundreds of extras, and creates suspense through the cross-cutting of parallel sequences: the assassination of Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre is brilliantly edited, strongly reminiscent of Hitchcock's Albert Hall montage in both versions of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934/1956).'",7,1,2,10 July 2010
Rocky V," 'All those fighters you beat, you beat them with heart, not muscle. That's what Mickey knew; that's why Mickey and you were special.'
","Coming into the most lowest-regarded 'Rocky' sequel (amongst both critics and passionate fans of the series), I must admit that I felt a certain trepidation. Whilst I had enjoyed the wildly over-the-top shenanigans of 'Rocky IV,' it wasn't what you'd call a good film, and had simply become the clichéd story of a champion boxer's underdog victory, not making any attempts to expand on the character of Rocky Balboa or his relationship with family and friends. Rocky's fifth outing is generally considered to be considerably worse, frequently denounced by Stallone himself.Whilst 'Rocky V' is most certainly not a classic, I can admire what it was attempting. Whilst Sylvester Stallone himself had helmed the first three sequels, 'Rocky V' was directed by John G. Avildsen, winner of a Best Director Oscar for the original film. This film attempts to break the mould set by the sequels, most notably by not including any scenes with Rocky in the boxing ring (except, of course, for the obligatory flashback opening to Rocky's bout of the previous film). Having been diagnosed with brain damage from his clash with Ivan Drago, Rocky is done with fighting. To make matters worse, he loses his entire fortune when his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) mistakenly signs the power-of-attorney over to a dodgy accountant. To fill the void in his life, Rocky begins training others to box, taking an enthusiastic, hungry young boxer, Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn (Tommy Morrison), under his wing.Rocky perceptibly sees, in Tommy, a younger version of himself; under-privileged, but avid for glory, and willing to take any steps to achieve it. In helping Tommy, however, Rocky grows further apart from his son, Rocky Jr. (played by Sage Stallone, and looking as though his character has aged about five years in the time that it took for Rocky to return from Russia) and his loving wife Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky Jr., an intelligent young lad in his early teens, feels neglected by his father and takes up boxing in an attempt to get noticed, eventually becoming a rebellious street punk.Often misunderstood - and reviled by many fans for a lack of 'action' - 'Rocky V' is a competent addition the series, and is, at least, superior to its direct predecessor. Unlike 'IV,' this Rocky film attempts (albeit, only partially successfully) to develop Rocky's character, and his family relationships. There is even a stirring flashback featuring Mickey (Burgess Meredith), quite possibly the most powerful moment in the film. Paulie is rescued from the role of comic-relief, and actually has something relevant to say. Adrian and Rocky face challenges, and their commitment is tested, but they manage to pull through. The film brings viewers back to the scenario of the original film  Rocky is no longer wealthy and living the easy life. He is back where he started, and must fight his way back to glory, not with his own failing body, but through Tommy. The only problem is that Tommy, despite having the ambition and the skill, lacks Rocky's passion and heart, resulting in his own eventual downfall.",6,7,8,22 February 2007
12 Angry Men," 'Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.'
","Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities. Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera-work; removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines. What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration.What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an 'open-and-shut case.' Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others.It would be plain naïve to label any one of the twelve jurors a 'villain,' but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority.Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations  purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door  would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.",10,6,9,1 January 2008
The English Patient," 'Every night I cut out my heart. But in the morning it was full again'
","Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an Allied soldier, and is simply referred to as 'the English patient.' After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her 'English patient,' who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas).It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. 'Ownership' is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy replies with 'Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me.' However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: 'I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.'Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.At 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.",9,27,35,2 July 2007
Public Enemies," 'I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey, and you... what else you need to know?'
","He's the master of the shootout. Wherever there's banks to be robbed, gun chambers to be emptied, or bodies to be riddled with bullets, Michael Mann is your go-to guy. A director of slick, stylish thrillers since the early 1980s, his pictures have often been tainted by their own knowing trendiness – and 'Public Enemies (2009)' is certainly no exception – but, damn, can the man engineer a shootout! Mann's craft reached its creative peak with 'Heat (1995),' memorably pitting Robert De Niro against Al Pacino, but his work in the new decade has not been without interest. 'Collateral (2004)' was a thrilling role-reversal for leading man Tom Cruise, and the turgid, aimless 'Miami Vice (2006)' was at least partly redeemed by an excellent climactic shootout. Why tell the story of John Dillinger? Perhaps Mann was simply entranced by the idea of a half-dozen Tommy Guns blazing at once. His approach to the material isn't exactly graceful, but, in his own way, he's done it some justice.For about a year during the Great Depression, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was Public Enemy #1. A multiple murderer and bank-robber, he escaped from jail on two occasions, and – along with such outlaws as Bonnie & Clyde and 'Baby Face' Nelson – dominated national headlines with his audacious and charismatic escapades. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, still in its infancy under director J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), struggled repeatedly to keep up with Dillinger, who had acquired something of a 'Robin Hood' image in the public eye. It fell to cool, methodical F.B.I. agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to apprehend the fugitive dead or alive, and on July 22, 1934, he finally succeeded. Depp's cocky portrayal of Dillinger is charming and entertaining, but the film expends little energy in exploring the man himself, content with vague allusions to Dillinger's loyalty towards colleagues and his affections for a pretty French girl (Marion Cotillard). At times, Mann seems very tempted to glorify his central criminal, painting the F.B.I. agents (especially Hoover) as incompetent and conceited.And now for my most predictable complaint. Despite the film's strengths, 'Public Enemies' is marred by Mann's distinctive brand of stylisation – most specifically, his decision to film in high-definition digital video. While I am not averse in principle to the use of digital video in a period-piece (Fincher's 'Zodiac (2007)' used the technology quite well), I feel that a director's use of equipment should not distract from the story he is trying to tell. Used wisely, digital technology is able to capture images every bit as good as traditional 35mm film, but Mann couples this digital video with a shaky hand-held camera. The result is not unlike an episode of 'The Bill.' This stylisation – which worked so well in 'Collateral' because of its contemporary urban setting – is so unconventionally anachronistic that it wrenches the viewer from the reality of the film: in a moment, I was suddenly aware of the director and his cameraman crouching in the corner of the room, filming an actor playing a role. In his pursuit of gritty reality, Mann paradoxically exposes his hand to the audience.",7,2,5,6 August 2009
Dead Poets Society," 'Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.'
","Australian director Peter Weir's third picture in Hollywood, 'Dead Poets Society (1989),' doesn't really explore any territory that has not been covered before. For most of the film, we can pretty much predict exactly where Tom Schulman's screenplay is heading, and so there are few surprises to set it apart from other movies of its kind. However, despite his film's hint of unoriginality, Weir hardly puts a foot wrong, and 'Dead Poets Society' proves a thoughtful, funny, haunting and inspirational drama that'll certainly stay with you once you've seen it. Accompanying a cast of bright, young actors {some of whom you'll recognise from their later successes, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard} is comedy veteran Robin Williams, whose warmth and passion forms the emotional core of the story.The prestigious Welton Academy prep school ('Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence'), as they're four-pillar motto suggests, has a long-standing history of success and high reputation. The young male students of the college are expected, at all times, to respect rules and authority, and to continually strive for greater and greater academic achievements. Into the school comes former student, now English teacher, John Keating (Williams), whose unorthodox approach to lessons, and vigorous passion towards literature and poetry, inspires many of his impressionable young students, and severely ruffles the feathers of Welton Academy's management. Keating's rousing motto of 'carpe diem' (a Latin phrase meaning 'pluck/seize the day,' borrowed from Horace's 'Odes 1.11') inspires the young boys to make the most of every opportunity, and to look within themselves to discover the correct path for their lives.The film proved quite successful at the 1990 Academy Awards, acquiring an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and nominations for Best Actor (Robin Williams), Best Director (Weir's second nomination in that category) and Best Picture. Perhaps because of the preparatory school setting and the cast of young actors, 'Dead Poets Society' seems as though it would be most effective with young teenage boys, who will relish the film's opposition towards conformity and strict authority. Nevertheless, the film also boasts a more important moral from which we can all take something: always seize the opportunities that are presented to you, and make every day of your life count.",7,3,4,30 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'No course is lost if but one fool is left to fight.'
","The final film in the very popular 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy, 'At World's End' heralds the return of everybody's favourite drunken swashbuckling pirate, Jack Sparrow. With most of the saga's previous participants returning to conclude the story, director Gore Verbinski also tosses a few interesting new characters into the mix. Complete with many awesome action sequences, some comedy and a bit of romance, fans of the previous films will not being going home disappointed.'At World's End' takes off where 'Dead Man's Chest' left off, with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) banished to Davy Jones' Locker, the final resting-place of sailors lost at sea. When Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is resurrected from death by the mystical Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) join with them to rescue Jack. Meanwhile, the fearsome Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), captain of The Flying Dutchman, has formed an unstable alliance with the villainous Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), with the aim of destroying every remaining pirate in the Caribbean. Among the newer characters introduced into the franchise are Captain Sao Feng (played with charisma by famous Hong Kong actor, Chow Yun-Fat) and Captain Teague, Jack's father (played by Keith Richards). Though the latter is merely a brief cameo or two, Teague's appearances are certainly funny and entertaining, especially since Depp reportedly based his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Jack Sparrow on the veteran guitarist and songwriter.Curiously, the final product of 'At World's End' is something of a mixed bag, with both good and bad characteristics. Johnny Depp is brilliant as always, delivering another entertaining and memorable performance as the drunken, reckless and talented pirate captain. Believe it or not, I think that his character was slightly underused. I would have much enjoyed for more of the action to have focused on Jack, since I find Elizabeth and Will to be quite uninteresting characters. Geoffrey Rush demonstrates that his extraordinary talent was what 'Dead Man's Chest' was noticeably lacking, delivering an enthusiastic performance as Barbossa. The CGI visual effects are often cleverly and effectively used, though a bit overdone at times, especially during the climactic maelstrom battle. I did, however, particularly enjoy Jack and Davy Jones' sword-fight atop the ship's mast, however unrealistic it was. Hans Zimmer's inspirational score is also worthy of a mention.Now let us move on to the parts of the film that I wasn't quite so enthusiastic about. First of all, Naomie Harris' character, Tia Dalma (later revealed to be Calypso, the goddess of the sea) is most certainly the most annoying cinematic character I've ever had the displeasure of watching  and that includes Jar Jar Binks. I had been relieved that her appearance in 'Dead Man's Chest' was rather small, and so was horror-struck to discover that she plays a substantial, pivotal role in this one. Her irritating, grating voice made me wince every single time she opened her mouth. I don't think this has anything to do with the actress' talents in themselves (she was quite tolerable in 'Miami Vice' and '28 Days Later'), but perhaps merely with the way she has decided to portray her character. To cut my rant short, I was just glad when the film got rid of her.As in the previous films, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were adequate without being anything notable. Knightley's would-be inspirational speech at the film's climax was not terribly effective, with the actress really lacking the screen presence to make a strong impression, though you can admire the effort. The film itself is long, much too long. Lots of action is sometimes a good thing, but the overly-extended battle sequence just went on for too long to maintain the audience's attention throughout. However - being a viewer who has enjoyed the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy without believing it to be anything particularly special  perhaps it's not my place to wish for the films to be shorter. After all, I'm certain that there are countless die-hard fans who were yearning for 'At World's End' to continue for hours and hours more.",6,2,5,28 June 2007
Match Point," 'For a split second, it can either go forward or fall back'
","Woody Allen's 'Match Point (2005)' is both a tribute and a counterpoint to the classic Hollywood film noir thriller. During the reign of the Production Code from the 1930s to early 1960s, it was a narrative obligation for cinematic criminals to suffer due punishment for their crimes. A typical thriller ideally works towards an unpredictable outcome, but with censorship came a foregone conclusion – thus, directors began emphasising the mechanics of Fate. No matter how perfectly-planned a murder or heist may seem, there is always a single lapse of judgement or fortune that brings down the bad guys (see 'Rififi (1955),' which Allen himself references in a cinema scene). 'Match Point' deconstructs Fate as a driving factor of film noir – there is no overarching providence, only the chance that a tennis ball may fall on either side of the net. Our familiarity with the traditional noir formula thus becomes a red herring; just when you think you know where the story is going, Allen takes another direction.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a former tennis player living in London, seemingly has it all. A sequence of fortuitous events leads him to date and later marry Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), a pretty if homely woman from an exceedingly wealthy family (headed by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton). Whereas any other man might be satisfied with such an arrangement – a high-paying job, an expensive home, a lifetime of financial security – Chris Wilton finds his eye wandering uneasily towards Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a failed American actress who once dated his brother-in-law. This scenario recalls Jack Clayton's 'A Room at the Top (1959),' in which Laurence Harvey was forced to choose between the woman he loves, and the woman who can offer him the most. Woody Allen further muddies this dilemma by portraying Nola as little more than a sexual object – basically, Chris is torn between the two sins of greed and lust. That each character, except perhaps for the pathetically-devoted Chloe, is snobbish or unlikable forces the audience to take a more detached, objective viewpoint.'Match Point' is my first non-comedic Woody Allen film, and I was pleased to note that the director's singular flair for sparkling wit and high-brow cultural references (Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' aptly makes an appearance) translates just as well to drama as it does comedy. Also impressive was the manner in which the film progresses, with disarming rapidity, from drama into a full-blown noir thriller. When Chris finally makes the decision to do the unthinkable, his actions seem, even then, coolly rational, as though it is the only action now available to him. The ending, too, is a complete surprise. The film methodically sets up the failure of its protagonist – the witness with whom he collides outside the building could easily have been Chris' downfall – but Allen relents with a wholly improbable turn of events that leaves a murderer in the clear. Against all odds (and, indeed, against all narrative convention), a heinous crime goes unpunished, and the audience is left feeling as hollow as Chris Wilton as he stares vacantly out the window, towards nothing.",9,0,1,20 December 2009
Zodiac," 'I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him.'
","Between December 1968 and October 1969, a serial killer, who had dubbed himself the Zodiac, operated in Northern California, murdering a confirmed five people, though other potential victims have been proposed. Up until 1974, the killer continued to taunt police and the media with a series of gloating and threatening handwritten letters, in one of which he threatened to execute an entire bus-load of school children. The Zodiac seemingly derived his name from a brand of wristwatch, and his incentive to kill  suggested by a cryptogram he sent along with one letter  was taken from 'The Most Dangerous Game,' a famous short story from Richard Connell, in which a game hunter turns to hunting humans because they are the only quarry worthy of his skill. Despite the best efforts of the San Francisco Police Department, and others investigators such as author Robert Graysmith, the true identity of the elusive Zodiac remains, to this day, a mystery.After the success of such films as 'Se7en,' 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room,' director David Fincher has turned his sights away from straight thrillers and fallen upon Robert Graysmith's true-crime novel, 'Zodiac.' Adapted by James Vanderbilt, the film opens on July 4 1969, with the shooting of Michael Mageau (Lee Norris) and Darlene Ferrin (Ciara Hughes) by a perpetrator who remains hidden in the shadows. After the killer sends a taunting letter to the 'San Francisco Chronicle', crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is assigned to follow the case, whilst newspaper cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes an active interest in the killer. After the Zodiac's fifth confirmed murder, of taxi driver Paul Lee Stine on October 11 1969, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) of the SFPD attempts to trace the serial killer, his desire becoming an obsession that will later threaten to destroy his life.It is possible that some viewers, expecting a slick and stylish Hollywood serial killer film, will be disappointed with 'Zodiac,' since Fincher has chosen to focus largely on how the hunt for the killer has destroyed the lives of those trying to bring him to justice. We linger on the victims themselves only briefly, and the homicides themselves are all orchestrated well before the mid-point of the film. By constantly reminding us that this is a true story, and by keeping the attention to detail as accurate as possible, Fincher has masterminded an entirely engrossing police procedural, in which the obsessive but futile search for the murderer is more absorbing than the murders themselves. With the real-life case being an unsolved mystery, the ending does not reach any solid conclusions on the identity of the killer, though, by laying out the evidence as it is, the film does manage to convey a certain sense of resolution, effectively avoiding the anti-climax that seemed almost inevitable. A meticulous recreation of the crime investigation, consisting largely of characters' personal and phone conversations, the film-making style of 'Zodiac' draws obvious parallels with such films as Alan J. Pakula's 'All the President's Men (1976),' of which Fincher confesses to being a fan.The acting from everybody involved in 'Zodiac' proves a real asset. Downey Jr. is excellent as the sarcastic and darkly humorous reporter Paul Avery, who would later descend into worrying bouts of alcoholism. Mark Ruffalo, delivering perhaps the finest performance in the film, is perfect as David Toschi, who tried for many years, in vain, to bring the Zodiac to justice, the case threatening to consume his life. Jake Gyllenhaal, though perhaps lacking the presence of his co-stars, is notable as Robert Graysmith, whose fixation with the serial killer would lead him to write two best-selling non-fiction books on the subject, upon which this film was based.John Carroll Lynch is disturbingly unsettling as Arthur Leigh Allen, the number one suspect for the murders, and the only person to have been seriously investigated by detectives. Despite being faced with seemingly damning amounts of circumstantial evidence, Allen vehemently denied being the Zodiac killer, and handwriting comparisons (and, more recently, DNA testing) yielded negative results. Graysmith, however, was convinced that Allen must be the killer, and the scene in which he tracks him down to 'look him in the eye to know that it's him' is extremely effective; it is the moment in which Graysmith frees himself from the grasp of the Zodiac's enigma, allowing him to recapture his life. In order to keep the identity of the killer in doubt, Fincher employed the use of three different actors to portray the Zodiac for the various murder scenes (Richmond Arquette, Bob Stephenson, John Lacy), based on witness descriptions from each of the incidents. Notably, John Carroll Lynch is not used in any of these sequences.Excellent cinematography by Harris Savides beautifully captures the mood and style of the late 1960s and early 1970s in America. Interestingly, to shoot the film, Savides made use of the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera, which has previously been employed by Michael Mann in such films as 'Collateral' and 'Miami Vice,' though 'Zodiac' is the first feature-length Hollywood film to be shot entirely in the Viper's uncompressed digital data format. Though I would have expected digital cinematography to detract from the nostalgic atmosphere of the film, I really didn't even notice the difference. A mixture of popular songs from the era, and original music by David Shire, also complement the film well.I'll stop short of referring to David Fincher's 'Zodiac' as a masterpiece, but, needless to say, it is truly a remarkable film that will, no doubt, continue to hold firm for many years. In one of his chilling letters, the Zodiac killer gloated that he was still waiting for a good movie to be made about him. Assuming that this mysterious serial killer is still about somewhere (Arthur Leigh Allen died from a fatal heart attack on August 26 1992), his wait is now officially over.",9,15,22,12 June 2007
The Prestige," 'Are you watching closely?'
","A good suspense film is very much like a magician's trick: we have absolutely no idea where this remarkable lead-up is taking us, and the final revelation is so mind-blowing that, after the curtains come down, we find ourselves stumbling from the theatre in a delightful daze of exhilaration and satisfaction. Already, we are arguing with the person who was sitting beside us: how was it all accomplished? One by one, most of the pieces slowly fall into place, but the film/magician still retain a sense of mystery, of wonder, of magic. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is precisely this sort of film. In the grand scheme of things, it is something of a nonentity, destined to become neither significant nor influential; however, it is such a invigorating thrill-ride that you get the sense that it is the promise of films like this that is the very reason we go to the cinema.Having already established his reputation as the director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins,' Christopher Nolan here cements his place as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents. 'The Prestige,' a riveting tale of magician rivalry, is set in England at the turn of the 20th century (much like its contemporary, Neil Burger's excellent 'The Illusionist') and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in top-form. It was adapted from Christopher Priest's successful 1995 novel of the same name, with the screenplay penned by the director and his brother Jonathon Nolan, who, once again, employ the use of their favoured non-linear narrative structure. The title refers to the third of three fictional components of a typical magic trick, as outlined in Priest's story: The Pledge ('The magician shows you something ordinary'), The Turn ('The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary') and, finally, The Prestige ('making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige.').Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, an ambitious budding magician who is willing to sacrifice everything to become the greatest of all time. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a born showman, who tragically lost is wife (Piper Perabo) during a failed underwater predicament escape, an accident for which he blames Borden. As the two magicians part ways for separate careers, Angier bitterly despises that Borden has formed a family and found happiness, and their professional and personal rivalry only intensifies when Borden pulls off 'the greatest magic trick ever seen,' known as The Transported Man. Desperate to upstage his competitor, Angier travels across the world to try and duplicate Borden's trick, his search leading him to the remote American laboratory of physicist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), whose work with Alternating Current electricity has spawned an invention of staggering capabilities.Aside from the passionate performances of its two leads, 'The Prestige' is also held together by numerous supporting roles of varying quality. Michael Caine is excellent as Cutter, the aging mentor whose experience and wisdom helps Angier on numerous occasions, though Angier's decision to neglect his old friend's confidence ultimately leads to his own downfall. Scarlett Johansson is competent as Olivia Wenscombe, the stage assistant who becomes the love interest of both rivals at some point during the film. The role was hardly a demanding one, basically requiring the actress to be on screen and to look glamorous; but, all things considered, she does this very well. David Bowie, rather strangely, has a riveting on screen presence as the real-life inventor Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis is enjoyable to watch as Tesla's assistant, Alley. Additionally, Rebecca Hall is pretty good as Borden's wife, Sarah, who is driven into depression by her husband's alternating personality and fierce dedication towards his work.The competition between the two magicians is absolutely thrilling to watch, as each continues to sabotage the other's work, in a grim and futile attempt to gain the upper hand. Obsession is one of the film's dominant themes, with Angier eventually becoming so dangerously infatuated with Borden's magic trick that he loses everything and everyone he cares about. Borden, meanwhile, also loses much that he loves, a sacrifice he is seemingly more-than-willing to make, though he is eventually given the opportunity to redeem himself. Mirroring this bitter antagonism is the rivalry between Tesla and (an unseen) Thomas Edison, with the latter  an advocate of DC electricity  taking numerous drastic steps to destroy the AC electricity experiments of his contemporary. Though largely grounded firmly in reality, 'The Prestige' takes a science-fiction turn in its climax, which may prove something of a cop-out for some, but will delight those who are enthusiastic about the genre.'The Prestige' is a film with numerous twists to always keep you thinking, and, like a good magic trick, you'll be talking about it for hours after the show is over. Having watched the film a second time, I was pleased to find that the story (which has been described by some to be merely 'gimmicky') holds up well on multiple viewing. Another interesting thing to note is that the hints towards the final twist are certainly there in full-view for you to notice the only thing is, you won't notice them. Why? Because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.",8,3,5,12 August 2007
MASH," 'Attention. Tonight's movie has been 'MASH.''
","Even as the opening credits begin to roll to the tune of a song entitled 'Suicide is Painless,' you recognise that, with 'MASH,' Robert Altman was deliberately aiming for a war film that was both unconventional and somewhat controversial. A black episodic comedy, 'MASH' portrays its experienced division of Korean War surgeons as laid-back troublemakers, dismissive of all authority and largely inconsiderate of others.'Hawkeye' Pierce (Donald Sutherland), 'Trapper John' MacIntrye (Elliott Gould) and 'Duke' Forrest (Tom Skeritt) are three Army surgeons who are drafted during the Korean war and assigned to a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit just three miles from the front line. Whilst they are undoubtedly fond of mischief, they are also very good at their job, as detailed quite graphically during the regular surgery scenes, into which Altman somehow manages to insert humour.They have also developed, perhaps due to the laid-back atmosphere of their own unit, a general disregard towards military authority. For example, during their brief visit to Japan, Hawkeye and Trapper John break military hospital procedure by treating an ill native child. When confronted by a superior officer, they promptly gas him, place him in bed with a prostitute and take some photographs as he begins to wake, ensuring a not-so-subtle but highly effective platform for blackmail.However, as carefree as their existence may be, the final football game demonstrates that the unit can successfully devise a plan, work together and emerge victorious. Of course, they only eventually win the game through the only means they know, involving highly deceitful (if not completely illegal) strategies and shifty game plans.Many have commented that 'MASH' looks unfavourably towards all women, treating them as mere objects of sex. I can certainly see where these arguments are coming from; spoken lines by women are few and far between, and rarely extend beyond enthusiastic acceptance of a man's proposition of sex. The only nurse who openly disapproves of these attitudes - Maj. Margaret O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman)  fares particularly poorly, unceremoniously dubbed 'Hot Lips' throughout the film and made the butt of numerous demeaning (but quite amusing, I must admit) practical jokes. When O'Houlihan lodges an official complaint to higher powers, the officer's eventual reply is 'You mean Hot Lips? Screw her!''MASH' has a great cast of likably rebellious characters, and its no surprise that the film later spawned one of the most beloved television shows of all time, even if only one actor (Gary Burghoff as Cpl. Walter 'Radar' O'Reilly) elected to reprise his role as a regular. I also enjoyed Robert Duvall's early appearance as Maj. 'Frank' Burns, the disliked religious zealot who is later led away in a straitjacket. This, of course, comes as no surprise to Hawkeye Pierce, since it was he who had planned the entire scheme!",7,0,2,11 February 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," 'My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.'
","The success of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)' and Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003)' demonstrated that adult audiences still enjoy stepping into the magical and wonderful worlds that captivated them throughout their childhoods. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has made fantasy his speciality, having achieved critical success in the past with such films as 'The Devil's Backbone (2001)' and mainstream comic-book adaptation 'Hellboy (2004).' Though I had previously never seen any of his films, I now consider del Toro to be a director-to-watch, since his most recent release, 'El Laberinto del fauno / Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the favourite films of 2006, second only to fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's dystopic futuristic sci-fi, 'Children of Men (2006).' An 'adult fantasy' in every sense of the word, 'Pan's Labyrinth' unfurls a marvellous fantasy fairytale amid the bloody backdrop of the aftermath of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). A young girl learns to endure the violence and devastation of warfare by retreating into a world of fantasy, occupied by fairies, fauns and other similarly-wondrous and terrifying creatures.Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is an intelligent and imaginative girl with a fondness for fairy tales. After the death of her father, a simple tailor, Ofelia's mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), marries an ambitious and sadistic Falange commander, Captain Vidal (Sergi López), who has been assigned to an old homestead from which to root out the remaining Marxist guerrillas. Vidal is ruthless in his attempts to exterminate the sympathetic rebels, often employing torture and intense violence to achieve his objectives. His primary ambition in life is to be remembered as a brave soldier, and, like his father, he wishes to die in battle so that his own son {currently developing in the womb of Ofelia's heavily-pregnant mother} will know the exact moment of his death and will be proud of him. With her mother seriously ill in bed, Ofelia is generally neglected by the household, with the exception of a kind-hearted servant (Maribel Verdú) whose sympathies lie with the rebels. In order to escape the horrors of the ongoing conflict, Ofelia devises an elaborate fantasy-world in which she is the returned spirit of Princess Moanna, destined to return to her glorious underground kingdom.Whether Ofelia's fantasies are, indeed, authentic or not {I tend to believe that the creatures are figments of her imagination, stemming from a subconscious desire to escape the violence of the real world}, there's no doubting the magnificence of del Toro's creations. Intricate make-up, puppetry and computer-generated imagery combine to create an assortment of the most mesmerising fantasy creatures I've ever seen: Doug Jones' Faun {named as the Greek god Pan in the English-translated title, though del Toro has denounced this due to the possible sexual connotations} is absolutely spellbinding in his every single word and movement, and one need only compare him to the rather ordinary faun in Adam Adamson's 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)' to confirm the superiority of del Toro's artistic vision. 'Pan's Labyrinth' brilliantly blurs the borders of the story's real and fantasy worlds, and young Ivana Baquera delivers an assured and mature performance in the leading role, lending credibility to her character's interactions with each fantastic creature. Guillermo del Toro's picture proved successful at the 2007 Oscars, winning awards for Art Direction, Cinematography and Make-up from six nominations.",9,2,5,29 February 2008
Alien," 'Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility'
","I was recently fortunate enough to experience 'Alien (1979)' at the cinema, and now it's become one of my favourite science-fiction films. That Ridley Scott was partly influenced by Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' is a given. When the Nostromo crew members are exploring the unknown planet in their spacesuits, Scott frames the action so that their space helmets claustrophobically crowd his hand-held camera; in this way, as in the Moon-walk in '2001,' the audience imagines themselves walking alongside these figures. It's this evocation of setting that most impressed me about 'Alien.' Despite a relatively modest budget compared to its sequels, the film does an incredible job of genuinely placing the viewer inside its manufactured reality. For this reason, I may be in the minority in declaring my greatest admiration for Scott's opening act, in which the titular Alien scarcely makes an appearance.Though the excessive parade of sequels and spin-offs has potentially dampened its impact, the Alien body design by H.R. Giger remains unforgettable. The organism's arachnid-like appendages and movements are given life – and even an astonishing sort of beauty – by the tall, slender frame of Nigerian-born Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the Alien in most scenes. Additionally, what separates 'Alien' from most inferior 'monster movies' is a legitimate affection for its own monster. In one scene, the Nostromo's science officer Ash (Ian Holm) confesses an admiration for the creature's evolutionary purity, an instinct for survival 'unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.' From this perspective, it's very difficult to hate the Alien. Indeed, in the film's climax, when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) blasts the organism into open space, I even felt an unmistakable pang of regret.",9,2,5,1 January 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 'I can guarantee the closest shave you'll ever know.'
","Only director Tim Burton could possibly contemplate producing a Gothic musical about a murderous, serial-killing barber. 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007)' is one of the bloodiest movies that you'll see all year, but there's something about the juxtaposition of murder and music that makes his film utterly irresistible. The screenplay was adapted from Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical of the same name, which was based on the already-prevalent Sweeney Todd legend from the nineteenth century. Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker, a happy family man who is falsely arrested and deported to a penal colony in Australia after the lustful Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) covets his beautiful wife (Laura Michelle Kelly). After an arduous fifteen years, Barker  now named Sweeney Todd  escapes from imprisonment and returns to the dark, sinister streets of London, where he learns that his wife committed suicide and that the malevolent Turpin has claimed their daughter (Jayne Wisener) as his own. As he strikes up a peculiar romantic relationship with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), the owner of a meat pie store in the shop below him, Sweeney begins to plot a gloriously bloody vengeance.The vast proportion of A-list actors, however Oscar-worthy their talents might be, fail miserably when asked to sing a single line, and so it comes as a surprise that the entire cast of 'Sweeney Todd' does an outstanding job. More than three-quarters of the screenplay is sung rather than spoken, and Depp and Bonham Carter, in particular, reveal themselves to have considerable musical talent {the singing voices you hear are all those of the actors you can see on screen}. Johnny Depp, with a prominent white streak through his stylish black hair, is superbly brooding as the titular character, and his uncontrolled rage during the sequences of bloody throat-slitting is both invigorating and rather terrifying. Also delivering excellent performances are the menacing Alan Rickman, a dangerous and unforgiving representation of corrupt power, the indispensable Timothy Spall, singularly grotesque and unforgettable, and Sacha Baron Cohen, a hilariously supercilious 'Italian' barber of some repute. Of the younger actors, Ed Sanders is the most impressive by far, threatening the steal the limelight on more than a few occasions.Tim Burton's primary trademark as a director is his incredible visual style. 'Sweeney Todd,' set in the dimly-lit streets of a crumbling and uninviting London, successfully evokes the style of David Lean's 'Oliver Twist (1948),' and other Charles Dickens cinematic adaptations. Sweeney's bloodshed is completely uninhibited, and, in a similarly-stylised move to Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill (2003-2004),' graphic spurts of intensely-red blood from the jugular vein are a common occurrence. The violence is extremely cartoonish rather than realistic, and Burton was adamant that such explicit acts of brutality must be included in the film's final product: 'Everything is so internal with Sweeney that {the blood} is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing.' The film's all-important soundtrack was sampled from Stephen Sondheim's stage version of the story {one of the few occasions in which Burton didn't employ the services of Danny Elfman}, and it is suitably thrilling and epic. As 'Sweeney Todd' arrived at its devastating tragic conclusion and the credits began to roll, my two friends alongside me  both possessing a staunch aversion towards musicals  announced their greatest enthusiasm for the film. If there's any loftier praise than that, then I really can't think what it is.",7,0,0,15 February 2008
The Best Years of Our Lives," 'They couldn't train him to put his arms around his girl, or to stroke her hair'
","'The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)' is one of the most powerful war films I've seen, and yet its story begins after WWII had officially ended. Too often in cinema, the end of the battle is considered the end of the war: a sweeping camera movement, an upwelling of stirring music, the hurrah of victorious soldiers, and suddenly everything is all right. But war doesn't end when the guns stop blazing, nor when the politicians put their pens to paper. War lingers for days, months, and years. Returning veterans, even those who emerged from conflict without a scratch, faced an uphill battle to reclaim their former lives, having sacrificed their happiest years in service to their country. In 1946, the issues faced by war veterans had only just come to public light. 1944 saw the introduction of the G.I. Bill, which allowed ex-serviceman access to low-interest loans with which to rebuild their lives. Post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers had previously only been explored in the film noir 'The Blue Dahlia (1946).'Three soldiers from different social classes, returning to their home- town after years of conflict, are united in their desire to rekindle their former lives. But things will never be the same as before. Homer Parrish (true-life war veteran Harold Russell) lost his hands in battle, and fears that his faithful girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell) remains with him only out of pity. Working-class pilot Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) finds that, despite his distinguished achievements in war-time, he still lacks the necessary experience to assimilate into civilian life. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to children he barely recognises, but finds consolation in 'the perfect wife' Myrna Loy. The intertwining journeys faced by each of the veterans are often uncomfortable to watch, sometimes shameful and embarrassing, but the overriding message is one of hope: whatever adversities these men must confront, they can be sure to rely upon the support of their family, friends and the grateful United States government.Gregg Toland's crisp deep-focus photography is excellent, but the major strength in William Wyler's drama are the characters themselves. Harold Russell, who actually did lose his hands in combat, was hand-picked from a military documentary on rehabilitated soldiers, and his performance works so well because it's genuine. Russell is clearly an amateur next to the neatly-balanced dramatics of March and Andrews – he even flubs his characters' wedding vows – but the emotion is authentic, and his pain heartbreaking. Fredric March won his second Oscar (after 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)') for his role as a banker who lost his commercial hardness in the trenches. A little disappointingly, his character doesn't figure prominently in the film's second half, his role somewhat reduced to that of a vector facilitating Andrews' melodramatic, but satisfying, romance with Teresa Wright. I would have liked the film to have more thoroughly explored Stephenson's detached relationship with his children, but evidently there were time constraints to be considered – having said that, though, the 172 minutes flies by effortlessly.",9,4,4,12 July 2009
Battleship Potemkin," 'The time has come for us to speak out.'
","On June 14 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated with the second-rate treatment they receive, and most particularly the maggot-infested meat that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspirational Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decide that the time is ripe for a revolution. And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's rousing classic of Russian propaganda, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin.'The film itself is brimming with shining examples of stunning visual imagery: the spectacles of an overthrown ship captain dangle delicately from the side rope over which he had been tossed; the body of a deceased mutineer lies peaceful upon the shore, the sign on his chest reading 'KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP;' close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are finally fed up with the Tsarist regime; a wayward baby carriage careers down the Odessa Steps as desperate onlookers watch on with bated breath (this scene was memorably 'borrowed' by Brian De Palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'The Untouchables'); the barrels of numerous canons are ominously leveled towards the vastly-outnumbered battleship Potemkin.However, the film itself is best analysed  not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes  but as a single film, and, indeed, every scene is hugely memorable. Though divided into five fairly-distinct chapters, the entire film flows forwards wonderfully; at no point do we find ourselves losing interest, and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards.The film is often referred to as 'propaganda,' and that is exactly what it is, but this need not carry a negative connotation. 'The Battleship Potemkin' was produced by Eisenstein with a specific purpose in mind, and it accomplishes this perfectly in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the unsuccessful 1905 Revolution, 'Potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in its home country, symbolising the revitalization of Russian arts after the Revolution. It is somewhat unfortunate, then, that Eisenstein's film failed to perform well at the Russian box-office, reportedly beaten by Allan Dwan's 1922 'Robin Hood' film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks. Luckily, despite being banned on various occasions in various countries, 'The Battleship Potemkin' fared more admirably overseas.The film also proved a successful vehicle for Eisenstein to test his theories of 'montage.' Through quick-cut editing, and distant shots of the multitudes of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathise with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein does briefly break this mould, however, in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees the ship officer who is trying to kill him, and, of course, during the renowned Odessa Steps sequence, as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the tumbling baby carriage. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched, largely featuring the orchestral works of Dmitri Shostakovich, served wonderfully to heighten the emotional impact of such scenes.One of the greatest films of the silent era, 'The Battleship Potemkin' is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is a significant slice of cinematic history. The highly-exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never actually any violent massacre on the Odessa Steps) have so completely engrained themselves in the memory, that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events. This is a grand achievement.",9,21,26,5 April 2007
Shutter Island," 'It's as if she evaporated, straight through the walls'
","Most psychological thrillers of late, stylistically, have been somewhat cold and clinical – I'm thinking along the lines of Nolan's 'Memento (2000)' and Anderson's 'The Machinist (2004).' The last thriller I can recall with a dazzling colour palette was David Fincher's 'Se7en (1995).' Yet, compared to this film, 'Shutter Island (2010)' has an incredible gracefulness about it. Martin Scorsese has spoken many times of his love for Powell and Pressburger (particularly 'The Red Shoes (1948)'), and this film seems like a very deliberate, and worthy, attempt to mimic the lush visual style of Jack Cardiff's unforgettable Technicolor cinematography. There's a potential problem in painting a thriller film with such warm, inviting colours; the viewer is embraced, rather than repelled, by what he sees. This, however, is exactly what 'Shutter Island' aims for. The audience is thrust into the mind of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his perception of the world becomes our reality.Teddy Daniels is a Federal Marshall sent to an isolated Alcatraz-like penitentiary to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner/mental patient. While battling personal demons of his own, Teddy must get to the bottom of an impossible mystery, all the while faced with hostility from the island authorities. A friend of mine noted that Scorsese was probably inspired by 'The Shining (1980),' and one might cite the use of György Ligeti (one of Kubrick's composers of choice) as evidence for this. However, 'The Shining' was, stylistically, a cold and sterile film, John Alcott's cinematography eerily detached from the horrors perpetrated in the Overlook Hotel. No, Scorsese's primary inspiration was The Archers, and his use of lush, brooding colours and lighting is unforgettably atmospheric {perhaps the closest same-genre reference-point would be Roger Corman's Technicolor Poe adaptations, such as 'The Masque of the Red Death (1964)'}.Unfortunately, thanks to the inherent dangers of trawling the internet, I entered the film already aware of its ending. In any case, Scorsese seems uninterested in orchestrating the typical 'gotcha!' narrative twist that is common to the genre. Even from the outset, the disturbance of the leading character is evident, the viewer frequently a party to his painful delusions. For most of the film's running time, we are quite happy to go along with Teddy, willing to believe his conspiracy theories. We expect to be deceived by the supporting characters, and resolve to see through their deceptions. Then something happens: the film tells us that we've been wrong, and we switch paths. All of a sudden, as he sat thoughtfully on the steps, I felt oddly distant from Teddy Daniels, his previously well-founded theories now dismissed as the musings of a mad-man. Are we, the audience, really that easy to sway? Have we just betrayed a perfectly sane man?",9,2,5,23 March 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," 'I know all the guys that you'd hire to come after me, and they like me better than you.'
","Back in 2001, Steven Soderbergh's slick, stylish, super-cool remake of the 1960 Rat-Pack heist film, 'Ocean's Eleven,' became one of the surprise critical hits of the the year. Featuring a stellar ensemble cast, the film's clever and exciting take on a modern-day Las Vegas casino heist left audiences wanting more. Three years later, Soderbergh and most of the cast returned for the long-awaited sequel, though 'Ocean's Twelve' ultimately failed to deliver the goods. Whilst it was certainly enjoyable to watch  and everybody involved seemed to be having fun  the script was poorly-developed and uninvolving, containing numerous moments requiring significant suspension of disbelief, particularly where Julia Roberts' character was concerned. Fortunately, with 'Ocean's Thirteen,' the filmmakers have returned to what made the first film so unbelievably entertaining: a selection of Hollywood's biggest stars having a crack at the impossible casino caper.Whilst the film has shed the two female stars from the previous film  Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones  the male cast has remained relatively unchanged, with acting veteran Al Pacino thrown in for good measure. This decision allowed for the removal of any clunky love stories from the storyline, keeping the writers (Brian Koppelman and David Levien, both new to the franchise) focused on what is important to the plot. It also allows for some highly amusing man-to-man banter between Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) about the troubles of relationships, the best one featuring Rusty's quirky pancake anecdote. The plot of the film is perhaps more elaborate than you might expect (you could easily lose track of some elements of the story if you're not paying attention), but each of the actors looks as though they are enjoying themselves, and, ultimately, we're enjoying it as well.The film begins when one of Danny's original team  mentor and father-figure, Rueben (Elliott Gould)  suffers a heart attack after being betrayed in a business deal by the ruthless, scheming casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Thirsting for revenge, Danny rallies his loyal troops, and they set about shattering Banks' hopes and dreams on the opening night of his slick and expensive new casino, The Bank. It doesn't matter if the team wins any money, as long as Bank loses out. Danny and his men hatch an extravagant plan to get their retribution, and success will depend entirely on their own resourcefulness and cunning. What are the odds of getting even? Thirteen to one.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner Forgive me for being repetitive, but that is one hell of a cast! Each of the actors understands that the film works best when the characters don't take themselves too seriously, and so their laid-back approach makes their exploits twice as enjoyable. The snappy script is jam-packed with highly-quotable one-liners, and George Clooney, in particular, relishes his sparkling dialogue, delivering it with the suaveness of an Ian Fleming character. Watch out for two clear stand-out scenes in the film: the first featuring a worker's strike at a dice factory in Mexico, and the second involving a very unique episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. All in all, 'Ocean's Thirteen' is a very entertaining thumbs up.",7,1,3,25 June 2007
Lost in Translation," 'Let's never come here again because it will never be as much fun.'
","'Lost in Translation' is a story of feeling lonely in a megacity of 12 million people. Tokyo, Japan is a city constantly on the move, never stopping to rest and always abuzz with flashing lights, loud music and happy and frivolous inhabitants. However, both over-the-hill actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and photographer's wife Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves in the midst of this frenetic chaos, and yet they both harbour that empty feeling of boredom and purposelessness. It is only via an intimate  though entirely platonic  relationship that the two trapped beings are able to discover a certain level of satisfaction, and to carry on their lives with an air of meaning.The film was directed by Sofia Coppola, daughter of acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola ('The Godfather' trilogy, 'Apocalypse Now'), who is fast becoming a respected cinematic figure in her own right. 'Lost in Translation' has a very distinctive film-making style, courtesy of Coppola's intelligent, thoughtful screenplay and Lance Acord's hand-held cinematography. The camera does exceedingly well in capturing the lights and colours of a hectic Tokyo, creating the impression of a city that is very much alive, and yet strangely isolated from the viewer, as if in a dream. This follows very well with the general theme of the film, as the two main protagonists struggle to fit into a confusing and unfamiliar foreign environment. One scene highlights this alienation hilariously well, as an exasperated Bob Harris (Murray) takes instruction from a Japanese director about the filming of an advertisement for Suntory whisky. As the director spouts off a long series of commands in his native tongue, the translator returns with a single very brief instruction, to which a confused Harris declares, 'Is that everything? It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.'When it comes to deadpan humour, Bill Murray does it better than anybody since Buster Keaton. Here, he uses his talents to great effect, conveying in very few words his character's feeling of being completely and utterly lost. Amid a very strained relationship with his resentful wife, Harris feels that his career has long since fallen to pieces, and he begrudges the fact that he has resorted to foreign celebrity advertising to make a living. 'Lost in Translation' also secured the career of a budding young actress in Scarlett Johansson, whose Charlotte is often left alone and forgotten whenever her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) has work to do. The relationship that the two adults develop, despite the significant age difference, is never anything less than completely believable. Perhaps surprisingly, given its modest budget of $4 million, 'Lost in Translation' proved a convincing commercial success, and did very well at the 2004 Academy Awards, winning the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, in addition to nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Murray), Best Director and Best Picture.",8,0,1,30 July 2007
Forrest Gump," A Journey You Simply Cannot Miss...
","Forrest Gump is a good-natured simpleton. His below-average IQ has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of American society.Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back To The Future) and multiple academy-award winner Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen.Though he may not be the smartest person in the world, Forrest Gump has achieved some amazing things. Aside from meeting three different American presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, Forrest has also been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his courage during the Vietnam War, run across the country several times over (because he 'just felt like running'), inspired Elvis Presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the Watergate scandal. At the heart of the film is a love-story. Forrest and his life-long companion, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn- Hurlyburly, The Singing Detective), are two completely different people, and Jenny knows that he deserves better, but Forrest loves her anyway. 'I'm not a smart man,' Forrest declares. 'But I know what love is.'The acting in this film is nothing short of perfect. Tom Hanks demonstrates how he will win his second Best Actor Oscar with this performance. Nobody else could have possibly portrayed Forrest so perfectly. The supporting cast is strong. Robin Wright Penn is good, and Gary Sinise gives the best performance of his career as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.'... Life is a box of chocolates,' Forrest announces at the beginning of the film. 'You never know what you are going to get.' This film is exactly that. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you will laugh, and you will cry. This life's journey is one that you will never forget.",10,5,11,21 July 2006
The Godfather: Part II," 'Your country ain't your blood. Remember that'
","To call 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)' a sequel doesn't quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in 'The Godfather (1972).' This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he'd just been 'baptised' into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody he's ever cared about. Michael's plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in 'The Godfather,' is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called 'American Dream' in which Vito believes so passionately.As with 'The Godfather,' Coppola's film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesn't disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacino's scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction I've ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the 'Godfather' cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.'The Godfather: Part II' is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesn't quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, 'Part II' leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. It's a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesn't seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct 'The Godfather: Part III (1990),' which charts, I believe, Michael Corleone's inevitable downfall. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.",9,1,2,12 March 2009
Fargo," 'Blood has been shed, Jerry.'
","It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the 'true story' of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as 'You betcha,' 'Aw Jeez,' 'Okie-Dokie' and 'Yah.'The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical  almost slapstick  comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a 'funny-looking' weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}.I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list.",7,2,4,19 November 2007
The Aviator," 'I care very much about aviation.'
","Considering he is often heralded as one of the finest directors ever to work in Hollywood, I find it rather surprising to discover that my experience with Martin Scorsese is embarrassingly limited. Outside of his all-time classics {'Taxi Driver (1976),' 'Raging Bull (1980)'}, the enjoyable 'The King of Comedy (1983)' and the interesting but uneven 'Gangs of New York (2002),' I had seen very little from the famed director. 'The Aviator (2004)' was a film about which I was very enthusiastic, as glossy biopics are a favourite sub-genre of mine, and its success at the 2005 Academy Awards {5 wins from 11 nominations} suggested that this film was a type specimen. Unfortunately, Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes proves a bit too 'glossy' for its own good, though there are certainly multiple moments of brilliance amid the fast-moving 170 minutes of skyward drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, finally breaking free of that 'baby-faced' persona that had clung to him throughout his career, is impeccable as notorious film producer, aviator and billionaire, whose mental deterioration and descent into reclusiveness is well-documented in history.'The Aviator' opens in 1927, with a young Howard Hughes directing his first ambitious motion picture, the epic war-time aviation drama, 'Hell's Angels (1930)' {a film that I'm now determined to track down}. Despite countless setbacks, and an expanding budget that stretches into the millions, Hughes is determined to complete his film, whatever the cost. It is in these opening scenes that 'The Aviator' truly hits its stride, and the remainder of the film struggles to keep up; being a director himself, Scorsese obviously delights in retelling an epic film-making tale, and some slick {if not entirely convincing} visual effects help to capture the sheer majesty of Hughe's vision Â– I think that it would have been even more charming for the film to have created these aerial scenes using the same tools that were available in the 1920s {however, there were obvious safety considerations, considering three pilots died during the making of 'Hell's Angels'}. The remainder of the film concerns Hughes' fascination with aviation, his company's tussle with Pan American Airlines, his various female liaisons, and his struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Though he is still perhaps too young to correctly portray a man reaching his forties, Leonardo DiCaprio {in his second collaboration with Scorsese} is excellent in the film's leading role, successfully capturing Hughes' eccentric personality and his OCD-afflicted symptoms. Of course, the film is arguably stolen by Cate Blanchett {in an Oscar-winning role}, who faultlessly channels the spirit of Katharine Hepburn, mimicking her well-recognised tone of voice, mannerisms and general demeanour. Kate Beckinsale {Ava Gardner}, Gwen Stefani {Jean Harlow} and Jude Law {Errol Flynn} also do their best at playing popular Hollywood figures, but these three pale in comparison with Blanchett's epic portrayal. Also memorable in 'The Aviator' are John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, and especially Alan Alda {of TV's 'M*A*S*H'}, who plays a senator allegedly in the pocket of Howard Hughes' greatest rival, Pan Am owner Juan Trippe.",7,2,4,21 January 2008
Burn After Reading," 'You are part of a league of morons'
","In my review of 'North by Northwest (1959),' I proposed that Hitchcock had depicted his F.B.I. agents as omniscient deities presiding over the affairs of Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), interceding sporadically in a Deus Ex Machina-like fashion. 'Burn After Reading (2008)' – the Coen brothers' follow-up to 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' – uses the government authorities in a similar manner. Unlike Hitchcock's Gods, however, the Coens' authorities are hardly omniscient. Owing to round- the-clock surveillance of suspicious individuals, the government is continually aware of the characters' movements; less complete, however, is their understanding of the characters' motivations, and, frankly, they don't want to know. 'Report back to me when it makes sense,' orders a high-ranking C.I.A. official (J.K. Simmons), who's so befuddled at the behaviour of this handful of American citizens that he'd rather cover up their crimes than get to the bottom of them.'Burn After Reading' is a send-up of the thriller, rather than a straight example of the genre. Gym employees Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are complete idiots who happen to stumble upon the memoirs of an insignificant government employee, Osbourne (John Malkovich), and attempt to blackmail him for them. Meanwhile, philandering charmer Harry (George Clooney) sneaks around with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton), and eventually gets himself into all sorts of paranoid strife. The Coens are no stranger to film noir, having incorporated the style into a good half of their films, and here the inevitable failure of greed is played for laughs more than anything else. This breeziness is only possible because the viewer is kept detached from the fates of the characters. Like the various institutions watching bemusedly from the sidelines – government agents, divorce lawyers – the audience is merely a curious spectator in a perverted game of chance.",7,1,4,10 January 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all'
","Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001-03) is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time (perhaps second only to Sergei Bondarchuk's 'War and Peace (1967)'), and played such an immense role in my adolescence that the two years I had to wait to experience its conclusion were as painful as they were gratifying. I'm about to take you on a trip down memory-lane, so bear with me. I first saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' in late January 2002, long after everybody else I knew, owing to a family holiday that nevertheless allowed me to familiarise myself with Tolkien's primary Middle-Earth literature.I greatly enjoyed the novels, and have certainly re-read them since, but this movie was something else. I was immediately transfixed by its magnificent locations, exciting characters, epic scope, and, above all else, its attention to detail. Jackson's prologue gracefully traverses 3000 years of Middle-Earth history, settling finally on the halflings of The Shire, a race of little-people so satisfied with their quaint lifestyles that the goings-on of men and elves are of little consequence to them. It's this balance of the epic and the intimate that makes these films so special. Every time I watch 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I notice something different: the three frozen trolls of Bilbo's tale; the hobbits' hairy, shoeless feet; the glowing of Frodo's 'Sting' blade whenever orcs are close.Each of the film's characters remain true to Tolkien's original stories. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are self-doubting but courageous, as yet oblivious to the roles they will play in shaping Middle-Earth's history. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) projects incredible power and wisdom, but it is infused by the weariness of an old man, the mental ravages of millennia passed. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a valiant wanderer, and the last surviving member of a shattered royal bloodline, an ancestry that seems to affirm his own downfall. Supporting stars Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, each contributing their own spark of personality into this magnificent world of fantastic creatures and terrific evil.Peter Jackson has asserted that his favourite film is 'King Kong (1933),' a prime motivating factor in his decision to direct his own excellent remake in 2005. Both films capture the awe and wonderment of their respective fantasy-worlds, though 'The Lord of the Rings' is even deeper entrenched in a sort of historical mythology, fuelled by a Tolkien legendarium that seems to stretch far beyond even the film's epic scope. We're all inspired by something. I like to describe myself as an amateur filmmaker, a hobby I've maintained for the best part of ten years. I'd already picked up a video camera by the time I saw 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in January 2002, but my prolonged enthusiasm for film-making came from the realisation that movies could be this amazing.",10,0,0,6 July 2010
The Caine Mutiny," 'Here's to the real author of the Caine mutiny.'
","'The Caine Mutiny (1954)' is a film that, for me, never quite came together. It's less than the sum of its parts, and a somewhat cumbersome amalgamation of solid performances and good ideas, but without any clear narrative thread. I don't think it would be unreasonable to assume that the film was heavily influenced by the success of Fred Zinnemann's 'From Here to Eternity (1953).' Both take a strict military environment and include sparing snippets of war-time conflict, but focus largely on the issue of military authority. However, 'The Caine Mutiny,' perhaps aiming to match Lancaster/Kerr or Clift/Reed, also attempts a clumsy romantic subplot, which feels too poorly-developed to have any lasting relevance with the rest of the story.Humphrey Bogart, as one would expect, gives the film's most memorable performance, his continually-paranoid and antagonistic leadership eliciting a curious mix of hatred and pity. Even so, Bogart had already displayed superior talent as a mentally-deteriorating personality in both John Huston's 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)' and Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950).' Fred MacMurray is excellent, playing Keefer, a likable would-be novelist and a self-confessed coward, who, rather than overcoming his shortcomings in order to save his friend's life, unceremoniously abandons and betrays him. Nevertheless, he's hardly played as a villain, as though the film accepts that this is just the way that some people are.Robert Francis has enough charisma to be a good supporting player, but he's simply not strong enough in the lead role. Given time, he might have developed into a big star, but a plane crash in 1955 tragically cut short a promising career. Female co-star May Wynn, aside from having a very good singing voice, is unconvincing in the role of Francis' sweetheart, her acting appearing strained in many of the romance's most intense moments, which aren't, in actual fact, very intense at all. José Ferrer makes an impressive second-billed cameo appearance at the film's climax, playing the lawyer who dutifully defends the accused mutineer, but resents the ship's officers for facilitating, through their own inaction, Cmdr. Queeg's illness; I liked how the conclusion shrewdly blurred the lines of villainy and heroism.The film's strongest scenes are those that involve Bogart, as his character, a 'ticking time-bomb' of denial and paranoia, threatens to destroy all those under his command, and I particularly liked the use of the ball bearings to signify Queeg's escalating nervousness. Nevertheless, Edward Dmytryk, as a director, has yet to impress me as much as I would have liked him to. From the three pictures of his that I've seen  the other two being the hard-boiled noir 'Murder, My Sweet (1944)' and the climbing adventure 'The Mountain (1956)'  he tends to strike me as a very workman-like filmmaker. He gets the job done, of course, and often does a good job of it, but you'd be tentative about blindly choosing one of his films from the DVD shelf. However, I'm perfectly happy to accept recommendations for any Dmytryk films that might break this general mould.",6,3,5,1 May 2008
The Village," Definitely Underrated! **(NO SPOILERS)**
","This film is hardly a horror movie. In fact, I'm certain it was never really meant to be. Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) is a master at creating his own fairy-tale worlds, and his films are wreathed in beauty and symbolism.This film is certainly a beautiful one. The art design is fitting, and James Newton Howard's musical score is beyond perfect. The film moves slowly, as it must to achieve this level of beauty. I believe this is why the film is often misunderstood- many watched it expecting to see a quick-paced, terrifying suspenseful thriller (not unlike the brilliant 'The Sixth Sense') but, instead, were met with something quite different.I will not delve into any details about the plot or the characters, since I think it would be better off to approach this film with as little prior knowledge as possible. Just don't go expecting a genuinely scary thriller, because it's not what you'll get. If you keep an open mind, you might just see something even better!",8,3,4,21 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," 'These are dark times, there is no denying'
","I've always had a bit of a beef with 'Deathly Hallows,' the final novel in J.K. Rowling's lucrative franchise. My main issue is that nothing much happened (or, perhaps more accurately, nothing happened that the discerning reader couldn't spot from 100 pages away). Kill off a marginal character here, throw in a Christ allegory there. And don't get me started on that epilogue! Even so, I approached Part 1 of the final cinematic chapter with a mind uncluttered by prejudice or preconception. I've always thought the reins should have been passed onto a new director for each film, but David Yates at least redeemed himself for the rushed 'Order of the Phoenix (2007)' with 'Half Blood Prince (2009),' which chose its tone and then stuck to it.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)' predictably suffers the pitfalls of its source material: namely, that nothing much happened in the first 400 pages of the novel. Because of this, the film feels more like a prologue than a chapter. Yates does an excellent job at establishing the mood, but then fails to do anything with it. Harry broods for a while, Ron gets angry for no apparent reason, Harry briefly dances to a dubiously out-of-place Nick Cave song, and then returns to his brooding. There's an episodic structure to the narrative, but each episode fails to give any overriding sense of achievement (invariably ending with Death Eaters suddenly bursting onto the scene). And why, for that matter, does Yates insist on constantly trying to surprise us? We know the bloody snake is coming back one more time. I don't like waiting around for obvious shock tactics!But good news there is: the actors are all terrific. The three leads can now carry a movie pretty much by themselves, the services of such veterans as Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, and David Thewlis reduced to a mere sidebar. In the absence of Hogwarts, the locations are beautifully chosen, so secluded and serene that it's difficult to believe that the Fourth Reich is breaking out in the wizarding world. So I've been complaining a lot, but overall I enjoyed the film. Aside from a few amateurish flourishes that got my goat, 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is an enjoyable viewing experience, and I await the final installment - without bated breath, but I await it nevertheless.",7,1,2,10 December 2010
American Psycho," 'I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.'
","I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Bret Easton Ellis' novel, 'American Psycho,' completely sickened me. It's a fascinating dark satire, but mostly for all the wrong reasons, with chapters of indescribably graphic sexual content and violence. If Ellis was aiming to receive a strong emotional response with his novel, then he certainly succeeded. I most definitely didn't enjoy it  in fact, I felt so uncomfortably filthy that I could hardly get to sleep  but he certainly knows which buttons to push. Thus, it was with some trepidation that I approached Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation, which starred an up-and-coming Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a murderous psychopath who finds himself caught up in the rampant materialism of the 1980s and early 1990s. Thankfully, and I say this with the greatest relief imaginable, the intense violence of the novel was toned down considerably for its translation to the screen, and, despite some weak direction in various scenes, Christian Bale's performance is positively awesome.To look at him, you would never have guessed that Patrick Bateman was a disturbed serial killer. He is 27 years of age, handsome, intelligent, impeccably-stylish and holds a high-paying job at the respected Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce. He tries everything within his power to fit into society, but cannot suppress his distaste towards it, erupting into nightly sprees of blood-lust, during which he tortures and murders women and others who evoke his revulsion. Though we are not offered any concrete explanations for Bateman's psychosis, these acts of incredible violence appear to act as a distraction from the frustrating monotony of his 1980s yuppie lifestyle, and as a means of overcoming the intense feelings of inadequacy he harbours among his peers. Though Bateman candidly speaks of his horrific crimes on more than one occasion, the people around him are seemingly so absorbed in their chaotic, materialist lives that they hardly acknowledge his presence. In a stark indictment of American life, society is so busy comparing business cards, booking restaurant reservations, using recreational drugs and discussing fashion trivia that nobody even notices when one unhinged mad-man slaughters dozens of innocent people.Less than a decade ago, Christian Bale was pretty much an unknown, having starred in a few notable films {such as Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun (1987)'}, but nothing that would make him a household name. After a string of actors  Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio  showed a passing interest in the film's main role, the opportunity fell to Bale, who delivers an absolutely extraordinary performance, portraying the infamous Patrick Bateman as cool, calm and collected character on the surface. However, to the scenes of violence, he brings a frenzied intensity to the role that is both disturbing and darkly amusing. Bateman's cocky lectures on 1980s pop music, prior to each of his killing sprees, are delivered with relish. It's perhaps a good thing that the film's director, Mary Harron, was a female, otherwise much of 'American Psycho' might easily have been misconstrued as sexist. In actual fact, the film always stops short of glorifying its gruesome protagonist, following his exploits with obvious disapproval and repulsion.Now we come to the most fascinating question posed by the film: how much of what Bateman does may we accept as reality? In the novel, Bret Easton Ellis cleverly keeps the answer to this completely ambiguous, offering scattered hints that support each of the possibilities. In media interviews, director Mary Harron has stated that she had always intended for Bateman's murders to be completely real, though I think that this is where her direction was a bit weak; I'll wager that almost everybody who hasn't read the book finished the film with the belief that Bateman had imagined all the killings. The final scene, in which Harold Carnes (Stephen Bogaert) claims to have recently had dinner with one of Bateman's victims, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), was handled quite well, since we already know that, throughout the film, it is commonplace for characters to mistake each other for somebody else {indeed, at the start of that very conversation, Carnes refers to Bateman as 'Davis'}. The scene of which I am not quite so enthusiastic is Bateman's revisit to Paul Allen's residence, where he finds a perfectly-clean apartment and a real estate agent. In the novel, it was written in a way that made the reader wonder 'why has the real estate company covered up the horrific murders?' In the film, we're left without any doubt that Bateman is delusional.",7,0,2,29 November 2007
North by Northwest," 'That's funny, that plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no crops'
","Following the commercial failure of 'Vertigo (1958),' Alfred Hitchcock needed a crowd-pleaser. He certainly gave us one. 'North by Northwest (1959)' might just be the most outright entertaining of the director's pictures, a film that exists solely to give its audience a rollicking good time. Throughout his career, Hitchcock often utilised his established stars – for example, Cary Grant in 'Suspicion (1941)' or James Stewart in 'Vertigo (1958)' – as an opportunity to deconstruct their ingrained public image. Here, instead, he simply goes with the flow. In his fourth and final film for the Master of Suspense, Cary Grant plays with a familiar persona – debonair and charming, cocky and mischievous. His Roger O. Thornhill (the arbitrary middle initial an overt jab at producer David O. Selznick) is an advertising executive, superficial and self-serving, but with the charisma to support these dastardly qualities. Such a man is surely in need of a comeuppance, and Hitchcock delights in every plot twist that sees Thornhill plunged ever further into a sadistic practical joke cooked up by the Cold War.Ernest Lehman's screenplay outwardly appears to be little but a selection of spectacular set-pieces strung together by Hitchcock's trademark 'wrong man' motif, but it nonetheless amply supports its running-time (among the director's longest). Cary Grant's charming banter with double-agent Eva Marie Saint is tinged with sly sexual innuendo, and only Hitchcock could have ended a film with the hero's train entering the leading ladies'. well, you get the picture. James Mason brings a dignified vulnerability to the role of Commie spy Phillip Vandamm, but Hitchcock seems only marginally interested in the character, and, indeed, his ultimate fate is completely skipped over (instead, Martin Landau's vicious henchman is given an arch-villain's death). Hitchcock's climax atop a studio reconstruction of Mount Rushmore is only effective thanks to Bernard Hermann's momentous score, but other sequences reek of the director's astonishing aptitude for suspense. The breathless crop-duster ambush is worthy of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it, and Grant's comedic talents shine during both a drunken roadside escape and an impromptu auction-house heckle.That the audience learns of George Kaplan's fictitiousness long before Thornhill ever does may admittedly weaken the suspense, but Hitchcock's motives are instead to recruit the audience into his own position, as director, of omnipotent power. Beneath its surface, 'North by Northwest' appears to be a subtle swing at Cold War politics, and particularly the power wielded by the FBI and government committees like the HUAC. As Thornhill fights to unravel himself from a tangled web of deception and espionage, Hitchcock unexpectedly crosses to a panel of FBI agents, headed by Leo G. Carroll, who bicker indifferently over the mess into which they've got this oblivious pawn. These government employees are happy to sit listlessly by as citizens place their lives on the line, their quarrels bizarrely resembling the conversations of the gods in 'Jason and the Argonauts (1963).' Indeed, like deities, the FBI men wield the power to invent (Kaplan), destroy, or even resurrect (Thornhill) human beings, and intercede sporadically in a suitably Deus Ex Machina-like fashion.",9,0,1,21 July 2009
Doctor Zhivago," 'How did you come to be lost?'
","Few filmmakers can claim to possess the extraordinary cinematic scope of David Lean. The British director began his career in the early 1940s, producing an assortment of relatively 'small' dramas  several adapted from the plays of Noel Coward  and each exhibiting a profound understanding of mise-en-scène. However, it wasn't until 1957 that Lean discovered his true calling: Columbia Pictures gave him a CinemaScope camera. Armed with an enormous tapestry on which to paint his masterpieces, the director produced 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957),' demonstrating to the cinema-going world a new standard in epic film-making, unsurpassed in its day and possibly even in the years since. 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962)'  Lean's second Best Picture Oscar-winner, and probably my second favourite film of all time  cemented his reputation as the master of ambitious epic cinema, and Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography captured the blazing, windswept desert sands in such magnificent detail that your planned holiday to northern Africa now seems rather redundant.If any director was most suited to adapt 'Doctor Zhivago,' Boris Pasternak's mighty retelling of a difficult era in Russia's history, it was, indeed, David Lean. As was the case in his previous film, the plot itself comes second to the director's astonishing ability to capture the majesty of every instant, and to place the audience in the midst of the moment. As such, 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)' lacks any straightforward narrative, but its strength is drawn from the incredible emotion that accompanies each turn in events: it's a story of love, loss, hope, war, family, revolution and death basically, everything that makes life worth living. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) stumbles passively through the turmoil that is Russia during the 1910s, both before and after the onslaught of WWI, and through his submissive eyes we watch citizens acclimatise to the constantly-shifting political climates of the era. During the Revolution of 1917, and the subsequent Russian Civil War, one's very existence was forever in doubt, and the uncertainty of the times consistently casts an ominous shadow over the fate of the film's major characters.Filming for 'Doctor Zhivago,' as was the case in 'Lawrence of Arabia,' was a long and gruelling experience for all involved. As Pasternak's novel was still banned in the Soviet Union at the time of the film's production {it would not be officially published there until 1988, though several earlier samizdat editions could be found}, filming took place primarily in Spain, with several sequences also shot in Finland and Canada. This extensive location-shooting allowed Lean to accurately reproduce the splendour of the Russian wilderness: the bitter cold of the snow-swept winter landscapes, the vibrancy of the fresh and chilled summers. An entire Moscow city-block was recreated just outside Madrid, and it would take a sharp eye to discern that the icy cobbled streets of the film's opening act are not located in the Russian capital. Such are the scenes' authenticity that you shiver at the very thought of stepping outside into the falling snow, and, as Zhivago  encrusted in a numbing case of ice  trudges stiffly through the winterscape, we can almost feel our own limbs becoming numb with frostbite.Rarely has an epic delivered such an impressive display of acting performances. Omar Sharif, who was apparently surprised to have landed the lead character in David Lean's latest, doesn't initially strike one as being 'leading man' material, but it is his passiveness in the role that proves crucial to the telling of Pasternak's story. He wanders dutifully through the changing landscape of Russia, rarely saying what he truly believes, and never displaying any genuine outbursts of emotion; he is a ghost of a person, and simply perseveres through his belief that better times are yet to come. Zhivago's primary emotional outlet is through his poetry, through which he articulates his passions and anguishes, though he only finds himself able to write when he finds himself in a comfortable living situation. His work has been condemned by the government for focusing on personal sentiments rather than the 'good of the state,' an ironic foreshadowing of the censorship that Pasternak himself would encounter. Nevertheless, Zhivago comes across as quite a cold and detached character, and there's a selfishness inherent in his decision not to pursue his estranged family to Paris.Julie Christie provides the film's primary love interest, an abused and neglected woman in whom Zhivago finds an illicit companion. Independent, and yet very vulnerable, Lara forms the emotional core of the story, and it is through her association with the lead character that he is able to divulge his true feelings and pen his finest work. Geraldine Chaplin (for better or worse, a spitting image of her father) is also quite good as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, though her presence  perhaps intentionally  fails to evoke the same glamour and compassion as is the case with Lara. Rod Steiger, who has been greatly impressing me of late, is a slimy figure of egotism and malevolence ('...and don't delude yourself this was rape. That would flatter us both'), though his deeds in the film's final act raise a level of ambiguity that is interesting to ponder: why, indeed, did he arrive to offer Lara warning? The motives of Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago, played by the great Alec Guinness, are similarly uncertain, and his apparent detachedness, almost indifference, to the plight of his half-brother is a puzzling riddle that only a second viewing could possibly resolve.",9,2,3,11 May 2008
The Shining," 'Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in'
","As do most, I can clearly remember the first time I saw 'The Shining (1980).' I must have been thirteen or fourteen, and had just read Stephen King's novel. There was something cold and clinical about the film that really shook my spine; I could never quite put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps it was the drab colours, the detached camera-work, an overwhelming sense of apathy towards the characters' fate. Just recently, I took the opportunity to see 'The Shining' at the cinema (on a double-bill with 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)') and my appreciation for the film hasn't faded. An unhappily-married couple (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) are employed to caretake the Overlook Hotel over winter. As the long, bleak months progress, the Hotel's rich and dark history begins to manifest physically, and Jack's alcoholism and unstable psychological state begins to crumble into maniacal madness.Jack Nicholson's grotesquely over-the-top performance is terrifying, and hilarious, and insanely watchable; Kubrick encouraged Nicholson to overplay the role to its demented maximum. Not surprisingly, his favourite actor was James Cagney, who frequently eschewed realistic method acting in favour of a broiling intensity that suggested a time- bomb on the verge of exploding. Shelley Duvall, meanwhile, does a very good imitation of a complete mental breakdown (in fact, the director himself drove her to the brink with his endless insistence on re-takes, sometimes as many as 100). The exaggerated central performances are strangely at odds with John Alcott's detached cinematography, which surveys the carnage of Jack's mental breakdown with a disquieting aloofness. However, the camera doesn't merely act as an observer; Kubrick uses it to tell the story, his peculiar use of quick zooms serving to claustrophobically constrict the viewer's field of vision and emphasise an element of interest.Throughout the film, frequent (but irregularly-spaced) title cards signal the passage of time, as though counting down to a historical moment. Jack's plummet into insanity thus becomes set in stone, inevitable, and every preceding frame is plagued by the hand of Fate, gently nudging the man towards a predetermined end. In the film's ambiguous epilogue, Jack's image appears in a photograph dated July 4, 1921. Hence, even before we see Jack Torrance first enter the Overlook Hotel, he has already become a part of its history (just as the previous caretaker Charles Grady had formerly known the Hotel through his historical doppelganger Delbert Grady, the butler). Alternatively, these visions could be a manifestation of Jack's alcoholism – note that, in every scene featuring a ghost, there is a mirror present. It can't be mere coincidence that Jack's axe-assault on a bathroom door was clearly inspired by a sequence in Victor Sjöström's 'Körkarlen (1921),' which concerns an alcoholic husband and father.",9,0,0,30 November 2009
"I, Robot"," Surprisingly Good
","When I first heard of 'I, Robot', I felt that it was just going to be a mindless action film that thought it was, in some way, being intelligent in its execution. I was pleasantly surprised. The year is 2035. Human-like robots have become the norm in modern society. They clean our homes, they make our furniture, they deliver our parcels. In Chicago, police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) possesses a seemingly irrational dislike of robots. He is immediately suspicious that an apparent suicide could be the doing of a disobedient robot. His suspicions are quickly dismissed by his peers. After all, such an action would violate the Three Laws, which every robot is programmed to obey.The film is very good. The acting is generally very good- Smith is a very likable sci-fi hero. The stand-out performance would be that of Alan Tudyk who perfectly voices the implicated Robot, named Sunny. The special effects are very good, and the cinematography perfectly displays the future landscape of Chicago. Based on an Isaac Assimov story, 'I, Robot' makes for a genuinely intelligent look at where human technology is heading. I'd rate it just a shade below Spielberg's 'Minority Report' and I'd give it 7/10. Well worth your time!",7,0,2,23 June 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," 'Once more it is being done for love of country'
","Stanley Kramer was more active as a producer rather than a director, but, when he stood for something, he would often take up the reigns himself. Kramer made no apologies for producing 'message films,' and, though his transparent motives have the potential to age poorly, there's no doubt that he had the stature to approach controversial issues  such as racism {'The Defiant Ones (1958)'}, religion {'Inherit the Wind (1960)'} and the Holocaust  with confidence and dignity. 'Judgement at Nuremberg (1961)' wears its pretensions on its sleeve, a film so utterly convinced of its own importance that Kramer must surely have already known about the eleven Oscar nominations before he opened production. Fortunately, much of this self-importance is quite justified. The epic 186-minute courtroom drama tackles some of the fundamental issues in the aftermath of WWII, such as the accountability of higher citizens for the Holocaust and how patriotism has the ability to corrupt human morals. With a mighty cast of Hollywood stars, Kramer impartially dissects the Nuremberg trials, exposing tragedy and hypocrisy.Courtroom dramas have remained such audience favourites because they are a showcase for emotional outbursts and impassioned monologues. 'Judgement at Nuremberg,' in keeping with the tone of its subject matter, is largely gloomy and subdued, only occasionally reaching the thrilling highs of Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' Robert Mulligan's 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or Kramer's own 'Inherit the Wind (1960).' Any speech by Maximilian Schell {who won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, despite being billed fifth} keeps you fixated on the screen, and, likewise, Burt Lancaster's confession and Montgomery Clift's interrogation are must-see moments. The remainder of the film occasionally falls in stagnation, perhaps an inevitable consequence of its format and length, though the drama remains quite watchable, even if I wouldn't fancy a re-viewing until several years from now. The performances are impressive across the board, though Judy Garland, who somehow still retains the rosy cheeks of her childhood, seems terribly out-of-place in such a grim drama.When he isn't in court, American Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) experiences the post-war German lifestyle, as its defeated citizens attempt to reconstruct their shattered lives amid the humiliation of being branded 'evil' by the rest of the world. Screenwriter Abby Mann has it both ways on this issue: on the one hand, he represents the ordinary German civilians as proud and resourceful people, who could never have known the true extent of Hitler's regime. However, Judge Haywood later lambasts this perception, asserting that this argument is merely a self-made delusion, and that their inaction  and, indeed, the inaction of the whole world  was just as contemptible as the acts of those who physically committed the atrocities of the Holocaust. In stating what he believes to be the truth, Haywood invokes the ire of the American government, and severs his close friendship with Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), whose husband was executed for his leadership of the German Army. The truth, it seems, was not something that most people wanted to hear, but Stanley Kramer said it, and we listened.",7,3,5,27 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'The Terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him'
","Watching 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' for the first time in three years made me remember how amazing movies could be. Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course – just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific.Science-fiction has often tackled the notion that Mankind's technology is destined to rebel, as in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).' However, unlike most entries to the genre, 'T2: Judgement Day' takes the time to explore the idea. As in Kubrick's film, the fates of humans and machines become inescapably entwined: Man is no longer merely the designer (a la Dr. Frankenstein) who creates an artificial son, but one who must learn from his progeny. Accordingly, John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) share a father-son relationship that twists back on itself like a Moebius strip, each half teaching the other. In one haunting sequence, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) grimly contemplates the Terminator's unwavering loyalty towards John, and his ironic suitability as a father figure. This grotesque interlacing of familial roles speaks a clear message: if Judgement Day is to be averted, Man and Machine must coexist as equals, though human vanity may never allow it.Throughout the film, Cameron weaves one astonishing action set-piece after another, utilising a seamless combination CGI and optical trickery. The T-1000 Terminator at first glance seems reasonably innocuous, but Robert Patrick brings something icily sinister to the role, a cold intelligence that isn't strictly mechanical but somehow filled with imagination. An equally fascinating character, I thought, was Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, a complete reversal from the innocent Sarah Connor of the previous film. Now emotionally hardened by the prospect of nuclear holocaust, Sarah sees only ghosts where she once saw people, her apathy stemmed only by her maternal instincts towards John. In a haunting dream sequence, Sarah Connor is powerless to warn a younger version of herself (representative of society at large) of the coming dangers, her screams consumed by a nuclear blast that levels cities and engulfs her in flames. Hamilton's performance is bold and ferocious, perhaps cinema's most intense female action role (not coincidentally, James Cameron also provided us with the runner-up, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in 'Aliens (1986)).'",10,8,11,23 November 2009
Duck Soup," 'I got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it.'
","'Duck Soup' was my first Marx Brothers film, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was slightly disappointed with it. After hearing about its comedic brilliance for the longest of times, it's an unfortunate inevitability that the film failed to reward my heightened expectations. The brothers' final production for Paramount Pictures, 'Duck Soup' was also the last screen appearance for Zeppo Marx, before he left the group to pursue other ventures (including opening a large theatrical agency with fifth brother Gummo). Though only mildly successful on its original release, the film has since grown greatly in stature, and is now considered by many to be one of the greatest comedies in cinema history. Obviously, I don't quite share this sentiment, but I'd nonetheless like to talk about the parts of the film that had me laughing.The plot for the film, which is basically a very loose narrative serving the sole purpose of connecting all the jokes, concerns the kingdom of Freedonia, newly-headed by Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). Trentino (Louis Calhern), the ambassador of neighbouring kingdom, Sylvania, wishes to gain control of Freedonia by marrying the wealthy and influential Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). To aid his cause, Trentino hires two spies, Chicolini and Pinky (Chico and Harpo Marx, respectively) to shadow Firefly and report on his movements. After relations between the two nations break down, their disagreements escalate into a fully-fledged war.Without a doubt, Groucho was my favourite of the quartet. Hidden behind his trademark fake moustache, eyebrows and glasses, his character is the epitome of quick wit, delivering a seemingly endless stream of puns, double entendres and insults. The verbal gags come so thick and fast that, by the time you've registered the punchline and finished laughing, you've already missed the subsequent three jokes. Chico also has his fair share of good lines, and Harpo  the silent member of the crew  has a lot of fun with the physical side of comedy, with the help of a limitless supply of props hidden within his clothing. Perhaps it was just my general ignorance, but it took me a very long time to work out which character was played by Zeppo, usually regarded as the 'straight-man' of the group.The mirror pantomime sequence  first used in Charles Chaplin's 'The Floorwalker'  is a classic gag, and probably my favourite of the lot. Harpo's peculiar habit of using his scissors to snip everything within reach also brought a few solid laughs, not to mention Groucho's energetic delivery of quick-witted wisecracks. However, it all seemed so inconsequential. At the end of the day, once the 68 minutes were over, it didn't seem as though anything had been achieved. I've never really been a huge fan of the so-called 'anarchic comedy' genre (for example, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' left me completely cold), and so perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference. In spite of this, I did find 'Duck Soup' sufficiently entertaining to warrant another exploration into the films of the Marx Brothers.",7,3,3,25 September 2007
Apocalypse Now," 'Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror'
","Unlike the bulk of war films, 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is not really about war, or, at least, it is only superficially so. The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness (1899)'  a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting  Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru.'We had access to too much money too much equipment. And, little by little, we went insane.' Fresh from the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' its sequel and 'The Conversation (1974),' Francis Ford Coppola was among the most respected filmmakers of his era. For his long-awaited next project, he decided upon 'Apocalypse Now,' then oblivious to the extent to which the film would crush his spirit. As grippingly documented in the unmissable making-of documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991),' the film's production parallels that of the story it depicts  an intrepid director embarks on an impossible mission, its conclusion unknown, choosing against his better judgement to continue filming at any cost, risking insanity and financial ruin. A modest on-location shooting period soon ballooned into nearly 16 months; typhoons destroyed expensive sets; leading man Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack and battled alcoholism; the Philippine military frequently whisked away their helicopters to be used in active combat against rebel insurgents. It was Hell broken loose  for Coppola, the apocalypse had arrived.The film's screenplay, by Coppola and John Milius (with Willard's memorable voice-over penned by Michael Herr), still retains many of the themes of Conrad's original novella, with Kurtz's distaste for British Colonialism replaced with his disgust at the needless hypocrisy of the United States' interventionism. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) certainly isn't a typical war hero: even at the film's beginning, he sits at the verge of breakdown. As he lounges in a sweaty Saigon motel room, Willard contemplates the seductive stench of a napalm strike, equates the beating of the ceiling fan with the muffled whirr of a military chopper; he craves the horrors of the jungle combat, and he's not alone. Many lesser war films are content to settle on the age-old cliché that 'war is hell,' before hypocritically celebrating the overblown heroism of its brave soldiers. Coppola here does no such thing. In Vietnam, soldiers are mere pawns in this absurd, sadistic mockery of life and common sense; and war creates no heroes, but turns us all into monsters.Note the progressive dwindling of humanity as Willard works his way upriver. At the river's mouth, the laid-back Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) casually goes about his duties, launching an explosive aerial assault on a Vietnamese village (to the bombastic notes of Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries') purely because of the beach's ideal surfing conditions. This nonchalant fool retains enough compassion to bring water to a dying enemy soldier, but discards the canteen as soon as he notices the arrival of a famous American surfer. We progress upstream: a love-sick mob of recruits overrun a USO show, a boatload of Vietnamese civilians are gunned down in a moment of panic, a final American outpost operates frantically without any form of command. By the time they reach Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) outpost in Cambodia, where natives have idolised him as a demi-god, Captain Willard and his remaining crew have shed every last sliver of humour, purpose and humanity. They progress, as in a drug-induced haze, towards the now-inescapable mouth of madness.Watching 'Apocalypse Now'  particularly in the cinema, as I recently did  was an extraordinarily invigorating experience, and I left the theatre with a cold chill down my spine. As a work of film-making, it is, to quote Colonel Kurtz, 'perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.' Vittorio Storaro's on-location cinematography is completely breathtaking in its scope and immediacy, shifting gradually from the open-air theatrics of Kilgore's morning aerial assault to the closed, claustrophobic shadows of Kurtz's compound. At the long-awaited premiere, Coppola described his film, perhaps a tad pretentiously, as 'not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam; it's what it was really like.' I'm inclined to agree. With respect to Steven Spielberg's accomplishments in 'Saving Private Ryan (1998),' I'd imagine that the human experience of war is not one of terrifying realism and clarity, but of a dream, the sensation of stumbling through a surreal carnival house of horrors. In the film's final moments, as that shadow of a helicopter flitters across the screen, we know that, wherever he goes from here, Willard will never truly leave the jungle.",10,1,2,14 October 2008
The Battle of Algiers," 'We aren't madmen or sadists, gentlemen we are soldiers and our only duty is to win.'
","When 'La Battaglia di Algeri {The Battle of Algiers}' premiered in the United States in 1967, it carried a disclaimer, assuring the audience that 'not one foot' of actual newsreel footage was used in the compilation of the film. This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentary-realism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries, and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anti-colonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage; surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians, is jostled by the crowd, reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire, and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score, composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone.'The Battle of Algiers' recreates the Algerian War of Independence, from November 1954 to December 1960, focusing entirely on the capital city of Algiers. Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France, a selection of determined civilians (Brahim Hagiag, Yacef Saadi  the latter playing a fictional version of himself) form the National Liberation Front (FLN), who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers, led by Colonel Mathieu (believed to be a combination of real-life officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu, and played by Jean Martin). In a bid to combat the frequent street-bombs and police officer shootings, Mathieu employs any possible means, including lynch mobs, murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple: 'should we remain in Algeria? If you answer 'yes,' then you must accept all the necessary consequences.'Another element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause (an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government), it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my post-September 11/Bali bombings mentality coming through, but, having entered the film without any background knowledge, I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers, hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly, café-bombing terrorists. Unlike other seemingly-similar revolution pictures (such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925)'), 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda: every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat; every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clear-cut heroes and villains here; everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful.",8,4,8,23 October 2007
Rocky IV," 'It's suicide. You've seen him, you know how strong he is. You can't win.'
","First of all, let us get the obvious out of the way: 'Rocky IV' is not a great film. Even naming it as a good film would be a decidedly generous assessment. There is extremely little character development. Adrian (Talia Shire) and Paulie (Burt Young), unlike in the first two films (and to a certain extent, the third one), are given very little to do, and the film never attempts to further explore their relationship with Rocky. In fact, Paulie is basically relegated to a clichéd comic-relief character.However, I really am surprised to find myself saying that 'Rocky IV' does contain a few fine moments, most particularly Rocky's training montage in Russia, intercut with the arduous exercise routine of his opponent. It appears that, in order to emerge victorious, Rocky has returned to nature. Whilst Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) runs on a treadmill in a stuffy training studio, Rocky jogs through the open air of the Russian wilderness; whilst Drago lifts a hefty weights bar, Rocky lifts a wagon; whilst Drago pumps himself full of steroids, Rocky shovels down spoonfuls of spinach. This montage, set to the inspirational tune of a Survivor song I can't remember, culminates in a genuinely spectacular aerial shot of Rocky standing victorious at the peak of a snowy mountain, the glorious sun beaming behind him as he shouts his opponent's name in readiness.The final boxing match is cartoonish, over-the-top and ultimately everything we've come to expect from a 'Rocky' film. It is also somewhat amusing to witness how Rocky manages to single-handedly win over a stadium full of fiercely patriotic Russian communists through his remarkable American courage and dogged determination. From the moment the fight begins, we already know that Rocky is going to win, but that is beside the point. We just want to be there to cheer him on.",6,1,3,20 February 2007
Collateral," Michael Mann's Brilliant Gritty Thriller.
","When a prominent actor such as Tom Cruise, accustomed to portraying heroes on screen, decides to try his hands at being a villain, it is always interesting to view the final result. Will the character be believably villainous? Will we be able to forget all those occasions that Ethan Hunt or John Anderton or Jerry Maguire or Maverick saved the day with his gallant efforts, and instead learn to loathe this character? Not surprisingly, a grey-haired, quick-witted Tom Cruise does incredibly well, reminding us that he is a superb actor, after all!Max (Jamie Foxx, 'Ray,' 2004) is a Los Angeles cab driver. Having maintained the same job for twelve years, Max yearns for change, but he can't accept that his dreams of starting a limousine company will never materialise. It is then that Vincent (Tom Cruise, 'Minority Report,' 2002) takes a seat in Max's cab. He instructs Max to travel to an apartment complex, and, once they arrive, to await his prompt return. Waiting patiently, Max is thoroughly shocked when a body plummets from an upper-floor window and obliterates his car windscreen.A cool and collected Vincent returns, a pistol clasped in his hand, and he commands Max to drive him around the city to each of his hits. When an aghast Max splutters, 'You killed him?' Vincent replies with a matter-of-fact, 'No, I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.'Vincent is a complex and effective film character, and Cruise portrays him suitably. Foxx turns in a stellar performance for which, despite being the leading actor in the film, he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination (in any case, he won the Best Actor Oscar for 'Ray' that same year).'Collateral' was the first major motion picture to be shot with the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, and this, coupled with director Michael Mann's decision to film with a hand-held camera, gives the film a raw, gritty feel, adding a sense of realism to the plot.",8,1,2,6 November 2006
Ratatouille," 'If you are what you eat, then I only want to eat the good stuff.'
","In the last decade or so, beginning their incredible run with 'Toy Story,' we've come to expect nothing less than masterpieces from Pixar studios, and they've rarely  if ever  disappointed us. My favourite Pixar animated feature to date would probably be 'Monsters Inc.,' followed by 'A Bug's Life,' with the remainder of their CV not dwelling too far behind. Nobody in their right minds would consider producing a children's film that featured rats lurking around kitchens, and yet, not only is director Brad Bird in his right mind, but he's also made it work. Welcome to the beautiful city of Paris, France  the food capital of the world - where a young and aspiring rat named Rémy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) dreams of becoming a first-class chef, despite the complete lack of support from his family and human beings' natural aversion towards rodents. Welcome to 'Ratatouille.'At the heart of every great Pixar film is a fantastic story, often simple but always funny and touching. 'Ratatouille' (pronounced, we are told, 'Rat-a-too-ee') teaches us to always pursue our hopes and dreams, whatever obstacles or limitations are placed in our way. It was directed by Brad Bird ('The Incredibles'), who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. Though the plot is perhaps just a tad predictable, the screenplay is beautifully written, with an abundance of funny one-liners and colourful characters. Whilst Rémy refuses to eat nothing less than the best, his older brother Émile (Peter Sohn) will gobble down any garbage he finds, and his father (Brian Dennehy) assigns Rémy  due to his uncanny ability to smell the ingredients in any food  to become the colony's resident poison-sniffer. When Rémy fails in his attempt to steal fine herbs from the kitchen of a crazy old lady, he becomes separated from his family. The legendary but recently-deceased chef, Auguste Gusteau (Pixar regular Brad Garrett), who had inspired Rémy with his motto 'anybody can cook!' appears before the rat as a shadowy figment of his imagination, offering him guidance and advice.Thus, Rémy stumbles his way into Gusteau's fine-dining restaurant, now managed by the devious Skinner (Ian Holm). A lot of the physical comedy in the film comes from Linguini (Lou Romano), the garbage-boy at the restaurant, with whom Rémy reaches a tentative arrangement: by hiding himself beneath Linguini's hat and controlling his movements by yanking at tufts of his hair, Rémy will be able to demonstrate his expertise for food preparation. But will he be able to accomplish this without arousing Skinner's suspicion? And can Linguini successfully win over meat and poultry chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), the most aggressive cook in the kitchen? Of course, they must then contend with Paris' most-dreaded food critic, Anton Ego, voiced with great relish by cinema legend Peter O'Toole.Visually, 'Ratatouille' is a masterpiece. Of course, there still remain huge innovations to be made in the field of human animation, but the rodents themselves look absolutely fantastic. An early scene, in which a huge group of rats charge frantically towards the river, looks so incredibly realistic that I pity any audience member suffering from musophobia. Additionally, the nighttime panoramas of a brightly-lit Paris are nothing less than magnificent, with every minute detail of the city painstakingly translated onto the screen. The film is an exciting blend of comedic and dramatic scenes, and elaborate action sequences, each executed with care and patience. The foods all look delicious, as well. The scene in which the ruthless Anton Ego is rendered speechless by Rémy's delicious serving of ratatouille niçoise is handled exceedingly well, and I must admit that a tear came to my eye when the 'peasant dish' swept the sullen critic back to his glorious and almost-forgotten childhood. I don't think the friends I brought along to the cinema would agree with my assessment, but 'Ratatouille' is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year.",8,4,6,16 September 2007
Quantum of Solace," 'There is something horribly efficient about you'
","Arghh, I've got a splitting headache! The human brain only process a certain number of images every second, and when a film has an average shot length of about 0.4 seconds, it really clouds one's perception. It's not that 'Quantum of Solace (2008)' isn't a classy film; it's classy in the great Bond tradition, blending cheap thrills with sophisticated banter, nefarious villains and gorgeous women. But when, as an enthusiastic cinema-goer, I dread the arrival of the next action sequence, something has gone seriously wrong. Marc Forster is a talented director, as evidenced by 'Stranger than Fiction (2006),' and he has a good visual flair, handling Bond's quieter moments with a steady and sophisticated hand. However, if his idea of an action scene is to cut frenetically to a different angle three times a second, with a shaky camera that suggests you're driving alongside 007 on a malfunctioning washing-machine, then he really needs to stick to quiet, contemplative dramas and light comedies. When all is said and done, I can't appreciate the artistry of a sequence if I can't decipher what is going on.I don't want to dwell on the negatives, though. 'Quantum of Solace' improves considerably in its second half, surrendering an overload of adrenalin-charge action set-pieces for a more understated, brooding tale of loss, regret and retribution. The film is a follow-on from Martin Campbell's 'Casino Royale (2006),' though it remains independent enough to succeed as a standalone film, such that even new arrivals to the franchise (assuming they exist) can still follow the story reasonably well. Daniel Craig, in his second turn as Ian Fleming's famous MI6 agent, has not lost any of his potency, managing somehow to come across as both brutal and tender at the same time. Judi Dench, as M, continues to prove that even an old woman can be commanding enough to boss around Britain's toughest spy, a triumph of casting if you ask me. Olga Kurylenko does well as Bond's strong-willed female sidekick, though she's not quite strong enough to get along without the guiding masculine hand of 007; it wouldn't be a Bond film if the girls could take care of themselves, would it?Craig's portrayal of Bond is that of a tortured human being; a rather exceptional one, of course, but a human nonetheless. This effectively harks back to Sean Connery's earliest portrayals  in 'Dr. No (1962)' and 'From Russia With Love (1963)'  in which Bond wasn't an agile, unassailable superhuman, but a suave government agent with a frightening mean streak. Craig certainly brings more humility to the role, but his inherent personal vulnerability is a facet of his character that I'm glad is being explored. The primary villain of 'Quantum of Solace' is a greasy-haired Frenchman named Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), whose sinister plan involves cornering the water supply of Bolivia. It doesn't sound very diabolic when you say it like that, but look deeper and there's something more ominous afoot. Greene belongs to a shady organisation named Quantum, of which even MI6 knows practically nothing, and whose members will certainly play a larger role in the inevitable Bond 23. As long as the next appointed director exerts more effort in keeping the action sequences discernible, then I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.",6,0,1,21 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," 'It's an historic moment you can tell your grandchildren about - how you watched the Old South fall one night.'
","Producer David O. Selznick must have known in advance that 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' would become the highest-grossing motion picture ever made. He purchased the rights to Margaret Mitchell's bestselling novel for an unprecedented $50,000, heaped a truckload of money into the project and exhausted the efforts of no less than three directors  Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood and possibly a few others, including William Cameron Menzies and B. Reeves Eason. Such was Selznick's passion for the project that he is typically credited as the prime architect of the film's success, a definitive exception to the auteur theory  unless, of course, one simply considers Selznick to be the auteur. The extravagance of the production is instantly recognised in the film's elaborate costume and set design, in addition to Ernest Haller's sweeping epic cinematography. If it weren't for such lavishness, the picture might easily have vanished into the background as a stuffy, overwrought melodrama; but film-making of this magnitude leaves a considerable imprint on one's memory, and audiences have come to epitomise 'Gone with the Wind' as the embodiment of Hollywood's Golden Age.The most exciting acts of the story, which was adapted by Sidney Howard from Mitchell's novel, take place during the Civil War, when the triumphant Yankees are marching towards Atlanta, casting an ominous shadow over the ill-fated city. The grandiose scope of the photography  the seemingly-endless sprawl of wounded soldiers, the desperate last-minute dash past the blazing munitions factory  would go unrivalled until the late 1950s, when David Lean discovered the widescreen camera. Clarke Gable was the fans' only choice for the role of the roguish but noble Rhett Butler, but it's Scarlett O'Hara whom I find most interesting, even if I disliked her more and more as the film progressed. The 1930s was very much a decade of change in how women were portrayed in cinema, with actresses such as Mae West ('I'm No Angel (1933)') and Bette Davis ('Dark Victory (1939)') achieving success as smart, independent characters, shifting away from the notion of the 'damsel in distress.' Scarlett, a role eventually given to unknown Vivien Leigh, was the apex of the independent woman  so independent, in fact, that she could never be happy in love with a man.The film has a fascinatingly-ambivalent relationship with its main protagonist, Scarlett O'Hara. She is obviously a very strong female character, and her resourcefulness and enterprise in difficult times is justly-celebrated however, at what price? In order to spite the Yankees for destroying her way of life, Scarlett essentially becomes those whom she holds in such contempt, surrendering any remaining traces of honour or integrity. There's no doubt that she commits damnable atrocities, often at the expense of those who love her, but the film can't quite bring itself to hate her  the audience is left suspended in midstream, presented with a wolf in sheep's clothing, but nonetheless expected to celebrate the clothing for its practicality and expediency. Conversely, Melanie Hamilton (the lovely Olivia de Havilland) embodies kindness and selflessness, but she is inevitably doomed to a premature death, perhaps a product of her inability to adapt to this new lifestyle. In the gritty aftermath of the American Civil War, the kind and decent are condemned to an uneasy demise, whereas the crass, opportunistic Scarlett lives to greet another day.The film should have ended with Clarke Gable's immortal parting words, a fade to black as his figure disappears forever into the mist, with our selfish and unprincipled anti-heroine having finally received her comeuppance, three times filled and running over. After stopping at nothing to obtain what she wants, Scarlett ultimately finds that she has been chasing an illusion, and, in the meantime, she has pushed away all that she still holds dear in this world, the one man who potentially offered her a lifetime of happiness. But, alas, Selznick had a lot of money riding on this picture, and it certainly would not have done to disappoint the ladies in the audience. Instead, the film concludes with Scarlett's optimistic epitaph  'after all, tomorrow is another day!'  implying that she may eventually win Rhett back, or, at least, that she'll never stop trying. Whether I want her to succeed is an entirely different matter. Scarlett is almost the female equivalent of Tim Holt's George Amberson-Minafer, arrogant and thoroughly deserving of a comeuppance, and neither deserved a happy ending, regardless of whether or not the studio provided one.",8,2,3,27 June 2008
No Country for Old Men," 'Even in the contest between man and steer, the issue is not certain.'
","There are very few filmmakers working today who can match up against Joel and Ethan Coen. Since their neo-noirish debut with 'Blood Simple. (1984),' the brother directors have dominated modern cinema with their unique brand of writing and storytelling, evoking the atmosphere of classic films while always maintaining a distinct sense of originality. 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' comes after a somewhat disappointing five-year stretch, during which they produced the second-tier remake, 'The Ladykillers (2003),' and the fun but inconsequential 'Intolerable Cruelty (2004).' Adapting the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the Coens have created one of the most harrowingly-intense cinema experiences you'll have all year, a cat-and-mouse game of drugs, violence, money and murder that will leave you gasping for air, and clawing at your armrest in search of some comfort. While this film is not the pair's most respectable outing  there's a certain roughness to the film that I couldn't quite connect with  they've certainly never delivered anything so chillingly gruesome and suspenseful.The year is 1980. When local hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon the site of a massacre in the middle of the parched, Texan desert, the apparent aftermath of drug deal gone wrong, his discovery of the $2 million payment, bunched neatly in a leather suitcase, prompts him to make a few decisions he'll come to regret later on. A psychopathic hit-man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a grotesque killer with no scruples, arrives at the scene to recover the money, only to find the loot missing and the remains of Llewelyn's abandoned vehicle. While the two men play a deadly game of hide-and-seek across the Texan countryside  Anton killing fellow conspirators, law enforcers and innocent victims at every turn  soon-to-be-retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) reluctantly follows, disillusioned by the overwhelming amount of evil present in the current world. The exploits of these three main characters, though they rarely share the screen, seem to blend feverishly among one another, and the eventual outcome of the story is one that you're unlikely to see coming.Anton Chigurh is certainly one of the more formidable villains to come our way in recent years. Though lacking the complexity of somebody like Hannibal Lecter, Chigurh is most terrifying because he is the complete opposite: silent, methodical, ruthless His actions are almost mechanical in their simplicity and practicality; he will do whatever is needed to get the job done, with little thought for human life {it would not be unreasonable to liken Chigurh to the Terminator (1984)}. His opening scene is the cinematic equivalent of a violent kick in the gut, a sequence as shockingly violent as I've seen in the first five minutes of any movie in recent memory {though, admittedly, I do tend to stay away from any film that promises a lot of bloodshed}. After this, the Coens show no signs of letting up, and, time after time, we are treated to one graphic death after another. The presence of a few off-screen murders does show that the two filmmakers' awareness that a cut-away is often more appropriate, but I think perhaps their penchant for blood takes the film a bit too far. I'm generally all right with violence if it contributes to the story, but at what point does it simply become gratuitous?Sprinkled amongst all the tattered bodies in Anton Chigurh's wake is a Coen Brothers script that delivers the black humour and witty dialogue of most of their previous films. The screenplay cleverly interweaves the extreme violence of the story with an amusing combination of droll banter and uneasy conversation, most noticeable in the scene in which Chigurh challenges a nervous service station owner to a coin toss ('what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?'). Though I chuckled quite regularly, I also feel the need to denounce the film-goer in the row ahead of me, who, rather distractingly, laughed at every single line as though it was the greatest thing since Charles Chaplin got himself caught on the conveyor belt. 'No Country for Old Men' is most stylistically similar to the Coens' debut effort, 'Blood Simple. (1984),' and, thematically, it deals with the same issues explored in both this and 'Fargo (1996);' namely, the corrupting power of money.The ending for the film, which was greeted by a hushed moment of universal confusion in the cinema, remains true to the source material. Though it was undoubtedly interesting to hear Sheriff Ed Tom Bell recounting his confused and insightful dreams, the tension in the final twenty minutes drops off so dramatically that 'anti-climax' is the only word that comes to mind. The Sheriff's vision of his long-deceased father 'riding on past' and 'fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold' is an obvious allusion to death and the possible afterlife. As near as I can tell, and I have a history of missing the point on such thing, the dream seems to be summarising the film by declaring that there is evil in the world, there always has been evil in the world, and there always will be. Perhaps the only way you can escape this evil is in death, where the Sheriff's father is waiting for him by a roaring fire in the depths of the cold, dark night.",8,6,13,4 January 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," 'Don't that picture look dusty?'
","There is beauty to be found everywhere in this world  in the haunting loneliness of the deep American wilderness; in the glowing, brooding eyes of a man before a fireplace; in the subtle, nervous flicker of the eyelids, a barely discernible inflection of human interaction; even in the murder of a man, the bullet thumping shockingly through the back of the head, his neck slumping forwards into the frame of a polished canvas depicting a nautical vessel. The beauty is to be found in the details, in the magnificent unknown elements that fall between the lines of historical records and glorified parables. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)' is only the second film from Australian director Andrew Dominik, who spent five years crafting his intricate follow-up to the impressive local production, 'Chopper (2000).' Though originally intended for a 2006 release, the film arrived just in time for the Western genre 'revival' that took place in 2007, the finest example from a group that included James Mangold's '3:10 to Yuma (2007)' and the Coen brothers' 'No Country For Old Men (2007)' {which some critics have described as a 'modern Western'}.Even if you were to find little else worth mentioning in 'The Assassination of Jesse James,' most will agree that it is among the most visually-stunning films you'll ever see, with Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography capturing the landscapes and moods of Jesse James' tale with breathtaking majesty. Every shot is elegantly and faultlessly composed and executed, offering a visual depth to the film that certainly complements the narrative {unlike Seamus McGarvey's work for 'Atonement (2007),' which was gorgeous but occasionally struck me as superficial}. The slow-burning plot is guided by the brilliance of the photography, but, rather than being overshadowed by the visuals, merges into a single entity that envelopes the viewer, absorbing them into the brooding world of both Jesse James and Robert Ford, the man who would put a bullet into his head. Though, on several occasions, I felt that the plot was deviating slightly from the vital interactions between James and Ford, a little patience convinced me that these elements of the story were nevertheless vital to the plot. The pacing of the 160-minute picture is deliberate, lyrical and contemplative, but never slow  anybody who suggests otherwise was obviously viewing the film in the wrong mindset.The two characters highlighted in the film's lengthy title are portrayed with impeccable precision by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, respectively, who deliver performances equal to anything else they've ever done. In today's Hollywood, Pitt is an under-appreciated talent, too often berated for his 'pretty boy' persona and often criticised for playing a version of himself. The latter is an easy mistake to make, however, a closer inspection reveals that Jesse James is like nobody that the star has played before. Though his performance doesn't initially stand out as being particularly notable, Pitt inhabits the infamous outlaw so convincingly that you hardly give him a second thought. Every gesture and movement  his granulated blue eyes burning with fire and suspicion, his cautious and knowing tone of voice, his confident yet understated stride  is perfect to the letter. Affleck, who is hopefully steering towards a Best Supporting Actor Oscar at present, portrays a lonely, pathetic sycophant, a seamless performance that is exemplified by the subtle nuances of his character, from the tentative Southern drawl to the frequent downward flicker of his eyes. Also worth mentioning is Sam Rockwell, who has a prominent role as Robert's brother, Charley.In criticising 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,' some have cited the segments of Hugh Ross' narration for distracting from the plot. However, I thought it was very well suited to the tone of the film, highlighting one major theme of the story  that history, as it is written, fails absolutely in reconstructing the events of April 3, 1882. Ross' narration is dry and professional, which, along with the occasionally cloudy cinematography, seems to be Dominik's way of stressing that the film's events are merely an assumed fictionalisation of real, ultimately unknowable events. The intentional encyclopedia-like tone of the voice-over could perhaps also operate as a critique of itself, a subtle satire that scorns the notion that any historical record could possibly communicate the mood and emotions of Robert Ford's relationship with Jesse James. Both mesmerising and entertaining, Andrew Dominik's memorable motion picture is one of the year's finest offerings, and possibly among the top ten to have been released this decade.",9,4,9,11 February 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," 'Nothing is written.'
","The parched vastness of the desert stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. The glorious morning sun begins to rise from beneath the earth, casting brilliant rays of searing light across the scorched landscape. In the distance, barely noticeable to the human eye, a dark speck appears. We watch, we wait. The tiny approaching figure, ever so gradually, moves tantalisingly closer, and we lean forward to discern it, the enormity of the Arabian desert instantly enveloping us, consuming us. We are there. When a character gazes up at the blazing overhead sun  an immense ball of fire in the sky  we feel it burning our skin, and we, too, yearn for that life-saving swig of water.David Lean's epic masterpiece, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' is one of those precious few films that is capable of completely absorbing the audience into its world. Just like Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterwork '2001: A Space Odyssey' of 1968, the plot of the film is not what we ultimately remember. When asked why it is such a great film, we can only recall the sheer majesty of the images that have been permanently seared into our minds  Lawrence blows out a burning match, which becomes the rising desert sun; a stranded soldier, stumbling across the sands, gazes up in horror as the first rays of morning sunlight beam across the land; a triumphant Lawrence, dressed in flowing white robes, poses at the summit of an enemy trainwreck, the sun glimmering behind him as if he is a god. Minute after minute, for the entire four-hour running time, we are simply bombarded with unforgettable images, thanks to the Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography, a stirring score from Maurice Jarre and director David Lean's epic cinematic vision.Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward 'T.E.' Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) died on May 19, 1935 after a horrific motorcycle accident. He was honoured with a bust in St. Paul's Cathedral for his liaison role during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18, his achievements made famous by the sensationalised newspaper writings of American journalist Lowell Thomas, who is represented in the film by the character of Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). Lawrence's funeral leaves us with several unanswered questions regarding what sort of man he really was: was he a 'poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior,' or, as Bentley suggests after the departure of the reporter, 'the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey?''Lawrence of Arabia,' very loosely based on Lawrence's personal memoirs, shows how, throughout his exploits in Arabia, he was a man trapped between two cultures, torn between his allegiances to Britain and its army, and to his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes, to whom he had promised freedom. He also battles to understand his own emotional reactions towards violence in war, his uncertainty beginning with the shocking satisfaction he experiences upon executing one of his companions. Early in his exploits, Lawrence embodies the qualities present in all great historical heroes: courage and determination, self-assurance and loyalty. Nearing the end of a harrowing march across the impassable Nefud Desert, though ragged from exhaustion and desperate for hydration, Lawrence turns his camel around in search of Gasim, a fellow comrade who was unknowingly left behind after succumbing to sleep and falling off his mount. However, as Lawrence's victories become many, he finds that his humility has been replaced with arrogance, and his bravery with blood-thirsty cowardice.The acting performances in this film are absolutely stunning all-round. Peter O'Toole ('The Lion in Winter') is undeniably brilliant as T.E. Lawrence, masterfully portraying a complex character in his debut high-profile role. It is perhaps unfortunate that he came up against Gregory Peck's equally memorable role as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' at the 1963 Oscars, otherwise he most certainly would have won Best Actor. To this day, despite a total of eight nominations, O'Toole remains without a competitive Oscar, though he did receive an Academy Honorary Award in 2003 for his collective body of work.A stunning supporting cast complements O'Toole's performance, and the film simply could not have been as powerful if any of the supporting roles were anything less than perfect. Alec Guiness ('The Bridge on the River Kwai')  who had originally wanted the role of Lawrence, but was turned down due to his age  plays Prince Feisal, the Arab leader who learns to value Lawrence's advice and assistance. Anthony Quinn ('Zorba the Greek') portrays Auda ibu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe of Bedouin Arabs, whom Lawrence convinces to invade the city of Aqaba. Omar Sharif is brilliant as Sheriff Ali, a man who inexplicably becomes Lawrence's most loyal comrade, though he fears what his good friend has become in the face of success. Other notable performances in the film come from Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Anthony Quayle, Arthur Kennedy and José Ferrer.In terms of David Lean's vast artistic vision, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time. This is truly one of the grandest epics ever made, demanding to be witnessed only in the cinema; put quite simply, a minute television screen just does not do this film justice. This is an life-changing experience like few others, and, for 220 glorious minutes, you can almost see yourself in the desert, sitting atop a camel, trekking across the sands alongside one of the twentieth century's most fascinating historical figures.",10,5,10,10 March 2007
City of God," 'What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided.'
","Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 'We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise,' reminisces Rocket, our narrator. 'Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!' Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. 'There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro.' Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film 'City of God' dares to veer from this 'postcard image' of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city.The story, which spans the 1960s and 1970s, follows two parallel lives in the Cicade de Deus. Rocket is a quiet, honest boy who dreams of becoming a photographer. Whilst nobody in this city is truly innocent, Rocket perhaps comes closest. His father was a fishmonger, and the older brother he respects, Clipper, is a hood (short for hoodlum) who  with two other close friends, Goose and Shaggy - forms the Tender Trio, who acquire their money through theft.The second child is Li'l Dice, who will later rise to be known as Li'l Zé. An ambitious young boy who often trails the Tender Trio, Li'l Dice attains his first experience of murder via a shockingly revelational flashback. Li'l Dice subsequently grows to become the dominant drug dealer in Cicade de Deus, after successfully eliminating most of his competition and taking over their businesses.Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is visually stunning. César Charlone's beautiful hand-held camera-work perfectly captures the beauty and horror of Cicade de Deus' chaotic everyday occurrences. Whilst sometimes you feel that the camera darts all over the place unnecessarily, this also offers the film a documentary-like feel, brutally reminding you that this is based on a true story.'City of God' is an unapologetically intense film, and it certainly is not for the faint of heart. The overwhelming combination of violence, drugs and rape (and the very idea that children as young as ten or so were taking part in all of this) made me nauseous at times, and I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm glad that I did watch it, but I can't say it was fun. In fact, I felt quite depressed afterwards. Yes, I suppose this just isn't my sort of movie. For what it's worth, I much preferred watching Fernando Meirelles' follow-up film, 'The Constant Gardener' (2005).",8,3,6,9 February 2007
Cars," 'I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.'
","Pixar Animation Studios has long maintained a history of excellence, always delivering enjoyable family entertainment. 'Cars' from their only film that I had yet to see, and so I greeted it with a lot of anticipation. Having finished it, I find myself considering a step-down from Pixar's other classics, such as 'Toy Story' or 'Monsters Inc.,' but that doesn't stop it from being an above-average two hours. In a world dominated by automobiles, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a super-successful rookie in competitive racing; all that remains for him is to win the prestigious Piston Cup, if only he can surpass retiring champion The King (Richard Petty) and cocky Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). After getting lost on his way to the all-important final race, McQueen ends up in the sleepy, dilapidated town of Radiator Springs, which had once been busy but had since slunk into obscurity when the new highway bypassed it.After accidentally destroying the town's main road, the citizens condemn McQueen to repave it, despite his insistence that he is a famous car and must get to his race within the week. Tired town doctor, Doc Hudson  a 1951 Hudson Hornet (voiced by Paul Newman)  is the most respected vehicle in town, and yet he harbours an unusual reservation towards McQueen that we can't quite explain. Running the local motel is Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a relatively new resident to Radiator Springs, who found comfort and happiness away from the hustle-and-bustle of the city. Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) is the town's rusty tow-truck, and he's such an adorable creature that he probably steals the entire film. As he slowly gets the know the friendly residents of Radiator Springs, McQueen uncovers some meaning in his life: after all, it's not all about winning. It's about being happy and having some good friends.The thing I've always loved about Pixar's films is that, despite the state-of-the-art computer animation, they've always told their stories in a very traditional way. The films don't try to be cool and high-tech (though I suppose this was a necessary prerequisite for 'The Incredibles'), but simply tell their stories in a simple way, as an older, traditionally-animated film might. Particularly during the opening sequence, the buzzing sound effects, flashing advertisements and pop music soundtrack just didn't seem to fit within a Pixar film: it, frankly, seemed like something you might expect to find in one of the inferior CGI-animated off-shoots from a different studio. Needless to say, I was relieved when McQueen drifted into the quiet country town, since it was then that I started to detect the filmmaker's skills for telling a good story. The outcome of the narrative  as in all Pixar films  was never in doubt, but it's such a nice story, and directors John Lasseter and Joe Ranft tell it pretty well. It's also interesting to note that the studio's next feature-length film, 'Ratatouille (2007),' truly recaptures the traditional spirit of Pixar's earlier works.Once again, I'd like to reinforce that, despite my slight disappointment, 'Cars' is not a poor film by any means. It remains highly entertaining, and healthy fun for children of all ages, even if they have absolutely no knowledge of 1950s automobiles (I most certainly don't!). If I had to choose a funniest scene, it would probably be the 'tractor-tipping' sequence, when Mater demonstrates the intricate art of startling cow-like farm machinery as they sleep. The ending also carries an excellent message of good-sportsmanship, and I can't have been the only person to let out an audible 'awwwwww!' in the final seconds of the tie-breaking Piston Cup championship race.",6,2,4,7 October 2007
JFK," 'Let justice be done though the heavens fall'
","Oliver Stone's wildly-speculative conspiracy theory epic 'JFK (1991)' opens with a montage of archival footage depicting the presidency of John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, up until 12:30PM on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. However, even before this historical prologue has come to an end, Stone has already introduced his own dramatisation – a beaten prostitute, dumped on the side of a road, pleads that Kennedy's life is in danger. Her agonised cries play over familiar documentary footage of the Presidential motorcade. Already, Stone is defiantly blending fact and fiction, speculation and dramatisation. On its initial release, the film stirred enormous controversy due to its flagrant disregard for historical fact, but that's not what 'JFK' is all about. Oliver Stone may (or may not) genuinely believe all of Jim Garrison's conspiracy theories – which implicate everybody up to former President Lyndon B. Johnson – but his film nevertheless offers a tantalising 'what if?' scenario, an unsettling portrait of the fallibility of 'history' itself.Having undertaken some light research, I don't feel that Garrison's claims hold much water. However, that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance. Crucial is Stone's more generalised vibe of government mistrust, the acknowledgement that political institutions are at least conceptually capable of such a wide-ranging operation to hoodwink the American public. 'JFK' also paints a gripping picture of its protagonist, torn between its admiration for a man willing to contest the sacred cow of US government, and its pity for one so hopelessly obsessed with conspiracy that it consumes his life, family and livelihood. Kevin Costner plays Garrison as righteous and stubbornly idealistic, not dissimilar to his Eliot Ness in De Palma's 'The Untouchables (1987).' The only difference is that Garrison is chasing a criminal far more transparent than Al Capone – indeed, a criminal who may not exist at all. Costner is supported by an exceedingly impressive supporting cast, which includes Jack Lemmon, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, Michael Rooker, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman.With the Director's Cut clocking in at 206 minutes, 'JFK' is an epic piece of work. However, the film is so dazzlingly well-constructed that watching it becomes less of a choice than a compulsion. Stone frenziedly throws together seemingly-unrelated puzzle-pieces, systematically peeling back layer after layer of conspiracy until all that remains is what Jim Garrison believes to be the naked truth. Beneath the sordid details, Stone speculates on the nature of history itself. Archive footage blends seamlessly with dramatisation – but what is recorded history but a re-enactment submitted by the winners? Not even the witnesses to Kennedy's assassination, clouded by subjective perception, can know for sure what exactly took place on that dark day in Dallas. Perhaps Zapruder's 486 frames of grainy hand-held footage (combined with that of Nix and Muchmore) represents the only objective record of the event – but Antonioni's 'Blowup (1966)' showed that even photographic documentation is unreliable through the inherent bias of the viewer. In short, nobody knows what really happened that day. 'JFK' is Oliver Stone creating his own history – or merely correcting it.",9,5,18,18 September 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits, somewhere in the wilderness'
","I've always considered 'The Two Towers (2002)' to be the black-sheep of the 'Lord of the Rings' family; still completely amazing, of course, but perhaps less so than the two instalments that bookend it. Whereas 'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' is an episodic introduction into the breathtaking world of Middle-Earth, and 'The Return of the King (2003)' is the climax to which the entire trilogy builds, 'The Two Towers' has neither a concrete beginning nor end. On initial viewings, the film seemed to centre on the Battle of Helms Deep, an epic conflict that pits a few hundred men and elves against Saruman's 10,000-strong Uruk-hai army.If the theatrical cut of 'The Two Towers' lacked the narrative depth of its siblings, then the Extended Edition – which I watched this week for the first time – rectifies any such shortcomings, breathing new life into the lands of Rohan, Gondor, and their human inhabitants. Most significantly, Faramir (David Wenham) is given a back-story that makes clearer his motivations, via an extensive flashback featuring his father, Denethor (John Noble), and brother Boromir (Sean Bean). The newly-introduced characters are no less three-dimensional than their more familiar counterparts: Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, Saruman's grovelling, serpentine apprentice; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, a pro-feministic noblewoman lusting for glory; Bernard Hill as Theoden, the King of Rohan, and possessed by the treacherous hand of Isengard.Unlike its predecessor, 'The Two Towers' is split into three parallel story lines, but once again balances the epic and intimate, abruptly (but never jarringly) cutting between the epic battles of Aragorn and Co., and the slow, tortured trampling of Frodo, Sam and their slippery little guide (played by Andy Serkis in a rotoscope suit). I recall that, when the 'The Two Towers' was first released back in 2002, Gollum was the main focus of reviewers' attention, and I was pleased to discover that the technology utilised in the CGI-character's creation remains completely authentic and convincing. Serkis, despite never actually appearing on screen, brings an astonishing depth to the character, highlighting Smeagol/Gollum's schizophrenia by subtly altering his voice, posture and mannerisms.I'm about to take another trip down memory-lane, so bear with me again. When I first saw 'The Two Towers' at the cinemas – in the last week of 2002 – I remember telling a friend that I preferred the first instalment, because it was 'more about the ring.' While it's true that the second film somewhat relegates Frodo and Sam's struggles to the sidelines, one must consider the bigger picture. 'The Two Towers' takes Tolkien's Middle-Earth beyond the guise of a simple fantasy world, and, with its vast scope and attention-to-detail, almost convinces us of its historical authenticity. I still recall emerging from the blackened cinema satisfied with where the trilogy was heading, but horrified at the prospect of waiting an entire year for the story's conclusion. Well, I waited... but no longer than I had to. At least I'll only be waiting a week this time around.",10,0,2,19 July 2010
Schindler's List," 'This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.'
","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, 'Batman Begins') was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Kraków Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it 'a certain panache.'It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, 'Gandhi'), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, 'By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew.' 'Well, I'm a German, so there we are,' replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, 'Red Dragon'), a Hauptsturmführer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly 'liquidated' from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. 'Today is history,' proclaims Goeth. 'Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.'This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled 'The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir'. The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.Long known as a 'blockbuster' filmmaker  with such adventure classics as 'Jaws,' 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to his name - 'Schindler's List' was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm.",10,135,243,9 February 2007
Across the Universe," 'Music's the only thing that makes sense anymore'
","It's sufficient to say that I wasn't Julie Taymor's most enthusiastic advocate when I caught word of her most recent film, a story built around an anthology of Beatles tracks. On paper, the idea sounds both brilliant and terrible: I certainly don't consider myself a Beatles aficionado, but, like most of the world, I greatly enjoy listening to their music, and a 're-imagining' of their most famous work could just as easily be interpreted as a desecration of their legacy; after all, how could we possibly envisage anybody but Paul McCartney singing 'Hey Jude?' Likewise, it seems a rather odd proposition to employ distinctly-British music as an exploration of 1960s American history, but all things considered, the end result isn't all that bad. Despite superficially being an 'extended music video,' screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have done a wonderful job at fitting a narrative framework around an extensive selection of songs from the band, and the resultant love story is suitably epic in scope to linger in the memory for some time afterwards.Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), has lived an uneventful childhood in the cold, dreary backdrop of Britain. After he ships off to the United States in search of his American father, he befriends a Princeton dropout named Max (Joe Anderson), subsequently falling in love with Max's younger sister, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). If these names are already striking you as vaguely familiar, then you wouldn't be incorrect in guessing that almost every character derived their moniker from a Beatles lyric. The three main characters are very good in their respective roles; Sturgess is the most successful, and, sporting a genuine Liverpool accent, his song renditions come closest to their original versions, and so, by implication, are the best. Evan Rachel Wood brings a graceful beauty to the screen, and Joe Anderson provides the necessary comic relief, though his character sobers up considerably following a stint in Vietnam. Martin Luther McCoy's Jimi Hendrix derivative is also entertaining to watch, but the characters of Prudence (T.V. Carpio) and Sadie (Dana Fuchs) are an annoying distraction, and the latter ruins more than a few perfectly-good Beatles tracks.There's no doubting that Julie Taymor, working with cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, has an incredible visual style, and the film's musical numbers are an extraordinary stage-show of lights and colours. Narrative-wise, 'Across the Universe' works most effectively when it avoids straying into spells of inane surrealism, though I was terribly partial to Eddie Izzard's nonsensical spoken rendition of 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,' which is a supreme piece of random nuttiness. As far as the films of 2007 are concerned, I'd consider Todd Haynes' Bob Dylan biopic, 'I'm Not There,' to be a superior piece of music-based cinema, and my preferred musical would certainly be Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.' Taymor's film loses much of its steam after the first hour, and runs at least thirty minutes too long, but it's such an ambitious piece of film-making that one can only recommend it.",7,0,0,6 April 2008
The Elephant Man," Flawlessly acted and directed, but just falls short of perfection
","Rarely has a film touched me so deeply, and kept me simply mesmerised for the entire running time. I found myself simply unable to drag my eyes from the screen, but I wouldn't want to, anyway. The character of John Merrick (based on the real-life 'Elephant Man' Joseph Carey Merrick), whilst initially repulsive to the eye, has an aura of beauty about him. The sheer courage of this man - in the face of unimaginable discrimination and adversity - left me in constant awe, and the moment when the hideous 'imbecile' is revealed to be an intelligent and sensitive being is truly a memorable moment.The acting is simply superb. Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries 'I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!' is one of the great moments in cinema.I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black. However, we instead have the stars in the sky flying past the camera and, as I interpreted it, the spirit of Merrick's beautiful mother offering him comfort in his final moments. Perhaps I am missing the significance of this final scene, but I simply felt it was unnecessary.We shouldn't let this minor nitpick detract too much from the brilliance of the film. Afterall, it is not often that I am so completely captivated by a film. Not since 'Apocalypse Now' (a completely different film, I realise) have I been left in such awe as the credits begin to roll. Of course, considerable credit should be given to David Lynch. 'The Elephant Man,' his second film, is my first exploration into the films of Lynch, and it certainly will not be the last!",10,3,4,20 December 2006
Dog Day Afternoon," 'I'm robbing a bank because they got money here. That's why I'm robbing it.'
","It was supposed to be quick robbery  go in, steal the money and get out of there. However, from the moment that Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal Naturile (John Cazale) step into the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York City, their well-laid plans begin to unfurl. Within just minutes, the bank is surrounded by a 'militia' of policemen and FBI agents, accompanied by a curious crowd of onlookers and a scurry of eager television journalists. With nine hostages as his only bargaining tools, Sonny must think of a way of getting himself and Sal out of this situation alive and free. But has he already come too far?'Dog Day Afternoon' is based on a real-life incident. On August 22 1972, John Wojtowicz, Salvatore Antonio Naturile and a third unknown accomplice attempted to rob a bank on the corner of East Third Street and Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The eventual result of the real-life siege is best left unknown for those who are yet to see the film, but certainly director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson took a certain artistic license with some of the film's events, which have been described by one significant person at the scene as 'only 30% true.' Nonetheless, this very same person praised the performances of Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon (as Sonny's 'wife,' Leon) as being accurate.Al Pacino is superb in this movie. Fresh off the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' 'Serpico (1973)' and 'The Godfather: Part 2 (1974),' Pacino truly was on his way to becoming one of the most outstanding performers of his generation, and his turn as Sonny Wortzik is most definitely no exception. Strong performances from his 'Godfather' co-star John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, Charles Durning, James Broderick and Sully Boyar make this a solidly-acted film.Lumet's decision to keep the film largely free of any musical score was a good decision, and certainly added to the realism of the plot. However, the one exception  Elton John's 'Amoreena' during the opening credits  simply didn't sit well with the tone of the remainder of the film, and he would probably have been best to leave it out. Also, though many of the film's scenes prove extremely riveting, there were certainly times when I noticed my attention somewhat wavering. Sonny's lengthy (and apparently improvised) telephone conversation with his 'wife' Leon was one example of this  though it was definitely important to the story, and certainly showed off the skills of the two actors involved, I simply thought that it brought the film's steadily mounting suspense to a grinding halt.",7,2,3,4 May 2007
Amadeus," 'God was singing through this little man to all the world, unstoppable, making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.'
","Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, 'Mozart and Salieri,' and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this 'unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat' through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as 'an infectious giddy' and 'like metal scraping glass.' Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words 'Leck mich im Arsch' and 'Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber' as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score  mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century.",9,4,7,3 July 2007
Gran Torino," 'What the hell does everybody want with my Gran Torino?'
","One can approach 'Gran Torino (2008)' as a sort of coda to the two roles that made Clint Eastwood famous: The Man with No Name and Harry Callahan, both of whom fought for justice, but did so by whipping out a gun and shooting a whole lot of people. Having presumably become more conservative in his old age, Eastwood's grouchy hero here comes to learn that vigilante justice isn't necessarily the right way to do things (though, admittedly, having a firearm close at hand does occasionally prove useful).Eastwood's sympathetic lead performance is what gives the film its strength. Walt Kowalksi is a bitter, grumpy and bigoted old man, but he apparently has every reason to be so: his wife has passed on, his own children can't stand to be around him, and his only companionship comes from the sleepy labrador at his side. As we come to learn, however, this is a prison that Walt may arguably have built for himself, so embittered by his Korean War service that he has shuns the affections of all those who reach out to him.Eastwood's lead performance is complemented by sincere (if slightly unconvincing) work from the supporting players, particularly Bee Vang and Ahney Her as Hmong-American youths who move in next door, much to Walt's consternation. In any case, it is the tired, weathered face of Clint Eastwood that dominates the film; few actors could make the phrase 'get off my lawn' sound quite so menacing, and yet his lines also project a certain frailness, of a once-potent force dwindling in body and spirit. 'Gran Torino' is one of Eastwood's most enjoyable dramas of the decade.",7,0,3,8 February 2010
The Hurt Locker," 'This box is full of stuff that almost killed me'
","Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker (2009)' plays like a modern version of 'The Wages of Fear (1953),' basically a non-stop succession of suspenseful moments. A team of American bomb-defusers (played by three little-known actors: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) go about their duties in Iraq, risking their lives at every turn. SSG William James (Renner) is a bit of an adrenaline junkie, his sincere but somewhat-reckless approach occasionally placing his unit in peril. This episodic film follows a month in the shoes of these soldiers, facing unexpected dangers at every turn. The performances are all very natural, and the unfamiliar main actors and hand-held camera-work inject some documentary-like realism into the film, though equally welcome are some well-handled supporting roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Evangeline Lilly.Perhaps the most refreshing element of 'The Hurt Locker' is that it isn't recognisably political or 'anti-war', instead focusing on the soldiers themselves, and how they attempt to deal with the knowledge that each moment may be their last. There's a sense of fatalism about it all. War films have always emphasised how combat turns otherwise-healthy men into shellshocked introverts, but 'The Hurt Locker' suggests that the opposite may also be true: that young men may become addicted to the thrill of conflict, and willingly stride onwards towards an inevitable death. SSG James remarks to his infant son that he will eventually outgrow his jack-in-the-box, when he himself is still enthralled by the idea of mechanical devices that unexpectedly explode. War has allowed (and, indeed, encouraged) this soldier to regress to his basest instincts.",7,4,9,3 March 2010
Patton," 'The absence of war will destroy him'
","George S. Patton (1885 - 1945), a highly-decorated and outspoken U.S. officer, was influential in the Allied victory of WWII, notable for his campaigns in North Africa and while commanding the Third Army across Europe. He was not without his controversies, of course. In 1943, after slapping a shell-shocked 'coward' in the medical hospital, Patton was severely reprimanded by General Eisenhower, and the incident nearly cut short his military career. In Franklin J. Schaffner's 'Patton (1970),' George C. Scott offers a commanding portrayal of the man, a master strategist and an egotist, who ruled his troops with an iron fist in his self-serving bid for historical immortality. WWII is portrayed, not as a battle of patriotic wills, but rather a battle of egos: throughout the North African campaigns, General Patton and British ally Montgomery (Michael Bates) engage in a petty rivalry, bluntly sacrificing strategy for personal glory.Whereas most military men would be glad to see an end to war, General Patton was a rare breed. Surveying the carnage of a disastrous overnight skirmish, he expresses his unashamed love for the stench of battle, his speech recalling Robert Duvall's 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' monologue in 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' {Francis Ford Copolla, as co-writer with Edmund H. North, won his first Academy Award for 'Patton'}. In one memorable scene, Patton bends down to kiss a shell- shocked soldier. His action is sickeningly transparent, a clumsy attempt to attain the humility of the great historical generals whom he admires with such fervour. It would have been more honest of Patton had he simply slapped the soldier as he had Charles H. Kuhl previously. A fine strategist he may have been, but Patton's showboating is depicted as a perpetual distraction from his military goals.",8,0,1,30 January 2010
La Grande Illusion," 'I think we can do nothing to stop the march of time'
","Re-reading my review of 'Stalag 17 (1951),' I see that I referred to it as the template for every prisoner-of-war film that followed, including 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and 'The Great Escape (1963).' Once again, my relative inexperience with cinema seems to have caught me out; this film from Jean Renoir uses a similar formula, and predates it by almost fifteen years. Billy Wilder must certainly have seen 'The Grand Illusion (1937)'  since it features Erich von Stroheim, whom he himself used in 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)'  and so Renoir's influence is present throughout. It's a WWI film, but we see no combat. Whereas most anti-war films illustrate their stance by pounding the all-too-familiar adage 'war is hell' through images of death and destruction, Renoir's approach is considerably more understated. He highlight the futility of war through human interaction, both between the captured French prisoners and between the Germans who watch over them.Just what is 'the grand illusion?' Renoir derived his film title from 'The Great Illusion,' a 1909 non-fiction book by Norman Angell, in which the author argued for the impossibility of a large-scale European war for economic reasons. That WWI broke out five years later obviously proved detrimental to Angell's arguments, and Renoir deliberately plays on the irony of this knowledge. More significant, however, is that the book was released in a revised edition in 1933, the general argument modified to assert the utter utility of waging war, a theme that supports Renoir's stance: this would not be the 'war that ends all wars.' With WWII just around the corner, there's an bitter urgency to what the film has to say; just three years later, the director would be fleeing France. The topicality of the film's message proved especially successful overseas, and 'The Grand Illusion' was unusually nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1939.Of course, no Jean Renoir film is complete without some class-related social critique. Most striking in this regard is the relationship between Capt. de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay) and Capt. von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), from which, scandalously, it is implied that one's class forms a more binding camaraderie than that of nationality. Boeldieu and Rauffenstein, both multilingual upper-class aristocrats who sense their social dominance is drawing to an end, seek solace in each other's company, and feel closer to one another than to the lower-class men of their own armies. However, there is hope in Renoir's vision of society. The age of aristocracy is coming to a close, and a new social order  in which all men are accepted as comrades  is at the cusp of existence. Boeldieu accepts this inevitability, and, despite the initial suspicion of his fellow Frenchmen, ultimately offers his life to allow two 'lower-class' companions to escape. He betrays von Rauffenstein in favour of duty to his country, even if his death provides only temporary relief from the inescapable futility of war.",8,5,5,11 February 2009
The Illusionist," 'Perhaps there is truth in this illusion.'
","Welcome to a world where nothing is what it seems. Welcome to a world where anything is possible. In short, welcome to turn-of-the-20th-century Vienna. In an era of vivid imagination and an unwavering enthusiasm for making the impossible happen, the stage magician is king. Eduard Abramovich, aka Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton, 'Fight Club'), is considered perhaps the greatest of them all, capable of numerous sensational magical tricks beyond belief; illusions so remarkably convincing that the audience truly believes that what they are watching is 'real magic.'But, as we knew they must, Eisenheim's miraculous exploits have acquired him an enemy, and a powerful one at that. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, 'Dark City'), who considers himself a rational man, finds himself utterly baffled by the magician's tricks, and he promptly orders for Eisenheim's performances to be shut down. To add more complications to their frictional relationship, Leopold has plans to marry Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), who was Eisenheim's childhood lover, though class restrictions tore their relationship apart. Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Paul Giamatti, 'Cinderella Man') does his best to uncover the mystery surrounding this enigmatic performer.The year 2006 brought with it two exemplary examples of riveting film-making, both, curiously enough, concerning magicians in turn-of-the-century Europe. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' premiered on October 17 to immense commercial and critical acclaim, amazing its audiences with a superb acting cast, brilliant art direction and a complex and twisting story of magician rivalry that had everybody talking for hours after the credits had rolled. Neil Burger's somewhat less publicised 'The Illusionist' had premiered on April 27 at the Newport Beach Film Festival, followed by a limited release that was later expanded. Having now seen both films, it is my absolute pleasure to declare that neither of these films appear to have been produced merely to profit in the other's wake  both films tell distinctly separate stories in different ways, and, above all else, both are fantastic cinematic accomplishments.The first thing you'll notice about 'The Illusionist' is how beautiful it looks. Dick Pope's Oscar-nominated cinematography brilliantly evokes time and place. Filmed with a brownish hue, with faded edges and employing old-fashioned iris wipes, the film even somehow manages to look as though it was filmed one hundred years ago. Composer Phillip Glass' soundtrack, likewise, is haunting and beautiful.In order for the story to have maintained its credibility, solid acting was a necessity, and the cast does not disappoint. Edward Norton lends his character  a man of few words  a suitably mysterious aura. Eisenheim is a man who is always in control, regardless of whether his 'magic' is genuine or not. Paul Giamatti is brilliant as Inspector Uhl, a man conflicted by his loyalties to Crown Price Leopold, and similarly entranced by Eisenheim's elaborate illusions. Rufus Sewell is convincingly unlikable as the corrupt Leopold, who is frustrated and embarrassed by his inability to decipher Eisenheim's magic, and so commits himself to destroying the magician's art. Jessica Biel is elegant and beautiful as Sophie, a strong-willed woman who lends a certain softness to the screen.'The Illusionist' was adapted from Steven Millhauser's short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist,' and Norton's character was loosely based upon a real-life 19th century magician, Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin (1805-1871). During my research, I was fascinated to discover that the 'orange tree' illusion depicted in the film was, in fact, performed by Robert-Houdin during the 1800s. This remarkable illusion was an automaton, controlled by pedals and wires. In the original magic trick, in order to create the deception that the orange tree was blooming, genuine oranges were driven in points and remained hidden by foliage with spread open at the required moment. Flowers were concealed in small tubes, and became visible at the activation of a pedal. The illusion of flying butterflies carrying a handkerchief between them was accomplished using artificial insects mounted on invisible steel wires.Part of the charm of 'The Illusionist' is that it doesn't really take the time to explain how the various illusions were achieved, or even if they were, in fact, illusions, and not real magic. The film leaves the ultimate decision to the audience, which, if you ask me, is treating us with considerably more respect for our intelligence than many other films often do. Magical, beautiful, memorable here are three words that still don't quite do this film justice.",8,0,0,21 April 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," 'Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss'
","Mankind has always been fascinated by his own mortality. Death has been a prevailing motif in art throughout the centuries, most of the contributing artists and authors now deceased, having been outlived by the work borne from their passions and uncertainties. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald died prematurely in 1940. There will come a time when director David Fincher passes on (hopefully not for a long time yet), and so 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)' will serve as his own wistful essay on the nature of life and death, love and loss. Fitzgerald's short story was adapted by Eric Roth, who also wrote 'Forrest Gump (1994)' {itself inspired by the likes of 'Little Big Man (1970)' and 'Being There (1979)'}, and so comparisons between the two films are certainly not unfounded. Both films  and I love 'Forrest Gump,' by the way  trace the lives of sympathetic characters who are forced to experience the world through unusual circumstances, thus giving them a unique outlook on life. Also brought to mind is Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003),' particularly with its elements of fantasy.Though almost three hours in length, every shot of Fincher's film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes, with computer-generated imagery integrated seamlessly into the plot, enhancing the fantastical atmosphere rather than distracting from it. Extensive make-up is used to add decades to many of the supporting characters, but what I found even more astonishing was the visual trickery used to 'age down' star Brad Pitt to a striking youth in his twenties. The effect is marvellously disconcerting, and really drives home the sheer eeriness of Benjamin Button's circumstances. The film's somewhat-gimmicky premise is played surprisingly lightly during the film's first half, but gradually transforms into a melancholy tragedy when Benjamin begins to comprehend that his current 'normal' lifestyle is only temporary. There's little emotional pay-off to the film, perhaps because the protagonist is himself incapable of finding any lasting satisfaction. Though we follow Benjamin's years to their logical conclusion, there's disappointingly little pathos in his final moments; as soon as Brad Pitt is removed from the equation, the audience loses its emotional anchor with the character.Despite its inconsistent tone and occasionally lazy storytelling, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is probably Fincher's most mature film to date, certainly more so than the highly enjoyable but superficial 'Se7en (1995)' and 'Fight Club (1999),' though 'Zodiac (2007)' first signalled the arrival of an intelligent filmmaker. For viewers in search of action-packed thrills, they'd best look elsewhere, for 'Benjamin Button' is a film in which nothing much happens. This remark is obviously hyperbole, but I don't mean it as a criticism; the film is a subtle and elegiac meditation on human mortality, and it basks for 166 minutes in this simple but powerful premise. For Benjamin Button, we can't sit back and muse, as we might for Forrest Gump or Edward Bloom, 'this man has had a great life.' When it comes down to it, exactly what has Benjamin done with his life? He's just lived it, and, really, that's all that anyone can expect out of life. Some people were born to sit by a river; some get struck by lightning; some are artists; some swim; some dance. Benjamin Button lived.",7,1,4,13 January 2009
Children of Men," 'Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices'
","It's been just over two years since first I saw 'Children of Men (2006),' and I'm still utterly blown away by it. Alfonso Cuarón's cautionary science-fiction tale, the finest film of 2006, is not only a masterclass in technical film-making, but also, and above all else, a 100-minute roller-coaster ride that doesn't let up its intensity until the final frames. This decade has, all things considered, been a pretty good one for science-fiction, and numerous directors have brought forth their own intriguing visions of the future. Many, like Alex Proyas' 'I, Robot (2004)' or Michael Bay's 'The Island (2005)' were determinedly bright and dazzling. Stephen Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)' and 'Minority Report (2002)' were largely optimistic, but also noticeably alluded to a darker underbelly. Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later (2003),' whatever my thoughts about the film itself, depicted a frightening and morally-barren post-apocalyptic Britain. The animated 'Renaissance (2005)' took the classic neo-noir route, channelling the artistic style of 'Blade Runner (1982).'Alfonso Cuarón's despairing vision of the future is frightening, not because of how much the world appears to have been changed, but because it feels like only one step ahead from where we are now. Just as Spielberg reproduced horrific images of the September 11 terrorist attacks to give immediacy to the alien invasion in 'War of the Worlds (2005)' {Tom Cruise emerges from the initial attack covered in a smothering white powder}, Cuarón too plunders our own unstable political climate to predict a bleak, oppressive future for future generations  if, indeed, there are to be any. At a concentration camp at Bexhill, there stands the infamous 'hooded man' of the shameful Ghraib Prison scandal. A coffee shop bombing recalls the devastating July 2005 London bombings, and decades of IRA terrorist attacks. Cuarón seems to be suggesting that the capacity for human depravity is already present in modern society; it would take only a single unexpected tragedy  such as an epidemic of infertility  to finally push our 'dominant' race over the edge into genuine, unbridled barbarity.Clive Owen isn't a leading man typically known for his versatility, but here his flatness is put to good use. Over the years, many actors have attempted to duplicate the weary-eyed laziness of Robert Mitchum, and Owen's Theo is a strong attempt, a disillusioned nobody who finally finds something to hope and fight for in Mankind's future. Able support is provided by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but the real star of the film is Emmanuel Lubezki's dynamic camera. Entire set-pieces are played out in single takes (though much post-production splicing took place), and, unlike other recent efforts such as the Dunkirk beach sequence in 'Atonement (2007),' these long shots actively propel the film's plot. Indeed, on first viewing, it wasn't until afterwards that I realised the sheer extensiveness of the technique's use. The extended takes, in a similar manner to Hitchcock's clever usage in 'Rope (1948),' place the viewer in a unique position: not only that of a voyeur, but of an active participant.",9,2,6,19 February 2009
The Dark Knight," 'You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain'
","The night is dark. After a brief period in which organised crime retreated into a minor enterprise, Gotham City has once again fallen into shadow. The Caped Crusader has done all that he could, but, if he is to eradicate corruption once and for all, he will require the cooperation of Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the untouchable honest cop, and Havey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the newly-appointed district attorney and Gotham's celebrated 'White Knight.' However, the emergence of a cackling, deranged psychotic, dubbed The Joker (Heath Ledger), threatens to throw the entire city into chaos  how deeply can he corrupt the uneasy alliance between Gotham City's authorities? 'The Dark Knight (2008)' is director Christopher Nolan's eagerly-awaited sequel to his own 'Batman Begins (2005),' which successfully rebooted the Batman franchise and returned some class to the 'superhero' genre in general. Unapologetically dark in tone, Nolan's film further explores the split-personality relationship of Bruce Wayne/Batman, comparing and contrasting him with Harvey Dent as he spirals downwards into his persona as super-villain Two-Face.In terms of character development, 'The Dark Knight' seems to have shifted itself into neutral gear. Whereas 'Batman Begins' portrayed Bruce Wayne's transformation from an angst-ridden, morally-conflicted billionaire to his noble, crime-fighting alter ego, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, who penned the screenplay, here seem satisfied with Batman as the tough, unaffected crusader. Though there is a noticeable shift in how the audience perceives Batman's role in Gotham City  he changes from a righteous champion to a shadowy vigilante, depending upon the needs of its citizens  Bruce Wayne faces few of the moral dilemmas explored into the film's predecessor, and, despite the good work of Christian Bale, his character is not altogether of much interest. Aaron Eckhart undergoes a more interesting (and much more literal) transformation as the 'White Knight' who is irretrievably corrupted by the evil psychological games of The Joker. Eckhart is convincing in the role, though his conversion to the 'dark side' seemed to have been rushed, and that Batman's final confrontation was with Two-Face rather than the Joker is an unfortunate anti-climax.Of course, nothing but praise may be heaped upon the late Heath Ledger, whose characterisation of The Joker will be undoubtedly be remembered for decades to come. The Australian actor, long known down here for his performances in 'The Patriot (2000)' and 'Ned Kelly (2003),' passed away in tragic circumstances on January 22, 2008 from an 'accidental overdose of prescription drugs.' Following his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Brokeback Mountain (2005),' Ledger was at the cusp of the Hollywood A-list, and his performance here  even without the higher pedestal bestowed to those recently passed  would undoubtedly have rocketed his professional career to unprecedented heights. Ledger's Joker, a far cry from the high camp of Jack Nicholson's equally-memorable turn in 'Batman (1989),' is a chilling mix of Hannibal Lecter and Alex DeLarge, a cackling psychopathic clown who, despite his fondness for chaos, frequently engineers his schemes to uncanny perfection. Nolan deliberately avoids any back-story for Ledger's character, though The Joker himself offers two conflicting anecdotes, the result being that his villainous motives are disconcertingly ambiguous.As in 'Batman Begins,' the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is wonderfully moody and ominous, and Wally Pfister's shadowy cinematography serves the story well. Christopher Nolan's greatest talent lies, above all else, with setting the required mood. The atmosphere of Gotham City is consistently bleak and oppressive, a tone that only intensifies as The Joker begins to leave his mark on its residents. He possesses an anarchistic belief that, at heart, all humans are selfish and corruptible, and his disturbed social experiments  extrapolated from the classic game theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma  are designed to confirm this belief, that, in order to survive, ordinary people will commit seemingly unjustifiable atrocities. Whereas there might once have been a time when the residents of Gotham City would have detonated the opposite ferry, the influence and dedication of Harvey Dent has inspired citizens with a new optimistic spirit. Gotham's White Knight may have been corrupted by forces of evil, but his legacy remains, and that is more great a defeat than The Joker could have anticipated.",8,3,6,22 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," 'There's a storm coming, Harry, just like the last time.'
","Perhaps surprisingly, the Harry Potter franchise of films has so far remained relatively consistent in terms of quality, with each new director leaving their own unique mark on the series. Chris Colombus, known for his assortment of warm-hearted family movies, offered a warm touch to the first two films (respectively,'The Philosopher's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets'), offering Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy an air of magic and wonder. As the stories gradually became darker, a new direction was needed for the films, and Alfonso Cuarón was an excellent choice to helm 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,' crafting J.K. Rowley's story into something bleaker and more intimate. Mike Newell's vision for 'The Goblet of Fire' wasn't quite so dark, and most certainly had a more epic scope on Harry's world, but this was used well by the filmmakers. The most recent addition to the Harry Potter series, David Yates' 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' is probably the darkness film by far, and, despite perhaps being a bit underwhelming, there are certainly many good things to say about it.Ever since 2001, we have been watching the young stars of the series mature, grow into their roles, advance their acting talents. Whilst previous films had usually shown Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to be a tight-knit team, and almost as the three main characters, Harry Potter is most definitely the only main protagonist in this installment, with his two friends reduced to supporting roles. With a much greater demand on his acting abilities, Radcliffe is phenomenal in a difficult role, successfully portraying the confusion and torment of his well-known character. Notably, the scene in which he screams 'look at me!' in Albus Dumbledore's office gave me shivers. The supporting cast of young actors is adequate: Rupert Grint is funny again as Ron Weasley, though I wasn't a big fan of Emma Watson, and often the lighthearted scenes between the three friends came across as forced and unnatural. Unfortunately, considering his previous efforts, Tom Felton  playing Harry's sinister adversary, Draco Malfoy  is given very little screen time, and not very much to do at all. Of the newest young additions to the cast, acting debutant Evanna Lynch is very enjoyable as the softly-spoken, hilariously-crazy Luna Lovegood, whose welcome support for Harry's theories is somewhat tarnished by her unwavering belief in the existence of Nargles.Once again, a delightful ensemble cast of seasoned acting veterans complement the younger performers, with Yates seemingly trying to accumulate as many big names as possible into his film. Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Mark Williams, Jason Isaacs, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane momentarily reprise their respective roles, but not enough time is afforded for any of their characters to be further explored, with the exception of perhaps Oldman as Sirius Black, whose character (presumably) leaves the franchise when he could still have offered the series so much more. Ralph Fiennes, a favourite actor of mine, is fiendishly wicked as the all-powerful, serpentine Lord Voldemort. Helena Bonham Carter is also extremely disturbed, twisted and downright scary as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of Voldemort's most devoted followers. The most outstanding performance of the film, however, is that of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, the powerful Ministry of Magic official who arrives at Hogwarts to interfere with its operation. Though sickly-sweet and softly-spoken, Umbridge is one of the most loathsome villains the series has yet seen, and I definitely detected a bit of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) in her character.My primary problem with this film is that it felt rushed, much too rushed. Quite plainly, it's the sort of effect you get from trying to cram an 800-page book into a 138-minute film; ironically, the longest book to date has been adapted into the shortest film so far in the series. Perhaps because of this noticeable rushing, Sirius Black's death didn't have the same emotional resonance that was no doubt intended, and Harry's 'silent scream' seemed a bit cliché and uninspired. Unlike the previous films, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' didn't feel like another Harry Potter adventure, but merely a single chapter, as though it's leading to a spectacular resolution but hasn't quite got there yet (in fairness, however, this was also a problem I had with the later volumes in the novel series). It also didn't seem that David Yates had made the film his own, given it his own distinctive style, as Columbus, Cuarón and Newell had. Nonetheless, despite my seemingly-endless complaints, the overall product is a worthy addition, without being anything particularly special. With Yates apparently set to direct the next film, 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,' it'll be interesting to see in what direction he chooses to take it.",6,0,0,16 July 2007
Annie Hall," 'That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing'
","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is something of a hopeless romantic. A cynical, death-obsessed New York Jewish comedian, Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice, and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the 'second shooter' conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination, or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud, possibly Groucho Marx, he simply 'would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member.' He doesn't drive because he is paranoid about driving; he has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past fifteen years, though these appointments were long ago reduced to simple 'whining' sessions. There is an inherent uncertainty in everything that Singer says  as though he really knows what he's talking about, but he can't convince himself that he's got it right.When he accompanies a friend (Tony Roberts) to a tennis game, Singer's first and foremost concern is that the club will deny him entry because he's a Jew. However, that fateful game serves forth something so much more significant and life-changing  he comes to meet the ditsy and exuberant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Despite clearly having very little in common, something clicks between the two eligibles, and they embark on a tumultuous years-long relationship that will inevitably fail to materialise into anything further. Erupting with clever dialogue and witty cultural references, 'Annie Hall's' script is one of the best you'll ever see. Not only is the conversation entertaining to listen to, but  even with all the talking to the camera and interacting with random extras  it actually manages to seem startlingly realistic. This is no small thanks, of course, to the main actors, who embody their characters so perfectly that we're unsure if they are acting or merely playing themselves.Though he had previously released a few well-received, light-hearted affairs, it was 'Annie Hall' that blasted writer/actor/director Woody Allen into the realms of super-stardom. In an uncharacteristic move for the Academy, Allen's film won four 1978 Oscars, including Best Actress (Keaton), Best Original Screenplay (Allen, Marshall Brickman), Best Director (Allen) and Best Picture  not undeservedly, though millions of 'Star Wars' fans would, I'm sure, disagree. Having revisited 'Annie Hall' for the first time in a year, having since enjoyed many of Allen's other films, I am genuinely amazed at his transition from silly comedian to insightful observer on human relationships. Of course, a noticeable evolution in his film-making style is evident in both the science-fiction 'Sleeper (1973)' and the Russian historical spoof 'Love and Death (1975),' but neither boasts the the intelligence nor the sophistication of this film, which wholly discards the Chaplin-like slapstick of Allen's previous films and adopts the Tracy-Hepburn screwball comedy of a decade later.Originally slated  and filmed, in fact  as a New York murder mystery with a romantic sub-plot, 'Annie Hall' was taken by editor Ralph Rosenbaum and cut down (massacred, if you will) into the modern, witty 1970s screwball comedy that we still enjoy today. It is truly amazing that such an extensive post-production reshaping had no obvious ill effects upon the general flow of the film, though the structure in itself is so hectic that we probably wouldn't notice it, anyway: Allen frequently cuts forwards and backwards in time, his modern characters are able to revisit and discuss the past, characters in split screens interact, Allen regularly breaks the 'fourth wall' and addresses the audience directly. Some of the discarded murder mystery elements from 'Annie Hall' were later incorporated into another Allen film, 'Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),' which also co-starred Keaton.Aside from Allen and Keaton, numerous smaller roles provide a crucial framework for the overall structure of the film. Tony Roberts is Rob, Singer's old friend and confidant. Paul Simon (of Simon and Garfunkel) plays a record producer who takes a keen interest in both Annie and her singing. Shelley Duvall is a reporter for 'The Rolling Stone' magazine, and a one-time girlfriend of Singer. There are also tiny early roles for Christopher Walken (as Annie's somewhat disturbed brother), Jeff Goldblum (who speaks one memorable line at a party  'Hello? I forgot my mantra') and Sigourney Weaver (who can be briefly glimpsed as Singer's date outside a theatre). Two slightly more unusual cameos come from Truman Capote (as a Truman Capote-lookalike, no less) and scholar Marshall McLuhan (whom Singer suddenly procures from behind a movie poster to declare to a talkative film-goer that 'you know nothing of my work!').Easily the most innovative and energetic of the films I've so far seen from Woody Allen, 'Annie Hall' is a spirited glimpse at the incompatibility of human beings, and a cynical yet bittersweet meditation on the falsity of the perfect romantic Hollywood ending. It is also a considerable comedic achievement, and Allen would repeatedly recycle his trademark neurotic New Yorker screen persona, most notably in 'Manhattan (1979),' but never with more success than this premium outing in excellence. The engagingly-convoluted storyline moves with such briskness that you don't realise just how very little happens, and that, by the film's end, our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning. Nevertheless, Allen manages to say something significant about human relationships  they're totally irrational, crazy and absurd, but we keep attempting them because of what they give us in return. Or, at least, what we think they give us.",9,44,61,7 June 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'Its origin and purpose still a total mystery'
","Beauty is an often-overlooked component of modern film-making. We are often so overwhelmed by complex story lines and fast-paced action that we forget to simply sit back and admire the sheer beauty of celluloid. Engineered with intricate precision by passionate, experienced hands, a film can transcend the boundaries of simply being a film. It can become a work of art. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is not a film to be watched by one in any hurry. To the unprepared viewer, the leisurely pace of the narrative may first come across as 'slow' or 'tedious.' However, to those lucky enough to be able to appreciate its brilliance, the film is a relaxing, meditative journey that you can't expect to forget any time soon. The film relies, not on dialogue, but on stunning visual imagery and an eerily appropriate classical score, to explore its themes and advance the limited plot. In fact, the first spoken word appears almost thirty minutes into the film, and, in total, less than forty minutes of dialogue constitutes the total running time.Following the enormous success of his classic apocalyptic black comedy, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),' director Stanley Kubrick became enthralled by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and so collaborated with noted English sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke to create 'the proverbial good science fiction movie.' The two decided to adapt and expand Clarke's early short story, 'The Sentinel,' written in 1948 and first published in 1951. In a nutshell, and at its most literal level, '2001: A Space Odyssey' tells the story of Mankind's evolution, either prompted or surveilled by ominous black Monoliths, the tools of an unseen advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. Through the coldly-sinister HAL9000 computer (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), Kubrick also explores the expanding role that technology will play in the future, and whether or not our complete dependence upon it will inevitably result in our own destruction {also an important theme in 'Dr. Strangelove'}.Many of the film's detractors often complain that the story poses complex questions about Mankind's origin and place in the Universe, but without offering any answers of any kind. I can see how the film's 'open-endedness' might be infuriating to those who are eager for a neatly-packaged explanation, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Though one might miss it on first viewing, Kubrick has plenty to say about the way he views humanity. For example, the opening 'Dawn of Man' sequence depicts the crumbling society of the early hominids, as they attempt futilely to scrounge out an existence in the arid landscape. The inexplicable arrival of the Monolith (accompanied by György Ligeti's endlessly-creepy 'Requiem') precipitates a profound change in the mental capabilities of the Apemen  they are now able to exploit tools to stay alive. That famed match-cut from the soaring bone to the orbiting spacecraft four million years later is so simple, and yet it conveys so much about the human race. Worth noting is that Kubrick originally intended those spacecraft to be orbiting nuclear weapons {the Cold War being at its peak around the time of the film's production}. The cut is a way of enforcing that, given his intelligence, Man will always use it to develop ways to destroy himself (remembering that the bone was used to kill the leader of an enemy tribe).Another sequence that remains hotly-debated almost four decades after the film's release is the controversial ending, a psychedelic wormhole of colour produced by effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull using slit-scan photography. Following his journey through the 'Stargate'  a breathtaking trip across the bizarre expanses of the Universe  Dave Bowman is deposited in a sort of fourth-dimensional observational chamber, its classical decorations both familiar and alien, where the greater beings who engineered the Monoliths can keep an invisible eye on him. In this room, having finally defeated his tools, Man must face one final challenge: his own death. Throughout history, human evolution depended so much upon its technology/tools that it almost replaced us. In the end, it tried to destroy us (i.e. HAL). Now, just moments from the death of Mankind, separated from his tools, what do we have left? The final act of a dying Dave is to reach out his withered hand towards the Monolith that stands before him. This image of 'reaching out' with an extended finger was directly borrowed by Kubrick from the famous painting found in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel artwork -- of Man extending his finger to touch God's hand. Note how, following Dave's epic transformation/rebirth into a Starchild, Kubrick juxtaposes the Earth's razor-thin atmosphere with the frail fetus in its womb, stressing the fragility, preciousness and vulnerability of the planet on which we dwell.There's really no adequate way to explain why '2001' is such a magnificent and special film to me. It is, above all else, a motion picture that appeals to our emotions, and the feelings of awe, wonderment and terror that overcome me are simply indescribable. In judging films, I prefer to reserve the term 'masterpiece' for the films capable of completely drawing me into their world, of making me forget that I'm watching a movie. I want to feel as though I am there. Shortly put, '2001' achieves this more effectively than any other film I have ever experienced. If you need any further explanation of why I value this film so greatly, then consider my experiences with one particular sequence: Dave Bowman, in order to re-access the Discovery and disconnect HAL, must enter the spaceship through the emergency airlock, exposing himself to a total vacuum for an extended period of time. As the breathable air finally began to fill Dave's surroundings, I found myself taking a breath for the first time in almost half a minute. I was there.",10,1,3,6 December 2007
Blood Diamond," 'That diamond is my ticket out of this God-forsaken continent.'
","'Blood Diamond' is probably most accurately described, first and foremost, as an action movie, with its other well-meaning cinematic intentions not being quite so well-realised. However, as a whole, the film is highly entertaining, and held aloft by two outstanding central performances. During the Sierra Leone Civil War of the 1990s and early 2000s, billions of dollars in diamonds were mined and sold around the world, the profits used to finance further conflict. These diamonds are widely known as 'blood diamonds,' from which the title of this film was derived. Over the course of the war, tens of thousands lost their lives, and countless more fled the country as refugees.Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' opens in 1999, revealing a poverty-stricken country that has been torn apart by the bitter struggle between government forces and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a loving father who was captured during the rebel insurgence and forced to mine for diamonds to fund RUF's activities. Meanwhile, his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been captured by the rebels and conscripted to become a child soldier, involving a brutal process of brainwashing that transforms children into bloodthirsty killers. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 'Rhodesian' weapons smuggler, devoid of morals and thinking only of his next pay-cheque. After Solomon unearths an extremely valuable pink-tinged diamond, Danny exploits him for the information of its whereabouts, though he isn't the only one who wants to get his hands on it.As I mentioned earlier, both Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou give excellent performances, and each was deservedly nominated for an Oscar at the 2007 Academy Awards. DiCaprio, notorious for always looking young and immature on screen, finally casts aside this troublesome stereotype as the selfish and grizzled firearms trafficker, accompanied by an unusual African accent that, nonetheless, never falters. Hounsou plays his role of devoted father with a lot of passion, his most impressive scene taking place at the UN refugee camp, when his relief at being reunited with his family turns to unadulterated rage when he hears that his beloved son has been stolen from him. Conversely, Jennifer Connelly is merely adequate as American journalist Maddy Bowen, who has arrived in Sierra Leone to investigate the illegal diamond trade.Oddly, the actress is seemingly trying to appear seductive in just about every one of her scenes, though perhaps this was a deliberate decision to highlight how she uses her 'charm' to obtain information.'Blood Diamond' contains some excellent action sequences, but Eduardo Serra's camera darts about so frantically that it's often difficult to decipher what is happening on screen. I felt that the extended ending was unnecessary (it should have ended on the mountainside), and the epilogue seemed like an attempt to make the film appear more significant than it actually was: after all, 'Blood Diamond' was a interesting character study and an excellent action/adventure film, but it says little of any substance about the diamond trade, beyond that it is bad. In any case, the theme of large international corporations getting rich at the expense of poverty-stricken Africans was handled slightly better in 'The Constant Gardener (2005),' whilst the issue of children being taught to become killers was more effective in 'Cidade de Deus / City of God (2002).' Interestingly, both of these were directed by Fernando Meirelles.Though perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good, Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' is an entertaining two hours, and has its own fair share of positive attributes. At the very least, it brought the horrific Sierra Leone Civil War to my attention; I'd honestly never heard of it before. That alone is enough for me to consider this film a success.",7,3,5,23 September 2007
The Graduate," 'This is Benjamin. He's a little worried about his future.'
","Now we come upon a true classic of American cinema. Singlehandedly defining an entire era of film-making, 'The Graduate' brought director Mike Nichols (with only his second film, after 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?') recognition as a major new talent, and launched the remarkable acting career of Dustin Hoffman. The film received seven Oscar nominations  including Best Picture and three in the acting categories  though it walked away with just one award, for Best Director. Often overlooked as a highly-effective comedy, 'The Graduate' features a remarkable performance from Hoffman (who, at the age of thirty years, convincingly played a 21-year-old), as well as Anne Bancroft as the bored, domineering housewife who seduces him during a vulnerable period of his life.Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman), having just graduated from college (presumably Williams College, where the author of the novel, Charles Webb, attended, and also because Ben is seen wearing a Williams College tie at the beginning of the film), is uncertain about his future. Pushed to success by his slightly overbearing parents, Ben is confused about where his life is heading, desperately fumbling for an answer whenever one of his parents' friends asks him 'what are you going to do next?' He stares mournfully into his fish tank, perhaps likening himself to the fish dwelling within it. He is trapped in this glass cube, able to see the world outside but incapable of any meaningful interaction with it. This analogy is reinforced when, for his 21st birthday present, his parents gift him with a metal water diving suit, in which he clunks to the water's edge and sinks mournfully to the bottom of the pool. Unsure of his future, Ben is simply drifting through life: 'Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. Here in the pool it's very comfortable just to drift here.'Into Ben's neurotic, confused life comes Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), whose failing marriage to Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) has enticed her to seek sexual gratification elsewhere. Despite Ben being half her age (in actual fact, just six years separated Bancroft, 36, from Hoffman, 30), she deviously maneuvers a vulnerable Ben into a compromising position and exploitively attempts to seduce him. Their relationship continues for many weeks in complete secrecy, though the two share absolutely no connection beyond a physical attraction. When Ben is coaxed by Mr. Robinson and his own parents (William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) into dating young Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), he haphazardly tries to ruin any chance of this relationship ever working, in the process falling in love with Elaine. Trapped amidst one of the most awkward triangular relationships in cinema history  a boy, a girl and her mother  Ben must ultimately make a choice about who he would rather be with. Instead of merely drifting along, he must decide what he wants and take control of his life.'The Graduate' appealed very much to younger audiences in its day. With its disapproving attitudes towards the older generation's complete belief in materialism (epitomised by Mr. McGuire's (Walter Brooke) one-word recipe for happiness  'plastics!'), the film shows a wide rift between the young and old, making Ben's relationship with Mr. Robinson seem all the more shocking and scandalous. Only the younger characters in the film (Ben and Elaine) are afforded first names, likely a deliberate choice to clarify the clear distinction between the two generations. In 1967, Simon and Garfunkel were at the height of their fame, and Nichols exploited this to its full potential. By blending newly-performed tracks ('Mrs. Robinson') with those already popular with audiences ('The Sounds of Silence'/'Scarborough Fair'), he created a highly memorable soundtrack, whose songs are now universally associated with the themes and particular scenes of the film. 'The Sounds of Silence,' considering it was written before 'The Graduate' was produced, is a perfect accompaniment to the film, effectively translating Ben's overwhelming feelings of loneliness and alienation.Considering I was expecting a straight-out drama, 'The Graduate' has its own share of hilariously comedic moments, most arising from Ben's pathetic impulsive actions when placed in a confusing situation. My favourite (supposedly improvised by Hoffman to prevent his own laughter from showing on camera) involves Ben dejectedly retreating to the back of the room to bang his head repeatedly against a wall after his pathetic attempt to grope an undressing Mrs. Robinson's chest. Revolutionary, funny, dramatic and memorable, 'The Graduate' is a deserving all-time American classic.",9,1,2,3 July 2007
Pride & Prejudice," 'Oh, my goodness. Everybody behave naturally'
","I tend to associate such titles as 'Pride and Prejudice' with stuffy melodrama, but Joe Wright's film is nothing of the sort. Rather than feeling stagnant, the film uses graceful and elaborate long-takes to suggest a sort of omniscient energy, the camera gliding breezily from character to character, watchfully aware of how their interactions are affecting each other's fates and behaviours. Throughout these long- takes, actors skip in and out of the camera's sights, jolting the audience's attention to different layers of the frame. During the ball scene, as the camera presses impatiently against the throngs of advancing ball-goers, I was reminded of Sokurov's 'Russian Ark (2002).' Whereas Wright's follow-up effort 'Atonement (2007)' was somewhat tarnished by a second-act that languished in aimlessless, 'Pride & Prejudice (2005)' benefits from its enduring source material, and Jane Austen's tale of unlikely love is consistently engrossing.'Pride & Prejudice' could only have worked with a strong cast, and all here do an excellent job. I've never been particularly charmed by Keira Knightley, but here she displays a strong assurance in the leading role. Her Elizabeth has the qualities both of a protagonist and a narrator; she occasionally sports, in passing, a sort of conspirational smirk, as though fully aware of the absurdity of society's customs, but choosing to go along with it. Rosamund Pike, as sister Jane, is an absolute angel, the deserving jewel of the Bennet family. Gruff, surly Matthew Macfadyen is good, though his apparent 'transformation' into a desirable husband never seemed to flow naturally. Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench, whose work is always appreciated, also contribute with their usual charisma and integrity.The world of the Bennet family and the surly Mr Darcy (Macfadyen) is one steeped in formality. The characters never quite say what they're thinking or feeling, having to content themselves with hiding behind words and witticisms. In this sense, there's a sort of claustrophobia about their interactions; constrained by the expectations of an uptight society, Elizabeth never really speaks her mind. Recall her altercation with Mr Darcy mid-way through the film, and her seething hatred towards him. Even then, Elizabeth's words are admirably civil, biting but sapped of honest emotion. The film is a parade of nervous giggling, obligatory bows, and forced pleasantries. Additionally, there's something rather grotesque in how desperately Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) basically tries to sell off her daughters to the highest bidder.",8,3,5,4 April 2010
Singin' in the Rain," 'The new Don Lockwood. He yodels; he jumps around to music!'
","Just to get the record straight, I don't really like musicals. Whilst I'm fond of most cinematic genres, the musical has been one to which I have been rather averse. Perhaps it is the sheer absurdity of a character suddenly breaking into song at the most inopportune moment, or maybe it is the films' tendencies to have a flimsy story connecting the numerous song-and-dance numbers. In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared.Following the great success of 'An American in Paris' a year earlier, 'Singin' in the Rain' was co-directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, and is set in 1927  appropriately, the year of cinema's transition from silent films to 'talkies.' Don Lockwood (Kelly) is silent cinemas biggest star, featuring in a string of monumental financial successes for Monumental Pictures, usually opposite the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who can't comprehend that Lockwood only acts affectionate towards her for his films' publicity. With the release of 'The Jazz Singer,' every studio is eager to cash-in on the demand for talkies, but Don and Lina find themselves with a problem: Lina's shrill New York accent definitely does not complement her glamorous public image.After their share of difficulties  including one hilarious, trouble-plagued test screening for Don and Lina's new film, 'The Dueling Cavalier'  a possible solution is happened upon. Don's energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and pretty, young Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, just 20 years of age when the film was released) suggest turning the disaster of a movie into a musical  'The Dancing Cavalier'  with Kathy dubbing all of Lina's dialogue and singing. Of course, not everything goes quite to plan, particularly when the selfish and arrogant Lina finds out about this and tries to have Kathy stripped off all the credit for her excellent work. What sets 'Singin' in the Rain' apart from almost every other musical is the story. Whilst it's obvious that most of the songs were selected well before the plot was formulated  sometimes the musical numbers go off on an unnecessary tangent that is irrelevant to the story  no true fan of cinema can go past a film about Hollywood itself.The actual storyline is genuinely engaging, and Lina turns into quite a loathsome villainess by the end of the film, especially when her selfishness threatens to destroy the career of one so innocent and promising as young Kathy. Gene Kelly is great in the main role, his superb confidence and boyish charm, coupled with flawless singing and dancing skills, helping to make him one of Hollywood's most fondly-remembered stars. Debbie Reynolds was also very good, despite reportedly having a difficult time on set, her underdeveloped dancing skills often incurring Gene Kelly's frustration. Donald O'Connor, who I can't believe I've never heard about before, is absolutely phenomenal throughout, his every appearance funny, energetic and memorable. Likewise, Jean Hagen savours every moment as the dim but influential Lina Lamont, earning an Oscar nominations for her troubles.Of course, the true highlights of 'Singin' in the Rain' are the musical numbers. Whilst very few of the songs are original to the film (for example, the title song was taken from 'Hollywood Revue of 1929'), the use of each is so inspired that they now forever associated with it. I'm not particularly a fan of the slow, romantic love songs, but some of the more lively tunes appealed to me greatly. 'Singin' in the Rain,' performed by Gene Kelly on a rainswept nighttime street, has now becoming legendary, superbly demonstrating how Don's love for Kathy has eradicated all of his troubles and left him blissfully happy. O'Connor's energetic rendition of 'Make 'Em Laugh,' in which he somersaults off the walls of a movie set, left him in a state of extreme exhaustion. 'Good Morning,' a catchy little tune performed by Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds was also nice to watch. Perhaps the film's centrepiece, Kelly's 'Broadway Melody Ballet' has little to do with the plot of the film, but it is such an astounding flurry of colour and excitement that I am willing to forgive its running a bit overlong. For fans of musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Indeed, even for people who have little interest in watching musicals, you shouldn't give up on the genre until you have at least seen this one.",9,2,5,16 September 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'How happy is the blameless vestal's lot'
","After a long-term relationship goes sour, Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. Joel decides to undergo the same procedure himself, but decides midstream that some memories are worth hanging onto. Charlie Kaufman's films explore the workings of the human mind: 'Adaptation (2002)' traced the neurotic exchanges between an artist and his art; 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)' is about how memories influence our relationships with others; I'm yet to work out what 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' was all about, but at least it had fun going about it. As was the case with Spike Jonze, Kaufman found in Michel Gondry a director who shared his unique perspective on life and art. 'Eternal Sunshine' is eccentric without being outwardly quirky, and Gondry's creative flair for optical trickery (sharpened through his work on music videos) is perfect for recreating the labyrinthine cubicles of the human mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is perhaps the only film I've seen whose narrative moves both forwards and backwards at the same time. It has been said that 'those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.' The film concludes with a single memory skipping back on itself, suggesting that Joel and Clementine are trapped in this endless cycle of 'love,' heartbreak and erasure for the rest of their lives {indeed, an early screenplay draft depicted this idea more explicitly}. This outcome is mirrored in the relationship between Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst), who repeat their affair even after Mary undergoes the Lacuna procedure. As in 'Adaptation,' this ending demonstrates Kaufman's talent for depicting failure in the misleading guise of hope; just as Nicolas Cages' screenwriter flounders in his attempts to write an original Hollywood script, Joel and Clementine willingly doom themselves towards a life almost entirely devoid of lasting memories.",9,0,1,21 January 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," 'I like the stink of the streets. It cleans out my lungs.'
","The director's final film, Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a spectacular sprawling epic of the lives of a group of Jewish Prohibition-era gangsters, witnessed through the memory of one member, Noodles (Robert De Niro), many decades afterward. Grand in both conception and execution, the film brilliantly combines flawless acting, a poetic script, stunning cinematography and a memorable musical score from long-time Leone-collaborator, Ennio Morricone. Despite weighing in at a hefty 229 minutes (Leone had originally envisioned a 6-hour epic), the film never fails to hold the audience's interest, flashing backwards and forwards between three eras in Noodle's life in an almost dream-like fashion, offering a compelling and comprehensive glimpse into his years as a gangster.If you're planning on watching this film, it is absolutely imperative  at least for your first viewing  that you track down the 4-hour version, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984 and was seen throughout most of Europe. For its American release, the film was infamously massacred into a heavily-cut, fully-chronological 139-minute version, which became a marked critical and commercial flop and failed to garner a single Oscar nomination. Fortunately, the European version has gained greater prominence over the years, and is now quite easily obtained on DVD.The film is mostly inspired by an autobiographical novel, 'The Hoods,' written by a gangster-turned-informant under the pseudonym Harry Grey. Leone has wanted to adapt the novel since the 1960s, but had long been unable to secure the rights. Interweaving three chapters of the characters' lives  1921, 1933 and 1968  the film focuses primarily on two main characters: the quiet, reflective David 'Noodles' Aaronson (played by Scott Tiler as a child, and Robert De Niro as an adult) and the very ambitious, quick-tempered Max Bercovicz (Rusty Jacobs as a child, James Woods as an adult). Also significant are the other younger members of the gang: Patsy (Brian Bloom, James Hayden), Cockeye (Adrian Curran, William Forsythe) and Dominic (Noah Moazezi), as well as Noodles' long time love interest, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly as a child, and Elizabeth McGovern as an adult). In 1968, after thirty-five years in hiding, Noodles returns to New York City to confront his past and the death of his long-time acquaintances, for whose death he blames himself.The acting in 'Once Upon A Time in America' is absolutely stellar, with highly-dependable leading men De Niro and Woods delivering brilliant performances as life-long friends in a constantly changing personal and professional relationship. The success of the film also hinged largely on the skills of the younger actors, who would be forced to carry lengthy sequences of the narrative on their own. Perhaps surprisingly, they each give assured performances that are very much equal to that of the acting veterans, with particular praise going to Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs and Jennifer Connelly (the now-famous actress who, at just fourteen years of age, was making her cinematic debut). Morricone's low-key but very effective soundtrack, largely employing the use of a pan flute, is soft and reflective, very suited to the sombre tone of the film.At nearly four hours in length, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is not a film that you can just sit down and watch at any time. It requires a little bit of patience and dedication, efforts that will not go unrewarded. When it was released  much to the director's disgust  critics touted the film as 'a Jewish 'Godfather.'' Perhaps this was not what Leone particularly had in mind, but many parallels can be drawn between the themes and subject matter of these films, and it is highly likely that fans of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces will also thoroughly enjoy this film.",9,1,3,27 June 2007
Avatar," 'You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there'
","Defying all analytical expectations, James Cameron's follow-up to 'Titanic (1997)' not only proved commercially successful, but actually out-grossed its colossal predecessor. Yet the mantle of history's highest-grossing film is not easily borne. By the end of January 2010, with $2 billion worth of ticket sales behind it, one finds it impossible not to form unrealistic expectations before a first-time viewing. 'Avatar (2009)' succeeds admirably in many regards, but also disappoints in a few. In a purely technical sense, the film is a masterpiece. Cameron's use of the 3D technology (particularly viewed on the mammoth IMAX screens) isn't gimmicky enough to draw attention to itself, but instead strives to immerse the viewer in the incredible computer- generated landscapes of Pandora, where ferns brush against your face and insects buzz lazily through your field of vision. This is the closest we've got so far to a visceral, immersive cinema experience.Where I did take issue with 'Avatar' was its screenplay. We know that Cameron is a capable screenwriter – both of the 'Terminator' films (1984; 1991) and 'True Lies (1994)' were impeccably-scripted action films – but here he traipses a well-worn path. The story, strongly indebted to the story of Pocahantas, and every other cinematic derivative, never (and I really mean never) takes an unexpected course. This painful predictability did inevitably detract from my enjoyment, because one would expect a majestic otherworld like Pandora to be fruitful with unexpected delights, and yet Cameron delivers few. Also, quality science-fiction films are rare nowadays, and I didn't particularly like how 'Avatar' had morphed into full-blown mystic fantasy by its conclusion. I recently rewatched Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979)' and was entranced by the simple act of exploring a foreign planet; such sequences, too, were the clear highlight of Cameron's film.",8,0,3,8 February 2010
Invictus," 'It is a human calculation'
","If ever an actor was the only choice for a role, then this is it. Morgan Freeman has one of the most commanding presences of any actor in Hollywood, and here he slips so effortlessly into the role of South African President Nelson Mandela that you have to blink twice to make sure you're not watching archival footage of the man himself. It's not an imitation so much as a habitation of the role. Matt Damon, too, does an excellent job, but he does it in a very different manner. Whereas Freeman tinkers with his preexisting screen persona in just the right way, Damon completely casts his own aside, and I frequently forgot that I was watching one of the screen's highest-paid actors. Clint Eastwood, an actor himself, has always excelled at coaxing quality performances from quality performers.In the early 1990s, Nelson Mandela was released following 27 years of incarceration. His first order of business as President, if this film is to be believed, was to ensure the World Cup success of the South African rugby team. All other politics are bluntly dismissed as gratuitous international travel or distractions during a rugby game. By evoking a significant period in South African history – the end of apartheid – Eastwood tries very hard to elevate 'Invictus' above the ranks of every other predictable underdog sporting story ever made, but a simple-minded approach to politics means that he never quite escapes the pack. In its final act, all matters of racism are swept aside for a World Cup final that unfolds almost entirely in slow-motion, and, since the game's outcome is never in any doubt, the sequence drags with corresponding sluggishness.",6,0,2,27 January 2010
Super 8," 'Production Value!'
","'Super 8' was my first film from 2011, and it was a fantastic place to start the year. The film's teaser trailer enigmatically promised something along the lines of 'Cloverfield (2008)' (which I still haven't seen), but the second trailer was pure Spielbergian nostalgia – not surprising, given the 'Amblin Entertainment' logo that opens the film. But what really distinguishes 'Super 8' is its love of filmmaking. The story is set in 1979, when director J.J. Abrams was just a kid, and probably running around with his own Super 8 camera. The film's characters are a group of children who spend their free time making a hokey amateur zombie detective thriller, though their equipment still looks more professional than that in my latest filmmaking project. A massive train derailment, a huge military presence in the town, and an ominous entity on the loose, cannot dampen their enthusiasm for completing the film. To each new turn-of-events, the boy directing the film (played by first-timer Riley Griffiths) keeps getting excited and exclaiming 'production value!', which was funny until I remembered I did the same thing when the annual Festival blocked off my town's main street in 2009. All of the child actors (including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning) are impressive, given that they're carrying the entire film on their little shoulders. And, of course, be sure to stick around for the final credits.",8,2,5,7 July 2011
Life Is Beautiful," 'This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell.'
","For the last 60 years, films regarding the Holocaust have had to tread carefully. It is truly a horrifying and disheartening period in Mankind's history, and, quite evidently, little humour could possibly be derived from it. Perhaps the last mainstream film to attempt such a thing was Charles Chaplin's classic 1940 satire, 'The Great Dictator,' which memorably spoofed Hitler and his Nazi regime, and poignantly highlighted the plight of the Jews. Indeed, Chaplin's film was released approximately a year before the true Nazi death camps, such as Auschwitz, were constructed, and Chaplin would later state in his 1964 autobiography, had he known the actual extent of the Holocaust's horrors, he could never have made such jokes about the Nazi regime.It would take until 1997 that a film dared to try again. Popular Italian comedy entertainer Roberto Benigni co-wrote, directed and starred in 'La Vita è bella' (Life is Beautiful), a truly heartwarming wartime tale of love, family, courage and imagination. The film made an international star out of Benigni, with 'La Vita è bella' winning three 1999 Academy Awards (including Best Actor and Best Foreign Film), and nominated for a further four (including Best Picture and Best Director). Though I find it difficult to judge a performance in which an actor is not speaking English, there is no denying that Benigni does a terrific job as both actor and director. His surprise Best Actor Oscar win was only the second time a performance completely in Italian had been awarded (after Sophia Loren for 'La Ciociara' (1960)).The first half of the film contains not a hint of the war, and acts as the genuinely entertaining story of Guido Orefice's (Benigni) whimsical attempts to romance a beautiful Italian teacher named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), whom he calls 'Princess.' Guido's exploits contain a large amount of innocent slapstick, evoking fond memories of Chaplin's antics sixty years earlier, and it is truly a pleasure to watch. We gaze in wonder as he continually meets his 'Princess' in the most unexpected of places, whether she falls from the sky and into his arms, he arrives at her school pretending to be an Aryan inspector, or as he serves as a waiter at her engagement  to a loud and rude bank manager with a certain attraction to eggs.After Guido 'rescues' Dora from her unwanted marriage, riding her out of the engagement party atop of a green-painted steed named Robin Hood, we cut to five years later, and the two lovers are now married, with a bright and curious child named Giosué (written Joshua in the English subtitles), delightfully played by the young Giorgio Cantarini, in his screen debut. On the boy's birthday, Guido and Giosué are captured by the Nazis and herded onto a train to be transported to a concentration camp. Not being Jewish, Dora is spared such a fate, but she insists that she be taken also, unwilling to abandon her family.In an effort to protect his young son from the horrors taking place around him, Guido cheerfully pretends that the entire concentration camp set-up is a huge game, with the ultimate prize going to the first team to score 1000 points  the ultimate prize being a real, fully-working tank. Young Giosué's imagination is captured by such a prospect, and he enthusiastically sets about winning 1st prize, his daily duties largely involving remaining hidden and silent on the top bunk of a set of beds. Meanwhile, Guido spends his days performing gritty slave labour, lugging hefty anvils considerable distances, all the while detailing to Giosué the phenomenal time he had playing hop-scotch and tug-of-war.Whenever Giosué occasionally expresses his disbelief in the authenticity of his father's explanation, Guido is always able to sway him back. 'How ridiculous. They were just teasing you!' exclaims he, when Giosué reveals what he had overhead from a sobbing old man. 'There are wood ovens, but there are no people ovens. Putting people in ovens creates too much smoke!' The weary, disheartened Jews in the adjoining beds do their very best to perpetuate Guido's glorious façade. In one highly-amusing incident, to put his son's doubts at ease, Guido volunteers to translate a speech from one of the bad-tempered Nazis  the 'rude men who yell'  despite not speaking a word of German, substituting the actual speech with the stern rules to his supposed game.There's no doubt that 'La Vita è bella' shields the audience from most of the horrors of the Holocaust  no deaths are actually shown. Indeed, with the exception of one, no deaths are explicitly implied, with most of the murders lying deep in the subtext, only apparent due to our knowledge of history. The death of Jewish children should have been a heart wrenching moment in the film, but somehow Benigni manages to gloss over it. Giosué comes running to his father during the day, declaring that he refuses to take a shower as he has been told. We immediately recognise that the remainder of the children must now have been led to the gas chambers, but we do not dwell on it. The wider focus of the Holocaust is simply not what this film is about  it is about a loving father and his desire to protect his family with the most powerful weapon he possesses, his sense of humour and imagination.",9,4,8,17 March 2007
A Clockwork Orange," 'What's it going to be, eh?'
","In Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' bizarre 1959 dystopian novel, a juvenile delinquent (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of droogs whittle away their time partaking in such wholesome activities as beating homeless drunks, warring with rival gangs, raping helpless women, and enjoying the music of Ludwig Van Beethoven. There are two things happening in this film: one that Kubrick inherited from Burgess' writing, and another that is endemic to the cinematic medium.The first role of 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)' is as a rather vicious political satire, dryly mocking the hypocrisy of the government and its policies on institutionalisation and criminal rehabilitation. In the film, the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) is depicted as opportunistic and self-serving, latching onto the unproven Ludovico technique in a bid to stem his party's failing popularity with voters. When public opinion turns against the therapy, the Minister very swiftly back-peddles, reversing the treatment so that Alex may return to his former ultra-violent ways: 'I was cured alright!'The UK edition of Burgess' novel contained a final chapter in which Alex sees the error of his former ways, and vows to reform into a productive member of society. Kubrick was unaware of this addition until he had almost completed the screenplay, and never considered using it in the film. This was, I think, a good decision. Burgess' ending shies away from the problem: by letting human nature run its course, he seems to be implying that the problem of juvenile delinquency will sort itself out. Kubrick, admittedly, doesn't offer any solutions of his own, but the corrupt manner in which he ends the film leaves a sour taste.The Ludovico technique involves the screening of movies, which also allows Kubrick room for a degree of self-referentiality. It is in the audiences' nature to recoil from acts of sex and violence, and Kubrick's hard-nosed, deliberately-subversive approach (utilising the perspective of its biased protagonist and narrator) only encourages this response. Just as Alex is exposed to the Ludovico aversion therapy, Kubrick is exposing his audience to the same treatment. Does it work? Do we become desensitised to the violence, or do we begin to associate socially- accepted cues (i.e. Beethoven's Ninth, 'Singing in the Rain') with acts of evil?",9,2,3,24 November 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," 'I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.'
","'Eyes Wide Shut,' the long-awaited final film from visionary director Stanley Kubrick was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's sad and unfortunate death. Many predicted that it would be Kubrick's masterpiece - the film by which he would inevitably be remembered. It isn't, but 'Eyes Wide Shut' remains a stunning film, and nothing less than we've come to expect from this master director.Tom Cruise ('Minority Report') is Dr. William 'Bill' Harford, a handsome and successful young doctor, who is happily married to Alice (Nicole Kidman, 'The Others') with one young daughter, Helena. Bill is loyal to Alice, and he expects the same in return. However, he is severely shocked one night when Alice confesses that, a year earlier, she'd seriously contemplated having an affair with a young Navy officer.Many have complained about the slow pace of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I didn't find anything negative about it. The slow, meditative pace of the film (which shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of Kubrick's spectacular '2001: A Space Odyssey') gave the film its entire, dream-like quality, and I was simply transfixed to the screen the whole time. The scene where a masked Bill Harford wanders into the mysterious mansion amidst a secret sex ritual is simpling mesmerising, with no small thanks to the great direction from Kubrick. Once again, as always, he's chosen the perfect music to capture the atmosphere of the scene!The only scenes where I thought the film slipped up were a couple of the later mansion scenes, when the mysterious woman was warning Cruise to get out of there. The bit where she said, 'You are in grave danger!' sounded a bit melodramatic (reminded me of 'The Da Vinci Code,' actually), and also when she interrupts Cruise's stern interrogation by yelling, 'STOP!' The quick zoom used in that moment made me laugh...However, an astute fellow IMDb user alerted me to the fact that perhaps Kubrick did this deliberately. The actress in that scene (the mask prevents me from remembering who she actually was) sounded like she was acting because, simply put, her character was just acting. The entire display, as Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) suggests later in the film, may have been an elaborate ploy to scare the wits through Harford. Not being an experienced actor, the woman may have been convincing enough for the terrified and confused Harford, but not necessarily for the astute film viewer sitting in the comfort of their home. Though it is impossible to understand entirely what Kubrick was attempting with that scene, it seems like the sort of thing he'd do!'Eyes Wide Shut' contains great performances from a talented cast. I thought that Tom Cruise shined in the main role, translating the fear and confusion of his character to the screen beautifully. Nicole Kidman was also very good  her slow, brooding delivery of dialogue certainly contributed to the dreamlike quality of the film.This is a quality film from one of the all-time greats of film-making. Often overlooked simply as 'Stanley Kubrick's last film,' 'Eyes Wide Shut' deserves to be seen and appreciated by more film-goers.",8,3,6,26 January 2007
Some Like It Hot," 'I don't care how rich he is, as long as he has a yacht, his own private railroad car, and his own toothpaste.'
","If films directors could be characterised as different types of beverages, then Billy Wilder would surely be the glass of sparkling champagne. To date, I've seen three of his films {the other two being 'Double Indemnity (1944)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)'}, and every single one absolutely brims with class, a triumph of witty writing and procificient direction. Even though 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' was voted #1 in the American Film Institute's '100 Years 100 Laughs,' I didn't initially consider it the sort of film that I would enjoy. After all, who wants to watch a movie about men dressing up as women? Needless to say, I had completely underestimated the talent of both Wilder and his terrific cast, and 'Some Like It Hot' revealed itself to be a very funny film, indeed. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as two jazz musicians who witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 and are forced to flee Chicago posing as two members of an all-girls band. Comedic sparks fly when both men fall for sexy blonde vocalist 'Sugar Kane' Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and, maintaining their female disguises, begin to fight for her affection.The most astonishing thing about 'Some Like It Hot' is that it never goes to where you expect it. The script, co-written by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond {from a story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan}, is basically a romantic screwball comedy, but with flourishes of the film-noir and gangster genres, most noticeable in the scenes featuring hardened mob-boss Spats Colombo (George Raft). Not many comedies open the proceedings with the brutal, cold-blooded murder of seven men, but Wilder's film does, and it's executed in such a way that, somehow, the unexpected scenes of violence never seem out of place. At the very least, these sinister events provide the perfect incentive for Curtis and Lemmon to throw on a dress, a wig and some make-up, their facade wholly believable in the face of such an unpleasant alternative. Wilder filmed 'Some Like It Hot' in black-and-white, not only to evoke the appopriate time-period, but, more importantly, to obscure the unavoidable imperfections in the men's make-up. Though the end result isn't very convincing at all  as a male, I certainly wouldn't make the mistake of approaching either Josephine or Daphne  it requires a suspension of disbelief that we're more-than-willing to make.The comedic duo of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon works extremely well. Curtis tends to appear rather self-conscious posing as a woman, finding more comfort as the multi-millionaire heir to Shell Oil, as whom to poses to win over Sugar Kane. On the other hand, Lemmon is entirely uninhibited as Daphne, exploding into feverish episodes of feminine behaviour that lead us to believe that perhaps his performance as a woman has convinced even himself. While Curtis' Joe (a.k.a. Josephine) spends his time attempting to woo Marilyn Monroe (whose character, self-described as being not particularly bright, absolutely oozes sexuality), Lemmon's Jerry (a.k.a. Daphne) finds that he has larger problems, as an obsessed old millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), falls in love with him. Keeping the entertainment level as high as possible at all times, Wilder thankfully denies us the seemingly-inevitable, clichéd moral lesson that usually arises once the supporting characters discover the true identity of their girlfriends. Most legendary of all is the reaction of Osgood Fielding, in the film's final line, as Jerry admits that he is merely a man posing as a woman: 'Well, nobody's perfect.'",9,4,6,16 December 2007
The Untouchables," 'I think I'll have a drink'
","Quite a few years ago, I was randomly flicking through channels at a relatively late hour for anything that might be worth watching. Suddenly, my finger froze on the controls, and I paused, immediately transfixed with the image that now occupied the television screen. A baby's carriage was tumbling down the stairs of a railway station, descending towards oblivion in heartrending slow-motion, every agonising moment meticulously framed for maximum tension. Kevin Costner, currently engaged in a relentless gunfight with armed gangsters, dives desperately towards the floundering infant, but the carriage is consistently out of his reach, and a devastating conclusion is imminent. At that moment, I'd never heard the name Brian De Palma, I'd never seen 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' and I didn't even know the name of the film I was actually watching, but I found myself positively spellbound by what I was witnessing  this sequence was a perfect organism of suspense and intrigue. It has, unbelievably, taken me years to finally track down 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma's stylish take on the 1930s Prohibition era, and I can only say that the wait has been more than worthwhile.The 1959 ABC television series, 'The Untouchables,' ran for four seasons and 118 episodes, and starred Robert Stack as Eliot Ness, the dedicated Prohibition agent who worked to put Al Capone behind bars. The story lines were adapted, albeit with much artistic license, from Ness' own 1957 autobiography of the same name, published shortly after his death. Director Brian De Palma, noted for his extreme if derivative visual style, had already achieved perhaps his greatest success with the bravura gangster picture, 'Scarface (1983),' starring an unforgettable Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana {this film was, in fact, a loose remake of Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson's 'Scarface (1932),' based on the life of Al Capone}. In producing 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma has crafted one of the most handsome and energetic gangster movies I've seen, and the two hour running time flew by so incredibly swiftly that I gazed at the clock in disbelief once the film had come to an end; is it a valid complaint to remark that a film should have continued for an hour more?Kevin Costner stars as Agent Eliot Ness, whose dedication towards bringing down arrogant and brutal gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) has been constantly thwarted by the corruption rampant throughout the police force. Compiling a small task-force of trusted cops, comprising gruff Irishman Jim Malone (Sean Connery), crack-shot Italian George Stone (Andy Garcia) and meek accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), Ness sets about disrupting Capone's illegal alcohol ring, and tracing shifty income tax dealings back to the infamous crime boss. Costner is strong in the leading role, particularly when his actions place his family in jeopardy, and Connery deservedly received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Ness' brisk, irritable and racist mentor. After years of shamelessly imitating Alfred Hitchcock's film-making style, De Palma finally comes into his own, and the railway station shootout  a respectful homage to Eisenstein's 'Odessa Steps' sequence  is a perfect construction of suspense, every minute detail absorbed by the audience with a continually-quickening heartbeat. As far as gangster pictures not directed by Francis Ford Coppola are concerned, this is about as good as they come.",9,0,1,23 March 2008
The Godfather: Part III," 'Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind'
","My three-week engagement with Francis Ford Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy came to a close this week, and, contrary to the prevailing public opinion, I find myself satisfied. 'The Godfather: Part III (1990)' has always been the Fredo of the 'Godfather' family  frequently disparaged, resented or otherwise ignored. Certainly, there was considerable risk in returning to the Corleone family after a sixteen-year absence, especially given the mixed critical and commercial reception towards much of Coppola's 1980s output {indeed, the director only accepted the studio offer to recoup his past financial losses}. Nevertheless, that a second sequel wasn't produced sooner demonstrates Coppola's dedication towards getting everything right, and the result is a picture that successfully expands upon the two previous instalments, respectfully and solemnly drawing the saga to a close. Any film is liable to suffer in comparison with two of the great gangster pictures of our time, but, despite a few issues  which I'll get to shortly  'The Godfather: Part III' is a more than worthy addition to the family.Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has spent the last two decades trying to legitimise his operations, perhaps a last futile attempt at reconstructing his shattered family. However, still tormented by the memory of brother Fredo, Michael knows that he can never truly wash his hands of organised crime ('just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!'). Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent (Andy Garcia) offers his services to Michael, proving his dedication towards the family, even if he shares his father's recklessness. Michael's two children have since grown up. Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) has defied his father's wishing by becoming an opera singer, and Mary (Sofia Coppola) begins a worrying incestuous relationship with Vincent. Meanwhile, in a further bid to improve his reputation and importance, Michael moves to purchase the Vatican's shares in real-estate company Immobiliare, a bid that ultimately reveals corruption and treachery in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church, a group traditionally regarded as pure and virtuous. Here, Coppola shows that policemen, judges, and even priests, can readily be bought.For the most part, 'The Godfather: Part III' is a wonderful film. Gordon Willis' return as cinematographer ensured that the film remained aesthetically consistent with its predecessors, and Coppola's film-making is, for the most part, handsome and professional. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, is just as convoluted as the original film, but I'm confident that a second viewing will substantially improve my understanding of each character and their motives. Though the first few dialogue scenes seem strained, as though the actors are easing into their roles, the performances are generally excellent. Only Sofia Coppola  and I don't want to labour the point, since she's been lambasted enough  fails to construct a well-defined screen persona. She wears a peculiar scowl for most of the film, and her role in the story is vague and superficial. Nevertheless, any of the picture's weaknesses are quickly forgotten in lieu of an unforgettable climax, set amid an operatic performance of 'Cavalleria Rusticana,' perhaps the finest instance of super-prolonged suspense since the Albert Hall sequence in 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956).'",9,1,3,17 March 2009
The Fountain," 'Death is a disease. There is a cure, and I will find it.'
","After the phenomenal critical success of 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream' (neither of which I have yet had the pleasure of seeing), director Darren Aronofsky became recognised as one of the great emerging talents of the decade. His third feature-length offering, released after a six year hiatus, was 'The Fountain,' a film that has universally divided the opinions of reviewers and audiences. For example, though it was booed by many critics at its opening press screening at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, 'The Fountain' received a ten-minute standing ovation at the public showing the following evening. Not particularly knowing what to expect coming in, I must say that I quite enjoyed it. Though undoubtedly flawed in some regards, 'The Fountain' is ambitious, brilliantly-acted and stunningly beautiful; it's the sort of bold film-making that you love to see a young director try his hands at.The plot of 'The Fountain' is a blurred combination of drama, science-fiction and fantasy. Three thematically-linked narratives  respectively set in the year 1500, the present day, and somewhere around the year 2500  are interwoven throughout the film, each era featuring similar characters played by Hugh Jackman (fresh from Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige') and Rachel Weisz ('The Constant Gardener'). In the present day, Jackman plays Dr. Tommy Creo, a devoted husband who is dedicating all his time to uncovering a cure for his wife Izzi's (Weisz) terminal brain tumour. Izzi, in her final months, has been writing a novel, entitled 'The Fountain.' The novel, which she would like Tom to complete himself, traces the struggles of a 16th century Spanish conquistador, Tomas (Jackman), to discover the famed Tree of Life in the New World, a mission granted to him by his beloved Queen Isabel (Weisz). The third story, set in the far future  or perhaps merely in Tommy Creo's mind  shows astronaut Tom (Jackman again) travelling towards the golden nebula Xibalba in an ecospheric bubble spacecraft, his only companion a dying tree and occasional visits from present-day Izzi, in spirit form.If all this sounds very confusing to you, then you're not alone. 'The Fountain' really is a film that you have to think about to receive most rewarding movie experience, and multiple viewings are sure to be beneficial in understanding the intricacies of the plot and themes. The 'Conquistador' portions were certainly inspired by films such as Herzog's 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (and, reportedly, Aronofsky based his script on that of Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time in America,' which also employs a flashback structure between three different eras). Originally set to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the main roles, production of the film was ceased in September 2002 after Pitt left due to script disagreements. However, in 2004, production was restarted (with half the original budget), and Jackman and Weisz were coaxed onboard. Ellen Burstyn, the star of 'Requiem for a Dream' was also hired to appear in the film.With a relatively small budget of about $35 million, Aronofsky chose to limit his spending on visual effects as much as possible. Rather than wasting millions of dollars on lavish CGI, visual effects supervisors Jeremy Dawson and Dan Schrecker discovered macrophotography, which is the extreme close-up photography of chemicals, fluids and bacteria. Peter Parks, who specialises in such photography, explains why such a method was highly suited to the visual effects of the film: 'When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the watergravitational effects, settlement, refractive indicesare happening in outer space.' The final result is a product that generally looks convincing and timeless. However, especially in the final climactic sequence, the effects do begin to show their low-budget origins.Though Aronofsky's dialogue is perhaps a bit simplistic at times, the actors deliver it with a real passion. Hugh Jackman is particularly good during the present-day sequences, and we can only watch with despair as the impending loss of his wife begins to tear him apart from the inside. Rachel Weisz is also very good, and the two actors share a strong chemistry, never leaving us in doubt that their two characters are very much in love with each other. 'The Fountain' is an especially visual film, relying on its vibrant colours and stunning cinematography to inspire emotion. The dying golden nebula, Xibalba, towards which Jackman's astronaut travels is simply beautiful to look at, encompassing all that is beautiful and fascinating about the endless universe. Clint Mansell's score also contributes greatly to the awe-inspiring feel of the film, gradually becoming stronger and stronger in tone, before exploding in a flash of sound and energy for the heart-racing climax.At just over 90 minutes in length, 'The Fountain' is long enough to adequately get its message across, but it ultimately feels as though there could and should be more to it. In my view at least, not nearly enough of the conquistador's journey was shown to us, and, indeed, another filmmaker might even have made that single section into a fascinating feature-length film of its own. 'The Fountain' is often compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' in tone and style. Though the film itself is probably not even science-fiction  as I'm inclined to view the astronaut's journey as being metaphorical more than literal  'The Fountain' is similar to '2001' in at least one way: both films were bold and daring enough to stray from the mainstream, from what audiences are used to; time, I predict, will be very kind to this film.",8,9,16,1 July 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," 'A toast to my big brother, George: The richest man in town'
","Why is it that I get a little teary every time I watch 'It's A Wonderful Life (1946)?' The title says it all, I suppose. Despite the film's reputation as a holiday classic, Capra's film succeeds because it doesn't forget about the other eleven months of the year – it truly is about life, and what makes it wonderful. Even the most understated moments have a tendency to expose me as a romantic: in one of my favourite scenes, George Bailey (James Stewart) offers the Moon to his sweetheart, Mary (Donna Reed). Yet Capra doesn't patronise the audience with a string of happy moments. George, at first, seems like the unluckiest person in town, a man whose big dreams never came to fruition, for reasons entirely outside his control. It is Capra's miracle that George, and the audience, ultimately realise that life's greatest wonders are not necessarily those that we had anticipated – friends we never expected to make, a girl with whom we never expected to fall in loveOn a snowy Christmas Eve, George Bailey stands on a bridge in his home town of Bedford Falls, contemplating suicide. Throughout his life-time, George's grand dreams of exploration and excitement have been repeatedly stifled by tragedy and obligation, and now he sees no future except in death. God, watching from Heaven, sends down guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who tries to convince George that life is something to be treasured. 'It's a Wonderful Life' was adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's short story 'The Greatest Gift,' and carries shades of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' (indeed, Lionel Barrymore was chosen for the role of Mr. Potter based on his much-lauded radio portrayals of Scrooge from 1934). James Stewart, who had served in the U.S. Airforce during WWII, brings a painful weariness to the role of beleaguered family-man George Bailey, and the warm, soulful eyes of Donna Reed – as George's wife Mary – are enough to remind any man that life is, indeed, wonderful. 'It's A Wonderful Life' differs from 'You Can't Take It With You (1938)' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)' in that the film's central immoral character does not undergo a change of heart (though, admittedly, Jim Taylor in the latter film does remain a rigid villain, even when Senator Paine reveals a human streak). Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is one of cinema's most formidable villains, a heaving bulk of a man, confined to a wheelchair, who desires money and power for the sake of money and power. In the swelling emotion of Capra's final act, it's easy to forget that Potter goes unpunished for his moral crimes. Here, Capra deals in blacks and whites. George Bailey is a good man; Mr Potter is a bad man. The director's own unique brand of 'Capra-corn' required that the audience's sympathies never be confused, so that they can commit themselves to a character who is destined for a happy ending. After having watched 'You Can't Take It With You,' Barrymore's role- reversing characterisation is stunning.",10,1,5,30 December 2009
A Beautiful Mind," 'I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.'
","John Forbes Nash was an American mathematician, a reclusive but brilliant man who harboured his own share of mysterious demons. 'A Beautiful Mind' first finds him during an informal welcome to Princeton University, alone against the back wall, staring at his own feet. His mind off elsewhere, Nash doesn't even listen to the inspirational introductory speech, but is instead  most likely  contemplating the original mathematical theory that he believes will make him great. Of course, he hasn't formulated this theory yet, but he is so supremely confident of his brilliance that, for him, it is inevitable.Refusing to attend his classes on the basis that they will 'dull your mind' and 'destroy the potential for authentic creativity,' Nash spends much of his time in his room, gazing out at the grass courtyard below, furiously chalking on the windows to try and discover an algebraic pattern to the movements of everyday life - a flock of pigeons around scraps of bread, a makeshift football game, the chase of a man who has stolen a purse. Nash is so assuredly confident in his mind's own abilities that he has long learned to ignore the aid of those around him. Upon losing a game of Go to a fellow student, Nash tries desperately to figure out what went wrong, recalling 'I had the first move, my play was perfect,' before declaring that 'the game is flawed.'This complete dependence upon his own mind makes it even more difficult when Nash is told that he is suffering from schizophrenia. Afterall, if it is his mind itself that is the problem, how could he possibly use his own impeccable logic to solve it? Most likely, Nash decides, it is everybody else who must be wrong.Despite winning the 2000 Best Actor Oscar for 'Gladiator,' it is in this film that Russell Crowe delivers his greatest performance, announcing unquestionably to the world that he is one of the most gifted talents of his generation. Contrasting starkly with his previous character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, John Nash is shy and softly-spoken, often exhibiting a complete disregard for social conventions.With his first spoken lines, Nash insults a man's choice of necktie, before informing another fellow student that 'there's not one seminal or innovative idea' in either of his pre-prints. Unaware on how to communicate with women, Nash sometimes matter-of-factly declares to an interested female, 'I don't exactly know what I am required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me. But could we assume that I said all that,' before requesting that they cut straight to the 'fluid exchange.' This statement is often met with a nasty slap to the face.Nash initially struggles through his time at Princeton University, simply unable to inspire that 'truly original idea' that is 'the only way he will ever distinguish himself the only way he will ever matter.' He has few friends; his only true support comes from his chatty, laid-back roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany). After graduating from Princeton, Nash becomes a doctor of mathematics, but, to his disgruntlement, his duties include teaching a class. It is here that he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who is able to accept him for the man he is, but soon sets about giving him a 'beautiful heart' in addition to his 'beautiful mind.' However, Nash's world is suddenly plunged into chaos when a federal agent named Parcher (Ed Harris) approaches him to perform top-secret code-breaking work for the Department of Defense.'A Beautiful Mind' is a haunting and inspirational biopic from Ron Howard ('Apollo 13'), who gives us perhaps his greatest film to date. Adapted by Akiva Goldsman from the biography by Sylvia Nasar, this film features terrific performances from a stellar cast, including a phenomenal Russell Crowe at the top of his game. You could argue that the screenplay sometimes embellishes on the truth for dramatic effect, but this can be easily forgiven in light of the often heart-wrenching drama we witness on screen. After all, like I've always said, 'don't let the truth get in the way of a good story!'",8,0,3,18 February 2007
Psycho," 'She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.'
","June, 1960. The movie theatre is quiet; 45 minutes ago, the halls were buzzing with anticipation, but not anymore. Nobody has been allowed into the cinema since the picture began, and the audience is dead quiet. Through the walls of the theatre, one can hear the muffled whirr of running water. Silence. An indistinct shadow is seen approaching through the curtain. Accompanied by the fierce screech of violins, hundreds of voices suddenly utter a deafening chorus of horrified shock; some patrons collapse into the aisle. Bernard Hermann continues to pound the violin with extraordinary intensity, and a bloody streak carves its path towards the drainpipe. Audience members reel with a frantic mixture of stunned confusion and gripping fear. The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, has just painted the most extraordinary masterstroke of his distinguished career. The simple act of taking a shower will never again be the same.Though he produced many films that could justifiably be considered masterpieces, it is unlikely that Hitchcock ever directed anything more popular and influential than 'Psycho (1960).' The first of only two Hitchcock horror films, it shocked many with its unique narrative structure, and the infamous 'shower scene' has become permanently imprinted in the movie-going public's collective memory. Hitchcock allegedly produced the film in order to reclaim his designation as 'The Master of Suspense,' as he considered Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot to have temporarily seized the title with 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and especially 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' Interestingly, the latter film has a particularly alarming bathtub sequence, and perhaps 'Psycho' was the film through which Hitchcock was able to respond to (and improve upon) the achievements of his chief rival. Gone are the larger-than-life artistic flourishes of 'Vertigo (1958)' and 'North by Northwest (1959)'  this is the Master of Suspense at his leanest and meanest, a film completely stripped of its spectacle and lowered into the unfathomable depths of the disturbed human mind.Adapted by Joseph Stefano and Samuel A. Taylor from a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' opens with the character of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real-estate secretary who impulsively steals $40,000 from her boss and flees in the direction of her California boyfriend. Her cross-country flight ultimately leads her to the Bates Motel, managed by the awkward and mild-mannered Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a man who submits loyally to the wishes of his mentally-ill, domineering mother. Meanwhile, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and sister Lila (Vera Miles) set out in pursuit, their search ending  inevitably  at the Bates motel. The story sporadically shifts from one character to the other; after convincing audiences that Marion Crane is 'the wrong man' of so many of his previous pictures, Hitchcock deftly strikes at the heart of their sympathies. In his early film 'Sabotage (1936),' the director had condemned his own decision to murder a character with whom the viewer had been asked to identify, though here he once again dared to break his own rules, and we've never forgotten it.Paramount was so aghast at the story's graphic subject matter, labelling it 'too repulsive,' that Hitchcock's budget was severely restricted, and the director was forced to finance the film through his own Shamley Productions. These budget limitations proved crucial in developing the unforgettable atmosphere, and were a major factor in his decision to film is black-and-white (which he also did to avoid incurring the wrath of the censors). Though 'Psycho' received a mixed critical response upon its release, its commercial success was extraordinary, and film-goers lined entire city blocks to experience the director's latest. Conversely, fellow British director Michael Powell's thematically-similar 'Peeping Tom (1960)' had been severely trashed by critics and audiences alike just months earlier, and the career of the beloved filmmaker was, for all practical purposes, left in ruins. Furthermore, the success of 'Psycho' triggered the emergence of the 'slasher' flick, and subsequent years saw a slew of inferior, gory and imaginatively-titled knock-offs, such as 'Maniac (1963),' 'Paranoic (1963)' and 'Fanatic (1965).'Though discussions of 'Psycho' rarely stray from the film's more disturbing moments, it's interesting to consider the various crucial scenes of human interaction. Marion's supper with Norman in the parlour room, surrounded by the seemingly-passive but strangely-threatening stuffed birds, is a masterpiece of nervous tension, awkwardness, and the tiny inflections of human speech that communicate more than mere words ever could. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates to quirky perfection, and his character {perhaps modelled from Dennis Weaver's jittery hotel night manager in 'Touch of Evil (1958)'  also starring Janet Leigh} is a man who initially demands our pity and understanding. Even after the atrocity in the shower, Hitchcock, as he also did in 'Frenzy (1972),' builds a suspense sequence around a villain's attempts to conceal the traces of his crime. Martin Balsam is rarely mentioned when discussing the film, but his characterisation of detective Milton Arbogast is letter-perfect, his shrewd but amenable tone successfully lulling Norman into a false sense of triumph, and yet the audience knows full well that the experienced investigator sees the transparency of his lies.Despite the prevalence of cultural spoofs and references, 'Psycho' is a thriller that still holds up exceptionally well, even though most viewers are fully-aware of the first major twist. When I first watched the film several years ago, I was completely ignorant of Mother's true identity, and I gasped aloud at the revelation in the fruit cellar, the swinging lightbulb casting a shifting luminance on the rotting corpse of Norma Bates, as Bernard Herrmann's intense, imaginative and very memorable musical score screeches in the background. Few moments in cinema have succeeded in giving me the same icy chill as the image of Norman in the prison cell, consumed by the mental consciousness of his overbearing mother, and that sinister smile that fades subliminally into the decaying shadow of a human skull. Norman Bates will continue to live on in my nightmares.",10,0,1,16 May 2008
War of the Worlds," 'Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes'
","In 1964, at age 18, Steven Spielberg premiered his feature-length debut, 'Firelight.' The film ran for 140 minutes, and depicted a hostile UFO attack on a small American town. As such, it was only a matter of time before the benevolent extraterrestrial beings of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)' and 'E.T. (1982)' began blasting people with lasers. I remember first seeing 'War of the Worlds (2005)' in cinemas, and the special effects really blew me away, a full-blown assault on the senses. Aside from the bookends (narrated by the commanding voice of Morgan Freeman), Spielberg basically does away with H.G. Wells' original novel, though there are still a few nice touches, like the red alien weed that keeps cropping up all over the place. I also liked how the film narrowed its focus to one family's experiences, with Tom Cruise spending most of his screen-time avoiding heroism and instead just trying to stay alive.However, even in the cinema, the film's flaws were apparent. The two young actors playing Cruise's children, Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin, are an unwelcome distraction. The former spends minutes on end screaming shrilly or asking annoyingly-persistent questions, such that I occasionally did wish for her demise, whereas the latter fronted every scene with an expression of faux teen-angst. In a sickly-sweet ending that feels like an afterthought, the older child reveals his survival, apparently for no other reason than to affect a happy family reunion. Wells' original ending, the definitive Deus Ex Machina, is a difficult one to sell to today's cynical audiences, and Spielberg doesn't quite pull it off. In particular, Cruise's character briefly and inexplicably becomes an action hero in the final act, an unfortunate tarnish on what I otherwise found to be a sincere and authentic performance.Yet the film's merits outweigh its flaws. Spielberg's mastery of atmosphere is evident in every scene, often the result of the smallest details: the wind blowing towards an ominous storm, lightning striking the same place twice; Tom Cruise smothered in white dust; an endless wall lined with the photographs of missing family members. There's a wonderful scene where a weary crowd of vagrants turns into a violent mob at the sight of a working car. This sort of inexplicable barbarism reminded me of another tense post-apocalyptic drama, Ray Milland's 'Panic in Year Zero! (1962).' Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' probably also tops Byron Haskin's 1953 adaptation, which had excellent special effects but faltered in its final act – when, with no small amount of religious symbolism, the aliens are stopped outside the walls of a church. Spielberg had no such religious sentimentality. In his version, the church is the first building to crumble.",7,1,3,7 March 2010
All Quiet on the Western Front," 'When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all.'
","Based upon Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel of the same name ('Im Westen nichts Neues,' in German), Lewis Milestone's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' stands as one of the first great war films, a powerful condemnation of human war and conflict and only the third recipient of the now universally sought-after Academy Award for Best Picture. A vividly realistic account of the effects of War World One on young soldiers, the film also boasts some solid acting, grueling cinematography and an unforgettable message, highlighting so poignantly the sheer folly of war.Perhaps the most curious thing about this film is that, despite being an American production, it follows the misfortunes of a young group of German soldiers. All our German characters speak in fluent English with crisp American accents, though this significant lapse in historical accuracy is extremely effective in allowing us to forget that these men are, after all, the perceived 'enemy side' in WWI, enlisting our sympathy towards their plight. No longer is the German army portrayed as a mass of faceless, babbling, immoral evil-doers, but each man feels pain, sadness and terror just like any other person would. In this case, it is the English Army who is reduced to becoming the faceless enemy, though the filmmakers stop well short of condemning their actions. In many scenes, it is made irrefutably clear that, with the exception of the politics of their respective governments, there is little difference between the soldiers of either side. Indeed, remove their uniforms, and two opposing soldiers could conceivably become the best of friends. Many of these soldiers are young and scared; many have wives, children, families to come home to; many will ultimately never return from combat.Particularly poignant is the film's conclusion, as the story's main protagonist, Paul Bäumer (Lew Ayres), is fatally shot whilst reaching towards a quivering butterfly, his outstretched hand falling limp just centimetres from the only remaining thing of beauty in the sullied war zone. This final scene was different from the ending in the book, and, indeed, so late was the decision to shoot it that the director himself was forced to double his own hand as Paul's. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' is considered exceptionally graphic for its era, and the Milestone, in order to illustrate the full horrors of war, did not shy away from including brief glimpses of lifeless bodies and severed limbs.Perhaps a bit melodramatic at times, and not always riveting to watch (some sequences move a bit slowly), Lewis Milestone's classic war film is, nonetheless, not an experience that you are likely to forget anytime soon. Indeed, war is hell, but too often we simply forget that war was hell for the other side, as well...",8,7,10,19 May 2007
There Will Be Blood," 'There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.'
","For several decades at the turn of the twentieth century, oil was the life-blood of the United States of America. Ordinary men became millionaires practically overnight, and thriving towns sprung up wherever an ocean of oil was discovered underground. Then again, many men failed in all attempts to achieve wealth through oil drilling, and countless lost their lives in the feverish pursuit of 'black gold.' Though the period, in the decades before the Great Depression would bring an entire world to its knees, proved a particularly prosperous time for America, it is also marked by significant incidents of corruption, bribery and betrayal. My first film from director Paul Thomas Anderson {who has previously achieved success with 'Boogie Nights (1997),' 'Magnolia (1999)' and 'Punch-Drunk Love (2002)'} is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, 'Oil!' An exceptional epic, a grand and sweeping saga of the early years of the oil business, 'There Will Be Blood (2007)' traces the fortunes of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an charismatic prospector who achieves enormous wealth despite (or perhaps thanks to) his disdain for the human race.Daniel Day-Lewis, an actor whose dedication to his roles has become legendary, is absolutely superb in the starring role, bringing an incredible intensity to Plainview that simply demands your complete and utter attention. The audience hangs onto his every word with an awed hush; when Daniel Plainview is speaking, you know that he means what he says. Throughout his harsh life, he has always expressed unbridled contempt for the people around him; when we first meet Plainview, he is mining alone for silver, his distrust of others even then driving him towards solitude. When necessity forces him to hire additional workers, a horrific drilling accident leaves an infant orphaned, and so Plainview decides to adopt young H.W. (Dillon Freasier, Russell Harvard as an adult) as his own. At first, we consider this to be an uncharacteristic act of kindness, perhaps evidence of a streak of humanity that lurks far within. However, time soon reveals Plainview's scheme, and the unfortunate H.W. finds himself to be little more than a prop, a fresh young family face to be used to underline his father's business propositions.Another prevalent theme of the film is the hypocrisy of religion. Paul Dano is excellent as Eli Sunday, a local faith-healer for the Church of the Third Revelation. Throughout the film, we are influenced into regarded Eli and Plainview as two opposing entities  namely, as Good versus Evil. However, by the end of the film, the former is shown to be as corrupt and dishonest as any other man. Plainview has long disregarded all religion as superstition, but agrees to participate in a humiliating initiation ceremony in order to secure the leasing rights to an old man's (Hans Howes) tract of land. This demonstration first highlights Eli's underlying streak of depravity, but all is exposed in the Wall Street stock-market crash of 1929, when Plainview sadistically taunts Eli into denouncing himself as a 'false prophet' and his God as 'a superstition.' In a highly unorthodox but exceedingly fascinating conclusion, a drunken Plainview bludgeons Eli to death with a bowling pin, the faith-healer effectively, though inadvertently, martyring himself in order to punish the sins that have gone unpunished for so very long.'There Will Be Blood' is brimming with astonishing set-pieces, most memorably the 'blow-out' of oil from the Little Boston well, and the subsequent oil fire. We do, indeed, detect another momentary streak of paternal humanity in Plainview's frenzied scurry to rescue his permanently-deafened son, both covered from head-to-toe in black veins of oil, though this swiftly dissipates as he abandons his son to tend to the flaming well. P.T. Anderson is known for his bold and unique cinematic style, and his latest film won't appeal to all audiences {my three friends afterward described the film as, respectively, 'good,' 'all right' and 'terrible'}, but the expertise with which the film is produced is undeniable. At tomorrow's Academy Awards, I would not be surprised if 'There Will Be Blood' takes out the Best Picture honours, even if {having seen four of the five nominees} my fingers are crossed for a Coen brothers' win.",8,3,6,24 February 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," 'You never really understand a person... until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it'
","'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' has stayed with me since the time I first saw it, perhaps because the film caught me at an impressionable age. This was in 2004, not a particularly long time ago, but it feels an age away. High school greets you at a young, idealistic age, when the world sits at your fingertips just waiting for you to take it. Having just read Harper Lee's Pullitzer Prize-winning novel in English class, we followed it with Robert Mulligan's film adaptation, which scored an Oscar for Gregory Pick and would have won Best Picture had David Lean not hustled in with his masterpiece. Even when lamentably broken up into fifty-minute intervals, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' left me captivated by its magic – and, yes, there is magic. Though typically celebrated as a statement on racial prejudice in the American South, the true core of both Lee's novel and Mulligan's film is distanced from Tom Robinson's rape trial, and lies in terrible, wonderful and beautiful experience of growing up.The film, as in Lee's novel, is told through the eyes of Scout Finch (Mary Badham; voiced by Kim Stanley as an adult), the tomboyish daughter of small-town lawyer Atticus (Gregory Peck) and younger sister of Jem (Phillip Alford). Along with visiting neighbour Dill (John Megna), the two siblings whittle away their summers obsessing over local recluse 'Boo' Radley, an agoraphobic, mentally-ill man towards whom the children develop both a fear and fascination. Meanwhile, Atticus is appointed to defend an African American (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman, and his determination to give the man a fair trial leads to heated racial tensions in the bigoted Southern township. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' follows Jem and Scout as they go about the processes of growing up, learning of the bitter immorality and prejudice that lurks beyond the security of their home. Ironically, the film is weakest during its narrative crux – Tom Robinson's courtroom trial – as Mulligan strains to keep the story focused around the children, though Peck's virtuous performance compensates for the lapse.I've never quite been able to put my fingers around why 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is, to me, such an emotionally-draining (and fulfilling) picture. Perhaps it's Elmer Bernstein's musical score, sad and wistful, like the lamentation of a fairy-tale punctuated by reality. Childhood itself is not unlike a fairy-tale, a time of infallible ideals and black-and-white ethics. Mulligan justly celebrates the steadfast moral courage of Atticus Finch, but the overriding emotion at Tom Robinson's sentencing is instead one of sinking disillusionment: while Scout watches on, uncomprehending, Jem buries his head in his arms, his childish conviction in the goodness of adults irreparably shattered. Yet, even then, hope survives for those who, like the Finch family, preserve their moral integrity. The film's fairy-tale mood, at times reminiscent of Laughton's 'The Night of the Hunter (1957),' is enforced most strongly in the children's' final walk through the forest, described as their 'longest journey together.' Arthur 'Boo' Radley, a mockingbird who might have been destroyed by less sympathetic souls, ultimately becomes their saviour.",10,0,1,28 July 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of cricket!'
","Nobody could craft an epic film better than David Lean, as I learned earlier this year when I watched the magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' for the first time. Though he had achieved earlier success with such films as 'Brief Encounter (1945)' and 'Great Expectations (1946),' 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' was the first of Lean's multi-million dollar wide-screen spectaculars, for which he is now most fondly remembered. Shot on location in the jungles of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the film concerns the building of a railway bridge by Allied prisoners-of-war during World War Two. As it becomes less and less likely that the bridge will be constructed before the deadline, conflict escalates between the proud British leader, Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and hot-tempered Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). The film proved very successful at the 1958 Oscars, taking home seven awards (including Best Picture) from eight nominations.Whilst William Holden's cynical, hard-edged American was likely considered the main star attraction, the film's most memorable character  and, indeed, one of the greatest in cinema history  is Alec Guiness' Col. Nicholson. The embodiment of British courage and dedication, Nicholson finds himself in a battle of wills with the ruthless Col. Saito, who, despite representing the enemy, nonetheless exhibits many of the same qualities: egotistical pride, obstinacy and unwillingness to compromise. For Col. Nicholson, the construction of the railway bridge becomes something of an obsession, its completion symbolic of 'Western methods and efficiency that will put {the Japanese} to shame' and the culmination of his 28 years in the military. When he uncovers the plot to destroy the bridge, Nicholson betrays his fellow countrymen to the Japanese, his narcissistic pride in the landmark prompting him to neglect his sworn duty to Britain.I'd like to take some time to consider the film's climax, undoubtedly one of the most awe-inspiring cinema spectacles of all time. I had initially anticipated that, after the intricate task of planting the explosives overnight, the detonation of the bridge would be a rather straightforward task. However, David Lean weaves so much action and suspense into the finale that the closing credits left me reeling. As the distant rumble of a train announces its impending arrival, Col. Nicholson notices that the reduction in river-level has exposed the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. Not yet comprehending the situation, he summons Col. Saito and they both descend to the riverside to investigate. Once his fears are confirmed, Nicholson  to his subsequent dismay  attempts to thwart his army's attempt to destroy the enemy bridge, and both Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) and Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) are fatally shot.Interestingly, there have been suggestions that Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkins) fired the lethal shots at his own comrades, abandoning the mission objective in an attempt to prevent their live capture by the merciless Japanese. Whilst this isn't explicitly shown in the film itself, it reportedly corresponds with Pierre Boulle's original novel (in which, notably, the bridge is not destroyed) and would certainly explain why, afterwards, Warden tries to rationalise his actions: 'I had to do it. I had to do it. They might have been captured alive. It was the only thing to do.' Alternatively, Warden didn't shoot them, but is attempting to justify his use of the mortars, which basically obliterated any slim remaining chances on their survival. Meanwhile, Nicholson, struck by shrapnel from a mortar attack, crumbles hopelessly onto the detonator (either intentionally or inadvertently) just as the train begins to cross the river. The actual collapse of the $250,000 bridge, a shot which owes a lot to Buster Keaton and 'The General (1927)', is an amazing spectacle, and Maj. Clipton (James Donald) sums up the entire climax - and war in general - with his horrified exclamation of 'Madness! Madness!'",9,3,5,24 September 2007
A Hard Day's Night," An Enjoyable Little Film From The Beatles
","I've never really been a fan of the Beatles. This is not to say that I don't enjoy their music, but I'd simply never been exposed to much of it. However, in the past year, I'd started to listen to many of their songs, and I instantly understood why they were so popular. Back in 1964, the band's growing popularity had spawned numerous best-selling albums, and the next step was a natural one - a Beatles movie. And so 'A Hard Day's Night' was born.This modest-budgeted 1964 black-and-white film allegedly documents a 'typical' day in the life of the Beatles. Whilst I'm aware that much of it was greatly exaggerated and dramatised for its portrayal on screen, I'm fairly certain that one thing has remained fairly accurate - the vast hoards of incessantly screaming teenage female fans who flock around the four performers, either during performances or in public. At the height of Beatlemania, I wouldn't be surprised if such scenes actually occurred on a regular basis.The four young actors of the band, who I, quite obviously, don't need to name, are not the most talented of actors, but they perform adequately. The screenplay simply calls for them to act as themselves, and this they do quite well. Norman Rossington is good as Norm - the Beatles' manager - and Wilfrid Brambell is hilarious as Paul McCartney's 'other grandfather,' who has joined the band's travels for a 'change of scenery.' 'A Hard Day's Life' is an interesting little film, full of moments of joy and laughter and drama - and let us not forget the excellent soundtrack of (you guessed it) Beatles songs! It is not, in any real way, a groundbreaking film, though I've heard that the performance scenes greatly influenced how music videos were filmed at the time.However, if, like me, you were unfortunate enough to have missed out on the 1960s, and you've been wondering why the Beatles were as big as they were, this is your definitive answer!",7,3,5,10 January 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Of The Greatest Films Of All Time!
","R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been jailed for six months following charges of assault and statutory rape. In order to escape forced labour at the 'work farm,' McMurphy feigns insanity, and finds himself transferred to a mental institution, under the watchful eye of the cold, domineering head nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher).'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is one of the most highly-acclaimed films of the century. The film garnered five Academy Awards from nine nominations, becoming only the second of three films to secure the top five awards on the night (the other two being 'It Happened One Night' (1934) and 'The Silence Of The Lambs' (1991)).Based on Ken Kesey's classic 1962 novel of the same name, this stunningly-acted film launched the careers of countless up-and-coming actors. Aside from securing the first of Jack Nicholson's three Oscar statuettes, after being nominated four times previously, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' also proved a successful stepping stone for Christopher Lloyd ('Back To The Future', 1985), Danny DeVito ('Twins', 1988) and horror staple Brad Dourif ('Child's Play', 1988).A terrific film, and one of the greatest ever made!",10,0,2,5 November 2006
American Gangster," There are two sides to the American dream
","There is one sequence in 'American Gangster (2007),' a very simple choice of editing, that perfectly captures the ever-expanding rift between crime and honesty. On the one hand, Frank Lucas spends his Thanksgiving with his family, in a warm, loving atmosphere with a delicious turkey sitting at their bloated dinner table. On the other hand, Richie Roberts spends the day at his empty apartment, his family having deserted him, cramming a few meagre morsels between two slices of bread. In an ideal world, it would be the dishonest criminal who is subjected to the latter scenario, a fitting reward for a lifetime of breaking the law and destroying innocent lives. However, reality has a bitter sense of irony: Frank Lucas, in fact, is a drug-dealer, one of the most powerful men in New York, and made wealthy through his substantial illegal dealings in heroin. New Jersey narcotics detective Richie Roberts is a straight arrow, a beacon of honesty in a law enforcement agency infested with corruption, and this lonely Thanksgiving snack is his punishment for a lifetime of unwavering dedication.'American Gangster,' the latest film from director Ridley Scott, was based on a true story, adapted from Mark Jacobson's 'New York' magazine story, entitled 'The Return of Superfly.' Frank Lucas is very much a real person {though I'm not sure to what extent writer Steven Zaillian took dramatic license with the events}, an African American who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the country's most powerful drug lords. From our very first glimpse of the man, we understand that he is not the sort of person you'd want to disappoint, and yet, channelled through Denzel Washington's acting abilities, he has an irresistible charm about him. If it were not for the illicit and lethal nature of his business, Frank Lucas might be considered a model American: a patriotic citizen, an ingenious capitalist businessman, and a dedicated family man. When the times become tough, he hands out food supplies to the needy Harlem people, and, every Sunday without fail, he accompanies his elderly mother to Church. Are these the actions of a bad man?In playing detective Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe matches his co-star step for step. Though the characters do not actually meet until the end of the film {and, indeed, neither have even heard of the other until a fair way in}, there is a raw intensity to the cat-and-mouse game that they are both playing, and Ridley Scott enjoys creating stark contrasts between the two morally-conflicting characters. As far as human beings go, Detective Roberts isn't the most saintly man you're likely to come across. A neglectful father and husband, he regularly fraternises with criminal types, remnants from his unprivileged upbringing. However, Roberts, perhaps to compensate for his personal shortcomings, is deadly honest, a law enforcer who  to the incredulousness of his corrupt colleagues  uncovered $1 million in unmarked cash in the boot of a car, and actually handed it in. An interesting side-note at the close of the film proves dryly amusing, if very disconcerting: thanks to the co-operation of Frank Lucas following his capture, large numbers of law officers were found guilty of corruption, including three quarters of the special drug enforcement squad.Though it runs for just under 160 minutes, 'American Gangster' moves along at a consistent pace, allowing for a lot of character and plot development, without ever getting bogged down with the details. The two leading players are, of course, excellent {and should be in contention come Oscar time}, and Josh Brolin also gives a strong supporting performance as Detective Trupo, a narcotics detective with a habit of using bullying tactics and accepting bribes. The one complaint I have with the film concerns its moral compass, as Scott expects us to sympathise with and admire Frank Lucas, as though it is acceptable to forget the death and misery that he caused to thousands of innocent victims. The closing intertitles also neglect to mention that, following his initial release from prison in 1981 {after serving a paltry five or so years}, he was again arrested and convicted in 1984 for further drug and parole violation charges. But, then again, I don't know what the man was like in real life perhaps he was a man whose capitalist skill ought to be admired, if only he'd directed his efforts towards a less despicable business.",8,1,3,11 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," 'This may sound like gibberish to you, but I think I'm in a tragedy'
","Charlie Kaufman is a name that is sure to come up whenever anybody discusses 'Stranger than Fiction (2006).' The screenwriter had absolutely nothing to do with this film, but the plot is so reminiscent of 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' and 'Adaptation (2002)' that either his works were an influence on writer Zach Helm, or the two received their inspiration from a common source. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an auditor with the IRS, a position that doesn't afford him the luxury of having many friends. He spends his life immersed in numbers, mathematics, routine and regulations. However, one morning Harold begins to hear a woman's voice inside his head, narrating his every thought and action. Though the people around him attribute the voice to schizophrenia, Harold comes to suspect that he is actually a fictional character, his future dictated by the omniscient author inside his head, and so he seeks the advice of a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). 'Stranger than Fiction' is one of those rare examples of a fresh and original movie idea that redeems your faith in Hollywood's ability to think up something new. Whatever his influences, first-time screenwriter Zach Helm has penned a fun, thoughtful and meaningful script that plays about with a complex abstract idea in a way that is easily followed by the viewer. Director Marc Forster seems to have dabbled in a selection of different genres in the past {he followed 'Monster's Ball (2001)' with 'Finding Neverland (2004)'}, and here he brings together a variety of different emotions, creating a comfortable balance of comedy, romance and tragedy. 'Stranger than Fiction' also has a pleasant visual style, and computer graphics are used cleverly to demonstrate Harold's tendency to count everything he sees, as well as his lifestyle's dependence upon clockwork timing in everything he does.I've always been a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy work, and nobody can match his talent for throwing a hissy fit. However, here he gives a remarkably restrained performance, playing Harold Crick as quiet, shy and sensitive, quite apart from anything else I've ever seen him do. It goes without saying that Dustin Hoffman is one of the acting greats of his generation, and, though his role in this film is rather low-key, there's no denying his flawless comedic timing, as well as that perfectly gutting moment when Hilbert bluntly informs Harold: 'you have to die; it's a masterpiece.' Emma Thompson is also excellent as Karen Eiffel, a famous tragedy author and, incidentally, Harold's narrator, well-known for killing off her 'fictional' protagonists in unique and poetic ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also notable as Ana Pascal, a tax-evading baker who falls in love with Harold and helps show him the joy of life.All great stories must possess a similarly great ending, and unfortunately this is the one facet of 'Stranger than Fiction' that I am in two minds about. The film undoubtedly chose to take the more crowd-pleasing route, betraying the film as a comedy rather than a tragedy, with author Karen Eiffel deciding that a selfless man's life is too much price to pay for a literary masterpiece. One can admire her sentiment, and the positive message that the film is trying to make, but there's no denying that the finale loses much of its potency once the happy ending comes into play. Even more bafflingly, the filmmakers seem well aware that this is the case, with Hoffman's character declaring that Eiffel's revised ending is 'OK' rather than the flawlessness that he had read earlier. Perhaps it's just the film-lover in me, but I was devastated that the perfect ending had gone begging, and would gladly have accepted it in exchange for Harold Crick's life. But, then again, what if Harold Crick had been a real person?",8,0,0,19 November 2007
The Green Mile," 'We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile seems so long'
","Every so often, a film comes along that somehow manages to worm its way into your heart, and then stays with you for years afterward. For this staunch atheist, that film inexplicably happened to be a Christ allegory, the poignant story of a miracle-man on death-row during the Great Depression. Director Frank Darabont, who impossibly followed up his debut 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' with something even better, is remarkable in his ability to evoke time and place, and to tell a story with a wistful nostalgia that incorporates the audience into its intimacy. Every character  even the minor supporting players  is perfectly drawn, as though we've known them our whole lives; now mere memories in the near-forgotten past. The 1935 setting emphasises the contrast between the general and widespread despair of the Depression, which had brought the entire developed world to its knees, with the arrival on death-row of John Coffey, an immense, mild-mannered African American with a special gift.Like Darabont's previous film, 'The Green Mile (1999)' was adapted from an excellent story by horror icon Stephen King, this one originally released as a collection of novellas. Former prison-guard Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) awakens from bad dreams to find himself in a nursing home that closely resembles the psychiatric ward in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).' Paul seeks solitude in the vast green hills surrounding the home, but the demons of his past inevitably return to haunt him, and he breaks down in tears at the sight of Fred and Ginger dancing cheek-to-cheek in 'Top Hat (1935).' Slowly and painfully, Paul recounts the events that changed his life in 1935, when a gentle Black giant named John Coffey ('like the drink, only not spelt the same') arrived on the lime-coloured tiles of the Green Mile to pay his due to society, for the vile murder of two young girls. For Paul (now played by Tom Hanks), everything he thinks he knows about life and God suddenly takes an unexpected, miraculous and even frightening turn.It's one thing to have an ensemble of well-written characters, but the task of credibly communicating each personality ultimately comes down to the actors. Simply put, everybody in 'The Green Mile'  both the seasoned veterans and the emerging talents  delivers with a professionalism and sincerity rarely seen in today's big-budget pictures. Tom Hanks, as always, is strong in the lead role, possessing enough honest charm to make Edgecomb strong yet identifiable to the audience. Michael Clarke Duncan, in the role of his career, deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his role as John Coffey, a slow but earnest giant (probably inspired, in part, by John Steinbeck's Lennie Small) who, despite his sheer goodness, has become disillusioned by the corruption of our world. If Coffey is an allegory for Jesus Christ, then Sam Rockwell  as 'Wild Bill' Wharton  is the film's representation of the Devil, a deranged youth whose only purpose in life is to wreak chaos on those around him. It's a telling sign that we frequently enjoy a chuckle at his mean-spirited (but admittedly creative) misdemeanours.I want to dedicate a paragraph to Doug Hutchison as Percy Whetmore, simply because his supporting performance is one of the most extraordinary I've ever seen, and certainly among the most underrated in recent memory. Hutchison, an unknown actor  except to fans of 'The X-Files'  goes beyond being a straightforward villain, absolutely relishing the detestable guise of an erratic young prison guard with connections in high places. Smug, slimy and impulsive, Percy is a dangerous man to have around death-row, all the more so because he's as stupid as he is influential. Unlike Wild Bill, with whom the audience forms some sort of morbid connection, Percy is loathsome in every sense of the word, the only character since Nurse Ratched that I've genuinely want to wring about the neck. In his excellence, Hutchison is joined by an impeccable supporting cast, which is worth mentioning in its entirety: David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, Bonnie Hunt, Patricia Clarkson and, always a treat, Harry Dean Stanton.King's original novel included a heartbreaking epilogue in which Paul watches his wife die in a road accident, as the immense black shadow of a recognisable man looms chillingly in the distance, an ominous reminder of Paul's sins. In the film, Darabont alludes only briefly to Jan's (Bonnie Hunt) death, but he strikes a similar note of melancholy as Paul reflects on the friends and family whom he has been forced to outlive as 'punishment' for executing one of God's miracles. When Paul unaffectedly remarks to his audience, Elaine (Eve Brent), that she, too, will die in due course, the utter loneliness of his predicament truly hits home, and our fascination at his longevity is swiftly replaced with a gutting hollowness. Though Thomas Newman's score is suitably emotional, the most powerful moments are those accompanied by the nostalgic tunes of the era. The sheer blind optimism of 'Cheek to Cheek' and 'Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?' is heartbreaking when set against the hopelessness and despair of death-row and the Great Depression. Now I can't watch 'Top Hat' without getting a little teary.",10,0,2,29 October 2008
Ray," 'Man, you told me if I think pennies, I get pennies. I'm thinking dollars, man.'
","On June 10 2004, America lost one of its most beloved music performers, a pioneering pianist and soul musician who thrilled the world with his own original style of rhythm and blues, country and pop. Frank Sinatra once called him 'the only true genius in the business.' He passed away just days after the first rough screening of Taylor Hackford's new biopic about his extraordinary life. This man's name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but you know him best as the incomparable Ray Charles.Raised by his poor but determined single mother, Ray suffered the unimaginable trauma of watching his younger brother drown in a washtub, an incident for which he blames himself. If this wasn't debilitating enough, Ray contracted glaucoma at the age of seven, eventually losing his sight. Both his mother and father (who had three separate families) passed away in his teenage years, and he also suffered the prejudices of Jim Crow racism. However, despite being blind, Ray develops a love for music, and dedicates himself towards becoming the biggest musical talent in the country. However, the road to stardom is not an easy one  and, at times, his weakness for heroin and women threatened to ruin his career and his life.First and foremost, the casting of Jamie Foxx ('Collateral,' 2004) was a stroke of sheer genius. Of course, this is to be expected, since it was Ray Charles himself who approved of the decision. In a role that very deservedly earned him a Best Actor Oscar, Foxx is a near-splitting image of the famed performer, mimicking his appearance and mannerisms to the letter. Foxx is also extremely convincing as a blind character (apparently, for up to 14 hours a day during shooting, he was forced to wear eye prosthetics that really did make him blind). And, to top it all off, Foxx is brilliant pianist  a quality that Charles demanded of the actor who would portray him.'Ray' is the story of one determined man's meteoric rise to international stardom, and of the successful defeat of his own personal demons. And, of course, the popular Ray Charles hits played throughout the film are terrific fun to listen to!",7,0,1,11 February 2007
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Magic Mirror, on the wall, which animated feature film is the greatest one of all?
","Contrary to common belief, Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is not the earliest feature-length animated film. This title goes to Quirino Cristiani's now-lost 1917 Argentinian film, ''El Apóstol / The Apostle.' Even as far as current availability in concerned, you can turn towards Lotte Reiniger's 'The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)' for a brilliant animated film, featuring endearing silhouette animation and an exciting tale of heroes, villains and monsters. Released in 1937, 'Snow White' was Disney's first feature-length effort, as well as the first technicolour animated movie, and also briefly the most successful film of all time (until the release of 'Gone with the Wind' in 1939). After the excellent 'Fantasia (1940),' this was the second feature-length film I'd seen from Disney's early era, and I was instantly able to appreciate why it is so revered. One can only imagine how much effort must have gone into the 83 minutes of animation, and, despite this relatively brief running time, the film manages to flesh out so many wonderful characters and effectively evoke a range of emotions.The story is roughly based upon the German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm. A beautiful and wicked Queen (voiced by Lucille La Verne) learns one day, through her Magic Mirror, that her stepdaughter  the beautiful Snow White (Adriana Caselotti)  has surpassed her in beauty. Enraged, the Queen orders the princess murdered, but the kind-hearted servant cannot bring himself to commit the act. Abandoned in the forest, Snow White is aided by the gentle animals of the forest, and she stumbles upon the modest dwelling of a group of seven dwarfs, respectively named Doc, Dopey, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy and Bashful, each with a personality that mirrors their own titles. Though initially hesitant about having a woman in their home, the little men eventually come to appreciate her presence, and all is going well until the Queen learns of her servant's disloyalty, and so crafts a new and terrible revenge for the sweet and innocent Snow White.Visually, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' is nothing short of a masterpiece. Compared to the primitive cut-out silhouettes of 'The Adventures of Princess Achmed' just a decade earlier, the animation in this film is nothing short of staggering; every single frame is simply alive with vibrant colour and movement. In fact, the film proved such a monumental advance in the field of animation that it took until the arrival of Pixar Studios and CGI before anybody truly progressed beyond what had been achieved here. Colour is used magnificently to create intense moods, and the chasing of the Queen (transformed into a witch) through a raging thunderstorm is an absolute triumph of film-making, equal to anything produced before or since. Notably, a flawless 1937 Silly Symphonies short, 'The Old Mill,' served as an essential testing ground for many of the techniques used in 'Snow White,' including the animation of animals, rain, wind, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections. Additionally, 'The Old Mill' also served as the trial-run for Disney's revolutionary multiplane camera, which was also used to remarkable effect here.",9,1,1,7 October 2007
Inception," 'An elegant solution for keeping track of reality'
","Inception (2010) Christopher Nolan has often explored the relationship between human perception and reality. 'Memento (2000)' was told backwards, forcing the viewer to rely upon the damaged first-person memory of its amnesiac protagonist. 'The Prestige (2006)' concerned misdirection and trickery, highlighting the role of the movie director as a magician, a shyster, a charlatan, deftly blurring the line between what the viewer is shown, and what actually is. Even 'Batman Begins (2004),' via the Scarecrow's creepy hallucinogenic toxin, hinted at how the human mind could unwittingly distort one's perception of reality. 'Inception (2010)' once again brings Nolan into familiar territory, an action film dripping with metaphysical philosophy: what is a dream? Why do we dream? And are you dreaming right now?Philip K. Dick succinctly described reality as 'that which, when you stop believing it, doesn't go away.' Our dreams are manufactured realities that seem every bit as expansive and convincing as our everyday lives, namely because the brain shuts off the segment of our brains responsible for logic (indeed, in one dream, I've walked through my front door, come out into a football stadium, and thought nothing of it). Who's to know whether or not I'll wake up in 70 years time, laugh to myself, and think 'blue skies? How absurd!' Shifting levels of consciousness have become common fodder in science-fiction (see, for example, 'Dark City (1998)' and 'The Matrix (1999),' but here I loved how Nolan twisted and warped the fabric of his cinematic universe like an Escher lithograph. Buildings leans and distorts; gravity shifts or disappears; in one particularly magnificent sequence, the Paris skyline seems to fold in upon itself, encapsulating 'reality' into a self-contained cube.",8,3,10,28 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," 'In another life, Mr Holmes, you would have made a great criminal'
","I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan; not quite enough to be a Baker Street Irregular, but I consider Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories to be among the best entertainment that literature has to offer, and Holmes to be one of the medium's most memorable creations. Upon hearing that Guy Ritchie would helm the latest Sherlock Holmes adaptation, my first reaction was that of trepidation. Though I did enjoy 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' and 'Snatch (2000),' I couldn't quite see Ritchie's style being suitable for the material. My concerns were well- grounded, but overstated. 'Sherlock Holmes (2009)' has extremely little to do with Conan Doyle's original prose, but, considered simply as an action movie set in the nineteenth century, the film manages to be a lot of fun. After all, Holmes has seen worse injustices bestowed upon him: let's not forget that Basil Rathbone's Universal films were set in the modern day, and recast Holmes as a Nazi-fighting spy!The year is 1891, and London lives in fear. Aristocrat Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) has been murdering women in grotesque rituals of human sacrifice. Even following his capture by Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Dr Watson (Jude Law), the sinister Blackwood pledges to return, even after death, to continue his work. Uncharacteristically for a Sherlock Holmes story, Ritchie's film relies very strongly on a sense of the supernatural: its screenplay, to me, more closely resembled Agatha Christie's 'The Pale Horse,' in which supernatural happenings are cunningly simulated by purely rational means. This clever device may be deliberately denouncing Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism, which, in his declining years, gained prominence in such novels as 'The Land of Mist (1926).' Despite the protests of close friend Harry Houdini, Conan Doyle remained a vocal exponent of spiritualism for the remainder of his life. Perhaps the great author, as Holmes might have suggested, should have taken greater note of the details.",7,0,1,22 January 2010
WALL·E," 'We'll clean up the mess while you're away'
","The first forty minutes of Pixar's 'WALLE (2008)' comprise the most fascinating and skillfully-executed science-fiction story since well, it's been a long time. Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALLE (an acronym for 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth-class'), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye  a Rubik's cube, a plastic 'spork', a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly! (1969),' which inspires the romantic in him.One day, WALLE befriends a lonesome and resilient cockroach, and the pair carry on with their job each day, even discovering a single, tiny plant growing in sterile soil. Then, one day, love comes erupting into this little robot's life. A slick, white (and female!) robotic probe named EVE ('Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator') arrives on the planet in search of photosynthesising organisms, blasting any perceived threats with her trigger-happy plasma cannon. Needless to say, WALLE, however rusty his exterior, falls immediately in love with this beautiful feminine visitor, and what ensues is a genuinely-touching love story that serves as a charming amalgamation of Chaplin's 'City Lights (1931)' and Trumbull's 'Silent Running (1972).' Best of all, and very daringly for a children's film, this entire opening act unfolds with minimal dialogue, the two robots restricted to shrill buzzes and brief electronically-articulated utterances. Thus, their communication is almost exclusively through body language, and more meaning and emotion is recognised behind WALLE's deep, sincere eyes than is to be discerned from most real-life actors.Had Pixar sustained this level of brilliance for the remainder of the picture, I would have had little reservations in declaring 'WALLE' a masterpiece. However, for its final acts, the film descends slightly from the stratosphere of excellence, and eventually begins to acknowledge its human participants. After WALLE hitches a ride on a departing spaceship, he ends up at a distant space station named 'Axiom,' where the surviving human civilisation, now hopelessly obese beyond belief, idles away their lives before computer screens, allowing machines to cater for their every need. This commentary on our increasing over-reliance on technology (and technology's inevitable revolt) has been done to death in science-fiction, comprising everything from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' to 'Alien (1979)' to 'I, Robot (2004).' In contrast to the deep, earthy colours of the earlier segment, here the colour palette is bright, vivid and almost migraine-inducing, the visual equivalent to being injected with an overdose with caffeine. These sequences work to a degree, but the human characters are ill-defined, and so all we really care about is WALLE.This being Pixar, of course, the film contains countless minute details that will thrill parents who are observant enough to catch them. There's the mutinous HAL-like ship computer, that nostalgic Mac start-up chime whenever WALLE recharges, the adorable cleaning robot who feverishly scoots around the ship chasing foreign contaminants, the obligatory inclusion of both 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' and 'The Blue Danube'; I was also amused to notice a brief snippet of D.W. Griffith's 'A Corner in Wheat (1909)' when the ship captain (Jeff Garlin) requests a definition for 'earth' {this, I suppose, is how you distinguish the true film buffs from the fakers!}. Younger audiences will probably find the film's second half  with its zany colours, funny characters and chase sequences  to be more appetising, but perhaps the more mature among us will lament the passing of that lovely, wholesome innocence in WALLE and EVE's silent courtship, a style of art practically lost in time since the Little Tramp told his girl, 'Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.'",8,2,5,21 September 2008
The Good Shepherd," 'Someone once asked me, 'Why don't they put a 'the' in front of CIA?' And I said to him, 'do you put a 'the' in front of God?''
","Robert De Niro's second directional effort - after 1993's 'A Bronx Tale' - is a deliberately paced, brooding and haunting glimpse at one man's life throughout the early years of the United State's counter intelligence agency, the CIA. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon, 'The Bourne Identity') begins his campaign, young and proud, wanting to 'save the world'. However, as he is forced to live a bitter lie year after year, a gulf develops between him and those he cares about. This is a story of true patriotism, and how it is never as glorious and inspiring as we are often led to believe.We first come across Wilson in the cold, somber days of 1961. He moves slowly, eyes constantly cast downwards at the dampened concrete. From the bright, colourful, enthusiastic young man we will later witness in flashback, Wilson has been reduced to an empty vessel. He dutifully follows his daily routine, but he is now less of a man. For the good of his country, he has sacrificed his own life. In his younger years, Wilson was warned to 'get out while you still can... while you still have a soul.' The man who said this was brutally murdered just seconds later, and dumped into an icy river.Not a film for the impatient, 'The Good Shepherd' is a beautiful glimpse into the very heart of a troubled CIA founder, at times evoking comparisons with such classics as 'The Godfather.' It perhaps moves a bit slow at times, but there are films where a jumbled combination of quick-cuts and fast pacing just doesn't work  this, most certainly, is one of them.The acting from a stellar ensemble cast is generally very good. Matt Damon is perfect in the main role, though I did notice that, over the 30 year or so time period, he appeared to age extremely little. I've heard from somewhere that it was De Niro's deliberate decision not to significantly age Damon's character with make-up, though I'm still wondering what the possible reason for this choice could have been. Angelina Jolie is adequate enough as Wilson's wife in an unloving marriage, though I noticed that some of her acting did appear strained in some of the more dramatic scenes. Notable supporting roles and cameos also come from Alec Baldwin (as Sam Murach, an FBI agent), Michael Gambon (as Dr. Fredericks, Wilson's literature lecturer in college who is suspected to have Nazi connections), William Hurt (as Philip Allen, a superior at the CIA), Joe Pesci (lured from an agonising eight-year film hiatus) and De Niro himself as General Bill Sullivan, who, with his health rapidly failing him, actually establishes the Central Intelligence Agency.Though advertised quite blatantly as a true story, the film itself is only based very loosely on actual events. Damon's character, Edward Wilson, is modelled upon James Jesus Angleton, a long-serving chief of the CIA's counter-intelligence staff, and Richard Mervin Bissell, Jr., another American intelligence officer. Let us not, however, delve too deeply into facts, because that would only detract from what is otherwise a masterfully-crafted, emotionally affecting film.",7,5,7,1 March 2007
Stalag 17," 'Nobody has ever escaped from Stalag 17. Not alive, anyway.'
","Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary {now Poland} in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder  being Jewish  fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum {adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski} effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films {David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)'} and even TV series {'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement}.The year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.Though he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance {via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple 'thank you'}. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.",9,23,28,17 February 2008
The Terminal," 'I've been waiting my whole life'
","I know that it's a blatantly-absurd contradiction, but I've always regarded Steven Spielberg, despite his incredible critical and commercial success, as a monumentally underestimated director. Many critics tend to regard him as something of a lesser filmmaker, adequate for immaterial mass entertainment, but relatively useless for anything that comes even close to approaching true art. As you no doubt have guessed, I take the completely opposite viewpoint, regarding him as one of the finest directors that Hollywood has to offer; one who, despite his occasional preference towards sentimentality, knows precisely what he wants in a movie, and constructs it in a way that is both technically admirable and unashamedly entertaining. 'The Terminal (2004),' likewise, is one of the Spielberg's most under-appreciated outings, an intensely-enjoyable, and occasionally whimsical, lighthearted comedy that is nonetheless able to pack an emotional punch when required. Filled with a likable cast of characters, and an atypical romantic hero in Tom Hanks' Krakozhian traveller, this is the sort of film that you can simply sit to watch and allow your daily problems to dissipate into the open air.If you were to choose any A-list Hollywood actor to portray a Russian tourist with little command in English, then I predict that Tom Hanks, despite his talent and multiple Oscars, would appear near the bottom of your list of potential candidates. However, not only does the character of Viktor Navorski work, but his personality is so intensely likable that he's one of Hanks' most entertaining creations. Hopelessly lost in an immense airport lounge, with no idea why he's even being detained there, Viktor wanders aimlessly throughout the hustle-and-bustle of the arriving and departing passengers, necessarily developing a haphazard, ad hoc existence for himself, making both friends and enemies along the way. Though Viktor's poor knowledge of English paints the deceptive impression of a dim mind, as his linguistic skills slowly develop, a vibrant personality begins to shine through his initially comical exterior, and a man of admirable humility and sincerity reveals himself. Catherine Zeta-Jones lights up the screen as Amelia Warren, a beautiful flight attendant who falls for Viktor, despite her obsessive compulsion towards wealthy married men who hold no future for her.The opening act of 'The Terminal' does an impressive job of accentuating the difficulties that arise when a foreign traveller becomes 'lost in translation.' Viktor's initial meeting with airport manager Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a hopelessly impossible conversation in which no meaningful understanding is reached by either party. When Viktor finally realises that a revolution has unfolded in his home country, his anguish at not being able to understand the full details is tragic and heartbreaking, especially when his cries for assistance fall on deaf ears. An incredible backwards crane shot, zooming out from Viktor's frantic form to reveal the vast expanse of JFK airport, is perhaps a visual reference to a similar shot in Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon (1952).' Whereas the latter demonstrates the haunting solidarity of Gary Cooper's character, Spielberg's shot shows Viktor equally alone and abandoned, surrounded by crowds of self-interested travellers who might as well be non-existent. Though Spielberg occasionally veers towards sentimentality, 'The Terminal' is an entertaining and thoughtful comedy/drama; sometimes the simple stories are the ones we find most refreshing.",7,1,3,20 March 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Uplifting and Inspirational
","Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the 'man who can get things.' Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time.",10,0,0,8 October 2006
Paths of Glory," 'See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.'
","Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' is the ultimate anti-war film. Rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell,' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger, revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat. There are heroes in war, of course  namely Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his brave fighting soldiers  but certainly not the generals, who sit back in their comfortable armchairs and send thousands of their men to certain death without a trace of guilt or remorse.In the treacherous front-line trenches of World War One, a regiment of soldiers is ordered on a suicidal mission to seize the German-occupied 'Anthill.' French General Mireau (George Macready) is at first hesitant about the attack, citing the unacceptably high fatality rate and his duty to his loyal soldiers, but he is very quickly swayed in his convictions when his superior, General George Broulard, (Adolphe Menjou), hints at the possibility of a promotion. And so, led by a doubtful but loyal Colonel Dax (Douglas), the soldiers  in perhaps the most realistic war combat scene this side of 'Saving Private Ryan'  proceed with the attack, suffering immense losses and ultimately being forced to retreat. Furious about the perceived 'cowardice' of his troops, an enraged General Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on his own men, but the artillery commander refuses to obey without a confirmation of written orders.Rather than taking the blame himself for the failed attack, Mireau decides to execute three men to set an example to the soldiers. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is chosen for execution because his commanding officer has a personal vendetta against him; Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), one of the most courageous soldiers in his regiment, was chosen randomly; Private Ferol (Timothy Carey) was chosen because he was something of a social outcast. Colonel Lax passionately defends the actions of his men during the court-martial, but, despite the utterly ridiculous cases made against them, all three men are inevitably found guilty of 'cowardice in the face of the enemy' and sentenced to death by firing squad.Later, in one of the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film, accompanied by the slow steady beat of an army drum, the three condemned men are lead to their place of execution, tied to posts and shot down by the weapons of their own army. Any other film from this era would have baulked at the final moment, offering its prisoners a last-minute reprieve, and the swift persecution of every general in charge of the original attack. Kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point, but it is to his credit that he stood firm on his daring and controversial ending. Indeed, French authorities considered the film such an offence to their army's honour that it was banned until 1975.",8,6,9,12 May 2007
Raging Bull," Deserving Of Its Classic Status
","After hearing about the brilliance of 'Raging Bull' for months and months, I was delighted when I managed to find a copy of the film. Whilst I must honestly say that I didn't enjoy the film as much as many others before me, I can certainly see why it is considered a masterpiece.First of all, the acting is absolutely flawless. Robert De Niro, in perhaps his greatest role (I'm still deciding between this and 'Taxi Driver'), stunningly portrays Jake LaMotta, a vicious and talented fighter but a paranoid husband. De Niro earned himself an Oscar for this performance, and it is easy to see why. The scene where LaMotta is thrown into a jail cell for selling alcohol to minors- overweight, disliked and alone- is one of the great acting scenes of all time.The supporting performances are also very notable, especially Joe Pesci (Casino, 1995) as LaMotta's brother and agent, and Cathy Moriarty as LaMotta's husband.The boxing scenes, though unexpectedly scarce throughout the film, are moments of utter beauty, and a testament to outstanding direction, editing and cinematography. The viewer is cast within the boxing ring, and they flinch with every blow, as if struck themselves.In watching this film, it is essential to first understand that this is not supposed to be a 'boxing film.' In other words, you won't be getting an inspirational, underdog film like 'Rocky.' 'Raging Bull' is a biographical character study of Jake LaMotta and a classical examination of masculinity. I must admit that I felt the film was a bit slow in some places, and had a drawn-out, anti-climactic ending, but I think that's merely because I was in a 'Rocky' sort of mood. With every scene, I found myself yearning for another of those brilliant boxing scenes, and I was slightly disappointed when we find LaMotta overweight and lazy - a sure sign that his boxing days were now over...I've heard that 'Raging Bull' is a film that benefits substantially from a second viewing. With my expectations of another 'Rocky' put aside, I think I can appreciate this film a lot more, something that it certainly deserves. So this is what I'll do: I'll give it a few weeks, and then I'll try the film again. You'll be hearing from me soon!",8,2,4,7 December 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," 'Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?'
","'The Silence of the Lambs (1991)' isn't even about Hannibal Lecter. We're so distracted by cold, probing voice of the suave psychiatrist- turned-serial-killer (played with chilling calculation by Anthony Hopkins) that it's easy to forget that the film is ultimately about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a rookie FBI agent with a dark past.Clarice spent her adolescence trying to escape death – the shooting of her father, the slaughter of spring lambs on her neighbour's ranch – and sought to banish these memories by joining the FBI. She's a young woman in what is traditionally a man's world, forced to endure the degradation of constantly having 'eyes all over her body' (and this disquieting metaphor is reinforced later on as we witness Clarice ogled through the lens of night-vision goggles). The motives of her boss and mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are somewhat dubious, and their final handshake quivers with sexual awkwardness.Hannibal Lecter perceives Clarice's dark past and recognises her strengths. He falls in love with her in a platonic sort of way (not dissimilar to how Sherlock Holmes fell in love with Irene Adler, one of the few people to have outwitted him, in 'A Scandal in Bohemia'). The moment that their fingers touch through the bars of Lecter's cell is a chilling sharing of intimacy. Thomas Harris subsequently elaborated on this relationship in 'Hannibal,' but that novel (and, to a lesser extent, Ridley Scott's 2001 film adaptation) goes completely off the rails in its final act. Clarice Starling would've been best left alone. (Tellingly, the best parts of 'Hannibal (2001)' were those set in Florence, Italy with Giancarlo Giannini).Finally, nobody ever mentions Ted Levine's perfect performance as Jame Gumb (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill), probably because he's such an repellent character. Lecter is frequently framed in close-up, emphasising Hopkins' mesmerising, unblinking stare, and he speaks eloquently and intelligently. Jame Gumb, conversely, is kept at a distance, often swathed in poor or garish lighting, or framed in such an extreme close- up that his features appear grotesque.",10,5,11,4 October 2006
Ben-Hur," 'May God grant me vengeance'
","Watching 'Ben-Hur (1959)' is a lot like paying a visit to the Colosseum. Situated in Rome, Italy, this massive elliptical amphitheatre is the largest ever built in the Roman Empire, able to seat up to 80,000 spectators for gladiatorial games and various public spectacles. I've never been to Rome myself, but I'd imagine that one would look up at this amazing feat of ancient architecture, and be left in awe at the scale of it all. You would marvel at the amount of care and labour that must have gone into such a project, particularly given the comparatively primitive tools with which the builders had worked. I feel the same way about 'Ben-Hur'  William Wyler's epic of epics, and, at the time, the most expensive film ever made. Winner of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this colossal cinematic gamble resurrected M-G-M from financial ruin. But is it worth nearly four hours of your time? Like a lumbering elephant, 'Ben-Hur' wallows in its immensity, extravagance and self-importance. But it is epic  oh, so very epic!  and, like the Colosseum, demands our awe.Earlier this year, I decreed 'Ben-Hur' to be the one film that I wouldn't watch until I had the luxury of viewing it in the cinema. Sooner than expected, the opportunity came along, though the Christmas Eve screening date made it essential that I bring the usual holiday festivities forward one day. The sacrifice was much warranted, for this film can only be fully experienced in the theatre, not least because of the breathtaking 70mm anamorphic print, with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1  one of the widest ever made. William Wyler fills every frame with extravagance, such that even the quietest person-to-person conversation takes place in a magnificent, lavishly-decorated chamber. Such expansive surroundings often promote coldness and detachedness from the audience (many uninvolving historical epics were produced around this period), and 'Ben-Hur' doesn't entirely escape the same fate; for every exciting and emotional sequence, there are maybe two scenes of negligible exposition. But the film thrives on its excesses, and, fortunately, the good scenes are so incredibly good that they merit the wait.Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his portrayal of Judah Ben-Hur, though his performance is merely adequate without being particularly brilliant. Heston, an actor who flourished mostly on sheer charisma, I think, appears to struggle in the film's most emotional moments {my personal pick for the award that year would have been Laurence Harvey in Jack Clayton's 'Room at the Top (1959)'}. Stephen Boyd, though un-nominated, is quite terrific as Messala, Judah's boyhood friend who was later corrupted by the evils of the Roman Empire. Though there are many exciting scenes  such as the fiery ocean battle or Christ's crucifixion  the film's undisputed centrepiece is, of course, the extraordinary chariot race, a marvel of adrenalin-charged action and suspense. Every single metre of the contest had me enthralled, every jolt and tremble of the carriage sending an agitated chill down my spine. The sequence's enduring influence is to be found in practically every historical epic that followed, most noticeably Ridley Scott's Best Picture-winning 'Gladiator (2000).'To be denied one's name is the film's greatest tragedy. When condemned to a lifetime of slavery aboard a Roman galley, Judah loses his important status and is delegated a generic identification number  #41. His mother and sister, having contracted leprosy after years in confinement, later flee to a leper colony, where, we are told, names are of no use. After being liberated from captivity by the kindly nobleman Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), Judah takes on the name of his newly-adopted father, a compassionate gesture but one that he is later ashamed to have accepted. To be denied one's face, on the other hand, is apparently divine. Claude Heater, as Jesus Christ, is never properly seen, glimpsed only from behind or at a distance. In this way, the Messiah is portrayed as something holy and angelic, not to be glimpsed by mortal eyes. Though the story of Christ may only form a subplot, thematically it sits at the film's heart. 'Ben-Hur' is about the beginnings of Christianity, and how its teachings have inspired people from the very beginning, and ever since.",8,1,3,26 December 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," 'I'll go to your room, but you'll have to seduce me'
","It would be cynical of you to suggest that Woody Allen conceived this project purely as a means of getting Scarlett Johansson and Penélope Cruz to kiss, so perish the thought; it is unworthy of you. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)' is another of Allen's recent turns away from comedy, but nevertheless plays more lightheartedly than the tense neo-noir 'Match Point (2006).' The film is a breezy excursion into the subtleties of love and desire, as two American tourists (Johansson and Rebecca Hall) spend a few idyllic summer months in Spain, getting wooed by romantic, straight-talking artist Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), also an enthusiastic advocate of what is traditionally termed the 'menage à trois.' His attempts at seducing both the uptight Vicky (Hall) and the free-spirited Cristina (Johannson) are interrupted by the arrival of Maria Helena (Penélope Cruz), Juan Antonio's ex-wife, a nasty temper smouldering beneath a striking exterior. Allen does an odd little thing here: in the opening moments, he introduces a chirpy narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who periodically chimes in to unnecessarily and wordily voice the characters' thoughts and actions, not as a participant, but as a smug, omniscient storyteller. The narration must surely be intended as ironic; there's a patent absurdity in trying to explain human emotions via such glib, superficial remarks. This complaint aside, the film is beautifully shot, with strong performances only enhanced by the breathtaking shooting locations. Scarlett Johannson's character carries shades of her role in 'Lost in Translation (2002),' as Cristina struggles – and will, posits Allen, continue to struggle – to find satisfaction in her lifestyle. In fact, the film doesn't really end well for anybody, harking back to the disillusionment that concluded 'Annie Hall (1977),' and the realisation that we're in it only because we 'need the eggs.'",8,2,5,15 September 2010
The Sixth Sense," Beautiful and Terrifying.
","Unknown director M. Night Shyamalan's third film surprised everyone by becoming one of the most successful horror/thriller movies of all time. Bruce Willis ('Die Hard,' 1988) plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a disheartened child psychologist who can no longer talk to his wife, and is haunted by the memories of a former patient he couldn't help.When he discovers young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment, 'Artificial Intelligence: AI,' 2002), a child with strikingly similar psychological problems to the boy he had previously failed, Crowe is determined assist him. However, Cole harbours a terrifying secret that is simply too shocking to believe: he can see dead people!Shyamalan's beautiful and terrifying masterpiece was nominated for a very respectable six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress for Australian Toni Collette ('Muriel's Wedding,' 1994) as Cole's worried and confused mother, and Best Supporting Actor for the brilliant Osment, at the age of just 11. Willis is also very good, turning in an appropriately understated performance that often eludes critical recognition.",9,2,3,24 November 2006
Rear Window," 'A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window'
","There can be absolutely no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most gifted film directors ever to work in Hollywood, and 'Rear Window' is one film that demonstrates most exhaustively his enormous talents. I must admit that, on my first viewing of the film, I was quite new to his work, and, whilst I thought it was a solid achievement, it didn't strike me as being anything particularly special. How wrong I was! With subsequent viewings of 'Rear Window,' include one in a cinema, I was able to better appreciate its intricacies: the flawless performances, the 100 minutes of subtle, wonderfully-executed suspense, the shades of delightfully-dark humour, the manner in which Hitchcock places the viewer inside Jeff's tiny apartment. Released in 1954, 'Rear Window' was the second of four Hitchcock films to star James Stewart (the others being 'Rope,' 'Vertigo' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'), and the second of three to feature one of Hollywood's greatest beauties, Grace Kelly ('Dial M for Murder,' 'To Catch a Thief').On the surface, the plot to 'Rear Window' is deceptively straightforward. The screenplay was written by four-time Hitchcock collaborator John Michael Hayes, and based loosely on the short story 'It Had to be Murder,' by Cornell Woolrich. Confined to his apartment with a broken leg, successful adventure photographer L. B. 'Jeff' Jefferies (Stewart) passes the tedious days and weeks by peering through the window at his neighbours, watching and learning their daily activities and rituals. When he is not being a voyeur, Jeff is distracted by visits from an embittered insurance company nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, glamorous socialite girlfriend, Lisa (Kelly). Jeff's 'peeping tom' activities become considerably more serious than simply a means of passing the time, and he is soon immersed in the triumphs and failures of his neighbours. On one particular night, Jeff notices a man in the apartment across the courtyard (Raymond Burr) acting in a suspicious manner, and, despite the doubt of his friends, he begins to suspect that this man has committed an absolutely heinous crime.The sheer genius of 'Rear Window' is not just how well-executed this storyline is, but how Hitchcock ties it together with numerous other narratives, making all of the strings equally-interesting to watch. Each of the apartments visible from Jeff's window acts like a different world  a separate movie  and the combination of all of these creates a rich tapestry of lifestyles, and a range of human relationships that mirror that of Jeff and Lisa. For example, there is hard-working salesmen Lars Thorwald, who arrives home each day to the incessant nagging of his invalid wife (Irene Winston); the woman in the floor below, dubbed 'Miss Lonelyheart' (Judith Evelyn), is a hopeless romantic who, in her depression, is addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills; a young music writer (Ross Bagdasarian) struggles to make an income; a sexy young dancer, 'Miss Torso' (Georgine Darcy), practises her dance moves and battles various suitors; two newly-weds frequently culminate their marriage with the blinds drawn, though, by the end of the film, the wife has begun the nagging that is arguably characteristic of the gender!Despite obviously being in love with Lisa, Jeff is apprehensive of approaching marriage, fearing that his gritty, adventurous, globe-trotting lifestyle will not be compatible with Lisa's love of socialising and high-fashion (she is never caught wearing the same expensive dress twice). At first, we notice Jeff using the lives of those in the other apartments to distract from the troubles in his own, and he often uses the examples before him to support the decisions that he must make in his own life. As the film progresses, Lisa reveals a daring, audacious streak in trying to solve the mystery, and Jeff realises that, when love is concerned, small compromises can and should be made in order to make a fateful relationship work. As the film closes, we notice Lisa lying on a bed in common, unglamorous clothing, reading the book, 'Beyond the High Himalayas,' no doubt in preparation for the couple's next adventure. However, though some compromises have been made, Lisa still remains her own women, suddenly casting aside Jeff's reading material and raising her own 'Harper's Bazaar' magazine to her face.Of course, despite the multitude of little narratives that comprise the film, the most significant  and, indeed, the one we remember best  is that of Lars Thorwald and his missing wife, Anna. After witnessing the former acting suspiciously during a stormy night, Jeff suspects that the over-worked and under-appreciated Thorwald has brutally murdered his wife, decapitated her body into several pieces and carried out the remains in a suitcase. Though Jeff's police detective ex-War buddy, Thomas J, Doyle (Wendell Corey), believes Jeff's story to be fantastic, Stella and Lisa soon come to accept the theory as fact, helping an immobile Jeff to solve the mystery. That we never fully understand the motivations of the murderer, having to be content with brief glimpses from afar, is crucial to Hitchcock's storytelling, and, by making the audience complicit in his characters' voyeurism, we feel as though our safety is being placed in jeopardy. The entire film possesses a very subtle air of unrelenting suspense, but the final ten minutes or so are among the most thrilling in cinema history.",9,4,7,6 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?'
","For the past week, I'd been pining to complete my rewatch of 'The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003),' viewing the films for the first time in years. This wait, however arduous, was nothing compared to the 360 days I originally endured between 'The Two Towers (2002)' and 'The Return of the King (2003).' The drought came to an end on December 26, 2003: I remember the exact date because it was the first night of release, and I'd been counting down for the past year. We bought our tickets weeks in advance, waited in line for over an hour, and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open.And so it is that Peter Jackson's trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close, in truly spectacular fashion. With the armies of Mordor marching on Minas Tirith, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of Gondor, ruled by the callous steward Denethor (John Noble), is not to fall before the Great Eye of Sauron. Meanwhile, this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits, Frodo and Sam, dutifully trundling across the wastelands of Mordor, two innocuous Halflings carrying the weight of a million men. Once again, the film excels at these stunning contrasts. The death of Denethor, a powerful, intimate moment of self-realisation, unexpectedly bridges into the Battle for Minas Tirith, the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands.A word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of Frodo's excursion into Shelob's Lair, a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects, topped only by the 'insect pit' in Jackson's own 'King Kong (2005).' Andy Serkis, as the computer-generated Gollum, once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former Ring-bearer. 'The Return of the King' has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour I've ever seen, as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice, this one-on-one conflict somehow more 'epic' than the entire Battle of Helms Deep. But Peter Jackson isn't done yet. While excising Tolkien's somewhat anti-climactic 'Scouring of the Shire,' he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful, and wonderfully satisfying, close, his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.",10,0,1,19 August 2010
Heat," 'I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me'
","Like him or not, director Michael Mann has his own distinctive style, but what matters is how well he is able to use it to tell a story. 'Manhunter (1986),' a solid and well-acted thriller, was tarnished by Mann's excessively 'trendy' style, and a musical soundtrack that has kept the film perpetually trapped in the 1980s. More recently, 'Collateral (2004)' demonstrated a precise and balanced combination of style and substance, making excellent use of the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, perfect for capturing the low-key lighting of Mann's favoured night-time urban landscape. His follow-up, 'Miami Vice (2006),' was almost entirely devoid of substance, a meandering crime story redeemed only by a thrilling shoot-out in the final act. 'Heat (1995)' is among Mann's most lauded achievements, and I'm happy to say that it's probably the finest of the director's films I've seen so far. Most noted for being the first film in which Al Pacino and Robert De Niro shared the same screen (they were separated by decades in Coppola's 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'), 'Heat' is sizzling, action-packed drama.Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is something of a cliché, the hard-working homicide detective who is distant from his family. However, Pacino gives the character depth, a hard-edged, street-wise cop who is basically good at heart. When writing dialogue for Al Pacino, the temptation is always there to make him shout a lot, and there are several scenes when Mann does exactly that, but the character is strongest when he's not talking at all, lost in silent contemplation or embracing the hysterical mother of a murder victim. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) sits on the opposite side of the law, a principled professional thief who has dedicated his entire life to crime. McCauley has a motto: 'don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.' His failure to adhere to this advice is ultimately what gets him killed, for, though he is prepared to discard his relationship with a sincere art designer (Amy Brenneman), McCauley unable to walk away from his own principles.'Heat' boasts an impressive supporting cast  including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert and Jon Voight  but it's no surprise that Pacino and De Niro dominate the film. Their single face-to-face encounter is a corker, as they sit opposite each other sipping coffee (the table between them representing not only the border between police and criminal, but also a mirror of sorts). Hanna and McCauley exchange terse pleasantries like old friends, despite having never met before, and the two master actors coolly and effortlessly exude charisma with every word. The film's promotional tagline boasts 'a Los Angeles crime saga,' suggesting that Mann was attempting something akin to his own 'The Godfather (1972),' though he doesn't quite pull it off as readily as Coppola. His film could have done with a few trimmings, excising a few largely superfluous personal subplots, including an impromptu suicide attempt that came right out of left-field. Nevertheless, 'Heat' is a gripping crime story, with great performances, and one of the best shootouts that you'll see anywhere.",8,0,1,25 December 2008
Thirteen Days," 'We were eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fella just blinked'
","It's taken the human race millions of years to get where it is today, but all that could be taken away from us in just days, even hours. The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 escalated, climaxed and then reached its resolution so rapidly that the Doomsday Clock didn't even have time to adjust its setting, but, nonetheless, it is perhaps the closest we've ever been to destroying ourselves for good. Prior to watching Roger Donaldson's taut historical thriller 'Thirteen Days (2000),' I knew very little detail about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but was familiar with its effects on popular culture. Two years afterwards, Sidney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick independently released two similar Cold War thrillers – 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and the satirical 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' respectively – both of which clearly attempted to reproduce the mortal political situation in which young President John F. Kennedy then found himself (and both films proposed that next time we may not be so lucky).'Thirteen Days' gives life to events that would otherwise, to a belated onlooker like myself, have seemed mere historical footnotes on paper. Only by returning to the proper time and place can one truly appreciate the despair and uncertainty faced, not only by the political leaders holding eleventh-hour meetings in the White House, but also the stunned citizens who would stock up on supplies in preparation for what must have seemed the inevitable. A historical drama like 'All the President's Men (1976)' is magnificent precisely because it succeeds in spite of a foregone conclusion, and 'Thirteen Days' similarly keeps the atmosphere exhilaratingly tense. Most of the film's action unfolds in the stuffy board-rooms and elaborately-decorated rooms of the White House, and this is where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, Donaldson too regularly cuts away from the primary decision-makers to visit American jet pilots, navy boat captains, and even the Cuban missile-workers, thus only partly representing the Presidents' continual frustration at having so little information on which to base his decisions.The story itself revolves around Special Assistant to the President Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner with a dubious Bostonian accent), and so presenting the Crisis from the perspective of a reasonably passive, impartial spectator. Bruce Greenwood (most recently spotted in the Bob Dylan biopic 'I'm Not There (2007)') is excellent as JFK, whose (relative) youthfulness is consistently scorned by the reactionary military commanders who seem intent on undermining his authority. Steven Culp, who has a little Brad Dourif about him, is also outstanding as Robert F. Kennedy, without whose matter-of-fact input his brother could never arguably have got along. Unjustly neglected on its original release, 'Thirteen Days' is a fascinating, and often terrifying, historical account of the Cold War's most dangerous fortnight of hostilities – hostilities not necessarily characterised by gunfire or missile strikes, but by the threat of something so much more widespread and devastating. In making his strategic decisions, President Kennedy walked a tightrope above the threat of nuclear war, and we can only be thankful that he kept his balance.",8,0,0,24 May 2009
Contact," 'You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not'
","In the late 1990s, Hollywood turned its eye once again to the stars. 'Independence Day (1996)' was a bombastic throwback to popcorn disaster movies, in which an alien civilisation attempts to annihilate the human race in a puff of fiery explosions. 'Deep Impact (1998)' and 'Armageddon (1998)' both entailed meteors on a collision-course with Earth. What was it that made us look up again? It certainly wasn't the threat of nuclear war, or the Space Race, both of which had fuelled the 1950s boom in science-fiction. Perhaps the approaching dawn of a new millennium had evoked in us the sheer insignificance of our own daily situations, casting our minds to previous generations, to an entire race and to other races beyond our terrestrial cradle. It was inevitable that filmmakers would return to Stanley Kubrick's science-fiction masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' its titular year – then on the cusp of fruition – signaling a new age for Mankind. You'll forgive me if my review makes frequent allusions to '2001,' for Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997)' feels, in many ways, like a feeble imitation of Kubrick's film. In both stories, the human race discovers evidence of a distant extraterrestrial civilisation, and attempts to make contact. Each film creates a sense of awe at the incalculable immensity of the Universe, and Man's own infinitesimal place within it {'Contact' does this via a wonderful computer-generated 'zoom-out' through the solar system and the Milky Way}. However, though I admire Zemeckis and Carl Sagan for taking their ideas further than most science-fiction films, I often found the film's approach clumsy and unconvincing. 'Contact' is strongest in its opening half, when SETI astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) discovers what is believed to be radio communication from an interstellar race. The moment of first radio contact is invigoratingly suspenseful, offering some small sense of the excitement that Jerry Ehman must have felt when the 'Wow! signal' came through in 1977. Zemeckis, ever the technical wizard, orchestrates a marvellous long-take that follows Foster from her car, through the observatory entrance, and into the laboratory.As 'Contact' strays farther from contemporary reality, it begins to get bogged-down by tiresome theistic philosophy. '2001' addressed the topic of religion only peripherally, almost dismissively; it was Arthur C. Clarke's stance that any sufficiently-advanced civilisation would be indistinguishable from God (making the notion of God almost redundant). 'Contact' tries to pander to two camps, carefully engineering a scenario by which there is no empirical evidence for Jodie Foster's experience, and then introducing empirical evidence, anyway. The climax, which unfolds following a Douglas Trumbull-inspired wormhole, is interesting, but far too safe: using a human avatar to represent the extraterrestrial race is a clumsy way of avoiding having to show them, and simply reminds the viewer that they're watching a movie. Kubrick did it better thirty years earlier, housing Dave Bowman in a Louis XVI-style enclosure that is familiar yet eerily sterile. In fact, watching 'Contact' has, if nothing else, made me appreciate just how much I love '2001,' forever the pinnacle of science-fiction achievement.",7,0,2,14 February 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," 'You want something? Go get it. Period.'
","We've all seen this sort of story before: a poor man, through his unbreakable courage and determination, climbs the ranks of society to become the best that he can possibly be. The story's conclusion was never going to be in any doubt; we know that it is based on a true story, and nobody's interested in making a film about a failure. However, despite its familiarity, its predictability, its share of clichéd moments, something about 'The Pursuit of Happiness (2006)' really hooked me. We follow Chris Gardner through six turbulent months of his life, experiencing his ups and down, and we really to come to know and care about him. Better yet, we are told from the very beginning that the film is 'inspired' by one man's true story. Though we realise that dramatic license has been taken in some regards, it really is stirring to know that the real Chris Gardner was faced with many of the seemingly-insurmountable challenges that we witness in this film, and yet he came out of his struggles a successful, independent and happy man.I've always thought that Will Smith had a lot of potential as an actor, but he's never really had an opportunity to demonstrate his talents {he was Oscar-nominated for 'Ali (2001),' but I saw that film such a long time ago that I can't recall much about it}. In 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' he delivers an intelligent and sensitive performance, his character wonderfully understated, and Smith's chemistry with real-life son Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is genuinely touching. A rare change from his usual cocky and smart-mouthed persona, Will Smith's Chris Gardner is likable, thoughtful and surprisingly reserved, though his self-confidence and determination makes him a legitimate presence in any scene. Though he met with stiff competition in Forest Whitaker ('The Last King of Scotland (2006)'), Smith's second Oscar nomination was certainly well-deserved. Competent supporting performances come from Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, James Karen and Dan Castellaneta, though the real star of the film will always be the beautiful interactions between loving father and son.'The Pursuit of Happiness' was directed by Italian director Gabriele Muccino in his first English-speaking film, and was written by Steve Conrad ('The Weather Man (2005)'). Technically, there is little notable about the film, but, emotionally, Gardner's story proves extremely powerful. This is the sort of film that really tugs at your heartstrings, allowing you to appreciate your current circumstances and to strive for those dreams that you had previously thought unachievable. In the film, we see that there are thousands of people in San Francisco living in poverty, and yet Chris Gardner seems to stands out among them all. Why is this? Is it just because Will Smith is such a star that even homelessness can't dampen his style, or is it because his character is a man going somewhere? At the moment, he doesn't any money, but his determination and will to succeed make him almost radiant amid the masses of pitiable derelicts. Admittedly, I'm still only working my way through the year, but 'The Pursuit of Happiness' has proved one of my favourites of 2006.",8,1,2,24 November 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'The quest for the Grail is not archeology; it's a race against evil.'
","In 1981, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg astonished the cinema-going world with the brilliant rip-roaring adventure of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' featuring Harrison Ford as the rugged, handsome, whip-cracking archaeologist Indiana Jones. A phenomenal critical and box-office success, the film inevitably resulted in the production of sequels, which, happily, did not diminish greatly in quality. 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' was released in 1986, to a rather more mixed reception, but the noticeably darker overtones and awe-inspiring effects-driven action sequences nonetheless make it one of cinema's supreme adventures. The third film in the series, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was released in 1989, partially as Spielberg's 'atonement' for the perceived faults in his previous instalment.This one, superficially a rough retread of the original film, is my personal favourite of the lot, in no small part to Sean Connery's inspired casting as Professor Henry Jones. The story opens with a prologue from Indiana Jones' childhood, as a boy scout in Utah in 1912. After stumbling upon a group of grave robbers, young Indiana (played with gusto by River Phoenix, who tragically died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the brink of a successful career) steals the valuable Cross of Coronado, with the intention of presenting it to a museum. As he scrambles desperately across the carriages of a moving circus train, in flight from his experienced pursuers, we come to witness the origin of some of the hero's trademarks: the fear of snakes, the bull-whip and, of course, the fedora hat.Returning to 1938, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the clean-shaven, tweed-wearing professor at a New England college, lecturing to his students about the lack of adventure in the field of archeology ('X never ever marks the spot'). Following the disappearance of his father, respected archaeologist Prof. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), Indiana strikes off across the world in search of him, unwittingly throwing himself into a race to discover the Holy Grail, the sacred cup used by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. However, to make matters worse, Indiana finds that his old enemies  the Nazis  have also launched a frantic bid to acquire the Grail. Aided by museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and beautiful Austrian historian Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), Indiana must rescue his father, beat the bad guys and uncover the ultimate archaeological treasure.'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was, once again, directed by Steven Spielberg, working off a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes, and a screenplay from Jeffrey Boam. What ultimately makes the film such an enjoyable ride is its fantastic sense of humour, and Connery's character delivers a large portion of the comedy, whether he is smashing his son over the head with a fake Ming Vase, setting the floor alight or blasting away the tail of his own plane with a machine gun (before blaming it on the Nazis). Ford and Connery have their own share of playful father-son banter, which becomes particularly farcical when it is revealed that they have both slept with the same woman (a favourite piece of dialogue: 'I'm as human as the next man'; 'I was the next man!'). Denholm Elliott is also highly entertaining as Marcus Brody, who, despite Indiana's great respect for him, is so hopelessly inept that he 'once got lost in his own museum.'The film, just like its predecessors, is one long string of action sequences, the centrepiece in this one taking place on and around a heavily-armoured Nazi tank. Clever, witty and impeccably acted, 'Indiana Jones' was and remains one of the most entertaining motion pictures ever produced, and a flawless addition to an excellent trilogy. Bring on the fourth instalment!",10,4,7,29 September 2007
Valkyrie," 'We have to show the world that not all of us are like him'
","The release of 'Valkyrie (2008)' was clouded by all sorts of overblown controversy regarding Tom Cruise's personal life, so it was perhaps fortuitous that it took me a year to finally watch it, allowing a period in which the dust could settle. All in all, Bryan Singer's film deserves some recognition; his storytelling style harks back to the 1970s, when filmmakers like Alan J. Pakula were crafting intelligent, slow-burning thrillers. In recounting the failed July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, the film avoids the anachronistic use of contemporary visual flourishes, gracefully recreating events with a strong emphasis on historical detail.Tom Cruise, whose screen persona is usually enough to dominate any film, is surprisingly understated in the lead, his character that of a calm, determined strategist. Colonel von Stauffenberg is driven by ideals, particularly his belief in a 'sacred Germany,' but the film explores these motivations only peripherally. Instead, 'Valkyrie' is concerned with the mechanics of the July 20 plot; that is, what does it take to overthrow a dictatorship? Singer directs the action as one directs pieces in a chess-game, using Stauffenberg and his co- conspirators as willing pawns in an attempted coup that proved resourceful but ultimately impotent.Seasoned players Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Billy Nighy and Terence Stamp are excellent in supporting roles. Wilkinson is particularly good: his General Friedrich Fromm stands on the fence between Hitler and the plotters, sensing that the powers are soon to shift, but stubbornly refusing to commit himself until his indecision returns to punish him. Throughout the film, Singer constructs a number of tense suspense sequences centred around the assassination plot. However, despite everybody's best efforts, it is often difficult for the viewer to fully commit to the characters and their scheme, since we already know how the story ends. Like Fromm, I suppose, one finds himself unwilling to pledge allegiance to what is inevitably the losing side.",7,0,0,8 December 2009
All the President's Men," 'It leads everywhere. Get out your notebook. There's more.'
","To be completely honest, coming into this film, I knew extremely little about the Watergate scandal, beyond knowing that Forrest Gump was responsible for the burglaries being discovered, because the flashlights were 'keeping him awake.' On June 17 1972, a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., by members of the Richard Nixon administration, resulted in a string of cover-ups and, ultimately, in Nixon's 1974 resignation. The two Washington Post journalists credited with uncovering the Watergate scandal are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, later known collectively as 'Woodstein.' Their exploits are detailed in their 1974 non-fiction book, 'All The President's Men,' from which this film of the same name was adapted.The scandal itself arose from humble beginnings. When a low-key court hearing for the five Watergate burglars piques the interest of Bob Woodward (Robert Redford), he and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) are assigned to the story. At the time, it is deemed insignificant enough to involve these two secondary journalists, but Woodward and Bernstein soon discover that the scandal runs higher than they could ever have anticipated.Redford and Hoffman are great in their respective roles, seamlessly stepping into the shoes of two reporters and never for a moment slipping up. Strong supporting roles also come from Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Jason Robards as editors of the Washington Post, and they act their respective roles convincingly, as though they've been in the newspaper business their whole lives. Hal Holbrook is suitably mysterious as Deep Throat, Woodward's anonymous inside source, who arranges meetings in the eerie shadows of a deserted parking garage. Deep Throat's true identity was kept a secret until May 31 2005, when William Mark Felt, Sr stepped forward and publicly revealed the truth.It would, no doubt, have been tempting for the filmmakers to exaggerate or overdramatise the two reporters' exploits, perhaps by 'fleshing out' their characters by including their own troubling personal lives, or by throwing in a random car chase to get the adrenaline pumping. However, director Alan J. Pakula and screenwriter William Goldman have remained relatively loyal to the source material, and manage somehow keep a taut storytelling pace, despite the film consisting largely of inquiring phone calls and interviews with reluctant sources.This is a stunning political thriller, the greatest triumph arising from the film's ability to keep the audience's attention, despite everybody already knowing how the story is going to end. Well, except for me",8,7,7,16 February 2007
Up in the Air," 'How much does your life weigh?'
","When I first mentioned my interest in seeing Jason Reitman's latest film, a friend swiftly dismissed it as 'one of those intellectual movies.' It isn't really. 'Up in the Air (2009)' is an affable, unpretentious look at life in today's fast-moving society, lighthearted for the most part, but pointedly dramatic when it counts. I must confess that I haven't seen 'Thank You for Smoking (2005)' or 'Juno (2007),' so I can't offer an auteurist perspective. However, the film's pleasantly- wistful approach reminded me of another good recent comedy/drama, 'Dan in Real Life (2007).' Both films explore the yearnings of an older man for an emotional connection in his life, though the screen personas of Steve Carell and George Clooney could hardly be farther apart. 'Up in the Air' displays Clooney at his most suave, gliding through a gleaming world of spotless airport terminals and glossy credit cards, a disconnected lifestyle of sterility and emotional emptiness.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) has spent most of his life in the air. His daily routine involves flying endlessly across the United States, firing people who he's never met, and will never meet again. He thrives on single-serve friendships (if I may borrow from 'Fight Club (1999)'), and feels empty if he's grounded for more than a few days. Ryan is estranged from his family, and never engages in romantic relationships beyond the occasional sexual fling with fellow frequent-flyers like Alex (Vera Farmiga). We expect Reitman to thoroughly condemn this lifestyle, but his approach is double-edged. In modern society, particularly given Ryan's difficult occupation, there's something sincere about the city- hopping lifestyle. Even among those like Natalie (Anna Kendrick), who would prefer to remain permanently grounded, technology acts as a barrier to genuine human interaction: partners break up via SMS, employees are fired over the internet (even when sitting in the next room).",8,0,2,11 February 2010
From Here to Eternity," 'Well, what am I? I'm a private no-class dogface. The way most civilians look at that, that's two steps up from nothing'!'
","On a quiet, unspoilt beach, two lovers embrace in the sand. The fierce waves of the ocean are tossed upon the shore, and the couple is momentarily submerged in a surge of water and foam. Gloriosly oblivious to this, the lovers continue to hold each other tight, as if it is all in this world that matters.This iconic image between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr has since become one of the most famous scenes in the history of film. As such, it comes as a surprise to discover it does not even appear in the script  the idea to film with the waves hitting them was a last minute inspiration from the director, Fred Zinneman. It is always fascinating to discover that the inspirations that spring forth at the last minute will often prove to be the most enduring.On a bright, sunny morning at a Hawaiian military base, Pvt. Robert E. Lee 'Prew' Prewitt (Montgomery Clift, 'I Confess') strolls amidst the marching soldiers. He has transferred across from the somewhat more prestigious Bugle Corps at Port Shaftford because he felt that a less-talented bugle player had been promoted ahead of him. 'His feelings were hurt.' smirks 1st Sgt. Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster, 'Birdman of Alcatraz') amusedly. 'Kids they send us now.' Yet it is this uniquely steadfast pride and determination that forms the heart of 'From Here To Eternity.' 'A man don't go his own way, he's nothing,' declares Prewitt after refusing his commanding officer's (Philip Ober) request to join his boxing team. 'Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way,' retorts Sgt. Warden. 'But today you got to play ball.'All this petty persuasion proves futile in Prewitt's case. However, his fellow comrades (and his superiors) believe that his participation in the boxing team will be beneficial, as Prewitt had once been a seasoned fighter, only to inexplicably quit a year earlier. As a means of cruel coercion, Prewitt is unfairly persecuted by his superior officers, and targeted by his comrades. Only one fellow soldier, Pvt. Angelo Maggio (an Oscar-winning Frank Sinatra, 'The Manchurian Candidate') looks out for Prewitt's wellbeing, and they become good friends.Amidst all this struggle and adversity, several love stories begin to blossom. Sgt. Warden takes a fancy to the unappreciated wife of his direct superior, Capt. Dana 'Dynamite' Holmes. Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr) is fully aware that her husband is cheating on her, but is denied a divorce because it could affect his reputation. Whilst she is initially quite terse towards Warden, she soon falls in love with him, and the two must maintain a low-key relationship behind the army's back.Prewitt, meanwhile, is dragged by a very drunk Maggio into a local club known as the New Congress Club. Here, Prewitt immediately spots the women of his dreams (an Oscar-winning Donna Reed), and he saunters over to her, only to discover that she is simply being paid by the management to mingle with the Club's guests. Indeed, the name by which she originally introduces herself  Lorene  was given to her on her first night on the job. Nonetheless, Prewitt sees an opportunity for love, and entices 'Lorene' to meet him outside of work.'From Here To Eternity' is a classic Hollywood film. It encompasses riveting drama, timeless romance and, when the occasion calls for it, a few highly-entertaining action sequences. The acting is brilliant all-round from a large cast, which also includes a small role for Ernest Borgnine as Sgt. 'Fatso' Judson, Maggio's sworn nemesis. Winner of 8 Academy Awards (including Best Director and Best Picture), and nominated for a further five (including two Best Actor noms for Clift and Lancaster), 'From Here To Eternity' deserved them all. This is a film that reminds us why we watch movies in the first place.",9,2,4,5 February 2007
Atonement," 'I will return; find you, love you, marry you and live without shame.'
","Joe Wright's 'Atonement (2007)' is a film that, on its glossy surface, seems practically perfect. The director has constructed each scene so meticulously that every shot looks perfectly positioned, every actor seems perfectly chosen, and every line sounds perfectly spoken. In the process of engineering this perfection, the film loses part of its heart, any sense of imagination or daring discarded by Wright's unwillingness to put a foot wrong. Adapted from Ian McEwan's critically-acclaimed novel of the same name, 'Atonement' is nonetheless an intriguing war-time tale of jealousy, naiveté and regret, and it offers much in the way of entertainment, despite lacking in depth. It's the sort of picture that is, dare I say it, tailor-made to appeal to the Academy, and a Best Picture nomination is certainly forthcoming, and not altogether undeservedly. A solid cast, including Keira Knightley, James McAvoy and young Saoirse Ronan, occupy the lavish sets, beautifully captured by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey; visually, the film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes.'Atonement' is divided into two distinct acts, contrasting violently between the luscious, sunny countryside of pre-WWII England, and the bitter, bleak, crumbling London that followed. The first act, probably the stronger of the two, takes place at a bright and cheerful country-house, where the eldest daughter in a proper English family, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), falls in love with the household's handsome gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), aged 13, witnesses this romance flourishing from her bedroom window, misunderstands the situation, and steadily builds a resentment towards Robbie, culminating in a final, selfish act of jealousy that forever wrenches the budding couple from each others' arms. The power of written-word plays a crucial role in the events of the film; it is Briony's interception of a sexually-explicit letter that proves vital in damning Robbie and Cecilia's future, and, in the tearful finale, an older Briony attempts to use written fiction as the only remaining means of correcting past mistakes and destroyed lives. Dario Marianelli's pulsating dramatic score also recognises this symbolism, employing the sounds of a typewriter to augment the events unfolding on screen.The second act of the film is a lot more subdued than what had preceded it, and, despite numerous memorable scenes, fails to entirely satisfy. Unlike the first act, the war-time sequences seemed to be heading in no direction, wandering aimlessly towards an undefined goal. Perhaps this was deliberate {during this period, nobody's fate was certain}, but, without any narrative drive, the film failed to fully hold my attention. Now 18 years old, Briony (played by Romola Garai), has discarded a Cambridge education in order to become a nurse, perhaps her first attempt at atonement for what she did to Robbie. Meanwhile, Robbie, having enlisted in the British Expeditionary Force, is trying hopelessly to return home to his true love, the horrors of war closing in upon him at every turn. The centrepiece of this section is a breathtaking long-shot on the beaches of Dunkirk, as Robbie and his comrades observe the chaos and confusion of the British evacuation, certainly the most impressive shot of its kind since Alfonso Cuarón's 'Children of Men (2006).' Despite drawing too much attention to itself, and doing little to propel the plot, the planning and co-ordination that must have gone into this minutes-long tracking shot is worthy of the ticket price alone.",7,0,2,20 January 2008
The Godfather," 'I believe in America'
","'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive 'family honour.' The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.",10,6,10,6 March 2009
