Hereditary," Masterpiece
","Oh boy did the horror genre need a movie like this. Be warned you Saw crowd people, you won't like this. It's too intelligent, too well done for you. This is for people who want a movie with real characterization, real feeling, whereas the dumbed down Saw crowd just want to see 2 hours of someone getting tortured and chopped up. This movie may not be for you.I want to give absolutely nothing away. There's not much more to say than bravo to everyone involved, and what an outstanding job by the cast. I have never felt such powerful empathy for characters onscreen in any genre of film, so much that this becomes genuinely difficult to watch at times for your shared pain with these characters.The tension is ratcheted up without mercy, slowly, relentlessly. Many subtle deft touches, little things that may escape the eye first viewing but resonate at a deeper level, as the nightmare coalesces, made all the realer for the bond you've formed with these brilliantly portrayed characters.Bravo. Restores your faith in the genre, relies on none of the cheap tawdry tricks of so many lesser horror films of late. Simply outstanding, and genuinely frightening like few other films you'll see. Deserves to be remembered as a classic long from now.",10,1,5,9 July 2019
Dark City," Cool premise, bad aesthetics
","Loved the idea and premise of this story.But the execution was pretty poor in most respects. The casting wasn't great - the lead for example, he's just not charismatic on screen, imo. They should have spent some money and got someone easier on the eye. This guy, he has a face which you could describe as 'extremely punchable', there's something off-putting about him, am I the only one who thinks so?Sutherland was good as the whacky doctor, but the alien guys were really ridiculous, I felt. Their speech an mannerisms, their look. They look entirely human, which is a great way I'm sure to save money on costuming & makeup, but how about behind closed doors we see their true form?Really cool concept, not a bad plot, but not really a pleasing sensory experience, this movie.",5,2,5,19 March 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Tolkien would be disgusted
","Boy oh boy, what a mess.Visually, it's gorgeous, although by now of course the CGI that so impressed everyone has not aged well and Gollum looks really unconvincing.Story-wise, they have raped and confused Tolkien's masterpiece and taken liberties Tolkien himself would never have allowed for all the money they'd throw at him. The hubris of the lady who altered this script is unbelievable - Farimir's a bad guy, huh? Whatever you say, lady. Probably a movie was never going to truly capture the nuance of the books, but they didn't even come close here... the cartoon in the 70s did a better job for God's sake.This has been watered down appallingly for the cattle. As long as it looks and sounds like a good movie, the cattle are impressed, as usual. Good costumes and music, that's all the cattle need. And of course Bad Guys all being clearly and obviously 10000% bad, the good guys are clearly and obviously 10000% good... angel music when they are on screen to make it even plainer, and sinister music for the bad guys, it's a good substitute for character.Every line of dialogue must lack subtlety to keep the sheep impressed, so of course even Wormtongue holding a parchment and saying: 'Theoden signed it this morning,' yeah even this has to be The Most Dramatic Line Ever Said In a Movie!!!!! Cue the music which reminds the audience they're supposed to Feel Emotions at this moment.Oh my God how embarrassing to see those actors trying to keep a straight face while talking 'elvish'. Gimli's character is nothing but lame comic relief - he's short, get it? Ha, ha.This whole movie was an enormous, overly long cringe. And the cattle cued for miles to dump hundreds of millions in the pockets of those who did this. For shame.",1,1,8,19 March 2018
The Game," Had me fooled - thought I was watching a good film, briefly
","Yeah it got me going for a little while there, thought this one was nicely building to one of those movies that plays deftly with the mind of both protagonist and viewer. A lot of you guys were fooled too considering the rating - this thing averages near 8/10, are you serious?Boy oh boy that ending... I don't ever remember an ending of a film so badly souring everything that's gone before. Wicker Man & the first 'It' adaptation come close... 'It' disappoints while 'Wicker Man' through laziness ruins everything that comes before (and the dumb ones in the audience think it's being clever). But this ending takes the cake. So they knew exactly how this guy would react, in a moment of extreme emotional torment, because humans are so predictable at the best of times, let alone under extreme emotional duress. They knew he would shoot, they knew he would jump. They knew precisely what part of the building ledge he would jump off, to the point they could plan where to put the big canopy to catch him. The ledge was a pretty wide ledge, had to be dozens of feet on one side, dozens on the other, but hey, they knew exactly what part he'd jump off. They trusted that he would land like a pro stunt man, on his back, not on his head, which would still have broken his neck, soft landing pad or no.And, um, the company doing all this... what the heck do they charge? The budget for this kind of ridiculous service would be many millions, so you're saying a skeptical Michael Douglas agreed to pay this before knowing what he was getting? And the company wasn't worried about being sued by a rich client if something went wrong, which, with this absurd set up and the risks involved, easily could have?Michael Douglas was good, which shouldn't surprise since he's playing more or less the same character he's played in nearly every film, the unsmiling corporate head honcho type. I gave it an extra star for that. This could have been a good movie if they had been willing to come to a different conclusion somehow, maybe something a bit more metaphysical, but then you might have confused a few of the stupider viewers, and as we can all see, those outnumber the rest of us. So you have to keep the cattle happy with junk like this. Enjoy. Moo, moo.",2,3,6,19 March 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Overrated
","Well I thought a movie that averaged over 8/10 would be better than this.Pretty standard fare, I thought, not all that clever or inventively done, not all that well characterized, and man did I lose all respect for DiCaprio's character when his wife turned him into a neutered sex starved puppy. That was in fact the point I switched off, so disgusted was I by this cheap garbage.I don't get the enthusiasm. The story is just not all that interesting, the characters not at all compelling. There are dozens of better rags to riches stories, and a little reading indicates this film is not particularly true to life either.Once again I'm in the minority, while the majority of the herd moos their appreciation for something that looks like it is a good movie, as long as you don't watch it too closely or expect a rich story driven by compelling characters.",2,2,2,19 March 2018
