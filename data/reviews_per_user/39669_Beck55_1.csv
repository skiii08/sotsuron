The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," WTF was that?
","(I never read the books so this comment is strictly directed to movie franchise)WTF WAS THAT? Almost 2 hours of NOTHING. God Damn it!, that was sad. It was a F-U to the public and especially to the fans. They might as well have sold us a bucket of sh*t, so we can carry something home because I got nothing from this movie. Not a laugh nor a cry, not even a boner (Bella looks like sh*t).Let's recap the series:1 - The first movie was OK, it was new and different. I actually enjoyed it.Then they started shooting sh*t into our eyes.2 - The second movie was exactly the same as the first (plot wise) but with wolfs.3 - The third had more action and featured the Volfucks and an 'army' (really? The word that's used is army?) of 10 young vampires who died in about 2 min. after the fight started.4 - Then came this piece of sh*t movie, the fourth, and its plot: (ATTENTION THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE YET SKIP THE FOLLOWING LINE!!!) Edward and Bella get married and have a kid - F-U!.I don't understand why the final part of the series had to be split in 2. This movie would've taken 30 min. (tops) of the Breaking Dawn complete movie.They really took a massive dump on the fans. And yet, some of then appear here to defend the movie which we all know (fans and none-fans) it was absolute crap.",1,84,123,21 November 2011
