50 First Dates," a lovely film
","I really liked this film, i thought it was funny and light hearted. drew barrymore acted wonderfully, being funny and sweet at the same time. adam sandler was just adam sandler. It was a good idea for a movie, and you really feel for them. i think it seems like a fairytale story. this film made me smile, and the little plots are lovely. i think it didn't follow the typical film type sterotyping, and stood out from other films. Its just a light hearted film, and i think its right up there with the standard of the wedding singer.its a gorgeous movie and i recommend everyone watch it on a Sunday night, with a big bucket of popcorn.",10,0,0,14 September 2004
