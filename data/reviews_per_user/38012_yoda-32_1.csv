Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the greatest action movies ever!
","This is a rip- roaring action film, from the brilliant minds of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The action is top- notch, the pacing is terrific, the scenery is spectacular, and Harrison Ford's acting is great. All in all, this is one film that shouldn't be missed.",Null,0,0,12 February 1999
