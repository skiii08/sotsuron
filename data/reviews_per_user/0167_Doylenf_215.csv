The King's Speech," The king who didn't fall off his horse conquers his stuttering in a film that humanizes the Royals
","THE KING'S SPEECH may not be a truly great film but it comes close. The acting is splendid, the costumes well-researched, the background score including some classic pieces of Mozart and Beethoven is inspiring, and Tom Hooper's direction is admirable.What hampers the film is the fact that it's protagonist, a stuttering man (Colin Firth) who must ascend the throne when his brother (Guy Pearce) abdicates, is really quite a dull man with a fierce temper and an inability to express himself as a person until he meets the challenge of a speech therapist. But for all his courage in overcoming his handicap, he keeps the story from moving forward until the last thirty minutes when the story's stature becomes more important because of the impending threat from Hitler and WWII.However, it must be said that Colin Firth plays King George VI with gusto, matched only by Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Logue, his therapist. The two of them create sparks in many a confrontational moment of truth, and each has a firm grip on their roles. Equally proficient, but less noticeable and given a smaller amount of screen time, is Helena Bonham Carter as the gracious and adoring woman who stands by her stubborn man and presides over a household of two children, one of whom is a future Queen of England. In a lesser but still rich role, Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII. But unfortunately, because of the film's preoccupation with King George's speech impediment, the film moves forward at a snail's pace and only becomes more urgent during the final half hour when the world awaits the king's reaction to the news that Great Britain has failed to prevent war with Germany.All the technical merits make the film outstanding in various departments, particularly the cinematography, costumes, settings and music. Colin Firth deserved his Oscar and Geoffrey Rush would have deserved a nomination as a Best Actor rather than Best Supporting Actor since his role his clearly a co-starring one.More importantly, the film does a grand job of humanizing the Royals.",7,2,3,14 May 2011
Saturday Night Fever," Disco movie gave Travolta his shot at fame...
","For disco fans, 'Saturday Night Fever' must be like going to heaven. It's only when JOHN TRAVOLTA, as Tony from Brooklyn, is doing his thing on the dance floor (energetic, dazzling twirls, leaps and steps lit by rosy glows of strobe lights) that it really comes alive. The story itself is rather mundane, about an arrogant boy's restless search for something to do on week-ends to get away from his everyday living in a Brooklyn tenement.But when the Bee Gees music is in full blast and JOHN TRAVOLTA shows the Brooklyn gang what he can do on a dance floor (in that white suit), we can see the kind of immediate appeal this film had in the midst of the Disco Era. You might call it a microcosm of the '70s craze for this kind of dance music.All of the scenes capture New York City nicely (especially those bridge scenes at night), but there's nothing deep here in exploring Tony and his restless energy while he seems to be a loser at love and finding himself. Nor are his friends anything more than cardboard cutouts of stereotypes we've all seen before, most of them with accents even stronger than Tony's and somewhat dumber, some of them yearning for jobs and a little respectability.Summing up: Great for Travolta fans, all others beware, it may not be your kind of music--or film.",6,1,2,9 October 2006
Angels & Demons," Brilliant suspense thriller with some spectacular photography...
","Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.One of the best action thrillers of the year, highly entertaining and full of gripping suspense.",7,9,15,19 May 2009
Vertigo," The kind of film that improves with a second viewing...
","An artful mixture of romance, suspense, atmosphere and mood make 'Vertigo' a stunning film to watch and experience. Bernard Herrmann's almost mystical score accentuates the feel of the story, giving it a kind of dreamlike quality--sometimes nightmarish, depending on the events unfolding. Probably no Hitchcock film ever made better use of a scenic locale with its San Francisco setting making a perfect backdrop for the story. It starts slowly but as the mood of obsession and the 'other world' quality of the story takes shape, your senses sharpen and you want to see how it all turns out. James Stewart and Kim Novak are perfect in the leads. I have only one reservation--I am not a fan of Barbara Bel Geddes' stagey style of acting and found her a jarring minor note in the story. The clever plot with a surprise ending is one of Hitch's best works--a richly satisfying experience and a beautiful film to watch. Will have you wanting to view it again for a deeper exploration of its twists and turns.",Null,2,4,22 April 2001
Black Swan," Unstable ballerina loses grip on reality and becomes The Black Swan...
","It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.The highlight of BLACK SWAN is the presentation of the ballet music and all of the behind-the-scenes tension brought on by the determination of ballet maestro VINCENT CASSEL to find a dancer who can be both The White Swan and The Black Swan with equal expertise. He is impressed by NATALIE PORTMAN's skill as The White Swan but tells her she must experience life and love to the utmost in order to provide the proper passion for her darker side as the evil swan. What's hard to believe is that he doesn't spot the flaws in her personality that make her unable to come to grips with the demands of the ballet world. However, his performance is excellent, as is MILA KUNIS as her cunning rival.Portman's mother (BARBARA HERSHEY) seems to be as neurotic as her unstable daughter in a Mommie Dearest sort of way. Their scenes together amp up what we know is bound to be a fatalistic end to an unhappy story. As the rival ballerina, MILA KUNIS provides plenty of jealousy for Portman, already unnerved by the demands that Cassel places on her emoting. Inevitably, Portman is pushed over the edge by all of her hallucinations and insecurities until she falls into a pit of darkness from which there is no escape.Portman's skill as an actress is evident, overcoming any objections some might have to the heavy use of a body double for the difficult ballet moves. She gives her character dimension and pity, despite the unpleasant aspects of the character's irritating personality.Worth a look for the performances alone, but beware that the dark side looms large in just about every scene which some might find too depressing for their taste and the sexual content is close to pornographic at times.",7,10,16,12 May 2011
The New World," Gorgeous but empty canvas of primitive art...
","It's incredible to think what a great movie this could have been if as much attention was paid to giving us a literate script as was paid to reconstructing history with villages, Indians, battles, and sets that look like the real thing. The photography is breath-taking throughout, the acting is sincere, but the pace of the film is beyond slow as it recounts a vision of what is said to have happened when the colonists came to form America's Jamestown side by side with some savages who owned the land.The John Smith/Pocahontas theme is nicely handled although all of this kind of story was handled in much more robust fashion by Disney's crew a few years ago when they did their animated version of the tale. And it was a might more entertaining than the way it is recounted here.There is a wistful quality to the whole story and gorgeous landscapes to gape at, authentic sunsets with boats in full sail, and some very convincing looking battle scenes with Indians in full mode as painted savages. Nothing has been spared to give the look of the film authenticity and detailed realism.But as entertainment, it falls far short of the mark. A huge part of the problem is a dull script with Colin Farrell given no opportunity to develop his role as John Smith and Christian Slater reduced to a secondary supporting role as John Rolfe, as is Christopher Plummer.James Horner's music sounds appropriate enough although it is strangely silent at times when some emotional depth could have been aided by his score.Summing up: Deserves credit for being an ambitious project, but ends up being a gorgeous empty canvas of primitive art with limited appeal to students of American history.",6,5,10,9 May 2006
Walk the Line," Exceptional performances raise the level of excellent bio...
","It's been a long time since I've been privileged to see two such heartfelt performances as are given by JOAQUIN PHOENIX and REESE WITHERSPOON in this excellent bio of Johnny Cash. It's a bittersweet love story of how a good woman is able to handle the difficult, stormy relationship with a man and redeem him with her love. And around these two, are performances of such high caliber that the result is a deeply satisfying feeling that you've experienced the pain and love along with the characters.The supporting cast does wonders, each and every one of them is absolute perfection. Mention must be made of DALLAS TAYLOR as the man who auditions the guitar-strumming trio and makes a very important suggestion; ROBERT PATRICK as the callous, indifferent father who creates scenes of enormous tension when he clashes with his son's lifestyle of drugs and opulent living; WAYLON PAYNE as the frenzied Jerry Lee Lewis, doing a remarkable job in his first acting role and showing the kind of charisma that makes him stand out among the supporting cast of musicians.Admirers of Johnny Cash should enjoy the movie unless they want to quibble with the fact that Phoenix does not have the same deep timber in his singing tones that Cash had, except for certain moments where his lower register does get a chance to show. But Phoenix is an extremely talented actor who rises to the challenge here. His chemistry with Reese Witherspoon is especially powerful in a quieter moment early on when they meet at a coffee shop. And from that moment on, the chemistry is palatable until the final sweet moment when she finally says 'yes' to his marriage proposal.An excellent film, even for those who are not at all familiar with the darker side of Cash's life. Well written and directed with the right kind of atmospheric effects to make it completely believable.",8,1,2,6 April 2006
The Sound of Music," Timeless musical is a sheer joy...a Julie Andrews triumph!
","Not even the overwhelmingly gorgeous scenery of the Alps can dwarf Julie Andrews' contribution to 'The Sound of Music'. She outshines the scenery and delivers what is probably the best performance by an actress in a screen musical--ever!! This fact is made even more impressive by the fact that the role was originally played on Broadway by Mary Martin--no slouch herself when it comes to musical stardom.Fortunately, under Robert Wise's magnificent direction, she is surrounded by top talent, all shown to great advantage in highly suitable roles. Richard Haydn as the Von Trapp manager almost steals every scene he's in; Christopher Plummer does a sly job as the tough as nails patriarch whose heart is melted by the charming governess; and Eleanor Parker does a magnificent job as the Countess, who, during one of the children's spontaneous home concerts, observes wryly: 'Why didn't you tell me to bring my harmonica?'And the children, of course, are all scene stealers. The final concert is staged for dramatic effect and pushes the movie toward its suspense-filled climax before the successful exit over the Alps. All of the numbers, in fact, are brilliantly staged--whether indoors or outdoors--and the movie spins along at a fast and merry clip.Sugar-coated? Sure. But given all the plus factors--including that brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein score--how can anyone complain? A film of undeniable charm and beauty--visually and vocally--a treat for the whole family.",Null,0,5,10 May 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Good entertainment but should have been better...
","There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience. Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his 'nice' score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's high security--or is it??",Null,3,8,12 May 2003
Ghost," Clever, charming, totally in command of some weird material...
","Whether or not we believe that in the afterlife we're all very much concerned with unfinished business and can simply contact a medium when we want to get in touch with the physical world, GHOST is a complete charmer from beginning to end.It all starts when a couple of yuppies (PATRICK SWAYZE and DEMI MOORE) are strolling back to their luxurious apartment one night. He's an investment counselor and his digs are something to kill for. However, that's not the reason he's murdered by thugs in an alley. Seems he's been on to a laundering scheme by some black market investors and it's a contract killing.Well, you can't keep a good man down and soon Swayze is interacting, at first in minor ways, with the living but is frustrated enough in trying to reach his wife so that he contacts WHOOPI GOLDBERG, a fake medium who has no idea that she is indeed able to hear words from Swayze until he starts prompting her and giving her information about him that only he and his wife know in order to convince Moore to pay attention to him. As one of the bad men involved in the investment scheme, TOM GOLDWYN gives a funny, terrific performance in a key supporting role. Much of the humor comes from his work and, of course, Whoopi, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her insolent supporting role, as well as a Golden Globe.Whatever, it all works even though it seems highly preposterous when you stop to think about it. But the lines are so clever, the interaction between ghosts and real people so inventive, and the climax so satisfying that you can't help admiring how the screenwriters were able to take a very difficult subject and turn it into one of the smartest comedy/drama achievements of the year.Summing up: Highly recommended for some good chills and lots of laughs.",7,1,2,4 November 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," As exhilarating as a rollercoaster ride...and twice as much fun!
","When I was a kid, the adventure classic of all time was 'Gunga Din' (and seen today, it's still a fun-filled classic full of suspense and adventure). But not until 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' did another film take its place alongside that gem. This stands as one of the cinema's greatest comic-strip type of adventures. If you really believe any of this could really have happened you've gotta be out of your mind. But it doesn't matter--the story is told with such tongue-in-cheek style and flourish for comic effects (even at the most dangerous moments)--that you know you're just supposed to sit back and enjoy it for the Saturday afternoon treat it is.
Biggest asset--aside from the casting of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones--is the magnificent musical score by John Williams. He never ceases to astound me with his talent--probably the finest film composer heavily influenced by the great scores of the '30s and '40s (by Erich Wolfgang Korngold)-- rich in texture and symphonic sound. Truly a master at making a film seem even better than it is.The villains are splendid, the heroine is gutsy, the chases are memorable and the look of the film is extraordinary in its attention to period detail. The Nazi menace makes it all the more riveting. Well worth your time--you won't be disappointed. And watch for that marketplace shooting--it's the film's biggest howl.",Null,3,7,6 May 2001
United 93," Finale weakened by use of Cinema Verite style...
","UNITED 93 would have been a much more powerful film if all of the airborne scenes aboard the doomed plane matched the clarity and intensity of the ground control scenes which are the most intense and best edited sections of the whole film. Instead, the director has opted for shaky hand-held camera movement and blurry fast-cut moments to obscure what happens when the passengers decide to revolt. This considerably weakens and defeats what otherwise would have been a brilliant film.After all the build-up to that final moment when the passengers decide to do something about their fate in the hands of hi-jacking terrorists, there is a distinct letdown in the way these moments are portrayed, in 'cinema verite' style with intentionally shaky camera movement, blurry action hiding the possibility of viewing anything clearly. It's as though the camera is on fast forward for the whole uprising event without anyone able to make out what is actually going on.This, and the fact that we learn nothing whatsoever about any of the passengers--making them complete non-entities--is what ruins the film for me. Seeing them in a huddle whispering things like 'Two planes went into the World Trade Center' is not sufficient dramatic device to make these events tangible to the average audience. Only those who were close to this event or had personal connection to it through relatives, will find this sufficiently chilling.A big disappointment to me as a film. I don't think the Academy will be voting this into the winner's circle at Oscar time.On the plus side, the music is dramatically appropriate and does add to the intense quality of many scenes. All of the control tower sequences are better staged and directed than the passenger moments when they decide 'to roll'. That is the film's weakest link. It ends with a whimper instead of a bang, defeated by the director's choice to use cinema verite style for the most explosive scenes.",7,5,11,4 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Charming fantasy with great John Williams score...
","When a little lost alien meets a 10-year-old boy (Henry Thomas), the plot of E.T. takes off and soars to a rollicking conclusion with a tearful farewell scene that is given an almost operatic quality by John Williams' emotional music. Williams wrings every drop of emotion out of his skillful score--one of his very best.Along the way we're treated to a series of misadventures involving the alien--one of the funniest is the Halloween sequence--another memorable one is the chase when the bicycles lift off the ground and soar into the sky against a full moon. Henry Thomas, as the little boy who feels a close kinship with the ugly alien, gives what is undoubtedly one of the finest performances ever by a child star. Not long after the release of the film, I recall seeing him perform in front of a group of celebrities at some shindig where the spotlight was on him as he went through the paces of a dramatic scene. The cameras caught the people watching--one of them was actress Olivia de Havilland who was watching with rapt admiration, clearly seeing that his was a major talent.There is manipulation, to be sure. The emotional ending is guaranteed to leave you wiping your eyes as Elliot (Henry Thomas) learns that friendship knows no earthly bounds.Only drawback is the film's length--but nevertheless, a fine family film for the young, marred only by the use of some vulgar language.",Null,1,2,11 May 2001
Casablanca," As time goes by, it's still one of the all-time greats...
","While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some 'off the cuff' comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film:'It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.
Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.'And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!!  As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar!Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! As time goes by, we still have 'Casablanca'...",Null,87,115,17 May 2001
Minority Report," Cruise in the world of 2054 makes a good action hero...
","MINORITY REPORT creates such a futuristic world of virtual reality that you can almost forgive some of the missing logic in the premise that has pre-cogs causing Cruise to hunt down the man he's supposed to kill (although he's never met him!). It's the kind of film you can enjoy even if you spot some of the flaws in the logic.However, despite some of the ingredients that don't quite make sense, it's a thinking man's thriller and Steven Spielberg has produced it on a grand scale befitting a superior thriller of its kind. He's created a futuristic world that is full of larger than life plasma screens and the sort of technology that borders on the believable, given some of the advances already made today.The premise of the story is even more disturbing since we live in the post-9/11 world where much debate has taken place over the government's right to interfere in citizen's private correspondence (via telephone, for example), while fear of rights being trampled have led to sharp policy differences between Democrats and Republicans. But this, of course, makes the story even more timely and intriguing.TOM CRUISE gets to play his action hero role in more than a one-dimensional way and is quite convincing as the man on a strange mission to find the man he is destined to kill--unless he can prevent what the pre-cogs have predicted. And COLIN FARRELL and MAX VON SYDOW lend conviction to key supporting roles.Furthermore, John Williams has written a busy score that magnifies the tension at every turn. Summing up: Well worth viewing for sci-fi fans who want more than just action-filled, brain numbing excitement.",6,2,7,13 April 2007
Finding Neverland," A touch of magic...and some inspired performances...it soars like a kite...
","A behind the scenes look at a portion of James M. Barrie's life is given the sort of superb visuals one expects from high quality British films of this sort. The magic is there when the story reaches the part about Barrie's inspiration for 'Peter Pan'. From then on, the film soars like a kite into an enchanted land.What I wasn't prepared for was the fact that the story takes a sadder turn when dealing with Barrie's relationship with the widowed mother of the four boys (who, by the way, are wonderfully played by the most natural and appealing youngsters I've ever seen on film!) But the balance between laughter and tears is a nice one, finely controlled, so that at the conclusion you've been rewarded with a really satisfying piece of entertainment and a new perspective on 'Peter Pan'.The performances are all first rate, exceptional in fact. Johnny Depp continues to stretch with each role, nailing the character so perfectly that he hardly seems to be acting. The same can be said for Kate Winslet, Julie Christie (in a rather thankless but well played role), and, of course, by the magnificent child actor Freddie Highmore, who plays Peter. Not since Freddie Bartholomew has a child of this exceptional talent and appeal appeared on the screen. The chemistry between him and Depp is magical.Despite the tear-jerker elements, a film the whole family can savor and enjoy right up until the final credits. The most magical moments are the theater scenes, but the cinematography throughout on various locations is awesome.The pace is a bit slow at times but this is the film's only flaw. Most will fall under the spell of the storytelling right from the start.",8,3,3,9 July 2005
Lifeboat," Claustrophobic but still suspenseful tale on the open seas...
","There are times during LIFEBOAT where the claustrophobia can't be avoided, since Hitchcock chose to film it on one set--a lifeboat in the open seas. But thanks to his craftsmanship, it never ceases to absorb the viewer as it becomes a tightly-knit character study of the survivors and their interaction.Most prominent among the players is TALLULAH BANKHEAD, losing her possessions but gaining some humanity. She's described rather accurately by another poster as 'the Maureen Dowd of the '40s', the shallow but sophisticated columnist with a condescending attitude toward everyone but herself.But it's the WALTER SLEZAK character, a German among the survivors, who holds the most attention and proves that nothing can be seen in terms of black and white when it comes to human character. On the good side, he operates on WILLIAM BENDIX to successfully amputate his leg--but later resorts to murder when Bendix outlives his usefulness.The other characters are more or less stock types--but are well played by JOHN HODIAK, CANADA LEE, HEATHER ANGEL, HENRY HULL and HUME CRONYN.Summing up: Absorbing entertainment, stark tale of survival with the Hitchcock touch.",7,6,7,25 January 2007
Chinatown," Imperfect film noir never gets near the real 'Chinatown'...
","It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night. Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: 'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.'Robert Foote's screenplay owes a great deal to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, both expert writers of crime detective fiction full of sardonic humor and double entendre remarks, usually delivered in deadpan manner by whomever was playing the male detective.In both CHINATOWN and THE MALTESE FALCON, a private eye gets involved in a messy case involving murder and other assorted mayhem, drawn into the case by a cool femme fatale who knows more than she's saying, and a cast of mostly unsavory characters living in the fringes of L.A.'s Chinatown area where crime in the 1930s is rampant.In this case, the cynical, hard-nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination. And likewise, the inscrutable dame is played by FAYE DUNAWAY in the sort of part Mary Astor essayed in 'The Maltese Falcon'. Instead of Sydney Greenstreet, we get JOHN HUSTON in the role of her megalomaniac, corrupt father. And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.It's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles. Visually, it's a masterpiece--and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.A stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir. But somehow, Bogie's image hovers over most of the dialog and it falls far short of being called a 'masterpiece' as many have done here. A more concise, compact telling of the tale would have made that description more apt instead of this long, rambling story with its engineering background and slow revelations.",8,1,3,7 October 2006
To Be or Not to Be," Amusing comedy has the Lubitsch touch...
","JACK BENNY and CAROLE LOMBARD are ideally cast as a ham actor and his zany actress wife in TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a story of Poland facing the Nazi invasion and how a theater troupe gets to do some real acting by fooling the Nazi authorities.The real comedy highlight of the film is SIG RUMAN as Col. Ehrhardt, foolishly thinking that Benny is a loyal German involved in spying activities for the Fuhrer and afraid of showing any disloyalty to Hitler by telling Earhardt a joke poking fun at the Fuhrer. His scenes with Benny and Lombard are a joy to watch.ROBERT STACK plays the young pilot who always walks out on Benny's 'to be or not to be' oration as soon as it begins, for reasons unclear to Benny. STANLEY RIDGES does a nice job as the real professor doing the spying for Hitler, the man Benny must impersonate with some hilarious results.Must have seemed way ahead of its time in '42. Sadly, it was Lombard's last film. Shortly after filming ended, she went on a bond selling tour and was killed in a plane crash on her return to Hollywood and Clark Gable, her husband.Throughout, the direction is well paced and assured under Ernst Lubitsch's clever and light-hearted touch. Well worth watching.",6,1,3,13 July 2008
Se7en," (POSSIBLE SPOILER)...Serial killer story within a 'Law and Order' format...
","Watching SEVEN, you almost expect a beer commercial to interrupt at any moment because it's like watching a harder-edged, slightly grittier, mean streets version of LAW AND ORDER with a more experienced detective (MORGAN FREEMAN) conducting a sort of balancing act with his footloose, craving for action sidekick (BRAD PITT) wanting to get away from his desk work.It's gritty stuff all the way through, with neon lights flashing amid grimy apartments, chases through crooked alleys and across grimy rooftops and down fire escapes that break the tension of a story whose central theme is the hunt for a serial killer intent on showing off his skill to a detective he professes to admire. As the killer, KEVIN SPACEY adopts a zombie-like pose, a flat monotone and recites his dialog with a straight face--but he's never quite believable enough in the role.BRAD PITT spends much of the time protesting loudly against the authority figure who tries to calm him down when things get out of hand. But his final emotional scene is a challenging one and he does manage to bring the right anger, confusion and bitter resentment as he confronts the man who has played his final trick on him. He's unrestrained in this final moment and it's the kind of emotion the audience can understand at this point.MORGAN FREEMAN, as the more restrained, experienced older partner on the brink of retirement, is excellent but his final decision to open a box (without revealing plot details here) is a questionable procedure.Summing up: Some tense, well-staged moments but the overall effect is less than impressive as a study of a serial killer on the loose.Overpraised by film noir addicts.",6,3,9,24 August 2006
As Good as It Gets," As good as Jack gets...
","You'd swear JACK NICOLSON was playing himself, he's so on target with his character (Melvin Udall), a quirky, misanthropic writer who thumbs his nose at everyone with sharp wisecracks, delivered in that dull monotone he perfected so many movies ago. When he isn't shoving a cute dog down the incinerator chute or avoiding stepping on sidewalk cracks, he's just about the rudest patron any waitress (HELEN HUNT) could expect to meet up with. His eccentricities even extend to bringing his own silverware to his favorite restaurant and insisting that only one particular waitress serve his meals. Poor girl.But the opposites attract cliché seems to be at work shortly after they meet and gradually learn to tolerate each other before romance enters the picture. Meanwhile, Nicholson finds time to be rude to his gay neighbors, GREGG KINNEAR and CUBA GOODING, JR. who share the same floor in his brownstone apartment building.When it's all over, there's an uplifting, feel good feeling about the whole thing, despite the nastiness of Nicholson's character which is almost always played for laughs. All the players are excellent and each have their special moments. Nicholson and Hunt went on to win well deserved acting awards for their offbeat roles.A cheerful, wacky look at those strange creatures called human beings.",7,0,1,12 September 2006
Citizen Kane," NOT the greatest of all time...I never bonded emotionally with this coldly clinical film...
","Many times I've been tempted to watch 'Citizen Kane' just to analyze why so many consider it the greatest film of all time. No more than twenty minutes go by and I find myself BORED by this so-called classic. I have to admit I am not a fan of Orson Welles and always thought there was a bit of the smokehouse ham about all his larger than life performances--be it 'Macbeth' or Rochester in 'Jane Eyre' or the attorney in 'Compulsion'. But it is much more than just not liking Welles. I find there is a pretentiousness, an artificiality about the whole film. It's trying so hard to be symbolic about the 'true meaning of life', much the way 'American Beauty' attempted to show us that there is beauty in a plastic bag floating in the wind. 'Rosebud' is just as simplistic--quite a letdown, in my opinion, to discover that a child's sled is at the seat of the mystery surrounding Kane. Frankly, I just don't get it. What is so profound about this film that historians say it should be shown to young filmmakers as an example of great story-telling? I would rather succumb to the charms of 'How Green Was My Valley' (also in 1941) which took prize as the Best Film of 1941 than have to view this depressing piece of cinema that is supposed to be a thinly disguised portrait of William Randolph Hearst. Intellectuals may love 'Citizen Kane' and AFI must have a number of them on their voting board--but it does not deserve the high ranking they've given it. In my humble opinion, it fails to be even credible. The direction is self-consciously arty (see those unusual camera angles) and the acting sometimes borders on the ludicrous. Does not stand the test of time.",5,6,14,2 May 2001
Monster," Real-life story of a prostitute turned serial killer is realistic and chilling...
","CHARLIZE THERON has to be quite an actress. The only other film I recall seeing her in was GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING in which she was quietly subdued, demure, and looked like a charming young woman who stepped out of a masterful painting--a work of art.Here she is as Aileen Wuornos, the serial killer who spent twelve years on Florida's death row convicted of three murders and guilty of how many others, I don't know. I was afraid the film version of her life would show sympathy for the devil, but not so. While it does give you an idea of the hard knocks dealt her from childhood onward, it doesn't justify any of her crimes because of her bitter childhood.Theron completely captures Wuornos, her haggard appearance, her demeanor (mouth twisted in disgust, the darting eyes, the outbursts of raging temper tantrums), and makes the character so completely believable that it's like watching Wuornos, who was viewed after her capture by TV cameras and interviews.Christina RICCI is less impressive as the naive and immature girlfriend, dependent on someone to buy her things so she could 'hang out' and enjoy life. She comes across as a more limited actress who managed to play a couple of her scenes competently, no more, no less, despite excellent direction from Patty Jenkins.Had a hard time recognizing BRUCE DERN, who looked so much visibly older than I pictured him, that I thought he must be wearing age make-up--I guess I just haven't seen Dern in a film in a long time! A tough film to watch because it doesn't flinch from telling a pretty sordid story that made headlines when Aileen was finally captured and went on trial for her crimes. CHARLIZE THERON definitely deserved her Oscar for playing a very unsympathetic, mentally deranged character and making us feel her pain, as well as the victim's. Especially chilling are scenes involving the last two Johns, neither of whom did anything remotely deserving of the penalty she inflicted on them.",7,1,1,6 January 2007
Memento," I agree with Maltin's verdict...'pretentious pap adds up to zero'...
","I can scarcely believe the cult status this film seems to be getting here at the IMDb board. It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare 'from end to beginning', to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here. Are we watching the same film???",3,18,35,23 August 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino in top form with brilliant WWII anti-Nazi salute that dares you to look away...
","Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has 'The Basterds' (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the 'Jew Hunter' with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.Just brilliant.",9,7,24,21 August 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare's life turned into a bedroom farce...good but not great...
","I never could understand all the fuss and fury over this period comedy of manners that has GWYNETH PALTROW parading herself as a boy because women were not allowed to partake in theater centuries ago when William Shakespeare (Joseph FIENNES) was writing his passionate plays.First of all, anyone who couldn't tell that Paltrow was--well, Paltrow in boy's clothing--should have had his eyes examined. So much for believability. Then we have the miscast Joseph FIENNES looking like a Gypsy with an earring and a Mafia-like manner who wandered out of a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn to play the famous Bard. He's not a bad actor at all, just dreadfully miscast. To believe him as the writer of these passion plays is hard to swallow.Then we have BEN AFFLECK who appears and disappears from the plot for long periods of time--so long that we forget he's even in the movie. And COLIN FIRTH, wasted in a colorless role. And for some strange reason, JUDI DENCH appears for eight minutes as Queen Elizabeth I and gets an Oscar for Best Supporting Role.Not at all helpful for me to review the film is the fact that I put off seeing it shortly after watching GWYNETH PALTROW's tearful, hysterical Oscar acceptance speech. I was so turned off by her out of control moments that I swore not to watch the film. Well, I relented finally, but was severely disappointed by the viewing experience.Sure, it's an enjoyable costumed romp with lots of period flavor in settings and costumes and some nice color cinematography. But for this to win the award for Best Film over SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a disgrace I think the Academy will have a long time living down.",6,2,7,13 September 2006
Au Revoir les Enfants," Friendships, coming of age and loss of innocence during World War II...
","Emotionally engrossing coming of age story for boys at a French Catholic boarding school during World War II, where subtle changes in friendship evolve during a time when Jews were being persecuted by the Nazis and sent to extermination camps. Told from the boyhood viewpoint of children, it captures the fearful nature of children under enormous pressure from outside sources they cannot comprehend.The semi-biographical account by Louis Malle of a time he spent at such a boarding school is driven by the focus on two boys: Julien (GASPARD MANESSE) and Jean (RAPHAEL FEJTO), a French boy and a Jewish lad, respectively. They carry the main burden of the story and are both excellent in a cast that is uniformly good.The rambunctious behavior of a bunch of Catholic school boys is something I can relate to personally, having sung in a choir as a boy where I was surprised at the ruffians who, behind the scenes, were like street youths full of boyish pranks and rough-housing, until summoned to walk out to the altar of the church, hands clasped in front of them like little cherubs. This aspect of the French boys in the film rang true to me, their behavior being very true to life.The story is compelling, dealing as it does with the Nazis determined to find every Jewish lad they could, aided sometimes by collaborators who for one reason or another turned in Jews to the German officers. The ending is particularly poignant and well acted.Highly recommended and stands as a reminder of the cruelties of childhood and war.",7,5,6,24 October 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Rollicking good fun...some wonderful escapes...but a bit overlong...
","Darker than the first film, and even more episodic, is PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN with Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. He holds the spotlight most of the time even though he is up against some of the most fantastic looking creatures a make-up man ever devised. Hideous as they are, it's hard to look away when they come on the screen. The cinematography is stunning, but the fast clip of scenes is overdone and gets wearying after awhile.ORLANDO BLOOM and KEIRA KNIGHTLEY do nicely as hero and heroine, the sort of pair that harks back to the days of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Miss Knightley has a beautiful face but not quite the warmth of personality this sort of heroine should have. Orlando Bloom looks good with a sword but needs more work with his acting abilities.The busy, overly orchestrated score by Hans Zimmer pounds away at the music in what must be the most overwritten score of the year. Dialog manages to be clear enough except for Naomi Harris who mumbles some inexplicable heavily accented words as the exotic Tia Dalma that should have required sub-titles for all their blurriness.Most fun are the chase scenes wherein Bloom and others are locked inside some sort of a rolling wheel-barrel--but all of the special effects are handsomely staged for maximum effect. And surely, an army of stuntmen must have been kept busy on the sound stages for all of the action scenes.Depp's character is given some questionable things to do. His moral compass is not quite what it ought to be, even if he is the anti-hero of this swashbuckling epic. And much of the action scenes could have been trimmed to bring the story in at a length less than two-and-a-half hours. Perhaps with some of the action trimmed, there would have been time for more emphasis on exposition, especially for those who never saw the first film.Aside from these minor reservations, it's highly enjoyable entertainment for those wanting to escape the summer heat and looking for more than two hours of pirate fantasy with stunning special effects and photography.",7,9,17,2 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Piracy on the high seas never looked so good (on DVD)...
","Borrowing traditional elements from films like CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK and many other '40 tales of piracy on the high seas, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN goes further than all the other pirate tales by adding strong bits of fantasy that give new meaning to the phrase 'a skeleton crew'.
You'll see what I mean when you watch the moonlight scenes where the cursed pirates become shadows of their former selves--effects that are guaranteed to cop a nomination for the Best Special Effects Oscar. So too are the gorgeously detailed sets and costumes (all of which have an air of accuracy), as well as the make-up wizardry involved in turning these actors into reasonably convincing 17th Century pirates.Standout among the performers, of course, is the central role as played by JOHNNY DEPP as the rogue pirate who teams with ORLANDO BLOOM (who looks like a young Errol Flynn here), a man with pirate blood himself. Their combined efforts to rescue a damsel in distress (nicely played by KEIRA KNIGHTLEY) and search for hidden treasure in a cave while fighting off the villain (GEOFFREY RUSH) is all done in almost comic book style and flair. Everyone seems cast to perfection.Artistically, it's a stunning film to watch, especially on DVD where the images are richly detailed and the mammoth production costs are clearly evident in every frame. Beautifully photographed and with a busy background score that is reminiscent of the kind of rousing music that Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed for the swashbucklers of the past.Summing up: A jolly good show!! A fun ride all the way.Only drawback: its length. Could have been trimmed by at least twenty minutes of running time.",Null,1,4,12 February 2004
12 Angry Men," Claustrophobic but compelling story of jury conflict after murder trial...
","TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors. Gripping stuff, well worth watching.",7,0,6,7 January 2007
Beauty and the Beast," Perfect mix of music and animation...a solid achievement...
","I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics ('Belle's Song') which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions. Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on 'Be My Guest' (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, 'Beauty and the Beast'. Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more 'modern' style. Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us.",Null,88,104,3 October 2002
The English Patient," Too much going on...collapses from the weight of too many plots unfolding at the same time...
","THE ENGLISH PATIENT was eagerly anticipated when I rented the video. It had just won nine Academy Awards and I knew I was in for something special.WRONG. In the past, moviemakers used flashback techniques in a way that was not confusing. You always knew you were watching a flashback. Not so in The English Patient. In fact, you seldom know whether you are in the past or present, the blurring of the time span is so confusing. No wonder several commentators have said they had to watch it a second or third time to sort out the pieces of this gigantic puzzle. I can endure no such punishment.Technically, the film is brilliant and so are the performances--they can't be faulted. But to spend three hours waiting for all of the loose ends to come together for an unspectacular climax is just too much. What I resent most about the film is the irritating story structure which makes viewing it a sheer test of patience and endurance.Not a film I'm ever likely to view again! If I had to vote for a film I felt didn't deserve an Oscar, this one would be at the head of the list. Should have killed off the flashback technique for good for future filmmakers.",Null,1,3,9 June 2001
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Charming epic fantasy until the last big battle scene...
","There's an epic quality of grandeur about the wintry landscape of Narnia, the land ruled by The White Witch (TILDA SWINTON), existing beyond the handsome wardrobe chest in a stately home in the country where four British children are assigned temporary shelter during the war.The youngest girl, played by GEORGIE HENLEY with great charm and humor, is the first child to hide in the wardrobe and to discover the land beyond. The others soon join her, accidentally, and the tale takes on a darker turn as they learn the rules of the kingdom ruled by The White Witch and her cohorts.Performances are all first rate, the CGI is incredibly convincing in making all the creatures look and behave in humanized ways, and the story is compelling from the start. Once you start watching, you won't be able to turn away. But the last third of the movie tends to overdo the huge battle scene that rivals 'Lord of the Rings' for blood-thirsty excitement. Very young children may be disturbed by the realistic special effects that make the violence so real.Overall, it succeeds in being a fantasy that weaves a spell of enchantment thanks to the superb craftsmanship of costuming and settings.TILDA SWINTON does a remarkable job as The White Witch, looking like a pale ghost in her all white attire and playing the role with not a shred of sympathy for her viciously cruel character. Among the children, WILLIAM MOSELY stands out as Peter, the oldest child, who reaches maturity as a leader.Summing up: Delightful fantasy from the C.S. Lewis book.",7,0,0,27 November 2009
The Notebook," Touching, sentimental story of star-crossed lovers...
","Not since SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS has a love story so rich and tender touched my heart as THE NOTEBOOK--although, when reviewing it, I must confess its length is the main weakness. Surely, some editing would have improved the overall impact of the love story.It's the rich girl/poor man kind of tale with physical attraction being the glue that holds them together at the beginning until their love deepens and it seems inevitable that theirs will be a lifelong bond. Then the girl's wealthy parents disapprove of the affair heading toward the altar and scheme a way of separating them by sending the girl off to New York and leaving her love behind in the mid-west. His numerous letters to her are kept from her and gradually she comes to believe that their love has died out and is wooed by another, wealthier young man (JAMES MARSDEN) who is serious about cementing their relationship.But the love story is framed by a flashback technique that has the man, Noah (JAMES GARNER) telling the story to an elderly lady in a nursing home (GENA ROWLANDS) who encourages him to tell it, telling him she likes 'this kind of story', before she realizes, at the end, that the tale is about her own relationship with him. She is a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's and at one point suddenly turns on him and says, 'Who are you?'It's an unabashed tear-jerker, the kind I thought they didn't make any more, and it's a well crafted one with shimmering color photography of outdoor locales and extremely well acted by a more than competent cast that gets every nuance out of the complex characters.RYAN GOSLING as the young Noah is outstanding, perfectly capturing the enormous feelings he has for the girl, and RACHEL McADAMS is wonderfully sweet and sassy as the girl who has to decide which man she will spend the rest of her life with.For anyone wondering if they still made tear-jerkers in this jaded and cynical age of hard-edged films, this one fills the bill. Not since NATALIE WOOD and WARREN BEATTY went through all the triumphs and tragedies of bittersweet love in SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, have I seen a romance as touching and poignant as this one.",7,1,3,6 December 2006
Public Enemies," Detective: 'John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!'...
","Director Michael Mann has given us a stylish gangster film, the kind that Warner Bros. used to make in the studio days with someone like James Cagney as Cody Jarrett in WHITE HEAT.This time the gangster is real-life public hero, John Dillinger, played in JOHNNY DEPP style by the actor who is convincing as the man who, from the very opening scene, plans a prison break that Mann has filmed with startling realism that jumps off the screen. I say hero because that was the public's perception during the Great Depression of any man who could thwart the authorities and rob banks with such authority and skill.MARION COTILLARD is the love interest, the only angle of the film that reminds one of Hollywood hokum, the way the gals were always featured in the Cagney and Bogart crime melodramas--but she plays her part well and is especially strong in some of the final scenes where the police are giving her a brutal interrogation in an attempt to locate Dillinger.Technical credits are all excellent, including the photography and background music, evocative of the '30s settings. Interesting use of some Billie Holiday songs on the soundtrack are combined with an effective and unobtrusive soundtrack by composer Elliot Goldenthal.The only weakness is that most of the other supporting members are given little character development to work with--but since the camera is almost always on Depp as Dillinger, who gives a riveting performance, this can easily be overlooked. Good chemistry between Depp and Cotillard is an asset.There are only two other main characters of interest--Christian BALE as Melvin Purvis and BILLY CRUDUP as J. Edgar Hoover. Both are excellent. Bale comes across as a basically decent man from Tennessee who is practically forced into becoming an enforcer by Hoover who is anxious to get his Federal Bureau of Investigation started. His first job is to go after Pretty Boy Floyd. When Floyd is killed, Hoover knows he found the right man for the job of hunting down Dillinger and his gang.The shootouts are exceptionally well staged and there are many of them throughout the story of one of America's most famous outlaws. Although the film runs two hours and twenty minutes, there is seldom a lull in the storyline, thanks to some very impressive direction by Michael Mann and some fine performances from the cast.The windup concludes with Dillinger attending the Biograph theater to see Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA. When the police learn that he has a choice of two theaters, one of the detectives asks what's playing at both. We know they made the right choice for their ambush when a detective says with assurance, 'John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!'",7,3,6,7 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," The first time was the charm...
","Somewhere along the way, the makers of SPIDER-MAN 2 couldn't decide whether they were making an all-out action flick or a soft-core soap opera with the accent on Spidey's melancholy love affair with Mary Jane. The balance between action, humor and love story has been so skewered by what seems like the intrusion of action scenes that this one doesn't work as well as the first. Apparently, the makers wanted to humanize Tobey's character as much as possible.None of the fault lies in the performances. Tobey Maguire is genuinely effective in making us see Spider-Man's humanity. In fact, he's so good that if this guy ever gets a really deep character role to play, he's going to win some big prizes (aside from financial ones). He's a very sensitive actor, as revealed in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.Kirsten Dunst does her usual nice job as Mary Jane but there's a little too much of her long pauses between dialog to gaze intimately at Spidey. James Franco is fine as Harry Osborn who may in time become Spider-Man's next opponent if the ending of this one gives us a clue.But acting honors this time really go to Rosemary Harris, so warm and human as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as the harried headline-chasing editor of New York's most tabloid newspaper. Cliff Robertson does nicely as Uncle Ben Parker.Naturally, all of the special effects are mind boggling and the villain of the piece (Doc Ock) with his octopus-like mechanical arms is given plenty of action once his character is established. But personally, I preferred William Dafoe's villainy much more than Albert Molina's attempt to be Doc Ock. Not liking the villain of the piece is enough to make me give the first Spidey film a higher rating.Elfman's musical score is excellent. Most impressive stunt in the whole film is the way Spidey stops a runaway train from a disastrous fate.",7,0,1,20 July 2004
Batman Returns," Burton's dark vision of Batman's Gotham City is impressive...
","Tim Burton creates a dark vision of Gotham City and its inhabitants with BATMAN RETURNS, which begins with a stunning opening sequence with a freakish infant being disposed of by cruel parents, all to the pulsating and powerful score by Danny Elfman that sets the mood for the rest of the film.MICHAEL KEATON returns for his second turn in the Batman role, convincing whether he's playing Bruce Wayne or the masked crusader; MICHELLE PFEIFFER has a grand time in her dual role as Selena, the mousy secretary afraid to express an opinion or the aggressive, sensuous and sinewy Catwoman who finds a willing opponent and lover in Batman, a love/hate relationship that builds to a frantic finale. The wonderful MICHAEL GOUGH is Alfred, Batman's faithful, wise and all knowing manservant. And, of course, DANNY deVITO gets a huge share of the spotlight as the villainous Penguin, conspiring with power hungry Max Schreck (CHRISTOPHER WALKEN) to get rid of their opponent, Batman.While all the performances are right on target, it's the special effects and sets that dominate the story with its mean and twisted nature sharply accented by the dark foreboding appearance of Gotham City, its Herald Square resembling a bleak counterpoint to New York City's Rockefeller Center. MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT HINGLE are present in minor roles but the film is carried by Keaton, Pfeiffer and DeVito.The screenplay is about as dark and mean spirited as you can get with comic book material, but it's the dazzling production design that gets the attention all the way through, usually on the sinister and somber side. There's a nightmarish quality to some of the action scenes and Burton, of course, is a master at this sort of thing.All told, a very enjoyable take on the Batman legend, dark to be sure but never dull with lots of juicy dialog for clever exchanges between Batman and Catwoman in their game of oneupmanship. MICHELLE PFEIFFER is especially good at capturing the dual nature of her role--and makes a stunning Catwoman with a whip. MICHAEL KEATON is not an actor I personally would immediately think of casting as Batman, but he does extremely well in the role.Summing up: Dazzling sets, good script and Danny Elfman's mesmerizing score are a solid combination to make this Batman a worthwhile viewing experience.",7,1,5,10 February 2007
Finding Nemo," An underwater coming of age story in gorgeous splashes of color...
","The underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything Disney ever did in PINOCCHIO, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all.The slender story about an outgoing clown fish, Nemo straying far from his over-protective father (voiced by Albert Brooks) and getting scooped up by a scuba diver (to be deposited in a fish tank), is played for laughs all the way through. Despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. The writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day.Along the way, Nemo's closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac Dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres in what has to be the film's best voice-over. Her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics.The movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. I had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the one-liners.On an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely.My favorites: the seagulls all shouting in unison 'Mine!' whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship.",7,1,2,30 June 2005
The Great Dictator," The best moments are in pantomime...
","Since enough plot elements have been discussed in previous reviews, suffice it to say that although I enjoyed this legendary Chaplin film, it is by no means a masterpiece. It's slow in getting started and then becomes a series of heavy-handed vignettes about life in the ghetto contrasted with the life of The Great Dictator, giving Chaplin a chance to emote in high style as both the tramp-like Jewish barber and as Adenoid Hynkel. His funniest bits are of course whenever he does a brilliant piece of 'silent' acting with gestures timed to the background music--notably in the barbershop scene where a nervous customer gets a close shave. Unfortunately, none of the dialogue is as brilliant as his use of pantomime.Indeed, there is a heavy handedness about much of the story's pace and direction. It almost seems as though Chaplin told his actors to play against his comedy by keeping a sober straight face uppermost in mind--watch how Henry Daniell and Reginald Gardiner play their parts with that stiff upper lip approach. An exception is Jack Oakie as Napaloni, doing a brilliant take-off on Mussolini. As a poor Jewish waif, Paulette Goddard shows all the vivaciousness that made her a star in subsequent films throughout the '40s. She adds warmth to all of her scenes with Chaplin.Some of the gags are carried on at too great a length, outlasting their comic value. And criticism can be made of some of the sequences played against fake scenery when obviously a good deal of money was spent on the main sets. The station scene featuring Napaloni's arrival is staged on an obviously fake studio set where the painted scenery stands out like a sore thumb. Jack Oakie got his only Supporting Role Oscar nomination for this one and Chaplin won a Best Actor nomination.Whatever the shortcomings, it does manage to keep afloat with some very amusing sequences. Chaplin deserves credit for even attempting such a satire--especially considering this was near the outbreak of the U.S. entry into war. His scene with the globe shows off his rare comic timing.A final note: the six minute speech at the end seems improbable coming from the timid Jewish barber and strikes a false note because it's so out of character. Obviously, Chaplin intended it to give the film a personal message of hope.",Null,33,59,1 October 2002
Alexander," Battle fatigue after three hours of heavy conflict...
","Alexander is an ambitious project, whatever one may think of its shortcomings. The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick--and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood. His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes--a control she has over him as well, urging him to become the great leader in battles.Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog, full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur, but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction. He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character. Nor is his relationship with his lover (Jared Leto) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey, as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling.The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile, following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments--but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters.Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael, almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard. Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus, narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary. Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle, teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life.On the plus side, the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective, as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography. The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings. But the script is a yawner, going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points. It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time.This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs.",6,0,0,10 May 2006
Constantine," Hell on earth...appallingly bad script, bad acting, bad everything...
","CONSTANTINE is one of those Prince of Darkness tales that defies description. It's so bad, I kept watching to see if it could get any worse. It did.Nowhere is there any coherence in the shell of a plot. The dialog uttered by KEANU REEVES and RACHEL WEISZ is unbelievably bad. As the Angel Gabriel, TILDA SWINTON is just plain annoying as well as absurd. SHIA LA BEOUF does his standard sidekick routine to little effect.The demons evoked by special effects are the only halfway decent aspects of the whole movie, particularly the one that tries to break out of a mirror image by shattering the glass. But aside from a few gripping moments with demons menacing the principals, the whole story carries about as much weight as a jar full of feathers.Pretentious junk aimed at the audience that thrives on comic book delights--but insulting to anyone's intelligence with a script that defies description.Summing up: The hell with it.",3,0,3,27 October 2008
The Others," Gothic atmosphere and a few nice chills...keep your remote handy to turn down the screams...
","Nicole Kidman has to be congratulated for giving an excellent performance as a woman living on the Channel Islands in a deserted looking house with two small children who are always seeing ghosts. That's the thrust of the tale and the screenwriters have taken bits and pieces of other such suspenseful tales--'The Turn of the Screw' by Henry James about a governess and two children who communicate with spirits--and tossed in elements of 'The Haunting' and 'The Uninvited' to come up with a nice little ghost story.The picture could just as well have been filmed in black and white since it makes almost no use of color. The drapes have to be drawn because the children have an illness that makes them photosensitive to light. Fionnula Flannagan gives an appropriately eerie performance as a housekeeper who knows more than she's willing to tell and the children give expert performances. But it gives away its secret about halfway through (especially if you've been to the movies lately), so the ending comes as no great surprise.Biggest drawback is the pacing of the film--very slow in spots and bound to make you feel something should happen soon. And the dialogue, especially by Miss Kidman, is below a whisper--someone should have made sure the film got a good dubbing before release--the music often drowns out some key passages in the dialogue, hindered even further by Miss Kidman's attempt at a proper accent. Best watched with the remote in hand to adjust the volume for the soft spoken passages--and to turn it down for the screams!!",Null,0,1,21 June 2002
Troy," Spectacular battle scenes dwarf the human drama...Brad Pitt miscast...
","The biggest flaw in TROY is that BRAD PITT, while looking more buff than ever and obviously having trained for the battle scenes with a personal trainer, is a disappointment as Achilles. He pouts his way through the entire role like a petulant child rather than a mature man who wants his name to down in history as a great warrior.When pitted against an acting giant like PETER O'TOOLE his lack of charisma in the role shows badly. Furthermore, he's simply miscast. The film needed someone who could give gravitas to the role. In old Hollywood, it's the sort of part that would have been ideal for someone like GARY COOPER.Everyone else fares a lot better. ERIC BANA, PETER O'TOOLE and SEAN BEAN are excellent, while ORLANDO BLOOM struggles to make the role of Paris come alive. He's at a disadvantage every time he shares a scene with his brother, ERIC BANA, as Hector. Bana gives the kind of intense performance that Brad Pitt never achieves. Nor does DIANE KRUGER bring more than a beautiful face to the role of Helen of Troy.But the film itself is glorious to watch. There's spectacle galore for each huge battle scene and some of the human conflicts are well staged, although most of them seem dwarfed by all the lavish sets and costumes. There's stunning realism to all the battle scenes but the highlight is the way Bana and Pitt fight a duel to the death.James Horner has composed a marvelous score, full of exotic color and adding a lot of texture to the overall drama.The cinematography is gorgeous, especially all of the outdoor shots showing the vast landscape populated by a vast army (thanks to CGI) and the fleet of Trojan ships nearing shore.Summing up: Enjoyable view of ancient times, but purists will object to all the changes made in 'The Illiad' on which it's loosely based. Fans of action films will get their money's worth.",7,1,4,11 August 2007
Brokeback Mountain," The bittersweet final scenes are enough to melt the heart...
","I held it all together until that final scene where HEATH LEDGER goes to the farmhouse to see Jack's parents. And then, on top of that, the last jacket scene where his eyes well up with tears--well, at that point the story really got to me and I wept with him.It touches anyone who has been in and out of love--and it's a universal theme that's explored here--and explored so brilliantly.Ang Lee has directed with a sure touch throughout, leading to that final devastatingly emotional--and yet understated scene that ties up the whole story. HEATH LEDGER, with his stealthy glances and shy, twisted smile and grimaces, reminds me of the young and still raw STERLING HAYDEN in his first early Technicolor film. But unlike Hayden, who had not yet learned to act, Ledger gives his all to a complex role that fits him like a glove. No less fascinating is JAKE GYLLENHAAL as the more open and natural man who longs for a lifelong friendship without all the separations that their marriages bring.And finally, Heath's character, Ennis del Mar, is left with nothing but his friend's shirt and jacket worn on Brokeback Mountain--and the bittersweet memory of what might have been a more fulfilling relationship all that time but one that would have made them outlaws in the world they inhabited.The female roles are more peripheral but all are extremely well played, especially by Michelle Williams. The music is non-obtrusive, always reflecting mood and character and the sumptuous outdoor settings are photographed with great skill.A very rewarding film that is much more than just 'a gay cowboy movie.' It's an enriching experience--and one that will make you think and ponder--especially all of those who may have been on this road before.",8,25,30,4 April 2006
Ed Wood," Ghoulishly funny...Depp and Landau are superb...
","Absolutely brilliant film on the bizarre and quirky cross-dressing filmmaker Ed Wood, played with boyish enthusiasm by JOHNNY DEPP in one of his most offbeat roles. He's the anchor who grounds the film in all its believable foolishness.Equally skillful are all the surrounding performances, including MARTIN LANDAU (who deservedly won a Supporting Role Oscar), BILL MURRAY, who does amazing things with an underwritten role as a man eager to change his gender, JEFFREY JONES as Criswell, the Magician, and VINCENT D'ONOFRIO as Orson Welles.But it's the caring relationship between Depp and Landau that defines the comic genius of the film and gives it heart. Both are extremely moving and adept at showing the respect and regard they had for each other when their world seemed to be falling apart. The story doesn't flinch in showing Lugosi's fall from grace with his addiction to morphine and other drugs that eventually took his life.A near perfect recreation of the '50s Hollywood scene with its low budget studio settings, wisely photographed in the B&W manner of most of the Lugosi thrillers. Entertaining and genuinely funny, moving and absorbing all the way through. Summing up: One of Tim Burton's best directing jobs. Highest recommendation.",8,4,6,5 September 2006
Orphan," Well directed, acted and written--one of the best recent horror films...
","ISABELLE FUHRMAN, VERA FARMIGA and PETER SARSGAARD are hardly household names to me but they do a superb job of carrying the main suspense ingredients of ORPHAN--as does the atmospheric photography filmed among snowy Canadian landscapes.So do all the other members of the cast--all very convincing in their roles, especially the little deaf girl ARYANA ENGINEER. She's adorable and becomes a pawn in the manipulations of Esther (Fuhrman), the orphan adopted into the household before a background check can reveal the truth about her past.Of course, anyone familiar with the pattern of most horror films of this ilk can spot some of the usual set-ups: a husband who is clueless about seriously suspecting the orphan can be evil, the wife whom nobody believes because she has a drinking problem, the little brother who resents the intrusion of a 'different' kind of girl, the well meaning nun whose social worker instincts will lead to her downfall.But many other aspects of the plot come as a surprise and are, to say the least, unexpected and shockingly gruesome.And some threads of the plot can be suspected pretty early on. Still, the final twist at the end is shocking and satisfying, thanks to the performance Fuhrman has so convincingly given. She plays the role with such sweet and sometimes sinister maturity that the final revelation is acceptable.ORPHAN delivers the chills, all staged brilliantly and turning it into a horror film that is just as chilly as the ever snowy weather with frozen ponds and feathery flakes making the indoor sets of a rustic cabin look most inviting.Good direction and superior art decoration, as well as strong performances, makes this an above average thriller.",Null,2,6,28 July 2009
Home Alone," Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the Grinches Who Almost Steal Christmas...
","The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.
Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic. The proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!",Null,80,96,18 May 2001
L.A. Confidential," Hardboiled melodrama of crime and corruption amid 1950s Hollywood...
","One of the most hard-hitting, compulsively watchable movies of the '90s is this complex story of crime and police corruption amid lavish life-styles in and around the Hollywood of the 1950s. Never read the James Ellroy novel but I understand it's even more complex and contains even more sub-plots than the film--so you have to admire the screenplay that manages to dovetail all the main details together in a way that leads to a smashing climax. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey do standout jobs in the leads--and Guy Pearce is riveting as the intensely ambitious man who eventually joins forces with Crowe to solve the crime. James Cromwell is chilling as the Chief of Detectives, as is Danny DeVito as a tabloid journalist. Kim Basinger is good as the Veronica Lake look-alike--but did she really deserve an Oscar for this? This kind of hard-hitting shoot-em-up melodrama is a throwback to the Cagney and Robinson crime epics of the '30s--but the gore is more graphic and the sadism more intense. Not one for the kiddies--but mature audiences should find this a knockout. And yes, nice use of old pop hits--but 'Accentuate the Positive' belongs to the early 1940s, as does Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo hairdo. The story is set in the early '50s, but by 1952 that Johnny Mercer hit was ancient history and Lake was no longer using that style.And one more minor quibble: the Lana Turner look-alike did not in any way resemble the real LT. I'm sure all of Lana's fans would agree on that one! Lana had a much classier look and finer features.",Null,1,2,4 May 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," Global warming on a grand, grand scale!!!
","Despite some of the negative comments, this is well worth seeing for the awesome special effects alone. I wish the armchair critics would stop trying to analyze the 'logic' behind this project and sit back and enjoy a good blockbuster thrill ride, which is obviously the aim of director Roland Emmerich. It's not meant to be a serious documentary about global warming, for God's sake! Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than spellbinding entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize it's all in the realm of impossibility anyway--so stop nitpicking every little scientific point and enjoy what is meant to be riveting entertainment.The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.Sit back and enjoy the thrill ride!! Yeah, baby, it's cold outside!!",7,2,4,9 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," There's much to enjoy if you can follow the twisted plot...the visuals are stunning...
","For sheer magnificence of the sets, costumes, action scenes thrown together with vigor and a good bit of humor, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END is best enjoyed by not paying too much attention to the intricate plot. It seems that everyone has a personal history or agenda that's the exact opposite of the other, so at times the confusion is mind-numbing if you pay too much attention to the plot line.But it's sheer fun as a summer blockbuster with the further exploits of Jack Sparrow, played to the hilt by JOHNNY DEPP with a devilish gleam in his eye-linered eyes. And the rest of the cast is perfect, all of them fully a part of the scheme of things by now and knowing exactly what their function is--or so it seems. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY is more beautiful than ever as the feisty heroine Elizabeth Swann and is given much more to do. ORLANDO BLOOM is back as Will Turner with significantly less to do but he looks good doing it.And you can't find better character acting than that provided by CHOW YUN FAT as Captain Sao Feng, brilliant in the Singapore scenes, STELLAN SKARSGARD as Bill Turner, KEVIN R. McNALLY as Gibbs--and most particularly BILL NIGHY as Davey Jones, hidden facially by gigantic tentacles that are just one of the many CGI ingredients. Still, behind all that make-up, he does a fantastic job.I enjoyed it twice as much as the second installment although it is quite a bit lengthier. But there's so much to see, so much action and so many strikingly beautiful visual scenes to gaze at that it's hard to take it all in at one sitting.If you're in the mood for a tale with plenty of swashbuckling adventures told with quirky originality, this is it. And once again, JOHNNY DEPP gets all of the humor and eccentricities out of Jack Sparrow that he possibly can. He's terrific.Summing up: Cap it all up with Hans Zimmer's glorious score and you have a real good summer blockbuster.",7,2,4,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spidey still spins a mean web...but the romance is wearing thin...
","First of all, let me say that the romantic angle is played up more so in SPIDER-MAN 3 than it was in the other Spider-Man films, which is a distinct handicap for what is primarily an action film based on the famous comic book characters.It seems to drag noticeably in all of the quietly played scenes between TOBEY MAGUIRE and KIRSTEN DUNST, as his girlfriend May Jane whose singing career is stung by bad reviews. Then too, the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS, a warm and engaging actress, add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side.But fortunately, there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard. BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring. And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J. K. SIMMONS as J. Jonah Jameson, the harried boss of the Daily Bugle, notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills. He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene.There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man, the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City. His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves. He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role.But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick. He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing.Not as well scripted, but easily among the best performers in the film, is TOPHER GRACE, arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom. Unfortunately, this comes pretty late in the film (almost as an afterthought by the writers) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted.As it is, it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout, for such a long film. Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications, it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department.TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch. When his darker side takes over (and he's wearing that black suit), he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films, and his arrogance with dance moves--while staying in character with his nerdy side--are played for laughs which are intentional.BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray (the Queen of Scream), and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs. Marko.I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can. The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences, all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset. But, personally, I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one.",7,4,11,10 May 2007
Midnight in Paris," Here's a Woody Allen movie I wanted to like...
","Because I heard such good things about it. I ended up liking the bits of music in the background, the look of Paris itself, and two of its principal actresses--Rachel McAdams and Marion Cotillard, both of whom played their roles to the hilt.But I had trouble with Owen Wilson's habit of 'slavishly' portraying Woody Allen as the troubled central character who finds living in the past is giving him the kind of nostalgic glow he craves. It takes the full story to unwind before he finds a girl who likes to walk in the rain alongside him and is also an eager devotee of Cole Porter's romantic music. Wilson's imitation becomes tiresome before the first scene is over and from then on I had a hard time just trying to enjoy the film.Lots of name dropping goes on throughout the writer's story, once Wilson embraces the past at the magic hour of midnight. He meets F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Picasso, Gertrude Stein (a bored looking Kathy Bates), a macho Ernest Hemingway and a hilarious Salvador Dali adroitly played by Adrien Brody. There's a hit and miss aspect to the casting of these celebrated characters but they provide the right comic relief.But something seems wrong from the start, mainly due to the wrong casting of Owen Wilson as the protagonist. He seems as nervous and on edge as his mentor (Mr. Allen), but watching him is an uncomfortable experience.The film is slight but amusing, although hardly worthy of a Best Screenplay Oscar.",6,0,0,13 March 2012
A Bridge Too Far," A military blunder too overwhelming in a film too long...
","Although filmed on a spectacular scale and based on Cornelius Ryan's best-seller about a huge military blunder during World War II, A BRIDGE TOO FAR tries hard to keep the viewer enthralled for three hours but narrowly misses because William Goldman's screenplay had too many facts and incidents to relay. Not that this is a failure by any means--but it tends to become tedious after the second hour with one disastrous mishap after another being played out.What holds the attention throughout is the presence of an all-star cast, all performing extremely well, some of whom have only cameo roles. But Sean Connery, Michael Caine, James Caan, Edward Fox and Dirk Bogarde each make strong contributions with Connery outstanding in the largest role.The battle scenes are as realistic as anything ever filmed--sometimes painfully so--and there is a stark realism to the entire story under Richard Attenborough's taut direction. As good as William Goldman's script is, three hours is a long time to spend on an overwhelming military blunder. If everyone had listened at the beginning to Gene Hackman (as the leader of the Polish brigade) the outcome might have been different. Perhaps his Polish accent was too strong for anyone to understand him. He had me looking for subtitles.John Addison's military score is effective but nothing that lingers in the memory--as, for example, the military tune for BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. 
Summing up: For military buffs, an ambitious, large scale project that is just too long for its own good.",Null,2,9,29 November 2003
Zodiac," Suspenseful thriller is based on true, unsolved case...excellent performances...
","ZODIAC starts off with a bang, and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over. Furthermore, since the case was never really solved, there's no real payoff at the end--just more speculation.Despite this, it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle), its crime reporter (ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.) and cartoonist (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner (ANTHONY EDWARDS) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer.The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives. The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher, and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer. But after the murder of a taxicab driver, the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition.JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case. He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject. His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information. His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution. It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed.The other performances are uniformly good, but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role. Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain.Summing up: Suspenseful and well directed, but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work.",7,0,1,2 August 2007
The Prestige," Dark tale of magician rivalry takes many twists and turns...
","Perhaps there is such a thing as a story taking too many twists and turns, and not all of them credible. That's the major fault of THE PRESTIGE which pits two very ambitious magicians (HUGH JACKMAN and Christian BALE) against each other in a manner that hasn't been seen on the screen since Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played dirty tricks on each other in SLEUTH.But there are other compensations in THE PRESTIGE to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for the serious movie-goer. It captures the look and feel of Victorian England with its beautifully detailed sets, artfully low-key in lighting but teaming with vitality and authentic looking period decor.Then too, the performances are all at a perfect pitch to make it an ensemble cast of acting pros doing their best to keep you guessing until the final shot. MICHAEL CAINE is wonderful in a colorful supporting role as the man who devises some of the ingenious stunts and SCARLETT JOHANSSON makes the most of a rather brief supporting role as a traitorous magician's assistant. And as the scientist who leaves Jackman with one of his most inspired tricks, David BOWIE is excellent as Tesla.But the last fifteen minutes are shrouded in such mystery and some highly doubtful explanations that the conclusion comes as a bit of a letdown after all the build-up to what the viewer can only hope will be a plausible ending.Christopher Nolan does much better with this than he did with MEMENTO, even though the tricky story structure is again likely to add confusion to all the entertaining twists and turns that occur on a regular basis.But overall, it's a very entertaining and puzzling piece of work with sleight of hand magic at every turn.",7,1,5,20 March 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Burton finds the perfect material for his brooding atmosphere...
","Absolutely one of the most satisfying films visually that I've ever seen and it looks great in Hi-Def on a big screen.The visual treats are too numerous to mention, but all the way through this dark tale the camera lingers on some awe-inspiring shots that almost have a Currier and Ives feeling about them.The famous tale of the Headless Horseman by Washington Irving gets a new spin here with the plot elaborated so that JOHNNY DEPP is not a timid schoolmaster but a constable given the assignment to investigate the brutal murders taking place in Sleepy Hollow.Depp is marvelous in the role and it's easy to see why he was Oscar nominated. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is outstanding in the large supporting cast and Christina RICCI, while improbably cast as Katrina, finally convinced me that she's an appealing actress.Danny Elfman's score contributes greatly to the mood of the piece, drumming up the excitement for all the action scenes, one of which includes a mad chase in the forest with Depp clinging to the back of a horse drawn carriage while sliding on the ground on his belly.As usual, Burton gets a chance to show buckets of blood, so the faint of heart may want to turn away for the gruesome moments--and there are plenty of them. But overall, a very impressive film with expert costume designs and muted visuals that capture the right feel for this kind of story.Burton's elaborate revision really works.",7,0,0,27 September 2010
Gettysburg," General Pickett, telling Robert E. Lee tearfully: 'Sir, there is no division'...
","While GETTYSBURG has several drawbacks--mainly the sprawling amount of time taken to depict the fierce Civil War battle with two viewpoints and philosophies--it compensates with its historical accuracies while at the same time compressing the three-day battle into the framework of a lengthy film.Its major asset is the sincerity of all of the major performances--and that includes TOM BERENGER looking magnificently scruffy behind his impressive beard, MARTIN SHEEN as Robert E. Lee, STEPHEN LANG as George Pickett, JEFF DANIELS and C. THOMAS HOWELL as Confederate brothers, RICHARD JORDAN as Lewis Armistead and SAM ELLIOTT as John Buford.Another fine asset is the stirring musical background with patriotic war themes and drum beating exercises adding flourish to the drama. The sets, costumes and color photography are all first rate, but some will be impatient with the talk between battles which is sometimes a little too extensive. All of the battle scenes look like a re-enactment, a soft core version of the more graphic horrors of war that are rampant in many more recent war films.Still, it's an impressive film from start to finish and the performances are all admirable.The most haunting exchange of dialog occurs at the end of the battle with Pickett being told by Robert E. Lee to keep an eye on his division.'Sir,' says a tearful Pickett, 'there is no division.'",7,0,2,5 July 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Fascinating but definitely the sort of musical that is an acquired taste...
","Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B&W rather than drab color. Perhaps only the blood (of which there's plenty) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B&W, since this basically falls into the horror film category--with music.Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple, except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs. Lovett, the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street. She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well. JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer--so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer. Performance wise, he's fine.SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli, demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's 'Pinocchio'. ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd, as do most of the other members of the large cast.ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting, and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start. All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing. Perhaps after a few more looks at the film, some of them will begin to stick.It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals, although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting--even if the gushes look a bit fake. Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes, or so it seems, and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion.Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show. The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody, with rarely a glimpse of sunshine, and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes. We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning, no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined.Summing up: Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best, nor is this Tim Burton's best film--but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult, very demanding roles.",6,1,2,11 April 2008
The Polar Express," Enchantment, thrills, spectacle...looks great on DVD...
","On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, 'The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,' we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely 'get it'.Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job.",9,121,153,22 November 2004
The Best Years of Our Lives," The ultimate screen classic...a timeless masterpiece!
","The homecoming of three war veterans leads to the reality of altered lives and the inability to communicate the horrors of war in William Wyler's inspired postwar saga, 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. A key ingredient in its huge success was the perfect casting of the leads. Dana Andrews had the role of a lifetime as a bomber pilot who cannot adjust to civilian life, confronted with the realization that his wife (Virginia Mayo) is a tramp and his job situation is hopeless. Fredric March, as a banker, and Harold Russell, as a seaman minus both hands, are followed as they attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Under Wyler's direction, the film emerged as the most honest and unflinching look at the shattered lives of servicemen forced to rebuild their civilian lives while dependent on the help of family and friends. Winner of many Oscars, it certainly merited a nomination for Dana Andrews but he did not receive one. This fine actor was always at his best in his decent victim guise and gave a compelling portrait of a bitter man. A particularly poignant scene has him climbing up into the nose of one of the B-17s in a junkyard, reliving fleeting memories of the war that has changed his life forever.All of the actors do outstanding work--Fredric March (Oscar winner for his role as the banker), Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell. Seeing it is a powerfully moving experience--one of the great post-World War II films of all time.",Null,1,2,8 May 2001
Shutter Island," A thinking man's psychological thriller gets the royal treatment from Scorsese and company...
","Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.",7,11,25,22 February 2010
Capote," Fascinating portrayal of Truman Capote by Philip Seymour Hoffman...
","Philip Seymour Hoffman does a remarkable job of bringing to life every gesture and utterance of Truman Capaote without ever verging on caricature. This extraordinarily sensitive tale of the strange relationship between Capote and young Perry Smith is absorbing from start to finish. It does not let Capote off the hook for the way he exploits for his own gain a cold blooded murder that somehow resonates with him because of his own dark past full of mistreatment by an uncaring mother. He gains the trust of Perry Smith but is not always truthful when it comes to some basic issues he withholds from the killers.Capote, of course, wrote IN COLD BLOOD, and this is the subject of the screenplay which tells how he came to write the tale that forever changed the image of him as just the gin guzzling playboy who wrote BREAKFAST AT TIFFANYS. There are fine performances in all of the supporting roles, particularly Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper, Clifton Collins, Jr. and Mark Pellegrino--but it is the solid central performance of Mr. Hoffman that holds the film together. His final confrontation with the killers as they await their hanging is a good demonstration of just what an extraordinary actor he really is.Clifton Collins, Jr. cannot be praised highly enough for his Perry Smith and Mark Pellegrino makes a strong impression in the more underwritten role as the other young killer. They both register strongly in their final scene when all appeals have been denied.Highly recommended, especially for those familiar with the Capote novel that forms the basis for Gerald Clarke's book on which this is based. The ambiguous nature of the Smith/Capote relationship is left up to the viewer, as it should be. The striking cinematography using muted colors is especially effective in creating the right mood for this darkly disturbing story.",8,3,4,24 April 2006
Tangled," Combines classic old-fashioned charm with a modern twist...a true Disney classic...
","TANGLED is much more than 'a drop of golden sun.' It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.Absolutely a must for any animation fan.",8,2,5,31 March 2011
Empire of the Sun," Awesome...Bale's performance brought me to tears...
","EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a gem of movie-making. Visually arresting from start to finish, given a sumptuous musical score by John Williams and some of the finest cinematography ever seen, it is hard to understand why the film is not as highly acclaimed as it ought to be...nor is it fitting that it was nominated for six Academy Awards but received none.It's a sweeping epic but depends on capturing your interest by giving the main burden to the young Christian Bale who certainly has one of the great child roles of a lifetime as Jim--and becomes the character so completely that his final reunion with his parents brings tears to the eyes. By that time, the viewer has been through so much with him, watching as he grows from spoiled rich kid to a wily boy who must fend for himself among the wolf-pack of prisoners interred by the Japanese.Basically, it's the real life story of one boy's survival during the outbreak of World War II when he is separated from his British parents during the evacuation of Shanghai. It is a spectacularly staged evacuation scene that is topped throughout by other scenes of visual splendor and poignant moments that stay in the memory long after the film is over. The boy's fascination with the beauty of planes and the horrors of war are well documented--as is his strange fascination with the Japanese and his doomed friendship with a Japanese boy.The film falls squarely on the shoulders of Christian Bale, so much so that the supporting players are never fully fleshed characters. However, all of them within a limited range--including John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers--do magnificent jobs. Steven Spielberg's direction cannot be faulted. He has given us a closeup glimpse of war and its effect on people that can only be rivaled by his later masterwork, SCHINDLER'S LIST.Technically, the film is a brilliant achievement in all of its World War II details. And Christian Bale certainly deserved an Oscar for what has to be one of the strongest performances ever given by a child actor, with never a false step, every nuance just perfect.",8,6,12,28 June 2005
Glory," Powerful and emotional Civil War story with great ensemble cast...
","James Horner's music fills much of the background to give GLORY the kind of emotional level it reaches in telling the story of a group of Negroes who choose to join a ragged regiment headed by a young white man (Matthew Broderick)in the Civil War. Abetted by Horner's effective use of music and chorals in the background, as well as some of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, GLORY is a uniquely satisfying blend of war and humanity. As a film it's a gem.The blatant bias that exists between black and white soldiers is on display throughout, gradually tempered by the realization that the ragged regiment has become a family during arduous training. Denzel Washington as a bigoted black soldier was justly rewarded with a Golden Globe and an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Other around him are equally valid, including Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes. Broderick does a fine job in the central role of the young commander who gradually matures in the course of the battles and in his firm command of the troop.An aspect of the Civil War seldom shown is the participation of many blacks on the firing line. Both action scenes and intimate emotional tugs of war are blended seamlessly and makes for gripping and raw emotional moments.Based on a true story, it's highly recommended for expert acting and an eloquent script that benefits from fine direction.",8,0,2,17 February 2012
Corpse Bride," As always, a Burton movie with its own brand of grotesque charm...
","An amazing array of Gothic background details and a charming background score are given a chance to highlight the main characters voiced by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson in this Victorian story about a timid young man (Depp) and his anxious bride-to-be (Carter) who just happens to be dead. The voice talent of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson helps make their characters endearing, wistful and funny. Others in the talented cast are equally good.The absurd story gets loving attention to detail and mood, its atmosphere and look bordering on Charles Dickens at his darkest. All of it is given a sort of grotesque charm, no matter what the characters or situations are, including a singing maggot! Very original, with the charming 'piano duet' for Victor (Depp) and Emily (Carter) by Danny Elfman sounding like a segment of classical music.Admirers of Tim Burton's art of animation will surely rank this among his best creations. Rightfully, it was nominated for a host of awards in the animation field.",7,0,0,21 October 2012
Bridget Jones's Diary," Screwball comedy is still alive in this modern age but needs Lombard, Grant and Stewart...
","RENEE ZELLWEGER plays such a klutzy frump of a girl in this British screwball comedy that it's hard to imagine COLIN FIRTH and HUGH GRANT fighting over her. We're told that it's because she so 'natural' that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of 'Georgy Girl,' an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in 'Pride and Prejudice,' at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqué.But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.",5,0,1,29 September 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," Unpretentious, good-humored summer blockbuster has all the required trimmings...
","There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in 'Captain America' whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his 'Captain America,' before and after the transformation.As summer blockbusters go, 'Captain America' ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.And the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.Joe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.Likewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.Recommended for all Marvel fans.",Null,9,19,28 July 2011
Top Secret!," A parody of espionage films from the '40s, it's Val Kilmer's first movie...
","There are lots of laughs in this film from the Zuckers who know how to create visual gags that are even funnier if you know what film is being spoofed. The main plot (if there is one) seems to be based on a certain Hedy Lamarr film called THE CONSPIRATORS with she and Paul Henried trying to escape the Nazis during WWII's Lisbon.Homage to a lot of other Hollywood films are scattered throughout. Fast-moving and fun loose, it's one of those films where you're waiting to see what the next gag will be.Everyone plays their roles with a straight poker face, particularly VAL KILMER in the lead as Nick Rivers, a rip-off of Elvis Presley. He doesn't show any particular flair for comedy except when he goes into his Elvis act. Then the wooden expression vanishes and he's limber enough to give the impression that he can sing and dance with the best of them.JEREMY KEMP does his best to look sinister as a Nazi officer and LUCY GUTTERIDGE is the pretty wide-eyed miss who gets Kilmer involved in a messy espionage situation. All of it is played for laughs and there are plenty of those, but I suspect this will appeal more to anyone who has experienced all the movies being parodied--even, for one fleeting moment, 'The Wizard of Oz.' Summing up: Some uneven moments but generally an enjoyable romp. Kilmer went on to better, more serious roles for the rest of his career.",6,4,6,17 April 2010
The Godfather: Part II," Not quite up to the first Godfather film--but chilling enough...
","'I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out. Just my enemies.' So says Michael Corleone (AL PACINO) in THE GODFATHER: PART II.Pacino plays the part with somber seriousness that becomes a bit one dimensional by the time the film is midway over. Nor is the story as compelling as the first Godfather film. But you have to hand it to director Coppola, he keeps the viewer glued to the screen even when the pauses between dialog is a bit longer than needed. (No wonder the film is so long!!). And with the risk of being politically incorrect, you can almost smell the garlic in every scene, so realistic are the accents and the background flavor of the entire film.So many plot developments are almost throwaways because the screenplay seems to be deliberately ambiguous about certain plot elements. And yet, the film has a certain holding power and all of the performances are more than competent. Especially poignant--and chilling--is the scene where Fredo's fishing expedition takes place with stormy looking clouds setting the eerie scene to perfection as the expected murder takes place.With murderous intentions just around the corner in practically every scene, it's a fascinating film to watch, especially since the murders themselves are so deftly handled by the actors involved. DIANE KEATON is especially convincing in the final confrontation with Pacino.I don't think GODFATHER II compares favorably to the original film with Brando, particularly since it's not always successful in telling two stories--the one involving the young Vito (ROBERT DeNIRO) and the present story--but it still packs a wallop when it gets to the intense moments. The double strand of stories doesn't always mesh well, a weakness of structure that hurts the film. Despite this major flaw, it's a superior piece of film-making.",7,1,7,31 March 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Paul Greengrass does it again...shaky camera movement and fast cuts don't make a thriller...
","Not only is THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM snuffed by fast camera cuts that never allow the eye to focus on a single scene--evidently Paul Greengrass' idea of a film with fast pacing--but on top of that, we get the same shaky camera movement that he used all through UNITED 93 to give it the gritty look of a documentary.It doesn't work this time. The pace is fast, sure, but the price to pay is that no scene is allowed to run more than a few seconds before the next cut. This must be the sort of thing that pleases the MTV generation of movie-goers who like their action fast and streamlined to the nth degree. But for a plot to hinge on nothing but fast camera cuts is fatiguing after the first hour and tedious after the second.The story depicts the CIA as the model of efficiency, with everyone a crackerjack at breaking codes, flashing the latest movement of everyone they're spying on on their TV monitors, making one click of the computer the answer to everyone's detailed biography at an instant command. It's total hogwash. We should be so lucky that the agency is this savvy with their computer techniques and wire tapping. If it were, we could avoid something like 9/11 ever happening again.Having said all this, it manages to hold the interest only because MATT DAMON is riveting as Jason Bourne, running through the paces like a true action hero should, never failing to connect the right punch to the right victim and then go on to the next rooftop chase. JULIA STILES makes a rather expressionless heroine opposite him.But watching it, you have to suspend your disbelief that the CIA knows everything about everyone in a click of a computer key and that they can communicate with each other on a dime's notice. Hard to swallow. All of the action is pounded home excessively by background music that is anything but subtle in John Powell's explosive score.Summing up: Would have been a decent thrill ride if Paul Greengrass hadn't decided to direct the whole thing as a shaky camera exercise in fast cuts that obliterate any awareness of what is actually happening on screen. As spy thrillers go, this one is only passable.Needless to say, with all the hype the film has had, it's probably making big bucks at the box-office for no good reason.",5,4,14,17 August 2007
Fargo," Black comedy is a one of a kind sort of film...lots of shivers along with the laughs...
","FARGO is a rare kind of film that has you hooked into the story of a kidnapping that goes wrong and ends in a series of gruesome murders--and at the same time, it works beautifully as a black comedy.Principal reason for the humor comes from FRANCES McDORMAND and WILLIAM H. MACY who have the pivotal roles and play them with such skill that they'll have you laughing in spite of some of the twisted plot turns and sick humor sometimes involved. You won't know whether to laugh or cry. The wood-chipper scene was gruesome enough, but there are so many dark elements running through FARGO that it borders on film noir except for the excessive amount of dark humor and color photography.The chilly Minnesota climate, the grim settings for crime, the many plot twists and turns, the uniformly excellent performances from a cast of pros, all of it is guaranteed to make you enjoy every bit of the story as it unravels and reveals some interesting tidbits about the main characters.FRANCES McDORMAND really deserved her Oscar for Marge, the methodical lady police officer with the homespun values who finds herself facing some really grim situations. And WILLIAM H. MACY delivers another one of his 'everyman' roles as the ultimate bungler who can do nothing right.A one of a kind film, well worth viewing.",7,0,1,5 January 2007
The Aviator," Gorgeous but basically superficial look at Howard Hughes' life...
","THE AVIATOR is a film as eccentric as Howard Hughes himself. It never really explains the germ phobia that possesses him since we are only given one brief scene of his mother bathing him as a boy and requiring him to spell the word 'Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e'. This is supposed to explain his lifelong fear of germs--in effect, it's Martin Scorsese letting us in on the 'Rosebud' behind his movie before the story even starts--a tribute to Orson Welles perhaps.With that mystery out of the way, the film proceeds to tell, at length, about the most productive years in the producer's life, a span of twenty years during which he gave the world HELL'S ANGELS, SCARFACE and THE OUTLAW when he wasn't immersing himself in the mysteries of flight.Like HELL'S ANGELS, the film is best when dealing with the aviation scenes, although all of the Hollywood period elements are done with style, taste and flair. Cate Blanchett, although not exactly a facsimile of Hepburn physically, plays Kate Hepburn with a marvelous sense of timing that catches the Hepburn mannerisms. Instead of dealing with Hughes' other affairs with actresses, Scorsese concentrates mainly on Hepburn with fairly good results. The scene where she takes Hughes home to meet her clan of kinfolk is hilariously staged.The big test flying accident that did considerable damage to Hughes physically, is stunningly recreated for maximum effect. It certainly never damaged his spirit--and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes with considerable enthusiasm as a man with strong convictions about his passion for aviation. He does a brilliant job despite the fact that he was not ideally cast to play Hughes. His fans will be proud of his work in this one.Not so fortunate is Jude Law, who, mercifully, appears briefly as Errol Flynn. This is the first truly bad performance I've seen from Law, and a major casting error even though his screen time is limited. Gwen Stefani in no way resembles Jean Harlow facially--only the bleached blonde hairdo lends any credibility to her role. Kate Beckinsdale does a remarkably fine job as Ava Gardner--stunning to look at and giving plenty of gusto to her feisty role.DiCaprio carries the film and does so with a superb, consistently on target performance. It's clearly his best work since TITANIC.For a really insightful look at the man who was Howard Hughes you would have to look much further than this slick, extremely well made film that will no doubt please the average movie-goer.He was a complex man--a billionaire whose conflicting traits made him a paradox--part playboy, part businessman, part inventor--and possessed by demons that eventually destroyed him. It's quite an interesting film but Scorsese never really captures what makes the man tick.",8,1,3,5 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," Espionage thriller has a murky, far-fetched plot...
","As spy thrillers go, this one has handsome location scenery, car chases, narrow escapes and enough implausible fistfights and killings to keep any plot spinning until the happy ending fadeout. It's all done in a brisk, stylish, no-nonsense manner and played believably by Matt Damon (his escape from the top floor of a building would make Spiderman proud), Franka Potente as 'the girl', and Chris Cooper who tends to overplay the role of a CIA man obsessed with capturing and killing the amnesiac-ridden hero. Matt Damon's fans will be impressed by his judo and action stunts that appear to be his own, not a double's. His overall performance, however, is a bit on the bland side and lacking in the urgency his character should be displaying.The plot is never given anything but a sketchy viewpoint so that the viewer is just as baffled all the way through as the hero is. This can become a bit unsettling as we go into the second hour of the movie still not knowing why his life is in such constant danger from the CIA operatives trying to kill him. The ending leaves too many questions unanswered with less than satisfying results.But for those who like spy thrillers, this one might be just what you're looking for--as long as you don't want to know all the answers.",Null,2,5,28 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Set pieces...battles...set pieces...battles...
","THE LORD OF THE RINGS has its admirers who are familiar with the plot and the strange characters inhabiting it--and who genuinely love the book and were eager to see their favorite story on the big screen.In this case, it helps if you are familiar with the plot and the characters because the screenplay is a murky one with none of the characters given enough time for us to understand what they are all about. Instead, we move from set piece to set piece (grand, beautiful sets abetted by dazzling visual effects) and in between each new grand view locale there's another battle of good vs. evil with weapons clashing in every direction and limbs lopped off as fierce battles ensue.It's a sort of dungeons and dragons world and if this is your thing then this is your dark movie adventure. I saw this on video rather than the big screen so I can assure you it probably all looks a lot grander on the theater screen with the deafening stereo sound effects adding to the vigor of the story. But none of the characters really stand out amid all this swordplay and skullduggery.Only Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood have substantial enough parts to connect a viewer to the movie. The others are all backgrounders without becoming characters we care about--with the exception, perhaps, of Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, who always makes a convincing villain. Another problem is the sound--voices are dropped so often that much of the stilted dialogue is muted. This is a special drawback because several of the actors have some sort of accent. The worst offender happens to be Ian McKellen who nevertheless gives a very compelling performance behind his grizzly make-up--however, someone should have dubbed some of his lines for greater clarity. The likeable Elijah Wood relies on his specialty--wide-eyed wonder or tense concern for close-ups, but it's rather a one-note performance.All in all, I was disappointed. With all of the hype (and due to some of the comments expressed here) I expected a much more substantial story than this, especially for a movie with a running time of almost three hours. The drawback on video is that many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the big screen grandeur is lost even when viewed on a large TV screen.
A bit of a letdown in every department. Even the score only occasionally has the right mystical quality between battles. The battles are not quite as brutal as those in GLADIATOR but their intensity is just as great and they turn up with alarming frequency!",Null,8,13,21 September 2002
Grease," Zestful version of the Broadway hit...
","GREASE is the movie version of a Broadway hit that began off-Broadway, where I saw it originally--and always remember it fondly because it provided me with a good glimpse of someone who just happened to be in the audience that day--INGRID BERGMAN with her son, Roberto. Saw her in the lobby during intermission and she was avoiding eye contact, and seemed to enjoy being 'left alone'. At the time, I thought it was odd that Bergman wanted to see GREASE, a strictly American type of look at the high school experience that she probably had no part of.Anyway, the film is full of pop songs that were high on the chart at the time with the standard number of stock characters you'd expect to find at Rydell High School. JOHN TRAVOLTA and OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN are the leads, Travolta repeating his Broadway role as Danny. Frankly, as the years passed, I became less and less interested in Travolta as an actor/celebrity--ditto with Olivia Newton-John--but this, apart from Saturday NIGHT FEVER, is probably tailor-made for his brand of singing and dancing.The talented supporting cast adds a lot to the proceedings--STOCKARD CHANNING, SID CAESAR, EVE ARDEN, JEFF CONAWAY and JOAN BLONDELL all contribute nicely to the overall flavor.Not my idea of a 'favorite musical' (unlike so many of the commentators here), but it passes the time quickly and amusingly.",6,1,3,6 January 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Bogie loses his marbles...the strawberries are missing!
","Humphrey Bogart received an Oscar nomination for 'The Caine Mutiny' as the eccentric Captain Queeg who finally collapses under pressure. The story leading up to his downfall is an engrossing one--and more complex than any surface description can convey. That's what makes this such a fascinating movie. Nothing is what it seems. No character is painted in black or white strokes--but beneath the surface lies deception, especially in Lt. Keefer (Fred MacMurray). Usually a lightweight actor, MacMurray delivers one of the film's craftiest performances. So does Van Johnson as the decent executive officer who takes over the controls when Queeg snaps. As many have pointed out, the only true weakness of the film is the attention given to a budding romance between Robert Francis and May Wynn which does nothing to advance the plot. The complex drama ends with a stunning courtroom scene in which Jose Ferrer gets a chance to do some heavy emoting. Max Steiner's score includes a jaunty, catchy main theme but is otherwise not one of his most interesting scores. An excellent film that makes you think how things might have been if--if only...but then there would have been no story. All in all, quite an achievement, well worth your time. The book by Herman Wouk was worth reading too.",Null,27,35,15 April 2001
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Fascinating but 'darker than dark' prelude to the finale...
","These hallows are not only 'deathy,' they're 'darker than dark.' Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly 'in support.' All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Volemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.Summing up: Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",7,0,1,2 December 2011
Cold Mountain," Stunning photography, fine performances but flawed script and mixed results...
","There are so many good things to praise in COLD MOUNTAIN that it pains me to say that staying with it to the very end is sometimes difficult because it drags in spots and some of the story-telling techniques are awkwardly staged.Nothing but kudos for the casting. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are in top form--with Law hiding his good looks most of the time under beard, stubble or mud. Renee Zellweger makes us understand why she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the tough but tender-hearted Ruby. Cinematography and background score are tops.By the time the two lovers have been reunited for the finale, much has happened in the way of showing how war brutalizes men. Anthony Minghella doesn't flinch from showing the harsh realities of battle and then switching to scenes of pastoral splendor on the home front. It's a film in which all the ingredients are put together with exceptional craftsmanship. So much so, that you wish the script had been a little stronger to make the two hours and thirty-four minutes more absorbing. Unfortunately, it tends to take too long to tell a tale that lacks the power of holding interest once it gets past the midway point.Nevertheless, anyone interested in the Civil War period will find this a meticulous work as far as costumes, settings and use of folk music is concerned. But be warned: This bittersweet romance at times is downright depressing and the gritty war scenes (and the brutality of certain Yankee soldiers) are about as graphic as such battle scenes usually get. The overall feeling is one of awe that so much has been accomplished and yet there is something unsatisfying about the tale itself.",Null,48,70,7 July 2004
North by Northwest," Essential Hitchcock...great mixture of humor and suspense...
","Ernest Lehman's screenplay for 'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies). He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.
It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows. An all-time great that has to rank as one of Grant's and Hitchcock's best films.",Null,3,6,8 May 2001
Hugo," In a word: Magical, especially for film buffs...
","HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the eventive tradition of his father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's reminiscent of the innocent Olivier Twist and David Copperfield trying to avoid the clutches of the laws that rule orphans.All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities. Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one of film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s. Glimpses of his work are seen throughout the film and Ben Kingsley is a perfect choice to play this complex man. His scenes with Hugo are extremely touching.And finally, I must end with a word of high praise for Martin Scorsese who lends his own magical touch to the proceedings to create one of the year's best films for the child in all of us with all of its wonders underscored by Howard Shore's lovely background score.",8,3,7,7 March 2012
Doctor Zhivago," The trouble with this epic is the story...
","Shakespeare said it best when he said 'the play's the thing.' The trouble with DR. ZHIVAGO is not that the direction can be faulted--nor the performances--nor the magnificent photography (photographed in Finland and Spain) that captures the look necessary for the time and setting of this sluggish tale of romantic escapades in the life of Dr. Zhivago. The tale is told against the background of the Russian revolution (1910-20s) and is easily one of the most ambitious projects David Lean ever tackled.Individual scenes are striking but the plot is tries to cover too much territory and there is an assortment of characters that we never really get to know. Unlike what Selznick did in giving his Civil War epic GONE WITH THE WIND a sharper focus than the novel, the screenplay remains faithful as possible to the sprawling novel without giving the film the structure it needs to succeed on cinematic terms.  Long stretches are dull in dialogue despite camera set-ups that are always fascinating and artistic, almost as if to distract us from the fact that the script is loosely written, trying without success to encompass a great deal of matter within the framework of a lengthy epic. It all seems sprawling and disconnected.Maurice Jarre's score is impressive and Omar Sharif does a superb job of introspective acting as the central character. His expressive face, often shown in close-up without dialogue but reacting to situations around him, proves the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. He definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for his Yuri. The rest of the cast is competent enough but none of the characters have the sort of definition needed to connect with an audience--nor are they likeable enough to deserve our rapt attention. Julie Christie's Lara shows weakness of character from the very beginning when she exhibits what can only be described as sluttish behavior--and although she is somewhat redeemed by her true love for the married doctor, her romantic heroine never quite overcomes being an alienating creature. Geraldine Chaplin, on the other hand, is strikingly attractive in her more sympathetic role. Rod Steiger, in an unpleasant but well-written villainous part, gives a full-bodied performance. Alec Guinness is wasted but Tom Courtenay takes advantage of a showy supporting role.A film of epic proportions, it lacks the story-telling power of a certain Civil War epic already mentioned here which managed to capture audience attention for an even longer running time while dealing with four central characters.",Null,4,8,1 September 2002
American Beauty," Over-Hyped Movie is a Bitter Disappointment
","Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called Oscar-winning 'masterpiece' for me to make this review a brief one--but to the point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but struck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar script, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got was from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully, I was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view the movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar.  As someone once said, 'the mirror of life should be tilted upwards' more often to make films more inspirational. The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two hours of your life--look for true beauty elsewhere. A big thumbs down on this one.",Null,5,11,17 March 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," Probably one of the most important films of the 1960s...still highly relevant...
","JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was adapted from Abby Mann's TV play and turned into a masterful piece of work by director Stanley Kramer. His sterling cast included SPENCER TRACY and RICHARD WIDMARK (American judge and prosecutor, respectively), German defense attorney MAXIMILIAN SCHELL in his award-winning Best Actor role, and such impressive defendants as MARLENE DIETRICH, JUDY GARLAND and MONTGOMERY CLIFT, all giving deeply felt performances.As every student of history knows, there were trials after World War II held in Nuremberg, Germany for Nazis who committed crimes against humanity during the war. This story concerns some fictional German defendants who were more like second tier when it came to atrocities committed since the primary leaders had already been judged. Nevertheless, their part in the war crimes is investigated as the trial proceeds to occupy most of the film, giving the whole story a claustrophobic feeling, the kind one always gets from a real-life courtroom setting.Tracy has some marvelous speeches to make--and Maximilian Schell has his moments where the viewpoint of an intelligent German defense attorney is seen as opposed to the violently opposite statements of RICHARD WIDMARK as the American prosecutor. The audience is forced to view both viewpoints and, having heard all the evidence presented, make up its own mind as to the outcome.It's an important film historically and one can certainly understand why so many of the actors were honored with Academy Award nominations or winners of Golden Globes. They all play an important part in keeping the film grounded in reality and not given to melodramatic outbursts.Summing up: Honest and thought-provoking, it serves as a valuable history lesson as well as a solid piece of entertainment.",8,2,2,26 August 2006
Heartbreak Ridge," Overlong comedy/drama war action with Eastwood as a tough marine...
","HEARTBREAK RIDGE isn't one of Clint's best movies. The story is too disorganized and goes on for a length beyond the limits of its thin material--but fans of Eastwood will get their money's worth. Even without a role that has him in the saddle, he's the toughest, gutsiest hombre who ever took some recruits and got them ready for battle. And the script gives him plenty of one-liners which he delivers with that confident 'Dirty Harry' style whether he's addressing his men or his superiors. My favorite line: 'With all due respect sir, you're beginning to bore the hell out of me!'Everett McGill is the marine Major who gets the short end of the stick from Clint. Marsha Mason has a totally irrelevant role as the romantic interest, Clint's ex-wife. They battle endlessly and hers is a role that could have been eliminated without doing any harm to the storyline. Mario Van Peebles has fun with his role as a cocky, guitar-strumming singing marine. Eileen Heckart and Bo Svenson are wasted in thankless roles.Summing up: much ado about nothing--but Clint is fascinating with his one-liners.",Null,3,8,2 August 2003
Duck Soup," Probably the most watchable of all the Marx Bros. films...
","First off, let me say I think Groucho Marx was at his funniest as host of a program called 'You Bet Your Life' which today's kids have probably only heard about or seen on shows like Nickelodeon. There, his one liners were off the cuff, not made up by script writers, and he was genuinely funny ad libbing his way through a sometimes hilarious program with daffy guests who made it easy for him to kid the pants off them.But in a Marx Bros. movie, all of the one liners are scripted, not ad libbed, as some of the reviewers here seem to think. The script for DUCK SOUP is fast paced nonsense, all of it bordering on the utmost absurdity, but managing to get the chuckles because it's the sort of romp one expects from the zany foursome.Zeppo does well in a comparatively straight role, letting the gags bounce off him without resorting to mugging of any kind. Groucho lets go with the sort of insults (some of which are pretty mean natured) that would give Don Rickles pause. Harpo and Chico do their usual gags with great aplomb.The classic mirror scene has already been praised to the skies. Edgar Kennedy with his slow burn has a few very good scenes with the boys, especially the one with the peanut stand and the lemonade.But it's a tough choice between this and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA for my Marx Bros. favorite. Some jaunty background music would have helped put over the laughs better in many spots--in other words, a little too much silence in the background (the mirror scene, for example) makes the viewer aware he's watching a relic from the 1930s.I can understand the enthusiasm by rabid Marx Bros. fans but I can see why the film may not have been the instant hit with audiences when initially released. Screwball comedy became even more of an art form after DUCK SOUP and has remained so.The most interesting thing about watching a Marx Bros. film is waiting for the reactions (often as funny as the gags themselves) of Margaret Dumont. She's at her best here, playing the grand dame with great skill and good humor. DUCK SOUP wouldn't be the same film without her.",7,3,7,9 April 2005
Disturbia," Scary mix of teen angst and horror works pretty well...
","DISTURBIA is a hip tale about a restless teen (SHIA LaBEOUF--what a name!!) under house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher and forced to wear a leg bracelet that sets off an alarm if he goes outside his restricted bounds. When his mother deprives him of entertainment as further punishment, he starts spying on some interesting neighbors, a la James Stewart in REAR WINDOW.The tale starts with a brutal road accident after a fishing trip with his dad that ends with a startling scene before the title credit. But it takes awhile for the story to get into high gear and start delivering the chills one is waiting for in a tale of this kind.SARAH ROEMER is the pretty girl next door who is soon joining Shia in his spying activities; AARON YOO supplies plenty of comic relief as Shia's Oriental friend; CARRIE-ANNE MOSS is understandably under a strain as Shia's stressed out mother; and David MORSE is sufficiently creepy as the neighbor suspected of harboring some dark secrets.Handsomely photographed, it's a letdown only when the shaky camera movement is used for certain crucial scenes such as the finale in a dark cellar. It seems that every filmmaker today likes to use that technique which should have been restricted to the likes of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.The last twenty-five minutes are well staged and exciting, building up to the suspenseful climax. Shia deserves full praise for practically carrying the film with an authentic portrait of an energetic teen with too much time on his hands.It's a satisfying thrill ride but not something to go out of your way to see.",6,0,2,18 September 2007
Van Helsing," Entertaining, a bit over-the-top with its graphic horror, but still fun...
","My main reason for seeing this old-fashioned fright film done in high style with elaborate sets and excellent actors, was to see Hugh Jackman on the big screen after having watched him in OKLAHOMA! on PBS in a wonderful televised version of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical.He makes a convincing Van Helsing and dominates many of his scenes with authority and skill--but I think we have to wait for a better scripted part to really judge his screen acting. He and all the other cast members are entirely up to the proceedings and there can be no complaints about the casting.In addition to excitement, there is abundant humor (of the somewhat corny kind) to add some spice to the relentless scenes of Dracula's wives having a grand old time scaring the hell out of everyone in sight. Perhaps for this reason I found it uncomfortable to watch young parents sitting in the audience with toddlers on their laps, letting them absorb all of the graphic fright scenes with a casual air, as though the film was ideal entertainment for three year-olds. Whatever happened to Disney?Most impressive are the elaborate sets, all providing the chilling atmosphere needed to bring this sort of thing off. It's worth noting that the first fifteen minutes are done in B&W fashion, harking back to the days of the Universal horror flicks with Karloff and Lugosi. And for some reason, when the film is over, it's the opening B&W sequences that chill with the most power.Alan Silvestri's score is heavy on the orchestrations but quite stunning as an accompaniment, lending grandeur to the elaborately staged action scenes. An enjoyable romp, if a bit repetitious after awhile.",Null,1,3,30 May 2004
Spider-Man," Toby Maguire spins a mean web...excellent fun movie...
","One of the most successful translations of 'comic book to screen' has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??",Null,36,46,15 December 2002
Jarhead," Gritty, realistic, tough first-hand account of U.S. Marines in Gulf War...
","JAKE GYLLENHAAL contributes to the impression gained from other films that he's one of the hottest contenders for the cream of the crop of new actors on the Hollywood scene. His performance here is flawless and just plain brilliant.The novel was written by a man who served his time in the Gulf War and we see the story from his viewpoint as a U.S. Marine training for combat under arduous conditions in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The desert landscape looks as though it was filmed on actual locations instead of Mexico.The salty language is peppered with typical service jargon (plenty of vulgarity and 'f' words tossed around), the kind that was never allowed in service films from the '30s to the '50s--which makes the whole thing ring true with even more authenticity than usual. Anyone easily offended will have to skip this one.While Gyllenhaal carries much of the film, CHRIS COOPER impresses in a brief role as a Lt. Col. and JAMIE FOXX is superb as a crusty Staff Sgt. whose only goal is to get his men into fighting shape. All of the supporting actors do amazingly well in roles that steer away from being the kind of stereotypes we're used to in service films. There's a wild unpredictability in the antics of the young men that comes from a superior script and enhanced by expert direction from Sam Mendes. Gyllenhaal is exceptional in his freaked out moment where he almost contemplates committing friendly fire on a buddy who lets the troop down. His temperamental and hysterical outburst is utterly convincing.The oil well scenes are strikingly photographed for maximum effect and there's a jauntiness to the background score that fits the wild antics of a bunch of boy/men who make up these fighting and playful Marines.Not a treatise on the Gulf War or the U.S. involvement in it, but simply a straightforward tale of what it was like for Anthony Swofford who wrote the novel based on his own real-life experiences. Highly recommended as an interesting look at men in stress under dangerous but sometimes boring combat conditions where some troops never even got to fire a gun.",7,0,1,7 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A darker Potter... could have used more humor...
","What strikes me most about this third Potter film is how truly dark it is during its two hours and twenty minutes of storytelling. Darker both in theme and in cinematography. Although the photography is striking at times, too much of the film is enveloped in darkness which is going to make a lot of the special effects look a lot less intriguing when it makes its transition to home video.This entry is first-rate entertainment all the way. Daniel Radcliffe looks considerably more mature than he did previously but his acting remains largely one-dimensional until he is moved to anger. The early sequence where he puts a hex on a boorish aunt by inflating her like a balloon is the most whimsical touch of magic in the whole film. All the other magic is mostly on the dark side and this is precisely what's wrong with this Potter entry--not enough bits of humor to lighten up when things get too tense. Apparently, kids will love it anyway.Standouts in the cast are Alan Rickman's hateful Snape and Emma Thompson's brief turn as an off the wall professor. Largely ignored is Maggie Smith who barely matters at all--another case where her zaniness would have injected more humor into the dark plot. She no sooner delivers a few lines than she is gone for the rest of the film.Most outstanding special effect is the half-eagle half-horse creation (the Hippogriff) which does an amazing job of looking both real and frightening as it takes Harry for a wild ride in the sky.Emma Watson's Hermione could have used some dubbing to clarify her spoken words for American audiences and Rupert Grint continues to be the most amusing of the leading trio with his expressions of fright or disbelief. Both have settled easily into their roles. Robbie Coltrane has some nice moments here.Imaginative and abetted by a nice background score--but a bigger dose of humor would have balanced all of the darker aspects of the tale. Noticeably missing is the sort of quirky humor that pervaded the first Potter film directed by Chris Columbus.",Null,15,34,4 June 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man," Action scenes are magnificent but story takes too much time developing Spidey's past...
","Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off once Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment.The whole thing is stylishly directed (especially in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb.",7,2,4,10 July 2012
The Exorcist," A landmark among horror films???...I don't think so...
","THE EXORCIST was a novel I read years ago and never saw the film, disliking the novel too much. Not even all the hype about the movie could make me interested in going to see it and stories I heard about people getting sick from the shocking reality of the fright scenes.Now I've seen it on AMC (with all those annoying commercial interruptions), and I see that I wasn't missing anything. It starts out painfully slow (for a film regarded as a landmark among horror films), and only vaguely begins to suggest what is about to take place in the girl's bedroom. (It's based on the true story of a boy's possession, not a girl's). I guess they figured it would be racier if a girl was involved.ELLEN BURSTYN is the worried mother who is told her daughter has a chemical imbalance in her brain after the girl appears to be deeply disturbed by something. Of course, none of the doctors can explain why her bed was moving convulsively up and down--the first tip-off that this is indeed going to be a horror film. It's almost an hour into the movie before the girl's first big attack comes on and she has to be sedated. By that time, I felt like I had already had a tranquilizer myself.But from this point on, as medicine fails to pinpoint the girl's illness, the mother turns to the local church for guidance and the story begins to exploit the theme of possession. LINDA BLAIR is highly effective in her manic attacks and those around her seem to be in real danger of the demon possessing her. It's only until the middle of the movie that the word 'exorcism' is even used by a doctor who suggests that the mother consider using it to rid her daughter of the spirit.The main shock appeal of the story (which made the book such a best-seller) begins as soon as Father Damien (JASON MILLER) begins the rituals--which, unfortunately, takes until midpoint in the film. By that time the viewer has mainly been treated to various glimpses of Georgetown and some pretty autumnal photography and a couple of cozy scenes with LEE J. COBB as a detective interested in a murder that took place near the girl's home. MAX VON SYDOW's entrance into the film is an impressive one, cinematically, as fog drifts around the Georgian brownstone and he shows up to assist Father Damien.While it's the snail pace of the story that defeats the film from the very beginning, it's this very fact that makes the actual exorcism scenes more shocking by contrast. And they do have shock appeal.ELLEN BURSTYN's drab looking mother is hardly the vision of a movie star who could stir LEE J. COBB into asking for an autograph. She looks about as downtrodden and upset as LINDA BLAIR in all of her garish green-paste make-up. Sure, THE EXORCIST is a shocking story but it now seems obviously contrived to upset anyone who hasn't heard of the practice of 'exorcism' as practiced by the Catholic Church.Here, director Blatty exploits his theme with professional polish and theatrical effect--but it's still far from a landmark horror film, in my opinion. Why it became such a box-office smash, I've never been sure.",6,3,10,30 December 2006
Spirited Away," Weird Japanese nightmare of epic proportions...not a charmer...
","I watched the English language version of this nightmarish film and I can't understand the lavish praise bestowed on this Japanese animated fantasy. Its colors have a muted, washed-out look as it tells at great length the murky story of a little girl (with a screechingly high-pitched voice that gets on the nerves) who gets separated from her parents and enters the dark world of an abandoned amusement park. None of it makes any sense--at least not to American minds--so there must be something either lost in the translation or lost in the vast differences between American and Japanese culture. If this is a picture kids can relate to, I can only suppose that more kids than I thought are living in a nightmarish world ruled by adults.The story goes on for two hours without presenting anything except turning the girl's world into a nightmare of dead spirits and mean-spirited elders against which she is supposed to eventually be reunited with parents who have been turned into pigs. It's all so weirdly incomprehensible to adults and let me say firmly that there is no enchantment here. Perhaps you have to have the imagination of a ten-year old to see what's fun about this strange and fearsome world. Instead of entertaining us in the manner Lewis Carroll did with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and his cast of weird characters, it is much too dark and intense to be called anything but a Japanese nightmare of epic proportions with elements of other famous fairy-tales working their way through the tale.The dubbing for the English version should have used a different voice than the grating one used for the little girl. Definitely not a charmer.",Null,5,25,2 July 2003
Pearl Harbor," Spectacular war film with routine romantic drama...
","If PEARL HARBOR had been made back in the '40s, you'd see a war film with a romantic triangle from stars like Tyrone Power, John Payne and Anne Baxter (ever see CRASH DIVE with Power and Dana Andrews both in love with Baxter?). What we have here is a good, old-fashioned romantic triangle yarn set against the spectacular bombing of Pearl Harbor.The action scenes are awesome with the relentless attack portrayed with searing realism. And the History Channel documentary on Pearl Harbor is chock full of details used in the screenplay, even including the bit about the cook who seized his opportunity to be a gunner. This is definitely a well-crafted film that shouldn't be panned as extensively as some of the reviewers here have chosen to do. The performances are first rate, sincere and earnest with Ben Affleck doing an outstanding job as Rafe, completely believable in his role as the pilot who is believed killed but returns to resume his romantic partnership with a nurse. Outstanding in supporting roles are Jon Voigt, strongly resembling FDR, and Alec Baldwin.A disappointment is the score, which I assumed would make full use of '40 swing tunes from that era but instead uses a bland love song that sounds like a leftover from 'Titanic' and never uses the music in a way that evokes the 1940s. Nor does it have any power in the dramatic moments.But above all, this is an enjoyable enough war film which relies heavily on the old-fashioned Hollywood triangle romances that came out of the '40s when patriotism was at an all-time high.",Null,4,8,20 December 2001
Enchanted," Probably the year's most enchanting romantic comedy...
","What the world really needs in 2007 are more films with the ageless charm and wit of ENCHANTED. It's priceless entertainment from the Disney studios, providing plenty of chuckles and downright laughter as PATRICK DEMPSEY, AMY ADAMS, JAMES MARSDEN and SUSAN SARANDON go through the paces of their fairy-tale roles. What helps immeasurably is that the witty script has been given a sumptuous look in both the animated and real-life scenes and the musical score is fresh and appropriate, if not a bit familiar in that it seems to be borrowing heavily from other Disney films--most of the time intentionally so.The script has the animated Giselle, a princess, being banished from the palace when her beauty surpasses that of Queen Narissa (SUSAN SARANDON). She exiles her to an existence in hell--make that New York City. Once in the city, after climbing out of a manhole cover in full princess regalia, the lovely princess (AMY ADAMS in a cheerfully over the top performance), runs into all sorts of predicaments because she acts like someone who 'just escaped from a Hallmark card', according to the lawyer (PATRICK DEMPSEY) who gives her shelter for the night but soon finds himself forming a romantic attachment to her.It moves along at a brisk pace, is stunning to watch because the hand drawn animation is so beautifully rendered, and is fun all the way, with everyone giving their own brand of exuberance to the acting.SUSAN SARANDON is extremely effective as The Wicked Queen and her make-up as the old hag deserves an Oscar. JAMES MARSDEN has all the physical requirements for his role as Prince Edward and tops that with a performance modeled after the vain Gaston from 'Beauty and the Beast'.There's no shortage of romantic chemistry between PATRICK DEMPSEY and AMY ADAMS in the leads, evident from their first awkward encounter to the final fadeout.Too bad Hollywood isn't capable of churning out more films like this one, as solid a romantic fantasy as anyone could wish for with lots of sly fun at the expense of other Disney classics and enough old-fashioned charm to satisfy adults and children.",8,2,5,28 November 2007
Die Hard 2," Just as timely as ever with terrorists storming the airport...
","You gotta say one thing for these DIE HARD movies with BRUCE WILLIS--they move. Fast. Hard. And there's usually a plot twist that jumps at you unexpectedly and they're here too. The other element going for them are the clever scripts with plenty of punch lines for Willis to say, and most of them suit his character of John McClane to a T.DIE HARD 2 makes good use of artificial snow to keep the atmosphere on the frosty side for its holiday tale about a South American drug lord (FRANCO NERO) being expedited to the United States, but being helped in an escape plan by a group of mercenaries led by WILLIAM SADLER. The escape plan includes shutting down the airport and taking over the tower duties so that the plane carrying Nero can land safely before he boards another one for freedom.What the terrorists don't count on is John McClane being at the airport to meet his wife's plane landing at Dulles. There he gets mixed up in the terrorist plot and finds himself using his brawn and his wits to outsmart them at every turn.While the story is highly unbelievable, it's also a first class piece of action entertainment on every level. BONNIE BEDELIA does a nice job with some sharp lines as McClane's wife, WILLIAM ATHERTON is chilling as the cold-blooded terrorist leader, DENNIS FRANZ is intentionally obnoxious as a stubborn police captain, and upcoming political candidate for president, FRED THOMPSON, lends his grim presence to the role of Trudeau, the tower supervisor.Once the action starts, there's seldom a lapse in pace. All of the stunts are pulled off with the kind of timely realism that makes some of the incidents seem more credible than they otherwise would be.Summing up: A good sequel to the original DIE HARD, it's highly entertaining and most of the credit goes to Willis for doing a first rate job.",7,0,2,13 July 2007
The Dirty Dozen," The ultimate action movie re World War II...
","Lee Marvin heads an all-star cast in a very rugged, humorous, exciting and entertaining film wherein his mission is to train THE DIRTY DOZEN (a ragged bunch of misfits slated for the hangman's noose unless they opt to join him in his mission).The cast is uniformly excellent in a variety of interesting roles--and the only underwritten roles without any depth are left to Robert Ryan and Ernest Borgnine as rather colorless military officers.Outstanding characterizations are offered by Telly Savalas, Richard Jaeckel, Clint Walker, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown and Donald Sutherland. The best scenes are the rigorous training the men are forced to undergo before assigned to their real mission. Given the length of this little war epic, they could have eliminated the training exercise prank in which the men defeat another battalion and instead cut right to the chase which is the climactic mission to destroy a Nazi fortress and its inhabitants.Action galore and some well developed humor along the way. Robert Aldrich keeps a firm hand on the direction but could have whittled the whole thing down to a more reasonable length. Still, it never bores and Lee Marvin, in the central role, commands the screen all the time.",Null,0,3,21 July 2003
Gone with the Wind," GWTW is still the all-time favorite!
","Just as Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was one of the most readable works ever written, so is David O. Selznick's production one of the most watchable films of all time. Something is happening every moment--and all of the characters relate to each other in fascinating ways only apparent after repeated viewings. It's the kind of movie that transports you to a time and place that may not have existed except in the mind of its Southern author--and yet, whatever historical inaccuracies are presented here--it's a remarkable achievement and has rightly become a part of American folklore and culture. No other film has so many memorable 'quotes' from a large cast of characters--and at the centerpiece is Vivien Leigh's striking performance as the willful Southern belle. Others around her are equally impressive, down to the smallest character roles--everyone has their moment of glory with the only weakness being the casting of Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Otherwise, the casting is perfect--Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Evelyn Keyes, Harry Davenport, Jane Darwell, Victor Jory, Ann Rutherford, Rand Brooks, Ona Munson--and the wonderful Hattie McDaniel giving the most genuine display of emotion in the whole film with her 'staircase scene' with Melanie when she tells Scarlett's friend what Rhett has said and done after Bonnie's death. All of the sets, costumes, art direction and photography are of the highest order. William Cameron Menzie's production design is superb (he storyboarded the whole concept of what the scenes should look like with beautiful watercolor paintings). The one film above all others that shows what Hollywood's expertise could do with a gigantic novel when transferring it to the screen. Much of the dialog is witty and pointed with some of the best lines delivered in mocking style by Clark Gable.An abundant amount of humor and sharp observations about human nature are present in the script. No wonder it's still the most beloved American movie of all time--not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere in the international market. It was an instant classic and still remains one, richly deserving all eight of the Oscars it won, as well as the Irving G. Thalberg Award for David O. Selznick.",10,2,5,23 March 2001
Legends of the Fall," Complex storyline has poorly motivated characters...
","Not having read the novella upon which this is based, I don't quite understand the quirky reasons for the characters to behave as they do in 'Legends of the Fall'--nor do I understand just what the title is supposed to imply. It's all a bit grandiose with some of the most breathtaking color photography of a western landscape ever seen in an American movie--richly deserving of an Oscar for its photography. But the story is another matter--a sprawling, epic kind of familial tale of the struggle for a father's affection, the love of two brothers for the same woman, etc., with all of the characters swept up in tumultuous emotional states without preparing the viewer for the reasons. The overall effect is disappointing when, after spending a couple of hours with these characters, you have no better understanding of their nature or what makes them tick. And yet, despite poor motivation, all of the actors do outstanding jobs--from Brad Pitt to Henry Thomas to Aidan Quinn to Anthony Hopkins--hats off for some fine acting. But at the core of the movie is a hollow factor that fails to touch base or explain the events. The jumps in continuity are a bit baffling.On the plus side, the war scenes are especially realistic--and it's nice to see Henry Thomas (the boy from E.T.) developing into a fine actor. The outdoor photography is awesome and the score by James Horner is an impressive one. Too bad the script was such a letdown.Summing up: a picture that can be enjoyed on its own terms--beautiful to look at but hollow inside.",Null,39,63,5 May 2001
No Country for Old Men," *****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*****Gripping tale of a psychopathic killer has no ending...
","I have to give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN a very mixed review.For the most part, I agree that NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a well executed crime drama, patterned somewhat after the much better written FARGO, in which the central character was a female officer. Here, it's a male sheriff (TOMMY LEE JONES) given to some armchair psychiatry aimed at trying to understand what makes today's western civilization (or lack of it) tick. He gets no answer from the script.Nor do we get a satisfying ending to a story that is full of grim menace supplied by its main character (JAVIER BARDEM) who goes around dispensing with almost every member of the supporting cast.Nor do the characters act in a way that makes common sense. This is the main trouble with the script. WOODY HARRELSON, for example, seems to walk meekly to his final destiny with the casual air of a man unalarmed by the situation after warning JOSH BROLIN (a man on the run) that he's up against a man who simply wants blood. Likewise, Brolin's wife accepts her fate meekly after stating that she 'knew' the killer would show up on her doorstep.It's taut with suspense most of the time with only a few spots that drag, but it's the inconsistencies of certain characters that gave the script some flaws, as well as a general lack of humor which made the dark happenings in FARGO more bearable.The biggest letdown is the dry ending with no justice for the guilty man and Tommy Lee Jones describing a dream that has nothing to do with the events we just witnessed. Period. The End.The very flat ending is the weakest part of all. But the performances of JAVIER BARDEM, TOMMY LEE JONES and especially JOSH BROLIN in a very unusual role for him, make the film eminently worth watching.",6,2,6,25 October 2008
Batman Begins," Let's get serious...the real Batman has arrived!...
","BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a 'darker' version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived.",10,63,77,21 June 2005
Twilight," Vampire yarn without much of a payoff at the end...
","Nothing much really happens in TWILIGHT except that the script attempts to tell the touching story of a boy and girl who meet in school, fall in love almost immediately and find that they have a strange attraction for each other that turns them into soul mates.Even stranger is the fact that the girl (KRISTEN STEWART) is played in rather indifferent fashion by the actress who is supposed to be the girl that turns all the male heads in her direction the moment she appears on the campus. She is neither pretty enough nor charismatic enough to deserve all that ogling in my opinion. But, hey, that's what the script says so we have to accept that no man can resist her. And stranger than that, the boy just happens to be a pale-skinned Vampire.The boy Edward Cullen (ROBERT PATTINSON) with the pale skin and red lips, turns out to be a member of a Vampire family who develops an overly protective attitude toward the girl, as well as an overwhelming desire to fall in love with her. I suppose this is the sort of thing that set female hearts beating quickly--the sight of a handsome lad setting his eyes on a vulnerable girl who only gradually learns about his true identity. And then, what is she to do?Catherine Hardwicke has directed this tale of tender love about to blossom between a girl and a Vampire with a keen eye for some glorious woodland scenery and gushing music that gives the young lovers the proper romantic background. Pattinson convincingly plays a Vampire who doesn't want to harm the girl and would rather keep the relationship more distant, but the girl has fallen for him so completely that this becomes an obstacle he cannot overcome. The ending affords little in the way of a resolution.Easy to see why the tale became a teen favorite when it first appeared, but this was my first exposure to the film which was showing on the FX channel on TV. It's not as bad as some of the comments would have you believe but it stirs up only a mild interest in seeing further films in this series should I come across them while surfing the channels for a watchable movie.",Null,6,9,28 October 2011
Liar Liar," The truth shall set you free---yeah, tell me about it!
","Not since Cary Grant mugged outrageously throughout 'Arsenic and Old Lace' has another actor accomplished what Jim Carrey does here.  In one of his more plausible, more restrained comedy roles--(restrained???--well for Carrey anyway)--he does wonders with voice, looks, expressions and double takes. The storyline is a slim one--can a lawyer who tells lies (seemingly for a living) tell the truth for 24 hours? It's a cute premise and is given its full potential thanks to a witty script and the right actor in the lead. Nobody else in the cast registers strongly because it's pretty much a one man show. Carrey delivers a knockout performance. It never pretends to be anything more than a lighthearted comedy--and it succeeds merrily. By all means, give it a whirl.",Null,4,6,5 May 2001
Zulu," Awesome tribute to human courage and sacrifice against great odds...
","ZULU is a masterpiece of its kind. It's a stirring tribute to the British army and how they held down the fort during a raid wherein the Zulus (outnumbering them in an army of 4,000 spear-carrying Zulu warriors) are defeated by a handful of British soldiers under the command of officers STANLEY BAKER (who, by the way, is a commanding figure throughout) and MICHAEL CAINE (in his first big screen role).Both of these men, and JACK HAWKINS, stand out in a cast of incredibly fine performances. The sunlit photography is stunning to behold, especially if you view the film in its Widescreen format (as shown on TCM) and the fierce battle scenes are unforgettable and authentic.One of the most chilling moments has Michael Caine saying, while viewing the vast horizon: 'It sounds like a train.' It's a train alright--a train of human feet approaching the fort but hiding behind foliage and getting ready to attack.The final moments are beautifully handled--just when you think (as the British soldiers do) that it's all over.Summing up: An amazing film, well staged and admirably performed by a huge cast of players.",8,3,5,13 August 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Among the top war films of all time...
","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN stands alongside SCHINDLER'S LIST as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements as a director. And just recently, I had the pleasure of re-discovering his EMPIRE OF THE SUN, and realized then how well he captures on film the horror and brutality of war without going in for stereotyped characters.During the '40s, when war films were largely produced for propaganda purposes and for injecting much needed patriotism into all Americans while we fought Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese, we had films like A WALK IN THE SUN or GUADALCANAL DIARY or SO PROUDLY WE HAIL. All of them were fine, in their own way, but often resorted to creating Hollywood stereotypes among the characters, the soldiers and nurses who fought during the war.Not true here. From the startling twenty-minute opening sequence on the D-day invasion, through the intricacies of inter-personal relationships among a disparate group of men, we never once feel we're watching stereotypes but real people. All of the performances are first-rate, beginning with TOM HANKS, whose everyman personality is put to excellent use here. Others too numerous to mention do great jobs in the large supporting cast.No cheap heroics here, just a compelling war story, extremely well done and holding interest from beginning to end. Recommended highly.Trivia note: John Williams' score is never intrusive enough to damage the stark reality of some of the most brutal scenes.",8,2,6,13 September 2006
The Pianist," An extraordinary look at one man's survival...brilliant performance by Adrien Brody...
","Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.",Null,8,17,11 June 2003
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Loaded with action stunts in typical summer blockbuster fashion...
","MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL delivers exactly what you expect a film of this kind to do--entertain the masses, especially action fans who like all those cool gadgets, all those stunts from high places, and all of the twists in plot that keep the story spinning between each new outburst of violent action.As usual, the mission is to prevent a nuclear device from destroying and vaporizing an entire population in an exotic locale. This time Ethan Hunt has Benji (Simon Pegg) for comic relief, Paula Patton as Jane Carter for a curvaceous female co-agent, and Jeremy Brenner as the troubled agent who's hiding something until the reveal.But it's not the plot that really carries the film. It's the outstanding use of picturesque locales combined with the danger of stunts that look amazingly as though nobody could have survived the making of the film. Cruise's spiderman stunt on a high tower glass skyscraper is something to see, as are many of his 'chase and be chased' stunts.To enjoy this sort of thing you have to ignore the credibility gaps in the story and simply dwell on the action-filled sequences, some of which look absolutely amazing. The photography is first rate, especially clever at capturing a frantic chase through a sand storm and other such perils that look like a danger to life and limb.Tom Cruise still looks fit enough to handle most of his stunts and does so with an intensity he always projected as the daring agent. All in all, the film is an example of how to put together an action film with few lulls in its long running time, and one that is sure to please the masses.One of its saving graces: no shaky camera as in the 'Bourne' films.",6,0,1,14 May 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," The man still remains an enigma after more than three hours...
","Yes, this epic of a British soldier assigned to Arabia during World War I, is every bit as brilliant as previous viewers state. But at the end of this gorgeously photographed epic (with great score by Maurice Jarre), we really are left pondering what his true motivations were--and what his true character was. The screenplay doesn't give us a clue, nor does the enigmatic performance of Peter O'Toole in the title role. Somewhat of a cheat, after watching with rapt absorption all of his exploits and wondering if there will ever be a revelation of the man who ventured into the desert--and into the history books.Despite this major flaw, the film is totally absorbing and, of course, should be seen in a theater on a large screen. The combination of great performances, photography and music makes for a stunningly majestic epic. The other significant flaw is the length--it tends to bog down during the final phases of the story, indicating perhaps some judicious editing would have helped.Peter O'Toole here gives his greatest performance--as does Omar Shariff. Their performances alone are a major reason for watching and appreciating David Lean's magnificent film. Watching it unfurl, you'll realize why it won seven Academy Awards in 1962.",Null,0,2,6 May 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Spielberg's touch not strong enough for sequel...
","Not having read the Michael Crichton novels about dinosaurs, I can only base my comments here on the earlier 'Jurassic Park' movie that was clearly more intriguing than this sequel.However, comparisons aside, 'The Lost World' stands on its own as a pretty fair adventure film with the usual assortment of ominous threats from creatures on an uninhabited island where two expeditions find themselves at cross purposes. Richard Attenborough is back as Mr. Hammond who wants to redeem himself for his past mistakes by having an expedition led by Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblaum) reach the island before the other team gets there. Eventually the two groups confront each other and team up for survival.There are plenty of thrills and near escapes with danger ever lurking and emphasized by the John Williams score. If you enjoyed 'Jurassic Park' you won't want to miss this one. Not as creative, perhaps, but the special effects are still pretty awesome--especially in the scene where the team is caught inside a cliffside trailer truck. Some of the action is pretty foolish and I could have done without the daughter who is a gymnast--but if you're looking for escapist entertainment this one fills the bill. Summing up: hokey but fun.",Null,5,11,18 May 2001
The Little Mermaid," Disney's Hans Christian Anderson tale given stunning animation...
","The haunting legend of Ariel, a spunky mermaid who, against King Triton's will, falls in love with a human, has been brought to the screen by the Disney artists in full-blown animation that captures the spirit and charm of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy-tale with the additional grace of a memorable musical score.From the opening sequences under the sea (incidentally, 'Under the Sea' is the big production number that won a Best Song Oscar), THE LITTLE MERMAID is a joy from beginning to end. Youngsters will love it for the appealing story of the Mermaid and the human prince, and young and old will succumb to the charm of the animation and the humor.The songs are a sprightly bunch, written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, and the background score deserved its Oscar too. In addition to the aforementioned 'Under the Sea', 'Kiss the Girl' is given inspired treatment and 'Part of Your World' has a charm of its own.Inspired moments of comedy, romance and drama, THE LITTLE MERMAID restored respectability to the Disney studio for its artistic worth and lay the groundwork for the future success of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and TARZAN.",8,2,2,30 December 2006
JFK," Speculative but riveting...superb story-telling...
","Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there. KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.",Null,1,11,26 November 2003
Insidious," Scary thriller does the job without slasher gore...excellent job by Patrick Wilson...
","Despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights into The Further, INSIDIOUS does the job of keeping the viewer glued to the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the surprise ending delivers a final blow. Patrick Wilson's performance gives nothing away with regard to the film's last bit of shock value. He's simply the husband who can't believe all he's expected to deal with when Lin Shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monster.One of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock impact, but used in connection with what's happening on screen it does manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror. Leigh Whannell's clever script fairs better in the story's first half up until the arrival of a team of specialists--but it's then that the horror elements reach their peak. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****It's just that the astral aspects of out of body experience don't carry much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time it's over.Acting-wise, it's fine with good work from Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty Simpkins--but it's Lin Shaye whom you'll ultimately remember in a very intense and believable performance.For thriller fans, this is not the blood and gore type of thing some may be expecting--but an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games with the viewer in a fascinating way. It's handsomely produced and shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations. I found it an extremely effective thriller.Warning: You'll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if you're willing to accept the startling premise of The Further.",7,6,14,17 April 2011
Schindler's List," Shattering impact...one of the great films of all time!
","Words are not enough to describe the overall impact of this powerful film about a profiteer (Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler) during World War II who uses the Jews as cheap labor in his factory until he decides to save over 1,000 of them from death in the gas chamber. Nor are there enough adjectives to describe the performances--especially Liam Neeson as the enigmatic Schindler, a complex man who ironically becomes a saviour of Jewish souls. Although lengthy, it never once loses tension or interest and the decision to use black and white photography was a wise one, considering that all the war footage in the '40s was seen only in monochrome. Ralph Fiennes gives a masterful performance as the chief Nazi villain and should have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work. The John Williams score has a haunting quality--his main theme is a fascinating example of his uncanny ability to connect with the material he was scoring. As powerful a film as ever emerged about World War II, this film will undoubtedly increase in reputation as the years pass, fully deserving of all the praise it reaps. So real that some of it is difficult to sit through--but no serious minded filmgoer should miss it.",Null,9,14,25 April 2001
The Incredibles," Full speed ahead once it gets past a slow start...
","THE INCREDIBLES is an incredibly popular Pixar computer animated action cartoon that made millions at the box office because it's an entertaining and funny romp about a family of super-incredible heroes.Audiences can relate because the heads of the family (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl--voiced by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) really want to settle down and have normal lives in suburbia without having to resort to their superpowers to save the world.But boredom creeps into their lives and the message of the film seems to be, if you have a gift use it. After years of suppressing his gift, Mr. Incredible gets lured into active service again and then the film really gets going.Once the film shifts into action mode, there's an incredible amount of things to watch as the scenes go speeding by relentlessly in search of a new adventure at every turn. And when Mr. Incredible's family joins the search for his whereabouts when he's captured by his nemesis, the film lurches forward with even greater speed.Apparently, audiences reacted very enthusiastically to this sort of crime caper action cartoon, animated in great style by Pixar. If you enjoy watching comic book heroes do their thing, you won't be disappointed in 'The Incredibles.'Of course, it goes against the theory that the Disney studios kept in mind when making the first feature-length cartoon, afraid that too bright colors and too much fast action would give moviegoers a headache for a feature-length cartoon. 'The Incredibles' defies that theory at every turn.",7,3,6,17 December 2010
Dog Day Afternoon," Only by the '70s would filmmakers dare to make this film...
","Homosexuality was still such a taboo subject for audiences to accept as a part of film entertainment that it took courage for Sidney Lumet to bring DOG DAY AFTERNOON to the screen--but by the mid-'70s audiences were already getting used to a lot of subject matter once considered taboo. This is the kind of rough-edged film that could only have happened in the Hollywood of the '70s.Basically, it's the story of two New York men attempting to rob a bank until everything goes wrong and it becomes a botched job. Motive is not just money, it's money for AL PACINO so that his love partner CHRIS SARANDON (in his film debut) can have money for his trans-gender operation. During the course of the robbery, we learn a lot about Pacino's character and he plays him in such a way as to gain a lot of audience sympathy. It's one of the best roles he had during the '70s which was a particularly good decade for him. Both he and Sarandon were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor performances.Summing up: Not for the kiddies. Plenty of profanity and adult elements that sophisticates can take easily but others beware.",6,2,6,7 October 2006
The Man Who Would Be King," Huston does Kipling...Connery and Caine shine in this 'buddy flick'...
","Telling a grim morality tale with a good amount of humor amidst settings of grandeur and a with sense of high adventure, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING reminds me of Kipling's more famous buddy tale of exotic adventure among dangerous natives--GUNGA DIN. But here the telling is more leisurely and for awhile we don't know where the story is going. First, it seems a comedy, then the more adventurous elements take over and finally it goes for a gripping climax in which all hell breaks loose when the two con men are about to get their comeuppance.
As the decidedly shady characters, corrupt and acting out of a simple desire for riches, SEAN CONNERY and MICHAEL CAINE give probably the most skillful performances of their careers. My only complaint about Caine is that sometimes his Cockney accent (spoken in a hushed voice at a key moment in the film) is hard to understand. Some post-production dubbing would have been advisable.For all of its sense of adventure, the film often plods along at a snail's pace between its more colorful episodes and could have been more tightly edited to tell its story in far less running time.Frankly, I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek GUNGA DIN infinitely more than this Huston film. That's not to say the film is a failure. The cinematography is great and all of the performances are extremely well done--with special mention of CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER who is highly effective as Rudyard Kipling himself. His final scene is a memorable close-up after Caine has told him the truth about the harrowing end of their adventure.Although highly entertaining at times, it's easy to see why this story of two con men is not considered to be one of John Huston's greatest. By no means a failure, it nevertheless has enough flaws and is just uneven enough to make you realize it could have been a truly great adventure film.",Null,8,14,18 February 2004
Ghostbusters," Bill Murray comedy is a silly cult classic but not screamingly funny...
","I never did find this one screamingly funny, as some Bill Murray fans obviously do.It's got a preposterous story with some good special effects (for those slimy, jello-like green images) and if quirky characters are your thing, you'll find plenty of them among the cast of characters. But a wittier script by Bill Murray would have helped. In other words, I can take it or leave it--that's exactly how I felt when this comedy was over. Sure, there were some fun moments with Rick Moranis as a nosy neighbor and I'll admit Murray and Dan Ackroyd have some good one-liners. Then too, Sigourney Weaver is amusing as the gal with a fridge from hell, but by the time the overlong story got to its mindblowing conclusion, I was longing for 'The End' to appear on the screen.Not my cup of tea as comedies go. Best moments were when the ghosts were on the loose and things got a little unpredictable toward the conclusion. But what happened in between these ghostly apparitions left a lot to be desired.",5,10,21,3 September 2006
The Longest Day," World War II never looked so authentic...
","THE LONGEST DAY is an expensive World War II epic that leaves you with the feeling that you know what D-day, the 6th of June was really like for American soldiers. On the other hand, it leaves you with the feeling that somewhere around the bend another great movie star or film personality is about to make another appearance.It's this disparity between truth and Hollywoodized fiction that struggles constantly to win your attention as you watch what is actually a very realistic depiction of what it must have been like during that fateful day when America lost so many of its splendid soldiers on the field of battle.It's a film that opts for realism, whether it's telling the story from the American point of view or the German--never sugarcoating any of the sequences but presenting the fateful day in an almost documentary fashion with the kind of realism and attention to detail that is awe inspiring.Suffice it to say that all of the names fit perfectly into the scheme of things, never giving the impression that the director chose them at random for star value. Whether English, German or French, all of the roles are beautifully played.With the Fuhrer having taken a 'sleeping pill', the German commanders realize they are losing the war. Unfortunately, it's such an epic film that it doesn't give you a chance to identify with any of the characters to the extent that you can care what becomes of them. That, indeed, is the film's major flaw.Truthfully, while all of the invasion sequences are extremely well staged for maximum effect, what's distracting is when the viewer's attention strays from the story upon seeing name players pop up unexpectedly in the midst of explosive action. Just a few of the names come readily to mind: JOHN WAYNE, PETER LAWFORD, RODDY McDOWELL, SEAN CONNERY, ROBERT MITCHUM, RED BUTTONS, HENRY FONDA, ROBERT RYAN, ROD STEIGER, RICHARD BEYMER and others. Fox seemed intent on using just about every male star in the business to fill the huge number of speaking roles.Summing up: If World War II war films about D-Day, the 6th of June, are of interest to you, THE LONGEST DAY, from a novel by Cornelius Ryan, is an essential, not to be missed, in all of its B&W glory.",7,1,3,24 March 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Not for everyone's taste...
","Despite dazzling visuals and lavish production numbers, MOULIN ROUGE is almost all style and no substance. Frankly, I'd rather watch one of the MGM musicals from the '40s and '50s than sit through this more than once.Kidman and McGregor are in fine physical form except that neither one has a true singer's voice.  Much of it is rather frenetic and grotesque, but no one can accuse it of lacking a colorful stylized life of its own. The best performance comes from Roxburgh as The Duke--excellent job.It will appeal to fans of Kidman and McGregor but is certainly not the sort of musical suited to everyone's taste.",Null,5,7,25 April 2004
La Grande Illusion," A 'great escape' French style...intriguing but not completely satisfying...
","For a film that has been hailed over the years as a masterpiece, GRAND ILLUSION is showing its age. I'm speaking now from a technical standpoint. The version shown on TCM has a series of scenes linked together by choppy editing, abrupt changes of scene that lack smooth narrative style. But overall, the B&W photography is sharp and glistens with the life brought to the story by an excellent cast.It seems a bit more profound in tackling the subject of prisoners of war, but there are many moments when you might think you're watching the French version of 'The Great Escape' or 'Stalag 17'. The somber mood that prevails is broken intermittently by scenes of male bonding amid camaraderie and clowning around, especially the scene where the men decide to put on a show for the German officers. Needless to say, the drag show is good for a few laughs before the plot has them all struggling to hatch an escape plan, one that hasn't been used before.But it soon becomes apparent that Capt. Von Rauffenstein (ERICH VON STROHEIM), an aristocratic German in command, has taken an instant dislike to two prisoners especially, a Frenchman (JEAN GABIN) and a Jew (MARCEL DALIO), both from the lower class. The class distinction also includes Von Rauffenstein's tolerance for an aristocratic French officer (PIERRE FRESNAY), who later becomes the pivotal character in helping the two most despised prisoners escape.The World War I story is poorly paced for a film that runs almost two hours and, as noted before, the editing leaves a lot to be desired. The story's final section takes place in a farmhouse after the two have escaped, supposedly to show the mutual trust and comradeship that develops between the Jew, the Frenchman and a German farm woman who gives them shelter during the Christmas season. Presumably, the intent is to show that the horrors of war are best forgotten when it's time for humans to treat each other with compassion.Worth watching if you don't mind reading the sub-titles (which are plentiful throughout), except for a short exchange between Erich Von Stoheim and Pierre Fresnay that is spoken in English. Perhaps it was the only part of the negative available when scenes were put together from various pieces for continuity.Not really the masterpiece that others have called it, with pacifist overtones that are non too subtle in those final scenes. It's an interesting glimpse into the past via the French cinema, nothing more, nothing less, but well worth viewing.As an 'escape' film, it falls far short of the adventurous spirit we're used to in more recent outings of American cinema, and certainly it lacks the rugged style and pace of 'The Great Escape' or 'Stalag 17'.",6,7,17,12 September 2006
The Illusionist," Nothing is what it seems...imperfect but interesting...
","THE ILLUSIONIST is a satisfying magic show, but not quite up to the standards I expected. One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery, suspense, Gothic detective stories or any sort of story involving these ingredients.EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fiancé (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the detective putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the plot was much too complicated to be solved by a few bits and pieces of the inspector's memory.Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed with an appropriate score by Paul Glass that captures the mood perfectly.",6,11,16,23 July 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Long, long movie from short F. Scott Fitzgerald story...
","THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is only half successful.First of all, if there are any Oscars to give out here it's got to be for whomever did the miraculous make-up jobs. Technical awards category might give this one a few Oscars for visual effects and cinematography. And the music by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous.But the story is a ponderous one, something about the time warp that occurs if a person ages backwards and keeps getting younger than all his contemporaries--but as fascinating as that concept might be, it takes a much better grip on fantasy to work for a movie that runs two hours and forty-seven minutes. Frankly, there isn't enough of a story here to sustain such a lengthy film. How many of us have to worry about getting younger each year, so where's the connection? And towards the middle, it really starts to sag, despite some good performances from a first-rate cast performing brilliantly under Bryan Singer's direction.BRAD PITT has certainly chosen an unusual role to play and he does it with his customary capabilities intact. CATE BLANCHETT is outstanding as Daisy, the childhood sweetheart who grows up to be the love of his life, but her motivations are sometimes vague and her character is sometimes irritating.Most interesting supporting roles are well played by TARAJI P. HENSON as Queenie who finds the foundling Benjamin and raises him as her own, and JASON FLEMYNG as the boy's wayward father who abandons the baby.The biggest hurdle for BENJAMIN BUTTON to jump is making the story seem credible, as fantastic as the concept is. But since the concept istelf isn't grounded in any sort of reality, it's too big a leap to make.Should find its special target audience in fans who love the arty type of flick, no matter how slow moving the story may be. But in the end, it's all rather meaningless. After all, is anybody else in the world going to have Benjamin's unique problem? Only in the movies--or if your name is Dorian Gray.",6,7,12,14 January 2009
Kelly's Heroes," Light-hearted WWII romp is entertaining action film...
","What films like DESPERATE JOURNEY did for WWII audiences at the time of release, KELLY'S HEROES did for audiences in 1970 in showing the humor and banter of men in trying wartime circumstances determined to carry out a certain mission. Here the mission is the heist of gold behind enemy lines--something Kelly inadvertently finds out about before deciding that his troopers will carry out the scheme right under the noses of the Nazis.It's all in fun, and some of it is even funnier considering that hippies didn't exist in the '40s so that the flavorsome performance of DONALD SUTHERLAND as Sgt. Oddball is really an anachronism. His quips are strictly from the '70s but his contribution is so full of laughs that it's easily forgiven in the spirit of enjoying a war story that doesn't take itself seriously in the first place.All the men seem to be having a great time--including CLINT EASTWOOD, TELLY SAVALAS, CARROL O'CONNOR, DONALD SUTHERLAND, RICHARD DAVALOS, GAVIN MacLEOD, HARRY DEAN STANTON and DON RICKLES.Summing up: Just the right brew for a lighter look at wartime escapades!",6,2,2,30 December 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The Pumpkin King that stole Christmas...
","Since Tim Burton is the very definition of the word 'weird', it's no surprise to me that THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (which I resisted seeing up until now), is richly imaginative and entertaining in the way it puts a special twist on the holiday spirit of Halloween and Christmas.Instead of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, we have The Pumpkin King (Jack) bringing horror to the Yuletide holidays and kiddies everywhere by riding Santa's sleigh and depositing horrific toys to frighten kids in a manner usually reserved for Halloween. Of course, in the end, the real Santa is allowed to reappear (after being held hostage) and allowed to bring his special brand of cheer to a world momentarily deprived of Santa and his toys.It's all richly dark and scary (for kids), imaginative, and visually stunning with so much to watch at any given moment that it becomes almost a strain on the eyes to follow all the cleverness accurately without a pause for breath. In other words, it's what I would call a very 'busy' film, but certainly an enjoyable one if you're in the mood for quality animation of this kind (stop-motion models).All I can say is the Disney studios never released anything remotely like this sort of dark fantasy when I was a kid, when everything was geared more to the lighter side with darkness only rearing up in the form of witches or dragons--and the songs were simple, catchy tunes that people could sing afterwards. That, for me, is the big drawback here. Danny Elfman's songs are devoid of any special sort of charm and certainly can't be called memorable. They work within the context of this story, but not apart from it.Nevertheless, this is undoubtedly a richly imaginative piece of animated art and well worth viewing whether young or old.",7,0,2,4 May 2007
Dumb and Dumber," Lives up to its title and then some...
","I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.But the film is a series of sight and sound gags more than a tightly constructed plot and it's just a matter of time before the Beavis and Butt-head type of guys driving cross country to return a valuable suitcase to its pretty owner (LAUREN HOLLY) would drive any normal person insane with their stupidity.The joke with the state trooper is probably the low point of all the tasteless humor, but here too, I'm sure I'm in the minority. Seems to be the highlight for others inclined to view potty humor as nothing more than harmless fun.If this sort of low comedy appeals to you, it's a funfest of crude jokes and imbecilic humor. It's either a comic masterpiece or a dud of titanic proportions, depending on your point of view.Carrey won a 'Razzie' award as worst new star--although I don't agree with that designation at all. He's obviously a hyperactive, manic personality who can give Robin Williams a run for his money--and Daniels, too, is a talented chap. But I just wish they had a script more worthy of their peculiar talents.",5,8,19,27 December 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," A 'dumb and dumber' Clooney & Tarantino meet the vampires...about as gross as any movie can get...
","This film was a complete turnoff for me. I only watched it for George Clooney and wondered how he could sink so low as to want to use this as his big screen opportunity.It's a strange combination of slasher/vampire film that has no focus and splits up into too many directions to form a coherent story. The characters have as much depth as cartoon creations and all of them are as freakish and pathetic as anyone can get. George Clooney mumbles his way through his role in a way that suggests he'd rather be back in 'ER' with its own kind of gore than splashing the blood of vampires. Frankly, he ought to be better at choosing material than this mess.The story starts out as a gutsy crime drama but soon veers into downright nightmarish activity at a Mexican border bar staffed by vampires. Nudity, foul language, vulgar expletives--everything is poured on thick to appeal to today's younger movie-goers who have an appetite for sex, sadism and buckets of blood. About as gross as any movie can get without leaving you with a queasy stomach.Of course, you'll get the opposite opinion from those who think Quentin Tarantino is the master of pulp horror. This graphic depiction of vampirism is sure to have them raving that this is a masterpiece only a genius like Tarantino could have invented.Clooney still has to prove himself on the big screen. His 'Batman' and 'Perfect Storm' appearances still indicate he should have stayed in 'ER' awhile longer.",Null,1,2,26 May 2001
World Trade Center," A narrow focus vs. a wider horizon...
","Some will call it the strength of the film--the fact that it deals almost exclusively with two of the trapped police officers beneath the 9/11 rubble rather than giving us a broader view of the tragic event. Others will lament the fact that it never widens its horizons to show us a more complete picture.Whatever, Oliver Stone has done a commendable job with what he has chosen to show--but leaving me with the feeling that I, personally, would have preferred a wider horizon of events. Instead he has chosen to tell the story while the men are trapped by going back and forth from the rescue scene to their worried families. It must be said that all of the dialog for these family scenes is completely natural and never seems forced or over sentimentalized.He has chosen not to show the actual footage of planes hitting the building at the start of the film--except for a background shot of TV footage--and the only time we are even reminded that planes did this damage is when we see a shadow of a plane against a skyscraper shortly before the first tower is hit. I think it's a mistake not to have shown this important footage as a prelude to his story.Of course, the dialog (which shows how much better communication should have been between police officers), does mention planes from time to time, so it's hard to understand just why Stone chose to blunt the visual impact this would have had at the opening of his film.Instead, he confines all of his coverage to the rescue efforts of two very heroic survivors who manage to keep each other alert under perilous circumstances. Since the two men are played in a totally real and sympathetic manner by NICOLAS CAGE and MICHAEL PENA, it is especially hard to witness their struggle to stay alive as even more dangerous rubble falls around them, making them even more vulnerable and helplessly trapped amid new explosions.All of the technical factors are excellent with regard to the realism of the war zone damage (before it was called a war), but strangely missing from the ground damage is the white ash that covered so many who ran from the huge clouds of smoke and debris. Only huge amounts of paper are strewn about, as though the ash never existed. This is the one technical blunder I found almost unforgivable.The women are competent, nothing more, as played by MARIA BELLO (as Cage's wife) and MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL as Pena's pregnant spouse. The emotional investment in the story depends entirely on the performances of Cage and Pena and they don't disappoint. Both are extremely real and affecting in difficult roles that limit their physicality due to being caught beneath the tower's rubble.Perhaps it's time for this to be seen for what it really is--a good reminder of the enemy we faced that day and still do--without politicizing the event the way we might expect Stone to do. And since most Americans seem to have short memories, it's a good thing Stone made this film when he did, memorializing the start of a new kind of war that began five years ago on 9/11.",7,3,7,16 August 2006
Quiz Show," TV's age of innocence ended with Quiz Show scandal...
","Robert Redford's brilliant direction and a quartet of expert performances make QUIZ SHOW a highly interesting, thought-provoking experience. Unfortunately, the end of TV innocence in the '50s brought us other game shows in recent years and real life survivor series that are guilty of shortcomings just as egregious in other ways but not to be discussed here. Manners and morals began a fast decline in the late '50s and only got worse with each decade, in my opinion.The real-life story of Professor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son of a famous scholar, Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield) is told in a lively and detailed way with many sights and sounds of the '50s making the atmosphere look very authentic. When the less than charming winner of a TV show, Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is dumped in favor of the more charismatic Charles Van Doren, the story goes swiftly through a series of expertly written scenes in which all of the behind-the-scenes goings on are revealed and characterizations are sharply defined. In truth, the ratings game between Van Doren and Herb Stempel went on for many weeks before a showdown was reached.An especially touching scene shows Charles wanting to reveal to his father the truth about his upcoming appearance before an investigative committee--relaxing as the two have an informal midnight snack in the kitchen, but unable to tell his father (played to perfection by Paul Scofield) who is a symbol of unwavering integrity. In fact, Scofield is so good in his supporting role that it's a pity the script didn't expand his role to give him more screen time.John Turturro as Herb Stempel has the unfortunate task of appearing to be an obnoxious nerd, whose only redeeming moment comes at the end of the film when he realizes how destroyed Charles Van Doren is by the revelations. He never tries to make the character anything less than the boorish, self-absorbed fool he is and does an excellent job. Rob Morrow is sometimes less than convincing as the tenacious investigator.Despite its lengthy running time, it all moves along at a brisk pace under Robert Redford's outstanding direction. Well worth your time, although I can't say television has raised the bar very much since its fall from grace, especially with regard to daytime talk or game shows. Are audiences any wiser today? Maybe only Regis Philbin knows...",Null,23,28,21 August 2002
The Dark Knight," Deserves another look for the performances alone...
","For a film based on a comic strip character that runs for some two hours and forty-five minutes, I feared I'd be bored long before the film was over. Usually I'd be checking my watch in the dark if a film runs this long without any redeeming qualities. But there's plenty to like in THE DARK KNIGHT--most of all, the performance of HEATH LEDGER as 'The Joker', a much darker and more fully realized 'joker' than has ever been shown before.The dialog is well sustained throughout, moving the film along briskly despite all the explosions and action sequences that you expect in this sort of thing. And everyone plays their roles with so much authority that you find yourself drawn in by the many characters on display.Along with HEATH LEDGER, there's Christian BALE, GARY OLDMAN, MICHAEL CAINE, MORGAN FREEMAN, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL (a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes), CILLIAN MURPHY and ERIC ROBERTS (Julia's brother), and all of them are admirably cast. Special mention, too, for AARON ECKHART's role as Dist. Atty. Harvey Dent or Two-Face. He's excellent.Furthermore, the cinematography, sets, costumes and CGI are of the highest order, as is a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.If you relish this sort of entertainment, it's not to be missed. And I certainly agree that Ledger's energetic performance must have required an amazing amount of energy and skill to pull off. He's created a vivid portrait and surely deserves an Oscar nomination this year.Summing up: Definitely not for the kiddies. Too much of it is on the dark side. Stunning to watch.",7,8,18,12 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Imelda Staunton steals the film...a darker than usual Potter...
","For a film that has been doing fantastic box-office business, one would hope that HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX would be a much more energized and fascinating movie than it is. Instead, it's like watching a rehash of previous Potter subplots, previous ingredients stirred into a new stew leading to a climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort that ends in a blaze of fireworks.But the few 'big' action scenes, while well staged with all the CGI effects bound to please the Potter fans, are hampered by a rather dull and listless storyline that has Potter looking at the dark center within himself as he plots how to avenge the dark forces trying to destroy him. And even the humor that is usually so much a part of these films is lacking, probably because EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT have so little do do with the main action.But as a consolation, there are some striking performances, especially IMELDA STAUNTON as the overbearing and strict disciplinarian who injects a lot of humor into her wickedness. The film is fortunate to have her in a key role. Not much can be said for EMMA THOMPSON and MAGGIE SMITH who speak no more than a few lines, but ALAN RICKMAN and GARY OLDMAN at least have much more to do in supporting roles. Even the main villain of the piece, RALPH FIENNES as Lord Voldemort, has little actual screen time.One big ingredient the film has going for it is the background score by Nicholas Hooper which gives zest to the action scenes and the proper mood to all the dark sequences--of which there are plenty. Some of the sets are richly detailed and atmospheric, but too much of the photography takes place in the dark.Summing up: A so-so chapter in the Potter series. Hard to see why this one is proving to be such box-office gold when the story is less than satisfying.",6,5,12,13 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," It's a puzzlement...
","There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.",Null,177,282,17 June 2002
Toy Story," Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...
","It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script.Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home.Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry.The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays.",7,1,1,19 December 2010
Men in Black," Terrific sci-fi comedy with stylish special effects stealing the show...
","For sheer entertainment, MEN IN BLACK hits the jackpot with its stylish and startling CGI effects--and is no slouch in the acting department either, with TOMMY LEE JONES and WILL SMITH making a great buddy team.Based on a Marvel comic book, it's really a series of well staged encounters with aliens as Jones and Smith attempt to save the galaxy from extinction by being able to cope with alien terrorists in our midst. No easy matter, since Smith is a rookie on the job, stumbling onto it by accident after his stunning chase scene wherein he has a brief encounter with a thing he recognizes has super capabilities. He's soon being groomed for the job of sidekick to Jones, having proved his mettle in that chase.The wisecracks back and forth never stop, the gadgets are fascinating, the plot wildly improbable--but most of it is enough to cause more than a few chuckles of laughter, if not hilarity. LINDA FIORENTINO does nicely as a sassy morgue doctor exchanging some double entendre quips with Smith as they examine one of the aliens.Aside from all the sight gags and some inside jokes at the expense of some well-known celebs, the visual splendor of the film and its New York City settings will grab your attention. A nifty score by Danny Elfman provides some appropriately zestful background music and it's all meant to be nothing more than pop culture entertainment for the masses--which it is.WILL SMITH gets to do most of the physical stunts in what has to be one of his most strenuous roles among all the action films he's done. Jones has his share of derring do--and the scene where he gets gulped down the gullet of a giant bug is quite a sight--and, of course, he lives to tell about it.The comic book capers of the MEN IN BLACK should please most fans of sci-fi fiction tinged with outrageous humor.",7,1,2,16 February 2007
Singin' in the Rain," Jean Hagen's contribution makes 'Singin' in the Rain' one of the all-time greats...
","Much as I admire the talents of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, it's really Jean Hagen who provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. Her character also provides the key to the plot for this witty look at Hollywood making the transition to sound films. A pity Hagen wasn't given any of the song numbers to participate in--but that's my only complaint. Everything is in good hands here--Kelly and Reynolds and O'Connor do outstanding jobs. The only other drawback, as I see it, is the extended Broadway musical number Kelly imagines and co-starring Cyd Charisse. It strikes a somewhat jarring note and wasn't really necessary. His song-and-dance routine in the rain is, of course, the most famous highlight--but equally endearing is the 'Good Mornin' number, staged with such style and verve and performed with gusto by the three stars. Betty Comden and Adolph Green provided a supremely funny script, somewhat reminiscent of an older film with Alice Faye and Don Ameche called 'Hollywood Cavalcade'('39), which also dealt with the transition from silent to sound movies. One of the great MGM musicals, not to be missed.",Null,6,8,13 April 2001
The Mummy Returns," Delivers the goods, as sequels go...amazing special effects!
","While not quite up to the original Brendan Fraser flick that started it all, 'The Mummy Returns' delivers all the action, adventure and romance one could expect from a story of this sort--and then some.  My only problem with the picture is the action is so non-stop, it hardly gives you a chance to enjoy the beautiful sets and scenery. Something is happening every moment--in itself not a bad thing--but there's seldom a pause for breath or a sequence that doesn't involve heavy use of FX.  As for the participants, Brendan Fraser resumes his original role looking just a tad bit heavier, Rachel Weisz makes a lovely action-adventure heroine, and John Hannah and Fred Boath have some crackling good lines to deliver, giving the much needed humorous slant to all of the proceedings--not that anyone is going to take the story seriously.Again, if you enjoyed 'The Mummy', you'll enjoy this one. Some of the scenes are gorgeously staged--the dirigible looks like a floating gondola in the sky, zooming past mountains and pyramids--and the desert sands are real enough to supply all the exotic flavor needed. And some of the creatures dreamed up by those Industrial Light people are really awesome.Summing up: never a dull moment thanks to some dazzling use of special effects. Those little 'critters' are amazing! Heavy on effects, weak on plot--but hey, it's just a damn good sequel!

Toy Story 2," Solid proof that sequels are not always inferior...
","TOY STORY 2 expands on the originality of the first 'Toy Story' by turning the plot into a rescue mission that must be performed by several of the main character toys led, of course, by Woody and Buzz Lightyear.Once again, the voices perfectly match the characters, the special effects are brilliant, the script matches the clever aspects of the original, and the story actually has a lot more scope with more of a feel for the dramatic and dangerous world of airports, stolen goods, elevator shafts, street traffic and all sorts of predicaments that combine laughter with terror.TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN are back as the voices for Woody and Buzz, as are many others from the original cast. A nice new addition is Stinky Pete the Prospector, who also happens to be one of the best animated and most interesting of all the computer-generated figures. There's also a Mrs. Potato and a Cowgirl mate for our hero.All of the technical aspects mark an improvement over the original and the quality of the script and story is just as good, marking one of the few times that a sequel more than matches the inspiration of the first film.",7,0,1,19 December 2010
Chariots of Fire," 1981 had to be a bad year for films...
","All I can say is 1981 must have been a bad year for films.  This is a slow-moving, veddy British rendering of a story about athletes competing in the Olympics during the '20s and especially the motives of the two leading actors--both of whom have no charisma.A slender plot that has no significant conflict between the two competitors is given quality status with the fine color photography and some nice background themes--but the story did not require two hours of running time. Characterizations are weak and the win for Best Costume Design is questionable in view of the fact that most of the footage is devoted to men in running shorts.Not worthy of Best Picture Oscar. Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK had more than twice the holding power and entertainment value of this one.",Null,3,9,14 March 2004
The Artist," Delightful romp succeeds largely because of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo...
","The chemistry between Jean Dujardin, as a fading movie star of the silent era and Berenice Bejo as a flirtatious flapper type heroine, is what makes this dazzling B&W film work. Of course, tributes must also be paid to the detailed B&W sets and costumes and to director Michael Hazanavicius who makes it all sparkle.There's a bit of deja vu when it comes to the script, which more or less follows the path of previous films on transition to sound, such as 'A Star Is Born' and 'Singin' in the Rain.' Mr. Dujardin, by the way, looks somewhat like a dapper Gene Kelly with a trim mustache and mischievous grin, in the sort of role Kelly played with much gusto in 'The Pirate.' To be fair, there are scenes that go on too long and tend to drag and there's the somber side of the tale that has our hero contemplating suicide, but things brighten up considerably before the fadeout which has Dujardin and Bejos strutting their stuff as dancers.Aside from the sparkling work of the leads and a strong supporting cast of players including John Goodman, James Cromwell and the dog Uggie, the musical background score is lively and a pleasure to listen to. The only jarring note is a sequence where Bernard Herrmann's 'Vertigo' love theme seemed out of place.Faults aside, it's easy to see why the Best Actor Oscar winner went to Jean Dujardin. His expressive face registers every emotion easily. Just as fluent at registering all the right emotions is his co-star, Berenice Bejo, who deserved more than just a nomination as Peppy Miller.",8,1,4,6 July 2012
There's Something About Mary," Something about weirdos that'll have you laughing so hard that it hurts...
","THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY that has every man in the film falling for her (sometimes literally) in a comedy that moves along with gay abandon and no shortage of slapstick silliness. Mary is played with breezy style by CAMERON DIAZ (a throwback perhaps to Carole Lombard's wackiness in this sort of thing), and, of course, BEN STILLER gets to play the lovesick fool who ruins his first prom date with her by getting stung by his zipper.There are too many sight gags here to enumerate, but the funniest have to do with Mary's dog and the other is the famous scene where hair-gel takes on a new meaning.MATT DILLON is the sleazy friend who agrees to find the missing Mary after many years have separated Stiller and Diaz, only to find that he's instantly in love with her too. Naturally, he tells Stiller that she's turned into a blimp in a wheelchair--and you can predict that when Stiller finds out the truth there will be hell to pay.Hilarious moments dominate the breezy comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, full of visual and verbal gags that are non-stop until the last moment. By all means, worth seeing unless you're completely grossed out by this type of humor.",6,0,2,13 September 2006
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Carbon copy lacks the wistful appeal of the original...
","MACAULAY CULKIN is back again as the little lost boy who seems to have the ability to lose his parents at airports in HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK. While the plot fails to be as engaging as the original, a big asset is all of the New York location photography that gives us great glimpses of the big city for an added dose of realism.It starts out pretty much the way the original did, with the family planning a Florida vacation and with Kevin pursuing all of them as they make a mad dash through the airport. This time, he doesn't deliberately stay behind--he mistakenly believes he's following a man wearing a coat similar to his father.But what's really missing are the characters that made HOME ALONE such a treat--and they aren't topped by the bird lady sequence and her friendship with the boy, nor are the bungling exploits of bad guys JOE PESCI and DANIEL STERN as funny, even though they are as clueless as ever in trying to deal with Culkin's nasty pranks.The violence employed by Culkin gets even nastier this time, which turns out to be a drawback because, after all, this isn't a cartoon where we know no one is really getting hurt.But in general, the story moves swiftly, the parents' reaction to discovering that he's lost is just as funny (as is their encounter with an official while trying to explain the situation), and the supporting cast does their best to keep things lively. Nice to see EDDIE BRACKEN as a toy store mogul in a huge toy store where a key scene takes place.Fans of HOME ALONE will no doubt appreciate this sequel, but they aren't likely to be as fond of it as the original--which had a wistful sort of charm totally lacking here. John Williams' score is a pleasing asset, once again providing a sprightly backdground that gives the film added cheer.",6,1,2,25 December 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Artful blend of tragedy and comedy is a testimony to the human spirit...
","If someone had told me that a genuinely moving story of a Jewish father and son who end up in a German concentration camp could manage to sustain such an artful blend of humor and tragedy, I wouldn't believe them. Then again, think of the popular success Americans have seen on TV in the shape of the enormously successful comedy HOGAN'S HEROES which takes place in a prison camp. Or the bittersweet irony of Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 with its blend of comedy and drama.But what ROBERTO BENIGNI has accomplished here surpasses all expectations on just how extraordinary this sort of material can be when executed with such wit, wisdom and humor and--even more importantly--without offending anyone with such controversial subject matter.The first part of the film is full of abundant humor as it chronicles the romance of the Jewish man and his sweetheart. Midway the tone of the film shifts to a darker element as the man, his wife and the young son are placed in a concentration camp. The husband is so determined that his son will be shielded from the stark realities around them that he pretends it's all a game. Benigni is a man of such irrepressible spirit that it makes the film's ending even more poignant.He deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar in '97 and the film itself was voted Best Foreign Film. The delightful score by Nicola Piovani won still another Oscar.Summing up: A fable, delightfully written and produced with an unforgettable performance by Roberto Benigni. Who can forget his joy on Oscar night when he bounded over the tops of seats to reach the stage and accept his Oscar?",8,3,6,1 December 2006
Where Eagles Dare," Dandy espionage during wartime...scales the heights...
","This well-titled thriller indeed goes WHERE EAGLES DARE and then some. When men aren't climbing mountain peaks, they're fighting atop cable cars and doing so many other stunts on a rescue mission that it becomes the ultimate in action/spy drama of the cleverest kind.And why not? It's based on Alistair McLean's thrilling novel and he authored the screenplay, turning his fast-moving novel into a thrill ride despite a running time of 158 minutes.At the center of the action are RICHARD BURTON and CLINT EASTWOOD and their mission is to rescue an American General from the clutches of the Nazis before he can reveal the secret plans for a D-Day invasion. He's being held in a German castle high in the mountains so the mission starts out as a built-in obstacle course. Naturally, a lot of daring and derring-do are needed to accomplish the task once the men arrive at the castle.It's a beautifully mounted production with no expense spared to turn this into a full-fledged winner, aided immeasurably by Ron Goodwin's background score and some exceptional photography in vivid color.Summing up: an action fan's dream.",7,6,8,28 August 2006
Groundhog Day," Every day like the one before...
","GROUNDHOG DAY is really a jigsaw puzzle of a film. Are we supposed to believe that somehow fate decrees that for punishment you must relive every day like the one before--if you are judged to be a rude enough person in need of redemption? A pretty shaky premise for any comedy/fantasy--and yet, the amazing thing about GROUNDHOG DAY is that it succeeds despite the flawed premise.There are numerous twists and turns in the plot--totally unexpected and welcome--otherwise, with the story heading in the same direction day after day, things could have become pretty monotonous. That pitfall is avoided by spicing up the story with just the little differences that make for some brilliant comic touches.BILL MURRAY is quite acceptable here as the unprincipled weather man who decides to change his ways--rather improbably, I might add--and alter the course of his life. ANDIE MacDOWELL is pleasing enough as the woman he falls in love with, although never one of my favorite actresses. And others in the cast keep the comedy on a high level throughout much of the running time.Summing up: Improbable fantasy never explains why Murray suffers this strange fate--but it maintains interest and the screenplay has enough originality to keep it fresh.",6,2,17,21 January 2007
National Treasure," The Da Vinci Code in a minor key...more humor, more fun...
","If your head is still spinning from all the murky codes being deciphered in THE DA VINCI CODE, you can sit back and relax with all the clues NICHOLAS CAGE has to unravel in order to go on his treasure hunt in NATIONAL TREASURE. He has lots of help from his dad (JON VOIGT), a very savvy female assistant (DIANE KRUGER), his mentor (CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER), and his goofy but handsome side-kick (JUSTIN BARTHA). The heist scenes involving a stolen Declaration of Indpendence are a highlight of the film, all filmed on actual locales in and around Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, handsomely photographed.Cage gets some stiff resistance from HARVEY KEITEL as a no-nonsense FBI man, and some villainous competition from greedy SEAN BEAN and his henchmen, who want the treasure for monetary purposes only and will stop at nothing, even murder, to lay their greedy hands on it.It's all Saturday matinée stuff, the plot strictly a mixture of Indiana Jones and other cliffhanger stories where the hero has to pursue his quest while all sorts of obstacles are thrust in his way--and then the final, climactic shoot-out and wild chase before he can walk off with the girl at the end of the movie.All the standard clichés are firmly in place, but it's still a lot of fun to watch NICHOLAS CAGE interact with a fun loving cast. SEAN BEAN lends some British dignity to his role as the charming villain, not quite as dark a villain as is usual in these sort of capers.There's a light touch throughout all the heist sequences and chases and explorations of the underground caverns holding the treasure, as well as some well staged moments of suspense with collapsing stairways and termite-ridden wooden structures making the search perilous. JUSTIN BARTHA contributes a lot of the lighter jibes as a computer wiz who is clearly having a good time and knows the whole thing is a lark as he works on his computer graphics.Nothing too original here, but it's purely an escapist adventure yarn.",6,1,2,13 January 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Graphic crime film from Tarantino...
","It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor. And I might as well admit, I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either, although I love a good crime film. This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime, where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police.'Did you kill anybody?' 'Three cops. No real people, just cops.' The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me. But the story, about the cop inserting himself into the mob, is well handled throughout, building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order.Standout performances from the entire cast: HARVEY KEITEL, TIM ROTH, MICHAEL MADSEN, CHRIS PENN, QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY (almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of 'Dillinger' and other '40s crime films).Warning: As usual with Tarantino, the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking, stabbing, blood gushing moments--and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty.But all in all, a powerful film of its kind with a 'crime doesn't pay' morality tacked onto the brutal ending. If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse--but then, he wouldn't be Tarantino, would he?Warning: Not for children. Too intense, too graphic.Seen now, it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word.",7,1,3,18 February 2007
Some Like It Hot," Flawless comedy is played to perfection...
","I'm sure no one had to twist arms to get Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis to sign for the leading roles once they looked at the hilariously witty script by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. What must have looked good on paper is even funnier on the screen--the three stars give their all to make this one of the most memorable comedies of all time! ('Dumb and Dumber' fans might not agree!!)The story begins with down on their heels musicians accidentally witnessing a gangland slaying by mobsters. Naturally, they flee the scene and decide the safest thing to do is disguise themselves as dames by joining an all-girl band in need of two musicians. Complications develop when Daphne (Jack Lemmon) falls for the charms of the band's singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Hectic goings-on continue throughout the course of the fast-paced yarn, with Daphne being romanced by a sex-starved millionaire (Joe E. Brown) and Tony Curtis getting out of drag to woo Marilyn with his impersonation of Cary Grant. It's screwball comedy at its finest--with some of the punch lines buried under laughter (if you see it in a theater).
The mad pace continues to the very end, with Lemmon deciding to accept the millionaire's marriage proposal--leading to the film's final punch line fadeout.Deserves its status as one of the best comedies of all time. An ingratiating performance by Monroe (and she CAN and does sing, contrary to someone's earlier comment on her voice), especially good in her scenes with Jack Lemmon's character. As for Lemmon, he all but steals the show once he grabs those maracas and fancies himself kicking up his heels as Daphne. He and Curtis underplay their cross-dressing assignments for the most part--but are still very funny.The dumbing down of comedy today--with leering one-liners about sex dominating all the dialog and toilet humor being 'in'--may leave some with the feeling that this is a mild mannered sex farce. But they're wrong. It's still a sizzler with more class than the dumb, sometimes gross jokes and situations that are the stuffing of the newer comedies like 'There's Something About Mary'.",Null,6,10,23 May 2001
Pulp Fiction," Darkly humorous tale laced with profanity and corruption...
","PULP FICTION is the sort of tale right up Quentin Tarantino's dark alley of a fictional mind. All of his criminals speak the profanity-laced dialog with such effortless ease that it seems perfectly natural after the first five minutes to hear the 'f' word and the 'n' word spoken with regularity by a very competent cast of actors. There is no such thing as political correctness in his vocabulary, so it's an audacious piece of work.Tarantino weaves the tales of several characters, not all of whom are related, until eventually the tales do dovetail together to make a common pattern out of the jumbled narrative. It's all done in brisk, good story-telling style to keep the viewer interested throughout the two-and-a-half hour running time.The dark humor is present in almost every situation you can think of involving murder and mayhem and somewhere, in all the Bible readings that SAMUEL L. JACKSON quotes, there's a message about redemption that seems to be the raison d'etre for the final scene in the diner.UMA THURMAN has delicious fun with the role of a gangster's moll who sniffs a little too much white powder in the ladies room while on a date with JOHN TRAVOLTA. The two of them get a chance to demonstrate their prowess with romantic comedy in this wonderful sequence where they go to a '50s-theme restaurant with an art deco ambiance and some '50 icons like Marilyn Monroe, Ed Sullivan and Mamie Van Doren doing their stuff while platters are served. They also indulge in a twist dance contest which, naturally, they win.It's the lightest moment in a film with plenty of dark twists and unpredictable shoot-outs that are a blend of violent gore and gales of laughter. HARVEY KEITEL has a fine time with the role of a 'cleaner-upper' who gives instructions on how to wipe the blood off messy crime scenes. BRUCE WILLIS is excellent as a boxer who fails to lose the match and has to go on the lam to escape the wrath of a crime boss. His brutal treatment at the hands of a sadistic hardware store owner and his sick pals is one of the most lurid episodes of the many layered story. They don't call this 'pulp fiction' for nothing!! Despite the disturbing scenes of violence, it manages to be a highly entertaining mix of crime and comedy that keeps rolling along toward a satisfying ending in the diner where the first scene involving TIM ROTH and AMANDA PLUMMER took place.Summing up: More likely to have broadest appeal for young male viewers who like their crime stories raw, real and unpredictable. Original, inventive and understandably awarded a great many honors when released.",7,0,2,15 September 2007
Les Misérables," Real singers badly needed to put over this epic tale of squalor and redemption...
","I have to give this a decidedly mixed review.My first impression before the film's first hour was over was a silent reminder 'don't buy the soundtrack.' The singing, even from Hugh Jackman who acquitted himself so well as 'Curly' in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical 'Oklahoma!' is, to put it charitably, just passable. Russell Crowe does as well as can be expected since he is a non-singer to begin with, but the others do not have the kind of voices that are needed to put over this kind of material.Cinematically, it's a bit over-the-top with its wondrous camera views from high places. Nothing is done to suggest that the squalor isn't real. The mud is as muddy as possible and the make-up (in extreme close-ups of Anne Hathaway for example), is enough to convince us that these wretched people had nothing to sing about.Not being a fan of the show and familiar with only a couple of the songs, I was not expecting to be thrilled by the score alone--and I wasn't. Whether you have an appetite for these kind of musical numbers is clearly a matter of taste. Most of the lyrics are as downbeat and desperate as the story itself suggests.A much needed touch of humor is furnished by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, although some of the humor is a bit gross and overdone.The almost unrecognizable first appearance of Hugh Jackman as a slave hauling a ship with his comrades as Jaffert (Russell Crowe) looks on, is an astonishing moment. Jackson looks nothing like his real self, so part of his performance can be attributed to a marvelous make-up job. But he does well with the anguish and pain of seeing so much suffering around him. Anne Hathaway is obviously a singer/actress who does all she can with the powerful emotions she displays in her big scene, but her role is a small one in the scheme of things.Despite the power of some of the performances, the overall effect for me was a story that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale and hard to follow unless paying strict attention.Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live. The pre-recording of all the lyrics would have enhanced the big numbers which required more vocal ability and professional technique than is offered here.Summing up: Definitely not for everyone, but the squalor of the French Revolution period is magnificently realistic with lavish, detailed sets and costumes that convey the right atmosphere. Stunning photography is evident in the final scene where Crowe's conscience forces him to take drastic action.Biggest flaw: The lack of tension in the cat-and-mouse game between Crowe and Jackman that was so powerfully portrayed in straight dramatic versions of the story filmed previously which sharpened the suspense. Instead, Crowe's recognition of the hunted man is done so casually that there is no building of suspense from the outset.",6,3,12,9 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Pulp fiction...ordinary thriller given too much attention because of controversial theme...
","If you approach watching a film like THE DA VINCI CODE as a thriller (and forget all the mumble jumble about the history of the Roman Catholic Church), it works on an elementary level. The background score (a very busy one) by Hans Zimmer gives it the required element of suspense even when two characters are merely giving you a lot of exposition to make the plot easier to follow.Unfortunately, it would take someone more familiar with this material to truly enjoy the movie as a serious look at the dark side of Christianity and its symbols that never quite make complete sense. And so, I will review the film on the level of a thriller that has added a controversial theme to attract a large audience ready to put on its thinking cap and at least ponder what might have been.Ron Howard has seen to it that the controversial elements have been toned down considerably from the book, without eliminating them entirely. But on the debit side, most of the photography is too dark (intentionally so, I presume to keep an air of mystery going), the explanations come at a slow pace but there are too many to keep the plot from moving forward the way it should in a thriller of this kind, and the acting is, for the most part, not extraordinary.TOM HANKS gives a very understated performance in a role that is, for the most part, rather bland. He plays the role straight, without any emphasis on his lighter side, but one almost wishes for some trace of wit or humor in the role. His French cohort AUDREY TAUTOU has an accent that makes some of her key words undecipherable (at least to me) in a film where every bit of relevant material needs to be handed to the viewer who wants to catch all the clues.Only Ian McKellen sparkles in a supporting role, bringing flashes of humor and intelligence to a well-written role. Alfred Molina as a Bishop has little opportunity to be more than slightly interesting. The most striking and intense supporting role goes to Paul Bettany as Silas, the albino who has his own interpretation of what he must do to please the Lord. He has a few masochistic scenes that dole out the required chills and he has a look of quiet menace and desperation in his eyes.All in all, I'd say this should please readers of the book. Howard has done as good a job as possible with the bulky twists and turns of the novel and translated a popular work of pulp fiction into a movie that will undoubtedly be seen by audiences looking for a summer blockbuster.Summing up: A good workmanlike job by a movie that really doesn't ask the viewer to take it too seriously. It's more like an espionage thriller with a dose of religiosity thrown in.",6,5,11,24 May 2006
Titanic," Awesome recreation of a tragic event...the love story is slim...
","I've looked back through the other comments posted here and can't believe I saw the same film some of these disgruntled 'critics' are talking about. What's so wrong about telling a love story against the background of a real-life historical event? Since when is there a restriction on poetic license? Get real. 'Titanic' is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives. Told in a flashback technique, it focuses mainly on Jack and Rose and their unlikely meeting when she attempts suicide--but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot. The class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity--making complaints from previous 'commentators' meaningless when they say that the film doesn't even deal with this factor. The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose's class-conscious mother. TITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen--masterful in all departments. The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent--but no one has given enough credit to Billy Zane. He's the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest. All those protesting that this film is a disaster are simply mouthing hollow words, all sound and fury signifying nothing. If it's cool to knock this movie, so be it. But their appraisal of it is far from the truth and they are quite clearly in denial.The Jack/Rose love affair is the weakest development in the script but at least it does point up the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy.",Null,2,6,14 April 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Lacks emotional warmth of 'ET'...a John Williams letdown...
","I was drawn into the story the moment the letters started whirling through the air to 'the boy under the cupboard' and to the amusing trio (Aunt, Uncle, brother) that give interest to the early scenes and make you anxious for Harry to escape life in this demented household. And from the opening scene on, the special effects are nothing short of marvelous despite what some 'critics' here are calling 'cheesy' -- I'm sure the film is a strong contender in that category for a Best Special Effects Oscar.Having said that--and not being a fan of Dragons and Dungeons, etc. kind of games--my only disappointment was that most of the 'magic' was too much on the dark side--without enough humor to keep things in a lighter vein for the most part. If this is what kids like, they'll love being scared time and time again by some of the creatures and situations.I have only praise for the performances, although I agree that Daniel Radcliffe seems to only have two expressions and is indeed bland, but appealing enough, as Harry. Everyone else does their best to bring the characters to life--especially Maggie Smith as head witch and Alan Rickman as Snapes. I think his is the film's outstanding performance.I was aware of too much exposition in the film (to explain to those of us who haven't read the book what Muggles are, etc.) but I'm sure this sort of thing will diminish when the series continues. I was disappointed by the John Williams score, relentless throughout with only one jaunty theme worth remembering.  This was made even more obvious by the fact that a trailer for the upcoming re-release of 'ET' emphasized the difference between his 'ET' score and the one he wrote for 'Harry Potter'. Obviously, he had much more of an emotional connection to the characters in 'ET' than was possible for him to have with the characters here. There is no such connection to the characters in this relentlessly busy score.Even Potter's farewell scene before boarding the train for home, lacks the emotional warmth so strongly suggested in 'ET' -- a factor that makes the entire movie seem a one-dimensional but highly competent version of a beloved book. All of the set pieces are extraordinarily detailed and well executed, including the Chess Game--and there's a nice plot twist toward the end that I won't reveal here. All in all, a good film version of the book which I understand is remarkably faithful to the novel--and don't let anyone tell you the special effects are anything less than superb!Nevertheless, a John Williams letdown. I'm sure Daniel Radcliffe--who is physically perfect for the role--will improve in his bystander reactions. After all, he made a wonderful 'David Copperfield' on PBS not long ago. Despite some drawbacks, looking forward to the next visualization of Potter's adventures.The film is known in England and many other countries abroad as '...and the Philosopher's Stone'.  Frankly, I think the American title is more suitable as it implies 'witchcraft' which is the very essence of the story. With the U.K. constantly changing American film titles, it's not surprising at all that we sometimes do the same thing. Apparently, we don't really speak the same language!",Null,1,2,4 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Richly imaginative, darker and scarier than most of the other Potter films...
","DANIEL RADCLIFFE and his company of wizards are having the scariest ride of all in this dark, dangerous and yet fun-filled thriller with absolutely stupefying special effects and some slam bang cinematography that is nothing short of dazzling.Readers of the novel may quip at all the material that couldn't be included, but the movie is extremely well-paced with a fair amount of humor to liven up even the scariest moments. The story is a lot less complex to follow than some of the others and lets you concentrate on the rich assortment of characters with almost Dickensian names.MIRANDA RICHARDSON does a nifty job as an overly exuberant journalist who exaggerates her tabloid material (by the name of Rita Skeeter), and Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do their usual superb jobs in their by now familiar roles.RALPH FIENNES does a chilling job as Voldemort for the final maze sequence which makes it questionable whether parents should let the very young watch this without fair warning. He's the meanest, darkest villain yet in all these Potter stories and does a brilliant job of being villainous.For Potter fans, this should come as a welcome chapter in this series, extremely well directed and acted thanks to a superb cast and crew. Patrick Doyle's music is a good background score without being too obtrusive.",7,0,1,10 March 2006
The Untouchables," Taut crime drama inspired by the classic TV series...
","'The Untouchables' is a modern crime classic in the tradition of the great Warner Bros. gangster films of the '30s and '40s which starred men like James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart and Edw. G. Robinson as the criminals. This time the events unfold in color rather than glorious B&W and the leading man is not an anti-hero but Kevin Costner who acquits himself well in the role of Elliot Ness. The story, set in Chicago of the '30s, depicts how Ness and his small band of deputies bring down notorious crime boss Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) after a succession of well-staged crime scenes involving Prohibition, speak-easys, etc. The train station shootout is a standout among the vivid action scenes.Sean Connery gives an Oscar-winning performance as the seasoned street cop who joins Ness and his men in their pursuit of Capone. Distinguished by excellent cinematography, good script, fine overall performances from a large cast and, last but not least, Brian DePalma's stylish direction that features some extraordinary camera work.A crime classic told in the grand manner of the best of the Warner Bros. crime melodramas, updated with its more graphic violence and bloodshed.",Null,0,1,25 June 2001
Mystic River," Powerful story, part mystery, part psychological drama...
","Clint Eastwood's directorial savvy is on full exhibition in MYSTIC RIVER--a story that unravels with a sense of mystery from the opening shot with three boys playing street games until one of them is forced into a car by a man posing as a policeman. In what is a poignant moment captured beautifully by the director, the boy leaves his friends behind as he watches from the rear window of the car until it disappears further into the distance.
Then we pick up threads of the story years later where the three children are now adults living in the Boston blue-collar neighborhood near Mystic River with each character examined in turn as they go on with their lives, affected somehow by that long ago incident that has left one of them (Tim Robbins) permanently damaged in mind and spirit.All of the performances are riveting and each deserves high praise. Sean Penn as the unruly father with a troubled past is remarkable, displaying an array of emotions that mark him as an exceptional actor. Tim Robbins, in a muted performance, is excellent--as is Kevin Bacon, now a police officer who is called to duty when Penn's daughter becomes a murder victim. Suspense is maintained throughout and there are several powerful scenes of graphic violence.The story is fascinating and the performances are all first rate, including Marcia Gay Harden as the wife who suspects her husband is a killer, and Laurence Fishburne as the brusque but efficient police sergeant who is partner to Bacon.There is one major flaw: despite all the craftsmanship--the writing, the direction, the cinematography, the music--the revelation of the girl's killer comes as a disappointment since there is no preparation for it in the script--and furthermore, it seems a highly unlikely solution. Up until that point, the film is on track all the way--but things fall apart swiftly in the last fifteen minutes. But in the meantime, we have been treated to interaction of some very human and believable characters for whom the rough and raw language seems appropriate, if a bit overdone.Summing up: A fascinating and distinguished piece of filmmaking despite this obvious flaw in the plot's outcome.Trivia note: Watch for Eli Wallach in an uncredited bit role as Mr. Looney, the elderly proprietor of a liquor store.",Null,19,33,8 July 2004

","I think we could all relate better to 'It's A Wonderful Life' if we lived in a Norman Rockwell type of world or small town where the George Baileys of America live. As it is, we have to take this slice of Americana as the real thing--and that's not always easy, given all the sentimentality on display here.Don't get me wrong. I like the film, but I think it has a kind of warm, cozy, cuddly look that becomes a bit saccarine and cloying by the time the film reaches its fairytale ending. It's impressively acted, photographed and scored and definitely contains one of James Stewart's most brilliant performances. He runs the gamut of emotions in close-ups that show the real genius of this actor. Behind him is a wonderful cast that is with him every step of the way. Donna Reed is especially appealing in one of her sweetest roles.But the Frank Capra/Norman Rockwell touch of small town lives gets a bit sticky at times--especially the falsity of the ending with everyone just opening their hearts to George Bailey. It's all a little too simplistic to swallow, like a pill that doesn't quite go down.It makes excellent family fare and will no doubt continue to be shown every Christmas--quite a tribute to a film that was not even a box-office hit when first released but did receive glowing reviews for James Stewart's performance in his and Capra's first post-war film. Despite its flaws, it has won the genuine love and respect of fans everywhere so let's leave it at that.I can't end this review without mentioning Henry Travers. His scenes with Stewart are the warmest, gentlest and wittiest ones in the whole movie. His Clarence, the Angel, makes the film the Christmas delight it is.",Null,3,9,30 May 2001
A Beautiful Mind," It's a beautiful achievement...
","Russell Crowe's stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely. No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured. Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his 'unsuitable' private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.",Null,1,5,11 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Darker fantasy than the first Potter film...brisk despite its length...
","Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.And apparently the makers of this Potter film have met the challenge of providing spiders and snakes that are hideous enough to have Ron and the audience in a fit of hysterics. It's all here--the main events anyway of the Rowling book--and for extra measure they've given a much needed humorous role to Kenneth Branagh who has great fun with his role as the self-loving Gilderoy Lockhart. The only real drawback is that Maggie Smith has very little to do--but the main chores belong to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who continue to charm as the three leads. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy has a commanding presence and an amusingly wicked final scene involving the computer created Dobby who steals every scene he's in.Should keep Potter fans happy--and for a movie two-and-a-half hours long it moves along at a brisk pace from one adventure to another with what by now appears to be mechanical skill, thanks to artful direction by Chris Columbus who knows how to keep this sort of thing moving. John Williams' perky score is a distinct help.",Null,41,49,20 June 2003
The Departed," All this and treachery too...gangsterism on a grand scale...
","Just as THE GANGS OF NEW YORK created a stir of Oscar talk, this time it looks like a sure bet that LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, JACK NICHOLSON and MARK WAHLBERG will at least be nominated for Oscars in whatever category (lead or support) the Academy decides. I didn't think MATT DAMON's performance was on the same level as the others, but there were also some fine supporting jobs by MARTIN SHEEN, ALEC BALDWIN and others in the large cast.A story of the Irish Mafia vs. the Boston police force, it teems with violent episodes and each scene has a tense undercurrent where you know some kind of volatile payoff is about to happen. You can almost choke on the intensity in some of the vivid scenes between Nicholson and DiCaprio as they eyeball each other, exploring what's going on in the other's mind as they play out their dangerous cat-and-mouse assignments. DiCaprio is a mole assigned by Sheen and Wahlberg to do undercover work for the cops. Damon is Nicholson's top man, assigned to find out who the mole is.All of the intensity is fully charged from the opening scenes with Nicholson visiting the local deli and lending his menacing presence to even the simplest scene. Every bit of suspense possible is wrung from a very effective screenplay that includes treachery and murder on a grand scale.By the time we arrive at the point where Damon finds out who the mole is, the suspense is tripled and there's a final orgy of a shootout that brings the film to a bloody climax. Definitely not a film for the queasy or faint of heart.A huskier looking LEONARDO DiCAPRIO proves he has much more than boyish charm and good looks. He's matured as an actor and delivers a tremendously moving performance, holding his own against such heavyweights as JACK NICHOLSON and MARTIN SHEEN.Summing up: A masterpiece of its kind, thoroughly absorbing all the way through, destined to reap plenty of Oscar nominations and--who knows--maybe even a win or two. Absolutely ranks among the top American gangster films.",8,1,4,17 November 2006
Psycho," Norman Bates: 'A man's best friend is his mother.'...
","The minute Bernard Herrmann's menacing score begins for the opening credits, you know you're in for an intense combination of horror, humor and suspense. Hitch really does a job on us with this one--disposing of the heroine (Janet Leigh) with a shocking shower scene. Then playing further tricks on us before the shock ending reveals just how twisted Norman Bates is. Anthony Perkins was forever identified with his role as the motel keeper, all boyish charm and pleasant manners while he concocts his wild schemes. Janet Leigh deserved her Golden Globe award for her performance as Marian Crane, the embezzler who has fallen into her own private trap and wants nothing more than to return the money toher employer. Little does she--or we--know what's in store for her.Summing up: one of the finest chillers Alfred Hitchcock ever directed with every frame of film calculated to keep you absorbed until the stunning climax. Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam all do fine work here. But the real star of the movie is Bernard Herrmann's gripping and very edgy background score, never more brilliantly menacing than when Janet Leigh peers through her windshield and the driving rain to see a sign that reads: Bates Motel. By the way, Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, has an amusing office scene with Janet Leigh in which she imagines that the only reason a man isn't flirting with her is that she's wearing a wedding ring. Touches of sardonic humor like this are evident throughout. Great film.",Null,1,5,14 April 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Seems tame today but still delivers chills...
","Since ROSEMARY'S BABY came upon the scene so many years ago, we've had a great many supernatural tales (THE OMEN, THE SIXTH SENSE) to name just a couple of the more recent scary titles, that it's no wonder someone viewing this for the first time might feel cheated.The audiences of '68 were used to this kind of slow build-up to a plot that kept audiences waiting for revelations explaining some mysterious goings-on in an uptown apartment house called The Dakota. They didn't expect slasher gore or quick cuts to show gruesome body parts on display. They wanted the story to develop at its own pace and then deliver the goods for a substantial conclusion.And this is what ROSEMARY'S BABY does so efficiently. It starts slowly and only gradually do we come to realize that something much more serious than just eccentric neighbors is going on here. Best of the eccentrics is RUTH GORDON who rightfully won a Supporting Role Oscar for her work as Minnie, the overly solicitous neighbor who watches so carefully over the pregnant MIA FARROW. Hubby JOHN CASSAVETES seems to be concerned too but that turns out to be for other reasons.There are several good supporting roles, but another performer who stands out is RALPH BELLAMY as the doctor Rosemary confides in when she begins to suspect things are wrong.It's a good screen version of Ira Levin's novel and MIA FARROW does a commendable job as the worried and confused young wife. Well worth a look as a modern Gothic thriller.",6,2,8,28 August 2006
War of the Worlds," (POSSIBLE SPOILER)...Spielberg's take on the H.G. Welles saga is lacking in many respects...
","TOM CRUISE is a New Jersey dockyard worker who is taking care of two rather insufferable kids (one of whom is DAKOTA FANNING who outdoes Fay Wray in the scream department). He promises to watch them while his ex-wife goes off with her hubby to visit her parents in Boston.All hell breaks loose in his backyard when aliens who have been hiding for maybe a million years under earth decide to shake up the neighborhood with some scary earth-shaking movements that start out as severe thunderstorms and extreme flashes of lightning but proceed to get more ominous when the tripod aliens make their first appearance.It's a good beginning--although the script is weak from the start on developing characters we can care about--neither Cruise nor the insufferable kids are worth bothering about for a couple of hours. And yet, we are forced to view all of the happenings through their viewpoint, which would have been fine if they were halfway interesting instead of puppets thrown about by the aliens and the scriptwriters.Most effective scene is a somber basement moment with a slithering tentacle trying to probe their hideout. It's a tense scene that introduces TIM ROBBINS in what has to be a bit of typecasting genius. He plays a quirky survivalist with a crazy gleam in his eye who makes so much noise that he has to be exterminated by Cruise in an off camera scene. Robbins plays the part of the mad-eyed eccentric looking eerily like he does in real life whenever he steps up to a mike and gets on his left wing political soapbox--clearly enjoying himself as a man who is off his rocker and spouting inane comments about man's survival in a world gone amok. Sounds familiar.Cruise supplies the star power necessary to give Spielberg the courage to spend $135 million on special effects, but it's a mechanical performance. He's no more than adequate in an underwritten role--he plays Joe Bloke on an off day, with his kids proving more difficult to handle than the aliens.Not the blockbuster I expected it to be from Spielberg, the man who gave us some really good films in the past--not the least of which was 'E.T.' which was a marvel of cinema ingenuity compared to this one. The script is the fault here--and the idea that aliens would want to destroy man and everything on earth in order to conquer it and take over what? What would be left? Not a shred of landscape would be worth owning if their scorched earth policy were successful. The irony is that they are defeated by germs--the common cold.Somehow I think an alternate ending would have been an improvement. Too bad the DVD doesn't give us one.Summing up: A story that starts out with a bang and ends up with a whimper.",5,3,9,3 April 2006
There Will Be Blood," A towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as corrupt oil man...
","Blood, oil and religion seem to be the heated topics for this version of Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil', and the presentation is starkly realistic from beginning to end, with DANIEL DAY-LEWIS giving another one of his towering performances in the central role of a corrupt, guilt-ridden man who can't talk about his evil deeds.His antagonist is a preacher (PAUL DANO) of hellfire and damnation, played with an oily mixture of naiveté and money madness, who wants his fair share of the wealth on his doorstep. It's really the battle between these two men that grips most of the story and leads to a startling climax.While all the performances are valid enough, it's a shame to see CIARIN HINDS so wasted in a role that barely gives him a chance to utter more than a few lines as a steadfast friend. More prominent in the supporting cast are DILLON FREASIER as the boy adopted by Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) when his real father is killed in a mining accident toward the beginning of the story. The boy is led to believe that he is the real son, only because Day-Lewis wants to use him and his innocent face as a way to secure deals. When the boy is a grown man and wants to move away with his new bride, Day-Lewis ruthlessly exposes the truth about him being an orphan and banishes him from his life with hateful curses.All of this is never fully explained, but we do know that he has a hatred for most people which he openly admits to a man who poses as his long lost brother Henry (KEVIN J. O'CONNOR). Here too, we can sense a dangerous relationship built on lies and moving toward a violent climax.DANIEL DAY-LEWIS inhabits his role with great intensity and although he is said to base his speech pattern on John Huston, he looks and sounds like he's chanelling Walter Huston as he appeared in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' as the old prospector. There are moments when his facial expression reflects the sort of penetrating gaze and wicked gleam in his eyes that Walter Huston had. It's almost uncanny. At any rate, Day-Lewis certainly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for this gripping film, stark but relentlessly moving and sometimes emotionally draining to watch.",7,2,6,9 May 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Nothing less than a masterpiece...
","About as Oscar-worthy as any film made in the '50s is David Lean's gripping BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean's direction.The jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.Some of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get.",Null,67,86,5 April 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Beatle mania when it was at its peak in the crazy '60s...
","First, let me say, I've always been indifferent to the Beatle craze so I'm not the most reliable or objective reviewer you're likely to find. However, wanting a good look at the '60s era that created them, I watched the film dutifully and these are my comments.The girl screaming thing gets the film off to a jaunty start with the Beatles dashing for a train--and the joyride goes on for the length of this very frisky tribute to the four lads with the cheeky and rather quirky sense of humor, British style. The songs are nicely woven into a plot full of Beatle antics, never stopping the action but instead providing a good background for the visuals.I didn't get the bit about Paul's grandfather being constantly referred to as 'a very clean man'--just one of the jibes that was over my head, but the humor is abundant everywhere, extending to lines like: 'Stop being taller than me!' A lot of the humor misses the mark if you don't catch the drift, so I watched it with the caption feature on my remote to catch the full flavor of the lingo.The songs are an enjoyable bunch, especially 'And I Love Her', and the film itself is diverting enough for even non-Beatle fans to enjoy.Entertaining fun.",6,0,4,13 February 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Story about terrorists in NYC is timelier than ever since 9/11...
","BRUCE WILLIS and SAMUEL L. JACKSON seem like they're doing a buddy flick rigged to simulate what Mel Gibson did with his LETHAL WEAPON films. There's lots of humor, excitement, explosions, daring escapes and leaps from high places as they tear around New York City trying to prevent terrorist (JEREMY LYONS) from blowing up a public school.As Leonard Maltin says: 'It's like watching 12 chapters of a hi-tech Saturday matinÃ©e serial all at once,' with non-stop action piled onto a thin plot that has the bomber using his threats as a diversionary device so that he and his army of goons can use dumpsters to load gold from the Federal Reserve Bank.Both Willis and Jackson have to undergo a number of physical hardships and beatings to attempt any number of athletic stunts they're forced to perform in the course of tracking down the riddles they're given by Irons. Irons, it seems, is intent on using ex-cop Willis as the target of his demands because he threw Lyons' brother off a roof a few years previously. That's about the depth of character involvement we get.But since the film is all about action, any fan of this genre is bound to get their money's worth. All the stunts are elaborately staged, the color photography (particularly of New York City's congested streets and bridges) is excellent and Michael Kamen's music wrings the most out of every explosive situation.Summing up: For thrill seekers only, but don't expect credibility when the brutal punishment Willis and Jackson take makes it improbable that they survived their mission intact. There's a comic book feel to the whole movie because all the action is over-the-top.",6,0,2,22 May 2007
Jaws," Man against shark...terrifying and vastly entertaining...
","What PSYCHO did for not taking showers, JAWS did for keeping people away from the ocean. And it's no wonder! The first terrifying attack is awesome in its ferocity, thanks to the screaming torments of the young woman trying to get away from the thing below the surface. After that, the film builds slowly but gathers suspense with each scene, especially each beach scene. The mayor's refusal to shut down the beach is simply an act of greed (it's the height of the tourist season), but once the attacks begin to multiply it's up to Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw to do something about catching the great white shark.All three carry the second half of the film aboard a boat that has Schneider delivering the unforgettable line: 'We should have had a bigger boat!' after he spots the shark for the first time. The plot gets a fair share of thrills once it becomes clear that killing the shark is not going to be an easy matter.Adding greatly to the suspense is a wonderful John Williams score and great cinematography. Incredible that Stephen Spielberg was only 29 when he directed this little masterpiece of man against beast.Well worth watching--and guaranteed to hold your interest throughout the final hour especially. One can sense the influence of MOBY DICK on the screenplay, especially with Quint's obsession to kill the shark.",8,1,3,3 July 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Still one of the all-time great animated classics...
","My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at Radio City Music Hall and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler. He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a 'masterpiece' and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing 'Heigh-Ho', the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.",Null,50,55,14 July 2001
Inception," Dream invasion is the focus of a strange and ambiguous film...
","I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.",6,20,34,21 July 2010
The Good Shepherd," The murky world of CIA deception as seen by one family man...
","Before I go on to praise the good points of THE GOOD SHEPHERD, I should mention at the start that the film badly needed some judicious editing. There are many scenes that go on for too long a time and are badly in need of some artful editing to get the point across just as well.Aside from length, everything else about the film is on the plus side--the handsome cinematography, the vast amount of settings, the background score that adds to the drama, and the performances of the entire cast which are uniformly good. I'm not a great admirer of ANGELINA JOLIE as an actress, but here I think she demonstrated skill at suggesting the loneliness, frustrations and jealousies of a woman whose life has to remain outside the boundaries of her husband's job with the CIA. Through a series of detailed vignettes, the murky world of an agent's life of deception within the government is sharply observed.More of a character study of Edward Wilson (played in stolid, very serious fashion by MATT DAMON) than a straightforward spy yarn, it manages to hold the interest even though it uses the flashback method of storytelling that is apt to confuse a viewer if it isn't done well. But here again, there is a flaw--it covers a span of twenty or more years but the aging of the central character is never quite convincing enough. Damon never looks that much older than his grown son--whereas a few gray hairs might have helped considerably. As his grown son, EDDIE REDMAYNE does reasonably well as the man seeking his father's approval.As for the supporting players in this story about one man's experiences in the newly developing CIA, JOHN TURTURRO does an outstanding job as a tough inquisitor and MICHAEL GAMBON is outstanding as a security risk with homosexual tendencies. ALEC BALDWIN has little to do but is intense enough as one of the agency's top men and others in the cast maintain credibility all the way through.The story itself is rather problematic in that nothing is what it seems and not all the information is readily given to the viewer in a way that makes sense. This is partly the fault of the script and partly the fault of director Robert De Niro who also assumes a small role effectively.But still, despite the handicap of being too long (and a bit too involved at certain points), it makes for fascinating viewing and is the kind of film you dare not divert your attention from for a moment. If you do, you are liable to miss an essential plot point.Summing up: Highly recommended for anyone with a keen interest in espionage dramas.",7,140,198,24 December 2006
Stalag 17," Survives translation from stage to screen with flying colors...
","Personally, I always thought that if WILLIAM HOLDEN deserved to win an Oscar, it was for SUNSET BLVD., not STALAG 17. But don't get me wrong. He's very effective here as the man everyone in the prison camp thinks is the 'stoolie' who is getting favors from the Germans because he's a thief and a snitch.Holden plays the role without any redeeming character traits other than as a man looking out solely for himself. Most of the time he's quick with a cynical one-liner or smirks rather condescendingly at the foibles of his fellow prisoners. And always, he's on his guard because he knows he's got to look out for the real mastermind hiding among them.The suspense comes from wondering when the real villain will be unmasked. And how. And along with this suspense, there's a lot of dark humor and rowdy laughter, particularly when the men are hellbent on enjoying whatever freedoms they have.It's a taut exercise in suspense laced with humor throughout. As the prison warden, OTTO PREMINGER is almost a caricature of a German soldier, but PETER GRAVES is very effective as the security officer who keeps a low profile. The ending is very effective, with an unexpected twist, and the final impression is one of a strong prison drama enacted superbly by its all male cast, thanks to the solid direction of Billy Wilder.",8,2,4,25 August 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...
","THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as 'the only guilty man in Shawshank.' The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",7,6,11,17 September 2006
Platoon," The ugliness of war as seen by an infantry platoon...
","I saw this one years after it was made and the biggest imprint on me was making me feel depressed after watching how the men struggled to keep their sanity in a war that made no sense to anyone at the time.CHARLIE SHEEN is excellent as the college youth whose innocence about man's inhumanity to man gradually changes during the course of ground combat in the jungles of Vietnam; and WILLIAM DAFOE and TOM BERENGER excel as two Marine sergeants who oppose each other (hate is a better word) with Berenger being the brutal bully and Dafoe representing a saner approach.Oliver Stone won his Best Picture/Best Director award and it's easy to see why. He kept the film's narrow focus on the men and the struggle they all have for survival under brutal circumstances. Missing are the stereotyped war buddies so commonly seen in the '40s films (the guy from Brooklyn, the dumb newbie, the baby-faced Marine) and instead we have more realistic characters facing a relatively unseen enemy hidden in the thick brush and using the kind of profane language servicemen commonly do whether in wartime or peace.It's quite an achievement in capturing all the ugliness of war up close and personal--but clearly not a film for everyone. And because it doesn't paint a rosy picture of America at war, it can be particularly depressing to watch at this time. Another possible flaw is that it has no clearly discernible plot and you're left constantly wondering where the whole story is going.",7,0,2,21 October 2006
Halloween," Good for a scary Halloween treat...still has raw power to frighten...
","John Carpenter put together a pretty fascinating little scare film with this Halloween treat that was so successful it spawned a couple of less worthy sequels. Here the chills are genuinely frightening, as is the overall atmosphere aided and abetted by one of the creepiest background scores ever to occupy the soundtrack of a slasher film.The frightened heroine is JAMIE LEE CURTIS, babysitting on Halloween night and being told by her young charges that something strange is happening at the house across the street. We switch back and forth between Jamie and her charges and another girl whom we know is about to be visited by escaped lunatic Michael Myers.The suspense is maintained at high level the moment the first attack takes place--and from then on, the scares become more intense as Jamie realizes she and the kids are in real danger.Takes its place among the great horror classics, thanks to some superb photography, direction and music--as well as some convincing performances from a relatively unknown (at the time) cast, with the exception of DONALD PLEASENCE as Dr. Loomis.A Halloween delight.",7,0,4,30 August 2006
Paths of Glory," Powerful look at men in battle under trench warfare...
",PATHS OF GLORY provides an interesting glimpse into wartime conditions during World War I when trench warfare was the common way to fight the enemy. The story concerns a self-serving French General (George MacReady) who believes that cowardice must be punished by randomly choosing three soldiers to face the firing squad. KIRK DOUGLAS is outstanding as the officer sympathetic to the men's plight who decides to defend them against a Court Martial.The supporting cast is studded with excellent performances. WAYNE MORRIS is especially good in a deeper than usual role for him as the real coward of the company chosen by Douglas to lead the firing squad. And ADOLPHE MENJOU is devious and cunning as the back-stabbing General who lets MacReady know that he too is going to be scrutinized by the authorities for conduct Douglas has made known to Menjou.Gripping war drama full of realistically filmed battle scenes guaranteed to make anyone understand how men become shell-shocked under constant enemy bombardment.The performance of KIRK DOUGLAS is another milestone in his career. Never has he seemed more defiant and courageous than he does here. My only quibble with the film is that its ending is just a bit murky as to intent and could have used a more satisfying wrap-up to the story.,7,0,2,9 December 2005
Carrie," Chilling horror story of an unusual night at the prom...
","CARRIE probably represents the sort of outsider feelings author Stephen King had as a nerdy teen-ager in high school. He was able to reach into those cruel childhood memories to create a girl with telekinetic powers that gives her the ability to wreak revenge on her tormentors in a big, over-the-top sort of way.And he found the perfect director for such a project in Brian De Palma. His vision of Carrie's everyday torments makes for a very gripping film and one that deservedly won Oscar nominations for both SISSY SPACEK and PIPER LAURIE. Standouts in the cast include AMY IRVING, JOHN TRAVOLTA and NANCY ALLEN (who became De Palma's wife).The disturbing scenes between Carrie and her mother have tremendous power but the highlight of the film, of course, is the famous prom scene where all hell breaks loose when the pranks get out of hand. It's a testament to the skillful playing of Spacek and Laurie that they got Oscar nominations in what is essentially a quality horror film.Summing up: If you like Stephen King stories, CARRIE ranks with the best.",7,1,2,20 November 2006
The Queen," Splendid recreation of events surrounding Diana's death...
","HELEN MIRREN is, of course, the focal point in THE QUEEN, but MICHAEL SHEEN as Tony Blair certainly more than matches her in the role of Britain's youngest prime minister. The two of them give towering performances that will remain indelibly impressed on your mind after viewing the film. Mirren is all crisp elegance and Sheen is a charmer who knows how to use his powers of persuasion. Both of them are ideally cast in roles they seem to inhabit with consummate ease.The screenplay deals with the unpleasant private events unfolding at the palace while the public mourning was obviously so great that it had to be acknowledged. The Queen preferred keeping tight-lipped and dignified, obviously not a woman who was pleased with Diana's conduct. Nor was her husband Prince Philip (JAMES CROMWELL) or Prince Charles (ALEX JENNINGS) who at least reminded his mother that Diana loved her children dearly.Handsomely photographed with newsreel footage of the crowds that began swelling shortly after Diana's demise in that tragic accident, its dialog is convincing throughout, concise and to the point without any frills whatsoever. The only weakness in the casting would seem to be SYLVIA SYMS as the Queen Mother who somehow doesn't look the role.The original background score by Alexandre Desplat is worthy of note, always appropriate and sometimes majestic. The scene with The Queen seeing the stag on the hillside while waiting for her car to be repaired is a standout, beautifully played.Summing up: A rare treat, and a slice of history well worth remembering with the shift from the old monarchy to the modernized ideas of a young Prime Minister emphasized in the script.",7,4,7,21 July 2007
The Iron Giant," Succeeds brilliantly as entertainment...fine animation...
","There was a preoccupation with paranoia about invasion from aliens that permeated all the science fiction in the '50s. This story builds on that fear by giving us an E.T. sort of encounter with an alien, in this case a super-sized piece of metal called THE IRON GIANT, who is saved from extinction by a little boy who pulls the 'Off' switch when it appears the Giant is about to be electrocuted.It's stunning right from the opening scenes, animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors (HARRY CONNICK, JR., VAN DIESEL, CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL).Not only is the story engrossing, but there's a humanization of 'the creature from outer space' that defies description. The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act (at the climax) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death.There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen, without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films, and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events.Briskly entertaining and well worth watching--among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy. The very expert voice-overs make the characters seem amazingly real.",6,1,6,14 November 2006
The Woman in Black," Atmospheric and moody Victorian ghost story offers plenty of shivers...
","You have to be in the mood for a good, authentically creepy ghost story to fully enjoy the quiet chills of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago. Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.",7,3,8,8 February 2012
Shrek," A lovable ogre and his donkey friend steal the show...
","SHREK is probably more fun for adults than children, especially if you can recognize all the twisted elements derived from a whole flock of Disney films or Grimm's Fairy Tales.The humor is clever, although sometimes crude, and the animation has a 3D look with some very clever special effects, especially for the scene of the fire-breathing dragon chasing Shrek, the donkey and the princess across a rickety bridge over a pit of lava.The spirit of fun is more evident than ever in the Robin Hood sequence with the Merry Men bursting into song and dance.Of course, all the voices are expertly done by people like MIKE MEYERS, JOHN LITHGOW, CAMERON DIAZ and EDDIE MURPHY, none of them sounding conspicuously like their real-life selves except for Murphy.Personally, I still prefer hand drawn animation over all this computer generated stuff, so I'm not the most unbiased person to review this sort of animated film.Summing up: Funny with an odd sort of charm but terribly overrated by today's generation of moviegoers.",6,2,5,28 September 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Sound imbalance between soft spoken dialog and music or explosions...
","The technical errors in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES are enough to warn viewers that they'll wish there were subtitles for some of the quiet scenes between Marion Cotillard and/or Anne Hathaway, both of whom have a habit of dropping their voices at key moments. Miss Cotillard has whole sentences that are key to an understanding of her character that are barely intelligible. Surely, whoever designed the audio mix has some explaining to do.Otherwise, fans will get their money's worth of action and thrills despite a lumbering plot that takes far too long to unwind after a breathtaking opening shot involving mid-air hostages.And the performances are uniformly fine from the large cast--Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Matthew Modine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. But the flaws are there in the script which has too many strands of sub-plots to cover and too many humiliating fights between Bane and Batman before the man of steel redeems himself again.Nevertheless, there are moments where it kicks into high gear between some dull stretches. Christopher Nolan sees to it that the action sequences are given top priority to any other values inherent in the script.Personally, I still prefer the first and second 'Batman' films to this one which is sometimes too muddled in content. Biggest drawback is the fact that the sound mix of voices vs. explosions (and Hans Zimmer's music) has been poorly handled at key moments in plot development.Fans of 'Batman' will probably overlook these weaknesses in the long run, but I felt they should be pointed out.",6,4,11,7 August 2012
Ben-Hur," New DVD version is a full restoration of sight and sound...brilliant achievement!
","'Ben-Hur' is such a great film, it's a pleasure to report that the newly restored Wide Screen 4-Disc DVD version (which includes the 1925 silent screen film with Ramon Novarro) is right on the mark. The color has been restored to its original brilliance with every scene clearly in focus and the soundtrack gives full range to Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. More than ever, Rozsa's score seems to have an energy and force of its own, underlining all the drama inherent in a story of this kind. And Charlton Heston's work in the title role is sheer perfection. He captures the character so completely that he IS Ben-Hur.Not often does such an epic have human characters that are not dwarfed by all the spectacle. The characters are all fully-dimensional human beings--particularly the two antagonists (Judah Ben-Hur and Messala), once great friends but now divided by political loyalties. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are outstanding in the leads (Boyd should definitely have won an Oscar as Messala for his chilling death scene alone!). All the other important roles are flawlessly cast. The chariot race is the most explosive and breathtaking seventeen minutes ever given to such a spectacular event--and all of the stunts look perfectly real. It's hard to believe that none of the stunts ended with more than minor injuries.The final scene, which follows soon after the chariot race, with Ben-Hur returning home and slowly climbing the steps to find that his mother and sister have been cured, still gives me goose bumps when I see it. As does the poignant scene in the leper colony where he insists on seeing their cave dwelling. Both scenes are strongly bolstered by Miklos Rozsa's brilliant score.Fully deserved all the awards it won. Should be released theatrically to show folks that even in 1959, Hollywood had all the technical skill to bring something like this off--with spectacular results! But in the meantime, this newly restored DVD is a keeper.",9,5,10,5 May 2001
Casino Royale," Smashing action sequences but the gambling scenes are too lengthy...
","First, let me say that DANIEL CRAIG makes a very believable James Bond and is certainly up to the demands of all the action sequences. What he seems to lack (in between all the brawls and stunts) is the sort of charm that characterized Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan when they weren't engaged in stunts. He has piercing blue eyes, a cold look, a nasty temper when aroused and all the other attributes needed for Bond--but he could work on the charm.Two more minor complaints: I wasn't at all impressed with either of the Bond girls--each with accents that hindered understanding their words when they whispered--which was often and neither one a great beauty.And secondly, that theme song under the opening credits added nothing to the credits which were, in themselves, stunning to look at with gorgeous graphic art. The song was a complete throwaway and 'you know my name' was about the only phrase I could decipher from the lyrics sung at full blast.Other than that, no complaints except that the gambling scenes went on a little too long--with some exciting intervals between playing a card game involving millions which Bond had to prevent from going to fund terrorist activities. All of the Bond action scenes were superb, the best of their kind, with realistic beatings and risks being taken at full steam ahead. How anyone managed not to get injured during the making of this film, I'll never understand. Those stunt players (and Craig himself) deserve kudos for what they pull off here in the way of action-filled moments. One of the most memorable is the chase up and down construction sites that gets the story off to a flying start.JUDY DENCH does a great job as 'M', giving Bond a tongue-lashing for what she calls his overgrown ego that is stifling his judgment. I've seen better villains in other Bond films and nothing particularly memorable here to make me change my mind--except that the torture scene is almost unbearable to watch.Overall, it's a stunning Bond action film with just an occasional lag but it manages to hold interest throughout with some choice bits of editing and direction. And DANIEL CRAIG comes through with flying colors except for that one ingredient--sophisticated charm. He could work on that as he grows into the part.",7,6,11,28 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Abandoned toys make their great escape in sequel that exceeds expectations...
","If ever there was a film that exceeds all expectations it's Pixar's TOY STORY 3, a movie with the familiar cast headed by TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively, featuring the further adventures of the toy gang everyone fell in love with after the first smash hit.The toys are accidentally abandoned when Andy's mom is helping him pack for college. They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care. As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series and even exceed expectations with a story of depth, compassion and humor that gets better as it goes along.Highly recommended.",8,1,2,16 February 2011
Signs," Works up some eerie suspense but is ultimately unsatisfying...
","Most of the suspense is well geared to keep you wondering how on earth this plot is going to be unraveled--but when the windup comes it's a disappointment in more ways than one. I was with the story until the last fifteen minutes when the whole thing just fell apart--but along the way there are many things to admire.The performances are all first-rate, although I would have preferred a better, more appealing child actor than Rory Culkin as the son who reads up on aliens. He lacks the distinct personality of his more famous brother. Abigail Breslin, on the other hand, is a sheer delight in her role, reminiscent of Drew Barrymore in 'ET'. Joaquin Phoenix does a standout job as Mel Gibson's brother who can wield a mean baseball bat and Gibson himself is so subdued for a change that it makes you wonder if he really believed in the script. Phoenix and his relationship with the children provides some humorous highlights that are welcome in this kind of intense story. It's nice to see him in a more wholesome role than usual.The suspense is guaranteed to keep you glued to the screen until the letdown of an ending. Just be advised that there are compensations for keeping a sharp eye on the film before the disappointing denouement. M. Night Shyamalan can be praised for an original script and some smart direction--but too bad the religious aspects of the story were so muddled as to seem foolish. James Newton Howard's score is highly effective for this kind of story, especially toward the end.Enjoy at your own risk because along the way the contrivances show.",Null,18,33,28 May 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Episodic, uneven but good-humored Allen film with intense Sean Penn...
","Not a typical Woody Allen film, as you can see from a cast headed by SEAN PENN, SAMANTHA MORTON and UMA THURMAN.Penn is a little known jazz musician from the '30s era so there's a lot of jazz guitar music on the soundtrack. Obviously it's a story close to Woody's heart. Penn plays the most down on his luck musician since Kirk Douglas in YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN.One of the film's best lines: 'A pimp doesn't need business cards.' Yes, Penn's associations are on the tawdry side but he looks to be getting full enjoyment out of his colorful role. He plays a real loser whose dreams always blow up in smoke. It's a juicy role for Penn since most of the dialog belongs to his character--when girlfriend SAMANTHA MORTON turns out to be a mute. She spends most of the time munching on food while she watches him with a baleful eye. But the tender scenes between Penn and Morton make the whole story worthwhile.During one of his kleptomaniac moments he meets UMA THURMAN whom he subsequently marries. Uma is her usual seductive self. But I'm giving away too much plot. Suffice it to say, it's an enjoyable Allen film and much of the charm comes from the authentic look to the '30s era and the jazz background.Summing up: Endearingly funny, except for a downbeat, bittersweet ending.Try it, you'll like it.",6,0,0,16 September 2006
The Deer Hunter," Gritty film can hardly be called entertainment...
","I have to admit I never liked 'The Deer Hunter' or viewed it as a satisfying war drama. Instead, I took an instant dislike to the three main characters and could only find some consolation in the impressive early performance of Meryl Streep.I found it extremely slow moving, irritating with its focus on three moronic blue collar workers who come across as loutish and brutish airheads, and unpleasant in all of its war details. Yes, the Russian roulette scene was fascinating but--like everything else about the film--given too much footage. The wedding scene in the early part of the film was also given to extended coverage. Some judicious editing of all of the film's content would have made it more bearable for me.I was not among those pleased that the movie was honored with Oscar awards for achievement. Robert DeNiro did give a very competent performance and was Oscar nominated as Best Actor. Christopher Walken received a Best Supporting Actor award and the film itself even won the Best Picture award. But in the years between first viewing it and now, I haven't changed my opinion of the film and don't believe it deserves the adulation it has won. I don't find the characters at all likeable and would rather not spend three hours of my time watching some quirky and unappealing characters become even more distasteful as the story unwinds.I suppose the subject matter of the film has a lot to do with my disapproval of the story as a whole. None of the Vietnam films have been the equal of the fine war films depicting World War I and II. They have not even come close to them.The Academy honoring the film must have felt it met all the requirements of social significance to qualify for the award. Sorry, I don't quite see it that way.",Null,7,13,23 May 2001
Identity," The plot is based on a combination of several past thrillers...
","IDENTITY is really a case of stolen identity. It borrows heavily from a number of other thrillers by using elements of them and stirring them up into a new blend of chills.Many are cliché ridden elements: a savage thunderstorm at a deserted highway motel in the middle of nowhere, a number of people who realize that they are being killed off one by one, a couple of authority figures who only appear to be what they are, and several other twists such as having the chief suspect being completely innocent. There are shades of Agatha Christie, 'Psycho' and several other stories that must have been the inspiration for the plot.But sadly, the film is badly marred by some senseless revelations and a completely baffling twist ending that is surprising but unbelievable.Good for any mystery fan who likes a story that makes you think, and well acted by RAY LIOTTA, JOHN CUSACK, ALFRED MOLINA and others, but misses being taken as a serious thriller by quite a wide margin.",6,2,4,11 October 2009
Speed," Guaranteed to give you a rush...the ultimate film for action fans...
","'Speed' has to be the ultimate action film, involving you in an intense experience from the opening credits until the smash-bang climax. Not only do Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do top work, but Dennis Hopper makes the most compelling villain of the '90s.It all starts with a revenge-driven extortionist letting authorities know he has planted a bomb on a bus. The catch is it will explode if the bus is driven at less than fifty miles an hour. The script races along with non-stop action and surprise twists, without ever giving the audience time to stop for breath. It's a little too intense for its own good and could have used some lighter moments to give us a break!Taut and suspenseful, with excellent effects and gripping suspense that keeps you riveted. Some of the stunts seem too incredible to be believable but in a film of this kind you have to go with the flow. The stunt work itself is breathtaking and makes it easy to see why the film is one of the most highly rated action films of the '90s.",Null,51,67,18 May 2001
Live Free or Die Hard," A rolllercoaster thrill ride from beginning to end...the franchise is alive and kicking...
","Once again BRUCE WILLIS in the guise of John McClane saves the world from professional hackers out to disrupt the U.S. government and shut down the financial structure completely--an act of revenge by a former insider (TIMOTHY OLYPHANT) whose warnings went unheeded by those in charge.And the action is practically non-stop, with one big stunt sequence after another. Midway through the film I was wondering how they would top the last big explosion, but the screenwriter never ran out of even more dangerous stunts to come. This has got to be one of the most physically demanding roles Willis (and his stuntman) ever played.Amid all the tension there's a nice sense of humor going on between Willis and his young Hacker friend (JUSTIN LONG), with the banter never missing a clever exchange of lines as they join forces to fight the villain out to destroy America. At the end, of course, there's plenty of guts and glory for both of them who manage to survive all the attempts to destroy them at terrific odds.While preposterous, the screenplay does make you think twice about what might happen if our dependence on computers went totally haywire. It's this aspect of the story that gives it that much needed adrenalin rush for today's movie fans.Summing up: The franchise is alive and kicking with some astonishing action stunts and some really better than average work from Willis and his sidekick Long. A welcome summer blockbuster.",7,6,12,9 July 2007
Amélie," Charming tale of a girl who lives amid a world of eccentrics...
","Charming, eccentric tale of a girl who wants to enrich the lives of others around her--all of whom seem to be oddities of the first order. AUDREY TAUTOU is charming in the title role as a girl who lives with her eccentric father in a house and neighborhood teaming with strange characters.Her motives about enriching the lives of others is hammered home from the very start, after the tragic death of her mother. Her do-gooder nature is triggered by the discovery of a neighbor's mementos of forty years ago hidden behind a loose tile in her bathroom. She decides to track down the owner and if he's properly touched by the return of his boyhood treasures, she'll go on doing good work for the rest of her life to make others happy.On this rather flimsy premise, the film is a series of vignettes in her life while she tries to fulfill her mission in strange ways. It's quirky, richly imaginative and rather clever from the very start, narrated with style and exquisitely photographed.For Amelie, life is a series of small pleasures. So is the film. Aside from some bawdy situations (the French, you know), it stays mostly on track to deliver a good deal of charm and sentiment. One never knows where the story is going, especially when she falls in love with a young man with an odd addiction who turns out to be her Prince Charming.Summing up: Quirky, richly imaginative, but as far-fetched as a famous French fairytale that begins with 'C'. The romantic aspect is enriched by the final sweet encounter with her prince.",6,4,12,22 October 2006
The Sixth Sense," Puzzling, absorbing, good twist as the final touch...
","To fully accept the premise of THE SIXTH SENSE, you first have to accept BRICE WILLIS as a prominent child psychologist after seeing him in all those DIE HARD films. He goes from an action star to an intense doctor absorbed with a child patient (HALEY JOEL OSMENT) who claims he can see the dead.Struggling professionally after a maniacal ex-patient has shot and wounded him in the heat of rage, the psychologist is determined to help Osment from going off the deep end the way his former patient did. That is the crux of the story.It involves flashbacks, flash forwards and all kinds of camera tricks to keep you guessing how it's all going to end, since the big hype about the film was that it had a twist ending. Well, it was a surprise to me--but now, years later, after seeing so many films of this ilk which are obviously copycat types that deal with ghosts or the supernatural--I'm not so sure I'd be fooled so easily again.However, a surprise it was for me and it's done so cleverly that you'll want to revisit the film to see just how the trickery was managed.BRUCE WILLIS cannot quite do away with the smirk he had as the anti-hero in many a film, so I have to reserve some criticism for his performance. But it doesn't matter since the film revolves around the dark secrets and behavior of HALEY JOEL OSMENT, very good child actor who manages to keep the plot believable and interesting.Absorbing thriller, even if it starts out a little slowly and doesn't really build up its suspense in a taut way. But that ending is clever!",6,2,4,16 September 2006
The Producers," Zany Mel Brooks comedy is over-the-top laugh riot...
","There are so many laughs in THE PRODUCERS (long before Mel Brooks lost his magic touch), that you'll be in tears by the time Brooks gets to his 'Springtime for Hitler' routine. ZERO MOSTEL's early scenes with ESTELLE WINWOOD are hilarious enough, but he and GENE WILDER top themselves by the time you get to the frantic ending.LEE MEREDITH is the curvy Ulla who can shake a mean hip and DICK SHAWN is the hilariously daffy Lorenzo St. DuBois (LSD for short), and everyone in the cast has a fine time delivering over-the-top performances in the spirit in which this sort of satire requires.The story is simply that of a producer running short on cash who devises a scheme whereby if he produces the worst musical in the world, he can actually get his investment back and then some. He convinces his mild-mannered bookkeeper GENE WILDER to join him in the scheme and then the fun gets off to a great start.The climactic 'Springtime for Hitler' is just one of the delirious highlights (if politically incorrect by today's standards), and is probably the reason so many of the comments here resent the film and everything it stands for. But there's no getting away from it--the script is downright brilliant and original--winning an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and numerous other writing awards including an award from The Writer's Guild of America.Summing up: Mel Brooks at his wittiest.",7,25,28,20 January 2007
Cinderella," Delightful Disney animation with some pleasant songs...
","When I first saw 'Cinderella', I found it surprising that the mice had so much to do whereas in the fairy tale they were just incidental creatures. But Disney saw that giving them a big role in the main storyline was the key to providing all the humor and suspense needed to spice up the predictable story. The leading mice, Gus and Jaq are delightful creations and the valiant band of mice are given amusing bits of business.Artistically, the animation art has a rather glossy modern look despite the fact that it's an old, old story from 1697, a classic children's fairy tale that has been done countless times as either a film, a play or a ballet. But this version will charm Disney fans young and old with its imaginative use of animation and a splendid collection of tuneful songs.A highlight is the 'Cinderella Work Song' in which the mice make a dress for the mistreated Cinderella, full of inventive comic touches and accompanied by the intricate blend of song and animation. Add to that 'So This Is Love', 'A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes' and 'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo' and you have a charming version of the Charles Perrault story.For villainy, the stepmother and her black cat (Lucifer) are two of the most brilliantly animated creatures in the film. The cat reminds me of a naughty black cat I once owned. The scene where the stepmother is stroking the cat as she gives Cinderella a list of chores is striking in its use of shadow and menace. Along with some dark touches, there is always a bubbling sense of humor, particularly in this sequence.Cinderella herself comes across as a pleasant heroine with a sense of humor herself, lifelike in her movements and one of Disney's more successful human figures. Disney's artists did greater art work in other films but this is a well-structured work, a great combination of music and clever animation. The pace is fast, even allowing for extended scenes of the mice and their shenanigans for the sub-plot. And Lucifer, the cat, makes a wonderful foil for their tricks.The Disney touch is evident in every scene and makes this charming blend of comedy, music and romance a film with timeless appeal.",Null,31,32,15 July 2001
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series...
","HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: 'Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt.' Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was 'off' once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as 'Snape.' His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many 'surprises' among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.",8,1,2,6 December 2011
Rear Window," In a world where nobody ever heard of window blinds...
","While I thoroughly enjoyed REAR WINDOW and think it's among Hitch's best films, I always observe how easy it was for Stewart's character to view the lives around him. It seems that nobody in the entire neighborhood ever heard of keeping curtains or window blinds in more discreet positions. We are forced to believe that all of these people leave their windows totally exposed to the naked eye even though they face an apartment building not more than fifty feet away, and even when scantily clad or seeking a romantic rendezvous.Of course, little do they suspect that a wheelchair-bound photographer is stalking them through his binoculars and keeping tabs on their everyday quirks and foibles. This is where the story taps into the psyche of the main character, brilliantly played by JAMES STEWART.He gets excellent support from a first-rate cast, although I think GRACE KELLY was a bit arch as his female companion. However, it's RAYMOND BURR (as a man Stewart suspects has killed his wife), JUDITH EVELYN (as 'Miss Lonelyhearts'), WENDELL COREY (as a skeptical detective), and most of all, THELMA RITTER as a wise-cracking nurse, who really stir things up.Hitchcock shows complete control of his camera, forcing us to view everything just the way Stewart sees things and focusing our attention where it ought to be through the development of the story, which is loosely based on a Cornel Woolrich short story.It's the kind of film where you have to be watching and on the alert all the time so as not to miss anything.Highly satisfying and typically good Hitchcock suspense that builds to a tense stand-off at the climax.",8,1,3,26 August 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," This is the real thing...truly terrifying even after all these years...
","The horror genre today has cornered the market on slasher films of all types that appeal mainly to teen-agers and young adults. But the one Wes Craven film that still stands high and above as a towering example of a great horror film is NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.Its great success is partly because the blurring of dreams and reality is so cleverly done that the audience, along with the participants on screen, scarcely knows when to believe Freddy is real or not. And Freddy Krueger here is not played for laughs, as he was in later NIGHTMARE films. There is an occasional touch of humor, but for the most the horror is played straight and it really works.The revenge motif is clearly explained with Freddy getting even with the parents who burned him to death by tracking down their children. Perhaps the scariest moment in the whole film is the episode involving the unfortunate victim, Johnny Depp, in one of his first roles. The gory, vindictive nature of Freddy Krueger is fully exploited in this sequence.Fans of the series should make sure they see this one. It stands head and shoulders above most horror flicks that have come along since 1984.Wes Craven has gotten an excellent performance from Robert Eglund as the man with the claws and the other players are not far behind.

","No, I wasn't expecting 'depth' to the characters nor was I expecting to see a documentary about the famous battle at Thermopylae--and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.King Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army. Butler is certainly not one-dimensional in the role, which is what would have happened in the hands of a less talented actor. He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen. The eye is drawn to him like a magnet, even in group scenes where his commanding presence dominates the action or the talk. Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role. In many close-ups he reminds me of the classic screen star ROBERT TAYLOR (think 'Ivanhoe').And others around him are fine too. LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own. She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes. Their final confrontation is a shocker.Visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art. This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.Butler's command of the screen is more evident here than in any other film to date, including his work in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. No doubt this will be an iconic role for him.Only drawback, at least in the theater I attended, is the sound mix of music and dialog could have been improved to the point where the spoken words are not drowned out by the relentless (but fascinating) background score, which tends to milk every melodramatic moment to the max.The battle scenes are well staged and I never found the use of slow motion distracting or inappropriate. Snyder has done a fantastic job.",7,7,14,21 March 2007
Tarzan," New 'deep canvas' backgrounds steal the show!!!
","'Tarzan' delves right into the core of the story from the very start, beginning with the shipwreck that causes mother, father and son to be castaways on an island inhabited by wild animals. The montage of scenes are brilliant as they show, side by side, comparison between the humans and the animal families. After this spectacular start, the timeworn story gets brilliant treatment from the Disney animators. The boy grows into the fearless hunk and his meeting with Jane in the jungle has to be one of the cleverest bits of animation ever. Jane is voiced by Minnie Driver in what is undoubtedly the top vocal job in the film.An exception is Rosie O'Donnell, but then--needless to say--I'm not an O'Donnell fan. Her vocals are a distracting annoyance since you immediately recognize it is she and the character becomes an obvious source of comic relief. But I digress. The film gets off to a great start and only occasionally stumbles. I didn't care for the bland Phil Collins songs--especially 'Trashing the Camp' (the entire scene should have been cut) but songs were not intended to be the strong point of this version of the Tarzan legend. Nor are they as effective as those in 'The Lion King'. But 'Tarzan' is a movie that really MOVES and you'll find yourself caught up in the frantic story from the very brilliant animation of the opening scenes. Only other weak factor of the animation is the poorly motivated villain who is too one dimensional and the Disney artists have made him a replica of Governor Ratcliffe in 'Pocahontas'. Other than that, it's top-notch Disney with the jungle settings looking more real than ever thanks to their new 'deep canvas' technique for background paintings. By all means, see it and enjoy!!",Null,7,12,29 April 2001
The Great Escape," Classic escape by POWs...excellent work by all-male cast...
","If ever there was a film that calls for ensemble acting by an all-male cast, this is it. And no one lets you down--all are at the peak of their performing talents--James Garner, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, David McCallum.There is no letdown in the purely 'escapist' overall enjoyment of the film either--sorry for the pun. At times, it seems almost like fun to be in a prisoner of war camp where everybody is so chummy and having a good time as they plot and plan their marvelous but dangerous escape. The plot whirls forward in such a breezy manner that it hardly seems possible the film is as lengthy as it is--well over two and a half hours. Details of the escape are photographed expertly.An impressive offbeat performance by Charles Bronson as the claustrophobic man who digs the tunnel comes as somewhat of a surprise. He turns out to be one of the few lucky escapees. After the escape, the film follows the adventures of several of them as, in turn, each one almost gets away with their plan. Only grim note in their adventures is the machine-gunning episode of 50 men who are told to get out of a truck in the middle of a field 'for exercise'. And a lasting impression is made by the vivid way the photography captures McQueen's brazen attempt to escape on motorbike through the Bavarian countryside. Stunningly photographed and impressively scored. McQueen's chase scene is nothing short of spectacular, best seen on wide screen version.Surprisingly, the only Oscar nomination was for film editing.
Escape films about POWs don't get any better--or more entertaining--than this one. By all means see it.",Null,5,10,27 May 2002
Saboteur," Still holds the interest but not top-notch Hitchcock...
","Perhaps with a stronger pair of stars SABOTEUR might have turned out to be a more impressive film than it actually is. ROBERT CUMMINGS, affable and pleasant as always, has to carry the film as a man on the lam fleeing the authorities because he's suspected of having blown up a munitions factory. He's a basically lightweight actor at his element in light romantic comedies--not in espionage films--and seems a strange choice for this role. Where is Joel McCrea or Gary Cooper when you need him?Likewise, Priscilla Lane, with her bubbly girl next door personality is not quite the type of blonde Hitchcock picked for his leading lady roles--and frankly, she's rather bland here and merely decorative.But the supporting cast is a good one--especially Otto Kruger as a blind man--and once the plot gets going, they all come in for closer inspection. The villain of the piece--played expertly by Norman Lloyd--is given scant screen time but he manages to make an impression nevertheless, especially in the famous Statue of Liberty finale.The story comes to a rather abrupt ending after a slow start and there are some moments in the middle that seem to drag. The pace is slower than usual for a Hitchcock film and today's audiences are more apt to expect the kind of thrills Hitch offered for his other more famous 'man on the lam' story--NORTH BY NORTHWEST.SABOTEUR has its fair share of gripping moments so it's still worth a watch--but don't expect too much. It's all a bit dated now and it's not top Hitchcock.",Null,1,1,1 December 2003
Gangs of New York," Impressive Scorsese epic marred by excessive bloodlust...
","Production-wise this is a richly produced epic of old New York focusing on gang rivalry in lower Manhattan circa 1860s, and the production values can't be faulted. Photography is expertly crafted, the main performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent (as a bloodthirsty villain called Billy the Butcher), and it is obvious that a great deal of research and historical detail was done to give credence to the story. Having said all that, the story could have been trimmed by at least an hour with some of the most graphic battle footage eliminated--and the effect would have been only slightly less startling. But Martin Scorsese has chosen to give the story a three hour running time to tell what is basically a tale of revenge that did not have to be amplified to include all of the bloated footage left in the final cut.It's clearly a film of murderous excesses and I can understand why the Academy chose not to give it the Best Picture Oscar.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing in his intense portrayal of The Butcher. Cameron Diaz as the 'heroine' seems to have a modern day look no matter what period she's supposed to be emoting in--and Leonardo DiCaprio is only semi-successful in his approach to the role of the avenging son of Liam Neeson. His accent comes and goes with each scene and is especially 'gone' whenever he narrates parts of the tale. Both he and Diaz are clearly more at home in modern roles. Additionally, a more rugged looking actor would have suited the role better.But, as stated before, the main flaw is the excessive butchery which is bad enough in the opening scene where DiCaprio's father is dispensed with by the Butcher. After that, every so often, the camera lovingly captures scenes of mutilation and killing, lovingly capturing every thrust of a knife. For a film of three hours length, it is all too much.Most of the performances surrounding the leads are excellent but one in particular stands out--Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco who meets a cruel death in the hands of The Butcher. It's hard to believe this is the same 'little boy' from E.T. He's excellent all the way through and should be commanding the screen in leading roles.Summing up: What could have been a great film is marred by excessive violence. There is indeed still such a thing as 'overkill' and it's too bad Martin Scorsese never gets the message.",Null,4,6,26 July 2003
Gladiator," Where was Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson???...Russell Crowe's gaze could melt an iceberg...
","While viewing GLADIATOR and seeing how the 'revenge' theme was carried to the fullest, I kept expecting to see Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson riding in on their horses to avenge the killing of Russell Crowe's family as they did in so many westerns.I have to give the film itself a mixed review--and mostly for technical reasons. First, I thought the performances were all splendid. Russell Crowe's intent gaze could melt an iceberg and he uses this intensity to add power to his portrayal. Believe me, it works. Joaquin Phoenix is so good that he should have won the Supporting Role Oscar for his work. He was spine-chilling as the villainous Commodus, pitted against his arch enemy Maximus. Great acting by both men. The battle scenes were excessively gory with buckets of blood gushing everywhere--on a grand scale befitting an epic but perhaps an indication that today's sensibilities are more than blurred.On the technical side, I don't understand all these comments about the photography. The color took on a distinctly murky look for much of the film, both interiors and exteriors. It made me wonder what kind of color stock was being used to get this muddy effect. Was it intentional? Take a look at the technicolor epics of the '40s and '50s where there was such great color contrast and brilliance in the color. I was very disappointed in the color photography. No need for it to be so dark. Perhaps on a large theater screen this wasn't as much a fault.Another thing--much of the dialog was muttered in soft tones that could not overcome the background music. A good dialog director should have coached the players to enunciate words more clearly. This is a fault that occurs throughout the film and is very distracting--and no, I'm not hard of hearing at all, thank you.Aside from those two quibbles, length was another factor that should have been solved with better editing. There are dull stretches where the dialog goes on much too long to make a point about character development.Definitely not a perfect film and not particularly Oscar worthy although I'm impressed by the performances. While SPARTACUS was a much more interesting look at gladiators, perhaps GLADIATOR was meant to be the thinking man's film about Ancient Rome. It just misses the mark.Russell Crowe's intense style of acting and Joaquin Phoenix's strikingly vivid villain made GLADIATOR work for me.",Null,2,7,7 June 2001
Pocahontas," Another triumph for Disney in the '90s...
","Perhaps there should have been a disclaimer at the start of the movie saying: 'Loosely based on the true story of the Indian princess' and then there wouldn't be all this fuss about a Disney movie not sticking to historical facts. First of all, when you go to see 'Pocahontas' knowing it's a Disney animated feature, do you really think you're going to see an accurate depiction of events? It's not meant to be a documentary--take it for what it is, a charming, completely enjoyable work of art with stunning visuals, great songs (by Menken and Schwartz) and an uplifting tale that has a message for kids and adults. What more could you want?
Definitely a must-see Disney film for the whole family. Should create an interest for kids to learn about the actual events if they are so inclined. As entertainment, it's top-grade Disney with a hauntingly beautiful score that would fit well into any Broadway musical. The songs are splendid: 'Just Around the Riverbend', 'Colors of the Wind', 'The Virginia Company' -- and the artwork combined with the music for the gold-digging number is outstanding. Belongs up there with 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' as one a serious film fan should not miss.",Null,91,117,5 May 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," This is why we go to the movies...amazing scenes of action and adventure on grand scale...
","The third in a series of Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a testament to the team of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who provide us with two hours of entertainment on a grand scale, thanks to some fine direction from Steven Spielberg and a rollicking good script. The duo exchange some lively banter in a believable way, bringing more depth to both characters and making us care more about their adventures.Keeping the Holy Grail out of the clutches of the Nazis is what makes the story click from the start, with adventures that range from sea to desert to majestic mountain hideaways, all while Indy and his dad are hotly pursued by the Nazis anxious to get their hands on the cup that promises immortality.A good supporting cast is on hand to give the story all the excitement it generates, including Denholm Elliot as a clueless professor and Alison Doody as an adventuress who seems to be helping the Nazis but turns against them at a crucial moment until her own greed works against her fate.All of it is filmed at a breathtaking pace, never stopping long enough to make you dwell on flaws in the logic of Indy's cliffhanging escapes and fights with Nazis aboard tanks in the desert. But aside from action, the script provides plenty of insight into the relationship between father and son, peppered with some witty dialog.All ages should enjoy this one, about as good as the original Indy film with the addition of Sean Connery providing bits of warmth and humor as dad to the world's most beloved archaeologist.",7,3,5,27 May 2012
Back to the Future," The kind of time travel fun film you can see again and again!!!
","If any film endeared MICHAEL J. FOX to movie audiences, it was BACK TO THE FUTURE ('85). He was an inspired choice to play Marty McFly, who meets up with crazy wizard scientist Doc Brown (CHRISTOPHER LLOYD) and finds himself living in small-town USA circa 1955 where he discovers that he must arrange a match between his parents who haven't yet connected.Lloyd plays Doc with wild-eyed enthusiasm, a stroke of genius for such an over-the-top kind of role. Completely in harmony with him is CRISPIN GLOVER as Marty's nerdy father, a joy to watch as he completely becomes this character. Then too, an added source of enjoyment is LEAH THOMPSON as Marty's mother/girlfriend who takes part in some of the most innocently funny 'incest' routines ever--and somehow, none of it manages to offend. It's all played for laughs and all of it works.Discovering that another actor originally started the Marty role and was then tossed aside (he was too intense and felt uncomfortable in the role), it's a wise decision that found MICHAEL J. FOX landing the role and keeping the whole story fresh, funny and innocent. He's an actor who tells you with his whole body what he is thinking--and his expressive face gets quite a workout when the plot thickens.My favorite time travel movie has the wildest climax imaginable, all very clever and full of inventive surprises. Don't miss this one.And last but not least: Thomas F. Wilson makes a great 'Biff', the town bully whose mere physical presence threatens to dominate many a scene.All of the action is directed at a frantic pace by Robert Zemeckis.",8,0,1,13 August 2006
Goodfellas," True gangster saga packs a wallop...
","Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese turns GOODFELLAS into an engrossing gangster saga that provides a lot of intense actors with some meaty acting roles--among them, RAY LIOTTA ('I always wanted to be a gangster'), JOE PESCI, ROBERT DeNIRO, LORRAINE BRACCO and PAUL SORVINO.The strong narrative follows the career of a youth, Henry Hill (RAY LIOTTA), an Irish lad living in a neighborhood ruled by the Italian Mafia who wants the easy life of crime and money and fancy cars and life in the fast lane. He enjoys the life of crime until it threatens to jeopardize the security of the life he has as a married man.It's a film very similar in theme to 'The Godfather', but not quite up to that level of achievement. RAY LIOTTA has never gotten enough credit for his leading role while most of the acting awards went to JOE PESCI as the gun happy hood with an explosive temperament in an Oscar-winning supporting role.If you like this sort of thing, this will be your ticket. Some of the scenes have a strong impact with startling realism as far as the violence goes, and it moves smoothly toward a satisfactory 'crime does not pay' conclusion. All of the performances are first rate and there's seldom a dull moment thanks to a soundtrack that includes a lot of pop songs of the period.",7,2,4,1 December 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Catch him if you can...he's still on the run...
","Another chase thriller from Robert Ludlum's novel and directed by Jack Greengrass with customary skill at this sort of thing. By now MATT DAMON has the amnesia with the quick reflexes down pat, and he's still just as agile when responding to any known threat by the C.I.A. and the agents who think he masterminded a case of espionage that they're investigating. They're in full pursuit mode again and he's on the run and under cover.If not the most original story, it does give the viewer a chance to watch events unfold against interesting backdrops--Italian, German and Russian cities provide eye candy for tourists--but the fast-moving chase scenes are likely to distract from too much concentration on scenery. They're spectacular, especially a rather long, involved car chase that twists and turns its way through city streets.Enjoyable sequel is about on par with the original 'Bourne' film. Some of the same cast is present but it's Matt Damon's show all the way.",7,0,2,17 September 2006
The Birds," Brilliant special effects heighten suspense in top Hitchcock thriller...
","'The Birds' gets you involved with the story right away as the camera follows Tippi Hedren into a pet store where she makes an inquiry about love birds. Next, she meets Rod Taylor and we immediately sense that there will be a growing bond between them that will lead to a bird attack of some sort. After that, Hitch slowly builds the suspense, climaxing midway with a gas station scene in which an expert on bird behavior (Ethel Griffies) expounds on her theories before a vicious attack outside the diner silences her. The most brilliant touch of all occurs during the schoolhouse scene with Hedren seated outside waiting for her teacher friend (Suzanne Pleshette). Unknown to her, birds are quietly lining up on the telephone wires and elsewhere, looking like ominous creatures against the sky. Other scenes are equally scary--particularly when the birds even attack by coming down the chimney--with the final attack occurring when Tippi Hedren climbs the steps to the attic. A gripping film, slow in starting as characters are introduced, but masterfully directed for the maximum of suspense once the birds start attacking. Definitely a 'must see' for any fan of Hitchcock films. The color photography of Bodega Bay and surrounding areas is excellent. Missing is a Bernard Herrmann background score--but the flapping of wings does nicely!",Null,1,2,23 April 2001
Valkyrie," Taut thriller in the WWII vein about a failed plot to kill Hitler...
","VALKYRIE accomplishes the mission it sets out to perform within a two hour running time. Under Bryan Singer's direction, it's a taut thriller bearing the outlines of a true story, handling a complex military plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler that depends on split-second timing to succeed. As we all know, it almost works. It's the 'almost' factor that gives the film a gripping edge, even though we know the plot fails. The complete story of the events is pared down to make a concise thriller that wastes not a second of screen time.As Colonel Von Stauffenberg, TOM CRUISE gives an effective performance, given that no more of his background is known or explained fully. He delivers a crisp, tight, forceful performance, bolstered by the fact that others around him do equally convincing jobs. BILL NIGHY, TERENCE STAMP, KENNETH BRANAGH, TOM WILKINSON, THOMAS KRETSCHMANN--these are the most prominent and all of them are splendid in portraying Nazi officers who recognize that Hitler's Germany is not the one they envision for the world, intent on seeing Hitler's Germany crushed and given new leadership.Photographed on many of the actual location sites in Germany, it's a vivid recreation of the period with excellent use of sets, costumes and explosives. All of the shattering wartime explosions are extremely well crafted, as is the bomb that almost destroys Hitler's conference room.The pulsating music score gives the film a solid amount of suspense once the plan is underway. This forces the first half of the film to be largely exposition, but none of the exposition is dull. It sets up the story to follow in an intelligent way.The New York Times movie critic dismissed the film's values and referred to Cruise as 'too much Tom Cruise' to be believable in the role. Not true. It's much more serious than that, and the film's tone is totally unlike the style of many of the war movies of the '40s--'Desperate Journey,' for example, featuring the antics of the Warner contract players in a film starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan about putting one over on the Nazis, which was juvenile nonsense.It's intelligent and engrossing from beginning to end, an efficient WWII yarn based on true incidents that should be seen and appreciated for what it is--not for bashing Mr. Cruise and whatever tabloid headlines exploit his personal life. It might also inform some of today's teen-agers about an event that actually happened during WWII--at least those teens who are interested in the subject.",7,6,11,27 December 2008
The Wizard of Oz," 'Wizard' remains forever young in heart...still gorgeous in technicolor...
","The restored prints of 'Wizard of Oz' available on VHS or DVD are well worth viewing for full enjoyment of this timeless classic. Thanks to the splendid work of all the original technicians, it's a film that stands the test of time with the best of them. Judy Garland is the perfect embodiment of Dorothy, the girl who dreams of being 'Over the Rainbow'; lanky, loose-limbed Ray Bolger is the ideal choice for Scarecrow; Jack Haley the definitive Tin Man; and Bert Lahr unforgettable as The Cowardly Lion. All of the supporting roles are expertly played, including Frank Morgan's tender job as the magician who tells Dorothy to go back to Aunt Em before the cyclone strikes. The magic was there in 1939 and has not diminished. Young and old can appreciate the artistry that went into the making of this spectacular children's fantasy, rivaled only by 'Mary Poppins' in terms of artistic merit. The perfect casting contributes to the film's greatness. Add a wonderful script, clever tunes (including Lahr's rendition of 'If I Were King of the Forest'), and Victor Fleming's sure-handed direction and you have a classic to treasure. Some of the art deco scenery may be a bit overstuffed at times but the charm and simplicity of the well-known tale cannot be underestimated. A true classic in glowing technicolor. Indeed, follow that yellow brick road!!",Null,1,2,13 April 2001
Law Abiding Citizen," Tense thriller has Butler seeking vengeance in a brutal way...
","Although there are plenty of opportunities to find loopholes in the script for LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's basically a thriller about vengeance sought by a man wronged by the justice system who feels he has a right to kill anyone connected with the case involving the brutal murder of his wife and daughter. JAMIE FOXX is the DA who orchestrates the plea bargain that gives one of the guilty men a good deal.And it's directed in such a skillful way by F. Gary Gray and played with such intensity by GERARD BUTLER and JAMIE FOXX, that it keeps you riveted to the screen for the duration of the plot. The supporting performances are all expert, especially VIOLA DAVIS as the frustrated mayor of Philadelphia and ANNIE CORLEY as a judge who rules by the book.When you stop to think about it, much of the plot is less than credible with Butler able to outwit and keep one step ahead of the authorities all the way until the contrived ending. But it's an interesting plot, keeping the viewer in suspense as to what will happen next. It succeeds on the high tension level right up to the fiery climax.Butler scowls a lot and gives the impression that he can hold a grudge better than any man on earth, especially since what he does goes to such extremes. Although none of the characters have much depth, they move through their roles with enough skill to make even the credibility angle be something you're likely to overlook for the sake of a good thriller. The tension is set at the grim opening scene and there's never a let-up, even though there are occasional bits of humor thrown in for good measure.",6,44,81,23 October 2009
From Here to Eternity," Gritty adaptation of sprawling best-seller...but it loses something as a film...
","I would have to say, after reading James Jones' sprawling novel about the peacetime Army in the days before Pearl Harbor, that this is about as good an abridgment of his work as could have been made at the time.All of the most brutal prison stockade scenes have been removed (along with the coarse language), personalities have been softened to suit the censorship of the time (Donna Reed is a 'hostess' instead of a whore), Warden's latent homosexuality is never mentioned, and yet--with all the deletions--Daniel Taradish has fashioned a very strong film script.As characters rebelling against authority, MONTGOMERY CLIFT and FRANK SINATRA do admirable jobs. Clift is especially touching in his combination of toughness and the ability to show his tender side; Sinatra is well cast as Maggio and makes the most of a strong supporting role.As Karen, DEBORAH KERR has been reduced to a supporting character, but she effectively portrays a lonely woman who cannot stay immune to the charms of equally lonely soldiers. Her famous love scene with Lancaster on the beach is the stuff movie magic is made of. It's the sort of role one might expect Joan Crawford to turn up in, so it's surprising to find Kerr in the role, a woman whose ladylike image made it a risky casting choice at the time.The most effective part of the film is Clift's fatal encounter with 'Fatso' (ERNEST BORGNINE). Their bitter exchanges lead to a nifty fight scene. Borgnine is such a believable bully that it's a wonder he was able to stretch beyond bully roles after this film. The antagonism between him and 'Prew' (CLIFT), as well as the big action set piece of the attack on Pearl Harbor, are just a couple of reasons why the film captures so much of the flavor of the best-selling novel. The love stories (both of them) are interwoven into the structure of the story with telling effect.But all in all, I've always felt that this film was overpraised from the very beginning by the critics. Perhaps because I read the hard-hitting James Jones novel first and was awestruck at what an accomplishment it was.The film only manages to be a pale carbon copy of the original work--but, as I said, it's still absorbing entertainment even with some of the characters diluted to meet censorship requirements.",7,11,17,25 August 2006
Atonement," Magnificent love story given the Ivory-Merchant kind of treatment...
","ATONEMENT ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years, boosted by some brilliant color photography, a lyrical background score, a well crafted script, and some fine ensemble performances. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines, but otherwise the cast is impeccable.Basically it's a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the English countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman (Knightley) and a handyman at her father's estate (JAMES McAVOY). Their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister Briony (amazing performance from SAOIRSE RONAN), who happens to spy on them from an upper window. She's a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her. He does, but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely pretended to drown.From that point on, the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives. In director Joe Wright's hands, the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied, by the conclusion, that the tale has been told in a very effective way.VANESSA REDGRAVE comes in toward the end, as the older version of the young woman who told a lie, and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting way.The standout performances are given by SAOIRSE RONAN as young Briony and JAMES McAVOY. McAvoy is impressive throughout, totally in command of a difficult role, almost emotionally draining in the film's detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shell-shocked manner. His confrontational moments with the eighteen year-old Briony (RAMOLA GARAI) are brilliantly played by both performers.Many stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale. This one is very powerful and yet, at the core, remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depth.The background score by Dario Marianelli , distinguished by lots of piano music, is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multi-layered story.",8,6,11,9 April 2008
The Godfather," Brilliant, engrossing study of organized crime family...
","Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my 'favorite movie' list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.",7,4,10,6 August 2006
