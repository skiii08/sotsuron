The Blair Witch Project," Way too much hype, but, not too terrible.
","I watched The Blair Witch Project twice a couple years back, and hated absolutely every painful, boring second. I thought it was awful, the worst movie ever made. I stumbled across the reviews on here one day, and, as usual, was just amazed at how many people claimed this was 'the scariest movie ever'. But, before putting in my two cents, I decided to give the film one last try. I watched it yet a third time, and my thoughts upon viewing it this one last time made me give it a rating of 5 - much higher than I'd planned.On some levels, The Blair Witch Project does work. There really are a few genuine moments where you sit back and think what-the-heck-is-going-on? Unfortunately, these moments are very few and far between, and interrupted by long sequences of painful boredom in which the three characters walk around and fight and talk about farting and kick maps into lakes and cause me, the viewer, painful boredom. And there are also a couple of moments of true hilarity, particularly the moment when Micheal tells his companions he kicked their map into the lake. I know that isn't supposed to be a comedic moment, but the acting is so bad that it comes across as just really, really funny.The film has some strong sequences. One being Heather's apology speech - you know the one I'm talking about. This comes across as very genuine and real. And of course, the ending was kinda nifty.So, all in all, The Blair Witch Project is worth a look. But it's definitely not the scariest movie ever. It doesn't even belong on a top-ten list or anything. But thanks to a few moments that stand out and are genuinely creepy, this film is saved from being totally a waste.",5,0,1,6 January 2009
