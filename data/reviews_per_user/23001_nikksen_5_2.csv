The Hangover," Just OK
","I heard from 'word of mouth' that this was to be a must see, hilarious comedy. It started off really well, and I give it credit for 'reversing the process' versus the standard formulaic screenplay 'structure'. Somewhere in Act II it began to get a bit flat. The caricatures over 'characters', the implausibility issues, and most of all THE VULGARITY. To me the movie deserves it's place (albeit, as does the other 99% of comedies and romantic comedies) in the 'bin of mediocrity and cheap gimmicks'. The reason for the negative review is due to the expectations I had going in. I was expecting something truly remarkable. It was not that. I'm 35, and haven't quite figured out this ever growing paradigm: 'vulagarity-is-funny'. I couldn't believe there were 5 year old kids in the theater. Guess, I'll stick to my drama's, and sci-fi, and action flicks.",3,2,5,2 October 2009
The Thin Red Line," slightly off
","the first malick film i saw was New World - and was blown away - left thinking that there ARE some in Hollywood who have an 'artists soul'.BUT i just caught Thin Red Line from VHS thrift store. And was 'turned off' by the ridiculously cruel and inaccurate portrayal of Japanese soldiers. I only tend to visit the comments section of IMDb when something really feels 'off'. thank you to the commentators who articulated my 'off' feeling for me. I guess I'm not the only one. I worked on Clint Eastwood's film Letters from Iwo Jima (aka Red Sun, Black Sand) - in which the Japanese soldiers ACCURATELY committed suicide rather than be taken alive.And yes, unfortunately 'the poetry' did begin to get tedious.that being said... Nick Nolte was superb! Penn superb! And yes, Jim Caveizel superb! as well, there were some impressive performances from 'lesser known' guys.",4,1,3,13 January 2010
