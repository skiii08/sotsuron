The Blair Witch Project," Poor camera work made me sick!
","I was not prepared for this movie--I had eaten a big meal beforehand.  The shaky and crude camera work literally made me sick at my stomach.  It was so bad--poor quality of filming and a crying infant seated behind me--that I asked for a refund after the movie was over.  I did not find the movie scary, but nauseating.",Null,1,2,5 August 1999
Coyote Ugly," Light summer entertainment!
","I saw the movie last night with my 21-year old son. We both enjoyed the movie.  It was fun entertainment with a catchy soundtrack.  John Goodman, as the main character's father, added much to the comical situations, while Piper Perabo (Violet Sanford) reminded me of a younger Julia Roberts.  The movie didn't have a great plot, but it seemed to entertain the mixed audience at the screening last evening.  The younger fellows in the theatre, and probably the older ones also, greatly enjoyed the bar scenes.",Null,1,1,27 July 2000
Shrek," A delight for young and old alike
","I saw this movie at a screening recently.  It was a delightful movie with something for everyone.  I think it will be as big a hit as 'Toy Story I and II.'  The computer animation is so realistic that it is great to watch. The donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice is a real crowd pleaser.  All in all, a winner!",7,2,2,26 April 2001
The Matrix," Confusing plot
",I saw this movie recently and would not recommend it.  The plot is confusing and hard to follow.  I found the movie to be way too long and way too boring.  This movie probably appeals most to science fiction buffs.  Both my twenty year old son and I were not impressed--we couldn't wait for the movie to end.,3,2,6,5 April 1999
