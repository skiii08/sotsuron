Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Miserably dull, hopelessly bad taste...grow up Quentin!
","I suppose that with rewrites from an actual writer, this material may have congrued into a cohesive and useful story -- blending action and drama; however the two have been crudely separated, with the first film stuffing reels of comic book fake action play, and this second film little more than insipid, manipulative melodrama that would better find its home on daytime soap. Scene after scene represents an insult to good taste, with children manipulated and threatened by soulless creeps, and vast acts of cheap thrill-kill sadism. A scene from Tarantino's Dusk to Dawn comes to mind, where he plays a psychopath that kills young women: the scene contributes in no way to the plot, the writer simply appears on screen, commits a grotesque act, looks pleased (and aroused) by it. That scene seems to be an accurate summation of Tarantino's muse or the man himself. When unfettered by actual writers, he is given over to gluttonous indulgence of sadism, supposedly as...entertainment?Wrestling Fans Only -- that should have been printed in bright red letters across the movie posters of these silly, callow films. Any adult viewer ought to be insulted. Each scene requests we lower our standards a bit more, accept less, permit more poorly acted, terribly written, implausible drivel. This is below the level of freak show material, below the worst Stephen King horror film. Banal, trite, pedestrian...ridiculous! Do yourself a favour and do something creative...finger puppets, lip-syncing, sleeping, anything...I promise you, you can find something more entertaining and stimulating than this mess. A disgrace. Grow up Quentin. You know better.",1,18,34,23 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Chinless George strikes back
","I have this vision of what George Lucas must be like as a director. It's 4 in the morning, the lights are hot, everyone is wearing too many robes, and have been doing the same scene for 22 hours straight. Sam Jackson looks like he's about to pop a cap in someone's arse, but he's trying to be cool, look centred and all Jedi -- like in the last scenes of Pulp Fiction.George has no where to go. Unmarried geek freak, he's capable of making money but never getting a stone's throw near actual art. 'Okay people, one more time...and remember, more VIDEO GAME.' It's not hard now, when lines too pedestrian to even laugh at are recited for the tenth, twelfth, twentieth time. Samuel L. Jackson has transitioned: from the mushroom cloud layin mutha, to all the dramatic power of a sleepy janitor leaning on his broom at the end of his shift.I wonder if fans at Star Wars conventions will hold contests, to recite lines from this film with less feeling than the original actors. 'That's possible...' is my favourite line (Jackson); though most any of Portman's and any of Christensen's will do. I won't say much about teen-Vader, his performance speaks for itself -- I can't fathom why an actual actor wasn't hired. Whatever the case, this film does make an excellent text for authors on how NOT to write dialogue. Star Wars was never particularly impressive under close scrutiny. It's science fiction without science; general consumption space-opera. It works with plot, with character, with action. That Joseph Campbell informed mythopoetic tradition is nowhere to be found in this film. Under the thumb of toddler TV direction, it becomes tedious and silly. Characters do not bleed, their hair does not ruffle in the strongest wind. No one vomits over the outrageously distasteful subplot with teen-Vader openly lusting over a woman who helped raise him. When confronted, the princess tells him 'it makes me uncomfortable.' It makes EVERYONE uncomfortable! What force does Lucas wield that allows him to wring all of the life out of even the best of actors? To stray so far from entertainment, or good taste? Perhaps he is a clone....",2,6,12,5 August 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," SNORE!!!! BORING! BANAL! WHAT A WASTE!!!! Matrix Revulsion!
","Spoiler warning.OK, first thing's first. The matrix is kind of important in the Matrix films. But in Revolutions you wait and wait for them to jack in and do something fun. Well, don't get your hopes up. You know that mind-numbingly dull dance scene in Reloaded? The huge boring Zion scene? Well that is all this movie is. With a lot of really sweaty people standing around saying 'they're coming.'I feel like someone forced my head into a bucket of grey mop water and kept it there for 2 hours. Where is Neo? Where is the matrix? The real shame here is that if most people see a GREAT film, they will want to see it again. If it was as good as the first film I'd go ten times! Great films begin with great stories. Reloaded, and particularly Revolutions have a pointless, meandering, flat scripts. There's no joy to this story, to this film. It's work to pay attention. Honestly I'm just glad the film is over. What a waste.",1,1,2,11 November 2003
Meet Joe Black," If this movie makes you feel good, check your pulse.
","Touted as a 'feel good' chick flick film, this offers nothing for any but the terminally brain dead.  Were it shorter, it might be laughable as lunkhead pretty boy pitt, facile and shallow as ever is incredibly miscast as Death.  Following lots of tense melodrama with Anthony Hopkins at his most vague, we wait hours for a plot to appear.  Instead we get lots of gushing scenes with pitt looking as though he's just sustained a head injury and the dumb girl appearing to be in training for the crying olympics. Avoid wasting 3 hours of your precious life on this absurd garbage!!!",Null,1,2,30 November 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A very poor effort.
","This is a meandering and tawdry film that keeps you wondering why you are watching it at all.  The director had some good films previously...naturally that is the reason, faith.  But the strengths of his other films are absent here: there are no colourful characters (most are downright implausible), no quirky dialogue (almost no dialogue, actually); there is some action but no suspense; it is like watching a video game played very well from over someone's shoulder.  I don't know if the few semi-serious scenes are meant to be sincere, because they reek of falsity and dreadful clich√©.  Poor Sonny Chiba, he looks like he's doing a Pepsi commercial!  There is a *great* amount of gore, and in fact almost every scene has a particularly nasty element to it; this is much more in the vein of 'Natural Born Killers' than 'Pulp Fiction.'  But story, where is the story? What story there is, is terribly full impossibilities, too many to list. After a while you just have to guess that it is a kind of dream that doesn't adhere to any reality (except the director's indulgence).  That's rarely a good time.Did it really take him nearly a decade to make this?  If so, Quentin really should learn to make better use of his time.  Much of this film could have been shot in a weekend (with all the contrived title cards and video effects wrapped up in a month).  Much has been made about choreographed fight scenes, but later I read the script was discarded and much of it was done freeform.  This seems very likely, as most of the fighters just look like stunt men standing around waiting to fall when Uma taps them.  There's just no skill here; no discernable authentic martial arts being done. 
Overall, an insipid and unsatisfying film.",3,1,3,11 February 2004
Pretty Woman," Risible and jejune
","Some films make you laugh, others make you cry; some make you cuddle with your guy and help further the illusion that you will stay together after the kids are grown. Some films make you ask...why? Others: WHY!!!!???? Some bring you to a deeper understanding of life, love and the quest for...whatever that SUV is a substitute for. Others bring you to your very knees, as you stare blithely into the corroded and opaque corridors of your very soul with a Kafkaesque gasp of mortality held for one epiphanous illusion-shattering moment. This film is none of the above. This film is doo-doo. It's an insult to the landfills it should be dumped in. The only way it could work is if the hooker turned out to be a transvestite, and (as far as we know) that would require a cast change. Get a grip and go watch something decent with Sean Penn, Lily Taylor or Christopher Walken.",1,11,24,25 July 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," CGI says it all
","Well okay, we waited a long time, and here we are with this massive scene of a ton of sweaty folks dancing and looking super sweaty. Then like these dudes are walking around gabbing for like an hour, saying idiot stuff like 'Whats it all about? ever wonder?' (Man I wondered!) So after (what seems like) ten hours later, there's finally some matrix stuff with River Phoenix doing a ton of jumping and Samuel L. Jackson just sitting there with sunglasses on saying 'it's cool, it will all work out.' And that old broad Navinity is ultra boring and does almost nothing.Anyway, then there's about 60 zillion CGI scenes that are real dumb and finally some big thing with David Soul sitting there in this huge plush chair and MTV playing all around him and then there's this psycho guy from out of no where that makes it a cliffhanger. I am sorry to say this review is more exciting than the film. Yeah.",2,0,2,14 April 2004
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Ultimate male fantasy
","Sammyboi 'Action' Jackson, Jeremy 'Leg' Irons and the ultimate Bruce 'Beastiboi' Willis star in this maddeningly erotic romantic-thriller. Three men are forced to confront the inevitable: their mutual attraction...buried deep beneath the surface. They do lots of movement and yelling and there are lots of guns. But these are unsubtle, crude images betray their deepest feelings, drives and animal desires -- to explore the untamed wilderness of each other. Try to imagine the Pulp Fiction pawnshop scene played out for several intense hours -- but with 3 Gimps! Yes, that is the most perfect possible definition for this wonderfully tasteful film. Yum!",Null,0,1,9 December 2004
