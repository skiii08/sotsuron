The Devil's Advocate," great script!
","'the Devil's Advocate' was robbed of a 'Best Screenplay' nomination at the Oscars!Although many would consider this film as a case of 'lawyer bashing', it's inevitable that a screenwriter would choose the law profession to expose the human boundaries between right and wrong, justice and greed, spirituality and humanism.We all know that defense lawyers deal with the fact that at times they truly believe that their clients are guilty, as well as prosecutors knowing that the defendant is innocent. It's all about self-mobility, which begets self-want.  That's where the Devil steps in.  For those that betray justice, honor, humility, and the ones they love; those people have truly become advocates of the Devil.This film would make a great double feature with Abel Ferrara's 'Bad Lieutenant'And needless to say, nobody could play the Devil better than Pacino.",9,0,0,25 September 2000
Scarface," Al Pacino delivers pure movie dynamite!
","I just read Leonard Maltin's review and I'm in shock.  He claims that this movie wallows in 'excess and unpleasantness for nearly three hours with no new insights'.  Let me tear apart his opinion, if you will: 
#1:  Hollywood films are supposed to be excessive.  Although I hold much disdain for the shallowness of Hollywood productions, this is one instance where they got it right.  What do you expect from coke dealers? The dope dealers life is one of excess.  Hollywood usually entertains the audience with car chases and shoot outs and I think that Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma handled it with a keen sense of detail.#2.  The life of a drug dealer is unpleasant to the common citizen.  Murder, corruption, and violence go hand-in-hand when it comes to cocaine smuggling. What the hell did Leonard Maltin expect?#3.  I can't stand it when people complain about movies being too long.  I love long movies, as long as the film makers keep it interesting.  Long movies usually deliver an epic movie experience that's well worth the price of admission or rental.#4.  'Scarface' does in fact offer new insight.  This film was made during the '80's when the rich got richer and  coke flooded the streets of the U.S. and the rest of the world.  While yuppies moved their way up the corporate ladder, bought the new car and penthouse, they also snorted mountains. Oliver Stone's script points out the excess of capitalism.  The best example is Pacino's speech in the restaurant:  'is this what i work for?...eating, drinking, focking, sucking, snorting...'.  Scarface has it all:  the biggest house, the most expensive car, the best clothes, the finest woman, $$$, power, an arsenal of weapons, and all the coke you could inhale.  Tony Montana comes from a communist country where all these things are unattainable, but he accomplishes success across the pond and he's still unhappy. Yeah, maybe the theme 'crime doesn't pay' isn't that original,  but it does speak volumes about the greed and excess of the 1980's.Finally, Al Pacino's performance is stunning.  I can't think of any role he's played in that even comes close.  Tony Montana makes Michael Corleone look like an alter boy, and yet it's 100% believable.  I totally forgot it was Pacino in the role, I truly believed he was a Cuban refuge.This movie is fantastic.  It's one of the favorites of my generation x counterparts.",7,0,0,18 March 2001
American Beauty," 'never under estimate the power of denial'
","when leaving the theater with my brother, he asked me 'what do you think the title 'American Beauty' meant.  like all good movies, my answer required much of thought. i first thought of Kevin Spacy's character.  he was one of the few people in the film that was honest with himself. he recognized that his marriage was a farce.  he realized that he could be confident again.  he saw his potential, and he felt rejuvenated.  self confedence is powerful. next, i thought of Wes Bently's character.  A young man so confident despite his dire situation.  he remained strong in himself, and in addition, help others believe in themselves. I then thought of Annette Benings character.  she played a person that depended on money and her plastic social status.  she represented what is 'ugly' in america. then there is Mina Suvari's character.  even though she gave the appearance of confidence, she was the most vulnerable.  she was completely dishonest with herself. finally, there's The Colonels character.  all the hatred he displayed to others, all the coldness and brutality he showed to his wife and son all came from his own feelings of inadquacy. he hated the fact that he hated himself, and he made all the people that where close to him feel the same pain. when i total it all up, 'American Beauty' meant to me youth and honesty. the lives we live when we are young are magical, anything can happen.  when we grow old and lose sight of what's important is when we lose our grip on life.  money and status mean absoutly nothing, especially when it brings pain instead of happiness. (oh! by the way, Wes Bently makes Brando look like Shirley Temple) ***1/2 out of ****.",8,0,0,23 July 2000
Apocalypse Now," ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME!
","although 'loosely' based on Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', 'Apocalypse Now' still captures the mood of the novel.  one of the most haunting, mesmerizing, and beautifully shot films of all time.  it may not be the most realistic Vietnam film, but it is the most surreal, and Coppola has never been better.  all film buffs must see this movie.  the best film of the '70's.  i still can't believe 'Kramer vs. Kramer' beat 'Apocalyse Now' for best picture.",10,0,0,8 July 1999
The Exorcist," the ultimate horror film
","few horror films have ever been nominated for best picture and few films have scared the hell out of its audience as the exorcist.  yet its more than a horror story: it's about our own doubts about the existence of god, the loss of faith, and of course the battle between good and evil.  the exorcist is often imitated yet never duplicated.",9,0,0,28 November 1998
No Country for Old Men," A good adaptation of a pretty good book
","I'm a big movie buff, but books are my first love; so when I see film adaptations of books I've read, I've often been disappointed. 'No Country For Old Men' is an exception to the tired clichÃ© 'The book is always better'. The movie left out quite a lot, such as the teen runaway that accompanies Lewellyn on his trip to El Paso; but the movie captured the maudlin tone of the book. Many have commented on the odd ending of the movie; and the book is the same way. The book was an engrossing cat-and-mouse chase, but bogged down in the end. The somber ending of the movie captured the theme of the book, that the good does not always vanquish the evil.The Coen Brothers are great artists, and when I heard they where doing this film, I knew they'd do a great job. And they did. They deserve the Oscars they've won. All the performances were spot on. I just find it odd that it was the best movie of 2007. Is this movie in the same league as 'The Godfather', 'The Lost Weekend', 'Schindler's List', et al? Regardless of my opinion, it is now. Must have been a mediocre year, I guess.As for Cormac McCarthy; I think he's a good writer, but some of his books (i.e. 'Blood Meridian'), were boring to me, but his greatest achievement, 'The Road' will soon be a film. It is one of the most emotionally devastating and powerful literary experiences I've ever had. If it's done right, it too will be an Oscar contender. I'm on pins and needles waiting for that film, but I have doubts that it will be as good as the book. If the Coen Brothers were directing it, I might have higher hopes. Wait and see, I guess.",7,0,5,24 February 2008
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," sick!sick!sick!
",this is one of the most pointless and sick films ever made!  a mindless piece of self-absorption from Passolini.  recommended only for people with anorexia who want to lose their lunch.  this film is void of any redeeming or entertaining value.,1,9,29,31 January 1999
There Will Be Blood," Another piece of crap by P.T. Anderson
","First off, I have to admit that I went into this film with low expectations. I've hated every film by P.T. Anderson ('Boogie Nights' is the worst film I've ever seen). 'There Will Be Blood' is more garbage from this no-talent. He doesn't seem to understand how to pace a film, his dialog is insipid and his characters are impossible to identify with. Yet the most irritating thing about his films are that they're BORING! The photography in this film is excellent, but the screeching soundtrack made me want to gouge out my eyes. Daniel Day-Lewis is an extraordinary actor, but he'll be downgraded in my book because he participated in this trash. Wake up Hollywood: P.T. Anderson is a hack! It astounds me that his films get such great reviews.",3,19,35,7 February 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The second best dracula movie
","'Dracula' is one of the most popular characters in film history.  Yet, few 'vampire' films are on the same level as 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. 
Even though it's no secret that Coppola watched 'Nosferatu' (the best of the genre) before making this film, Coppola has added his own touch.  I can't think of any 'Dracula' film that started with the historical background of Vlad the Impailer in Romania/Transylvainia; nor can I think of a film director that captured the Victorian era better than Coppola (I love the stag film shown in the background during the 'white-wolf' scene in London). Finally, Coppola actually read the Bram Stoker book:  reading the source novel doesn't seem to be a popular Hollywood practice.I'm surprised at the negative reviews this film has received.  Coppola has guts for filming a big budget picture on sets, especially after losing it all by doing the same thing with the Las Vegas settings of 'One From the Heart'.  The sets and costumes were brilliant, as well as the cinematography (it reminded me of 'Excalibur'). Finally, Gary Oldman makes Bela Lugosi look like a boy scout.Coppola has made a couple of bad movie's in his career (need I mention 'Jack'?), yet 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is not one of them.",9,1,2,25 September 2000
True Romance," TRUE ENTERTAINMENT!
","'True Romance' has it all:  action, humor, horror, a great script, a colorful cast, etc, etc, etc.  it's very hard to find films that keep you entertained from start to finish, but this one succeeds at every level, and it's not often where the 'bad guys' get to take the money and run. a great return on your video rental investment.  9 out of 10.",9,1,3,14 July 1999
