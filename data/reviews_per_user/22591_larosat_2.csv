10 Cloverfield Lane," Highly overrated mess
","Almost zero suspense and unpleasant characters make this crap fest virtually unwatchable. After all the high praise I was expecting a solid, claustrophobic thriller. Instead we get a poorly paced slog of nothingness. Overrated and underwhelming and one of the stupidest endings involving a Molotov cocktail. Avoid at all costs.",1,0,1,24 March 2017
Get Out," Awful, ponderous and what a slog.
","Don't BELIEVE HYPE. SPOILERS: Ponderously slow movie where evil white people want to abduct black bodies ( why, they succumb to a multitude of medical problems as they age ). Boring, tedious and a telegraphed ending that you must be in a coma not to figure out. Avoid at all costs.",1,23,50,18 March 2017
