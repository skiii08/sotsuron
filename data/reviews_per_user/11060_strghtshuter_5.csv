Scarface," ... say hello to my little friend...
","this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around. Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite sweet) even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still easy to follow along, but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it is really just that great. this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy...

Taxi Driver," suck on this
","Note... There are scenes depicted in this review if you do not want to know any scenes from this movie, please read this another time after you have seen Scorsese's and Deniro's great film... with that said...Taxi Driver... the movie that people can only dream of topping. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver who has a overwhelming imagination about himself, and others and tries to save a pre-teen prostitute in order to do something worthwhile in his life. Robert Deniro was just great for the role.this movie is just such a great portrayal of a man who cannot connect with human beings. his personality is one of many teenagers in high school and some even in college, who have been on the lower scale of the popularity chain. he has ideas and ideals that are good and true, but he just can't get them out properly without making himself look bad. he is very conscieous of his own image to such an extent that he is afraid to take any sort of risk, until the thought just drives him over the edge in the end of the movie.To make the statement clear about his own self image, he actually goes out of his way in the movie to tell people that he was in the marines, or he's a narc, etc. he also goes to the porno theaters and just sits there playing with his hands as if they are guns. Travis loves guns and an occupation, or a role playing scenario of himself with the guns.Travis is really this overgrown child who cannot communicate, but has great intentions. but his daydreaming sometimes got the best of him. his character is actually very attractive in many ways. its that type of character where if you see them, you think they are crazy, but you yourself would do the same behind a closed door. That is who Travis is. he is the guy just like any of us who cannot go beyond our mind barriers and our imagination because we seem to think that we cannot achieve those goals, or we would fail, die trying. Because Deniro has played such a great role, in such a great style of acting, it can be assumed, that he himself went through something of this magnitude during his own adolescent years. actors can only act their best if they have felt similar feelings to the ones that the character has. Deniro's personality, may not be exact, but can have aspects of Travis in himself, and that is just so cool about him. Deniro has taken himself, the side that never shows, and has shown it to the entire world. And most of us have always done things like role playing ourselves in the mirror.Deniro was just great. Another thing that is great about this movie is that there is an hour and a half of pure story before getting into the coolest action scene (and memorable one) in cinema ever. this here is a great usage of buildup in cinema. This movie and the action scenes are very tasteful compared to other action movies nowadays.SEE IT!",9,0,0,18 November 2003
LÃ©on: The Professional," artistic in its own way
","Leon is a hit-man, or a 'cleaner' who has only one rule... 'No women... No kids' Leon is almost hermit like until he meets matilda, the daughter of a drug trafficer who gets killed by a DEA officer.Luc Besson just did a teriffic job as a director for a movie with so much art in it. *Spoiler* there is a scene with a bunch of snipers shooting at Leon and they hit a statue of the 'virgin mary'. It kind of showed how the room is not holy anymore and how G-D is not on his side anymore. It can also show that Leon can't even have G-D on his side. this is just a small example of how artistic this movie can get.The Porfessional is a movie that has a sort of fitness to it. it has everything just in its place at the right time. scenes that are obvious have more meaning to them than the usual. Bullet shots and normal pan shots of the streets with the Italian music in the background give more insight and depth to the characteristics of the film in general. This is not your usual action movie, which Jean Reno is known for. This movie is definetly worth checking out. A movie about a man finding a new route to life because he was not living the way he wanted to live originally. Leon was living a life with no roots, just living. Many people don't realize but this movie has a lot of revilance to our daily lives. Where are your roots?",Null,2,4,4 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," so close yet so far
","this may have spoilers. so please be aware of what you are reading.this was probably the best trilogy to come out in a long long time. its also hard to say that the movie had the best ending that could possilby be made for such a story. as much as the trilogy had a disappointing ending, one should ask themelves if they saw it, or better yet, before they saw the thrid/last movie, 'How could i have ended this story?'fact remains, one can get puzzled over such a matter for a long period of time before just saying that the story itself is a simulation, which is what the story was. the story of a simulation playing another simulation, made by the oracle. in the end there are no machines or humans, just numbers and figures made by the architect.as much as that is disappointing and heart breaking for things like Morpheus's ideals and neo's purpose in the story, but Agent Smith puts it all together throughout the series trying to find his purpose. and when he finds it, he finds out that he has made the biggest mistake of his life, which flushes him out of the matrix, allowing for the bug/virus (smith) to get thrown out.people gave pretty mean ratings to this movie, but it think its because they didn't fully pickup the end of the story, so people go in denial, saying that there were no 2nd and third movies. that's just low, knowing that the directors did put a great deal of thought into this movie series. as much as it was a bad ending, credit must be given to the best ending for such a complicated story.kudos to the Wachowski's. they were close but with no cigar.",7,2,4,7 December 2003
Heat," what a treat
","this movie had such an awesome story.the movie has two kings in film: Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.it was as if someone just had the idea after the 2nd Godfather to see how De Niro and Pacino could act with each other. the story has both of them acting separately, and then once things get comfy, they both meet up for a chat. their conversation in the film was what made it for me besides all the awesome shooting action in it. they just acting so well together. it was some real eye candy.the movie goes for just under 3 hours, with the strangest angles. at times where you thought it would cut to such and such, either it didn't or it switched to something else that was awkward. The entire movie is made up of these strange angles that any other director besides Micheal Mann would use. it worked only because the entire movie was composed of these strange angles, creating a new way to see a film. it was cool, i bought it.SEE IT, IT WAS GREAT with many side actors who boost the performace of the film as a whole to lead De Niro and Pacino to do their work as well as they do.",8,1,1,21 October 2003
