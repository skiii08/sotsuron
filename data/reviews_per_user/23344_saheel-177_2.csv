Iron Man 3," Just really stupid
","I would start off that the Dark Knight was a more realistic take on batman where it deviated a lot from the comic books. For Iron Man 3, I think Shane Black just used the large amount comic book material he had of the Mandarin, who btw is Ironman's arch nemesis, and just use to wipe his ass.Firstly, I would say that I somewhat enjoyed how they made Tony Stark scared about the prospect of aliens and another world because of his avengers wormhole incident. I also enjoyed that Ben Kingsley, a really well-known and credited actor, was playing the Mandarin. The set up for the Mandarin as just excellent. I liked how they made him really evil and just all round horrible man, with no care for humans.However, my compliments end there because we find out that the 'Mandarin' is just some dumbass named Trevor. I mean seriously? You needed Gandhi for that? And btw if they wanted to go that direction of misleading the audience, then they should've done the same thing from batman begins. Replace one Mandarin with another Mandarin like replace one Ra's Al Ghul with the real Ra's Al Ghul. And many people would argue that Guy Pearce's character said he was the Mandarin. I wouldn't take it as if he meant that he was the Mandarin from the comics with the ten rings and all. I would take it as if he meant that he was responsible for all the threats and attacks not the useless Trevor. Another complaint I have is that Tony Stark wasn't smart in this movie as he is normally is. We are told in the film that he is smart but he made so many stupid decisions like: 1. Giving his address to the enemy 2. Not knowing that there is a missile flying towards his mansion until he sees it on the news. 3. Not using his 42 Iron man suits against those helicopters shooting at his house 4. And only using his 42 Iron man suits on an oil tanker (yeah that's safe) 5. Making Iron man suits that crumple like tin foil but apparently can withstand Thor's Hammer? (Technically inconsistency in the storyline) 6. The president not using the Iron Patriot suit to fly to safety when he is hung(technically the president's idiocy) or not having JARVIS remotely fly the suit to safety. To be honest, the only point to this film is that Iron Man is a major source of income to Disney Marvel and they need a way to continue from the avengers. So those who want to watch this film....don't watch it. Just don't watch it.",2,0,3,5 December 2013
Man of Steel," Really enjoyable film but not the best film
","Well first I need to clear things up first. A common mistake people make when going in to watch this film is that they expect to be like the dark knight films because Christopher Nolan was involved in this project. To those people I have to say.....STOP IT. Batman and Superman are two different characters and therefore have to be treated in different ways. Batman is a dark, brooding superhero to puts fear in others whereas Superman is an alien and could be either mankind's hope or the means to end its existence due to his abilities.Well now that I have cleared that up, I went into watching this film expecting it to be a movie that the man of steel deserves. In a nutshell, Zack Snyder did somewhat pull it off. He did something that is normally difficult to do with superman films - make Clark Kent experience issues both due to his meta human abilities and normal worldly issues. I liked how they made him seem more human than expected. I enjoyed it when he was first discovering his abilities of flight, x ray vision and so on, because his reactions were very human like. For example anyone of us would have a big grin on our face if we one day found out we could fly. Secondly I also liked how they handled Zod because they didn't make him a typical 'bad guy' with no purpose. He had a purpose - to save krypton. Furthermore, the reason why I liked Zod's and Jor-El's relationship is the same reason why I like Prof. X and Magneto's relationship. Two men who have utmost respect for each other but don't agree on certain matters.However, I do feel that Zod was a bit overshadowed Faora because she was just bad ass in her scenes but that is one of the least of my complaints. One complaint I have was the amount of destruction. Not the one caused by the world engine. I understand why that happened because they were trying to make another krypton so they have to demolish everything on Earth and Zod generally doesn't care about humans. The destruction I am referring to is the one between superman and Zod because superman cares about the human race so he could've at least made an effort to take the fight somewhere else.So to sum up, I would say that I enjoyed this movie for the same reason I enjoyed the first Ironman film. Both films are enjoyable with their action scenes, treat the main character properly although with the addition of several flaws in the plot but all round good. I would recommend this anyone who wants that. NOT the best but enjoyable",8,5,9,5 December 2013
