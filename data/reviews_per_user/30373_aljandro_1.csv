Marie Antoinette," Lovely but...
","I loved the images of the film, although if i didn't know Sophia Coppola's previous work I would think a photographer made the film.The movie is filled with fashionable dresses, great shots and amazing music! If that was all it needed to be done in order to be a good film this would be a masterpiece, the problem... the movie is about nothing, if you know MArie Antoinette is great, if you don't, then the movie ends and you think : 'so... they left the palace great deal!' They don't show she ended up with no head, or the fact that she made a great defense in her trial.The movie is way to shallow, quoting MTV's Daria 'So shallow it gets to be deep' Liked it though",6,1,2,15 January 2007
