The Blair Witch Project," If You Go Down To The Woods Today...
","Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's 'The Blair Witch Project' caused a sensation when released in 1999. It was the first movie to become a hit as the result of the internet, and deservedly so. The low budget horror movie is the perfect antidote to those formulaic Hollywood shockers in which nubile co-eds get chased by some knife-wielding idiot in a mask.A group of students - Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C.Williams - venture into woods in Maryland to make a documentary about the notorious 'Blair Witch', a sorceress believed to have actually existed and been responsible for many deaths. At first, the assignment is fun, but then things go wrong; the map goes missing, they argue amongst themselves as to whose fault it was, and they cannot find their way back to Burdittville. Strange noises can be heard at night. Worst of all, peculiar stick figures are found. Something is out in the forest with them, watching their every move, but what? As noted earlier, 'Project' was made on a very small budget. But for once this was an asset rather than a liability. So convincingly realistic did it turn out that cinema-goers thought they were watching a real video diary. The principal cast members give natural performances, particularly Donahue. For me, it brought back uncomfortable memories of camping with friends in the woods and being kept awake all night by owls and other nocturnal beasts! It owes a great debt to those eerie 'Ghost Stories For Christmas' made by the B.B.C. in the '70's, such as 'The Signalman'. It works as much on the imagination as on the senses. The film starts slowly, then ratchets up the tension so fast that by the end you're absolutely terrified. The ending is deliberately ambiguous. All we know is that the students were never found, and the film footage provides the only clue to their fate.For a short time, it looked as though there was to be a major shift towards a more natural style of horror movie, but it does not seem to have happened. Many movies have copied the look of 'Project' - the quick-fire editing, the shaky camera-work - but alas not the feel.There was a sequel - 'Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows' - made the following year, which was everything the first was not - uninspired and silly. If you're planning on going camping in woods, whatever you do, don't watch 'Project' the night before.",10,3,5,14 September 2006
Love and Death," 'I'm dead and they're talking about wheat!'
","'Love & Death' was Woody Allen's last film before his 'reinvention' as a more serious film-maker with 'Annie Hall' in 1977, and is an uproarious spoof of classic Russian literature such as 'War & Peace'. It opens with 'Boris' ( Allen ) in a cell awaiting execution. What circumstances brought him to this predicament? The film goes into flashback mode. Boris is in love with 'Sonja' ( Diane Keaton ), his beautiful cousin, but she prefers his brother 'Ivan', whom Boris claims cannot even write his own name in the ground with a stick. He is then caught up in the Napoleonic Wars ( 'we kill Frenchmen, they kill Russians, before you know it, its Easter!' ), and against the odds, becomes a hero, seducing a beautiful countess ( Olga Georges-Picot ). He finally marries Sonja, but it is not a happy union, although she manages to make some wonderful dishes out of snow. Sonja then comes up with her grand master plan - the assassination of Napoleon Bonaparte...As with his other films of this period, most of the gags have a strong Marx Brothers flavour, along with anachronisms such as Boris and a gang of cheerleaders suddenly appearing on the battlefield, along with a hot-dog vendor. There is a duelling sequence which one can imagine might have worked for Harpo Marx. Keaton, as ever, is excellent. Her meaningless discussions with Boris over the futility of human existence are priceless. Boris is agnostic; 'If only I could see a miracle...if only God would just cough!'. My favourite moment is Boris quoting from the Bible: 'Yay, I will walk through the valley in the shadow of death...come to think, I will RUN through through the valley in the shadow of death...you get out the valley quicker that way!'. 'Love & Death' ends with the sight of Boris and the Grim Reaper dancing through trees. It is easy to see the scene now as symbolically bringing to a close this era of Woody Allen movies. He was smart to make the change when he did as the television show 'Saturday Night Live' was about to unleash a new wave of comedians - such as Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Ackroyd - who went on to define 80's American film comedy.",10,1,1,25 July 2012
Frost_Nixon," Hello Mr.President, Good Evening & Welcome!
","In 1977, David Frost's interviews with disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon attracted the highest ratings ever for an American news programme. They are regarded now as a highpoint in current affairs broadcasting.It is easy to forget how ubiquitous old Frosty was then; forever jetting back and forth across the Atlantic on Concorde, hosting chat-shows here and in America. As the '70's arrived, he focused less on satirical comedy of the sort he'd made his name with ( such as 'T.W.3 ) and concentrated on 'big star' interviews. But by '77, the perception was that his career had nosedived. He then got the idea of interviewing 'Tricky Dicky', and getting him to apologise for Watergate. Frost was no stranger to slippery customers, having famously torn insurance swindler Dr.Emil Savundra to pieces back in 1967. Nixon represented the ultimate challenge. When no network agreed to pay the ex-President, Frost was forced to approach big business interests, cap in hand. The programmes went ahead.From the onset, it looked as though Frost had his work cut out for him. His very first question - 'Why didn't you burn the tapes?' - was met by a long, rambling answer that told no-one nothing. Other questions were met with similar unhelpful responses. It must have looked as though Frost was wasting his time ( and other people's money ). But then a remarkable thing happened. Frost's research uncovered new facts about Watergate; these enabled him to ask searing, probing questions which wore Nixon down and got him to speak from the heart, something no-one had previously managed to do. It was a personal triumph for Frost.You would think that a film about a television interview might turn out boring, but 'Frost/Nixon' is far from that. Peter Morgan's script ( based on his play ) is literate and absorbing. Frost's verbal battles with Nixon are riveting, a meeting of powerful minds. Tremendous performances from Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Sheen gets 'Frost' to a tee, while Langella's 'Nixon' comes over as remarkably sympathetic, outshining even Anthony Hopkins' performance in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon'. I am not a big fan of the films of Ron Howard, but was impressed greatly by this. Another amazing thing is that it makes John Birt ( the man who sacked Stanley Baxter from London Weekend Television and then crucified the B.B.C. ) seem likable!",10,1,3,17 November 2009
Spider-Man 3," Much Better Than Expected
","Usually in movie franchises ( particularly superhero ones ) the third film is the one where it starts to run out of steam. This was certainly true of 'Superman 3' and 'Batman Forever' - though a very enjoyable movie - was not as good as the two preceding it.So it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch 'Spider-Man 3'. The first two were excellent, so how would this compare? Very well indeed, I thought. Picking up on a plot strand from the last one, Harry Osborn is told by the ghost of his dead father that Peter Parker killed him, and that he is Spider-Man. Harry decides to carry on the family legacy by becoming the new Green Goblin.Elsewhere, a criminal named Flint Marko breaks out of prison and takes refuge in a secret testing area where he is exposed to radiation. As a result, he now has the ability to turn his body to sand. I remember 'The Sandman' from the comics so it was good to see the character being visualised so accurately, even down to the green striped shirt.Spidey's problems are not over yet. A strange creature from outer space attaches itself to Parker while he sleeps and creates a black version of his costume which, when worn, brings out the dark side of his character, enabling Tobey Maguire to have some fun with the role.Parker sees the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson, in a new musical play on Broadway, and makes plans to ask her to marry him. But that day will have to wait...These diverse plot strands converge at the end in a breathtaking finale. Its pointless describing the action scenes but needless to say they are exciting indeed. The giant-sized Sandman is a truly terrifying creation. As Spidey wryly observes: 'where do these guys come from?'.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Durst turn in their usual fine performances. The presence of 'Gwen Stacy' did startle me somewhat though. I found myself muttering: 'don't go near any bridges!' whenever she was on screen. Stan Lee makes his usual brief cameo - nuff said! What makes these films special though is not so much the C.G.I. but the love and care with which Sam Raimi has brought to the material. You get the impression they are not made simply for the money. At times you can almost see the comic-book pages being turned. As someone who read the Lee/Ditko originals as a boy, I was pleased with this movie.I do not know whether any more 'Spider-Man' films will be made, but if this turns out to be the last, the series has ended on a very high note indeed.",9,1,2,25 May 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Mein fuhrer! I can walk!'
","Amidst the flurry of Stanley Kubrick tributes following his death in 1999, there was one dissenting voice - ex-'Private Eye' editor Richard Ingrams. In his 'Observer' column, he called the director 'overrated'. He then admitted to having seen none of his films. If I had to recommend only one Kubrick picture it would be 1964's 'Dr.Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying & Love The Bomb'. It started life as a straight thriller ( based on Peter George's novel 'Red Alert' ) but over time Kubrick came to view it as what he termed a 'nightmare comedy'. An American General ( Stirling Hayden ) has gone 'a little funny in the head' and ordered planes to attack the U.S.S.R. with nuclear bombs. What caused this upset? Said general is ( it is suggested ) suffering from premature ejaculation, for which he blames the Russians whom he thinks have been putting something in the water along with the fluoride. The general has instructed his men to open fire on anyone attempting to break into Burpleson Air Force Base. This includes the U.S. Army.While American troops battle one another, in the White House the chiefs of staff work against the clock to find a solution. The President ( Peter Sellers ) even phones the Russian Premier. Another mad General - 'Buck' Turgidson ( George C.Scott ) - suggests the only way forward is to step up the attack, kill the enemy before he can hit back. The President rejects the idea.Sound like side-splitting fun? That is where the film's genius lies. It takes the most terrifying subject matter imaginable - nuclear war - and makes it into one of the funniest movies of all time. It suggested that World War 3 need not necessarily start because of an act of calculated aggression by either side, but through human error. Peter Sellers is magnificent in three roles - President Merkin Muffley, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, and the Dr.Strangelove of the title, a crippled Teutonic genius whose artificial hand has a life of its own. The actor was allowed to improvise, and came up with wonderful ideas, such as the good doctor's hand trying to do a Nazi salute while he is advising the President.George could not have been too upset at this bastardisation of his story, he collaborated on the script ( with Kubrick and Terry Southern ) and penned the novelisation. To emphasise the lunacy of the story, the characters have weird names like 'General Jack D.Ripper', 'Major King Kong', and 'Colonel 'Bat' Guano'.Ken Adam, best noted for his work on the Bond films, designed the stunning War Room ( the story goes that when Ronald Reagan was taken to the Pentagon he asked to see the War Room, not knowing it only existed on film. He had one built ).Originally the film was to have climaxed with a custard pie fight, but Kubrick deleted it - rightly so. The present ending is much more effective. The same year this opened, another movie with an almost identical plot - Sidney Lumet's 'Fail-Safe' ( starring Henry Fonda ) - appeared. The main difference was that it was not a comedy. Lumet begged Columbia to let his movie come out first, to give it a chance. They ignored his concerns. While 'Strangelove' was a big hit, 'Fail-Safe' flopped.Many Sellers films are less than interesting, some are plainly mediocre, but a handful bear the imprint of genius. This is one of them. It was nominated for a number of Academy Awards, including Best Actor ( Sellers ) and Best Picture. In the final event, it won nothing. Hollywood, as ever, went for sentimentality over satire and rewarded 'My Fair Lady' ( starring Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn ) instead. There is no doubt in my mind which film deserved to win.Funniest moment - as a brawl develops Turgidson and the Russian Ambassador ( the wonderful Peter Bull ), the President tries to intervene: 'Gentlemen, you cannot fight in here! This is the War Room!'.Second funniest moment - Major King Kong ( Slim Pickens ) riding an atomic bomb as though it were a bucking bronco and whooping for joy as it drops on Russia. Like I said, the film made the unthinkable funny.",10,4,7,23 February 2010
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Owes Benny!
","'Bridget Jones' struck a chord with millions of single women all over the world. She's kooky, blonde, has a weight problem, a man problem, and is British. If she were the creation of a man, she'd have been banned by now. I loved the moment in this film when Bridget slides down a fireman's pole and we see her big knickers close up. But then I laughed at the same gag when it was done on 'The Benny Hill Show' on 23/12/70.This is supposed to be feminist comedy, yet when its only memorable gag comes from an old television show derided and pilloried for its so-called 'sexism', you know something is wrong somewhere.Benny Hill, rest in peace.Your legacy is intact. Renee Zellweger is your natural heir.",2,7,14,17 November 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Alice In Zombie Land!
","It used to be the case that zombie movies were purely the preserve of filmmakers with low budgets and no stars, now it seems everyone is making them. In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', a virus escapes from a top secret facility known as The Hive, infecting the inhabitants of Raccoon City, and a small group of survivors have to battle their way through an army of flesh-eating zombies to freedom.One of the reasons why George A.Romero's early 'living dead' pictures worked so well was due to their documentary approach. No matter how far fetched the premise, you felt as though you were watching real people caught up in a terrifying situation. The main characters in this film, however, are anything but 'real', consisting mainly of young, good-looking people well acquainted with the martial arts, armed with weapons Rambo would be jealous of, and who never tire. No sooner have they wiped out one gang of zombies with karate kicks and expertly aimed shots than they are ready to wipe out another without so much as pausing for breath. Hence the suspense factor is nil.Milla Jovovich reprises her role as 'Alice', and admittedly she looks great crashing through a church window on a motorcycle ( or rather her stunt double does ), but the script gives her no opportunity whatever to establish, much less develop a character. She is as every bit as inhuman as her opponents.Like many modern horror movies, it over-relies on C.G.I. for effect. The action scenes are shot and edited in the style of an M.T.V. rock video; bullets fly out of guns in slow motion, people do back flips and execute perfect leaps over fences, and Milla still manages to look sexy no matter what happens.The appearance of 'Nemesis' is a hoot; resembling nothing less than one of Clive Barker's 'Cenobites' with a Schwarzenegger complex. If you can sit through the scene where it uses a rocket launcher to wipe out the S.T.A.R.S. without laughing, you are made of stronger stuff than I.Alexander Witt must have thought that the visual trickery was enough to carry the film, and decided not to bother with such trifles as a strong plot, believable characterisations and dialogue. Did anyone understand that ending? I certainly didn't.For a superior example of a zombie picture, check out the original 'Dawn Of The Dead'.",1,0,2,24 August 2007
A Clockwork Orange," 'I was cured alright!'
","When I was in my teens, I resisted joining street gangs, believing such groups to be essentially mindless. When they put on their clothes to go out each evening, they were not just following the latest fashions, but putting on battle uniforms. Joining would in my view been a major error of judgement. In the early '80's, a new street gang came to my town. On Saturday afternoons, half a dozen or so young men strutted about the shopping centre in white boiler suits and bowler hats, and carrying canes. People kept well away from them. I did not know it then, but they were mimicking the 'Droogs' - the gang from Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' ( 1971 ). Like Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' ( 1971 ) and Hooper's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' ( 1974 ), a mystique built up around the film because it was impossible to see for many years. When it finally became commercially available - after the director's death - a minority grumbled it was 'overrated'. Not so. 'A Clockwork Orange' is marvellous. Based on Anthony Burgess' provocative and thought-provoking novel, it is about a gang with no respect for authority led by 'Alex DeLarge' ( Malcolm McDowall ) whose hobbies are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven. They even have their own language. A good night out to them involves at some point the beating-up of an old tramp. In one of the most shocking scenes ever put on film, they break into the home of writer Mr.Alexander ( Patrick Magee ) and rape his wife ( Adrienne Corri ) in front of him while warbling 'Singing In The Rain'. Eventually, Alex is caught, jailed, and subjected to a new kind of aversion therapy. No longer capable of violent acts, he is released. But some of his victims have not forgotten nor forgiven him, and set about exacting revenge...This is a fascinating study of the morality of free will. It poses the question - is a man who has has been born good better than one who has had goodness imposed on him? Is the State's brainwashing of Alex any better than the ultra-violence he himself practised? McDowall is magnificent, playing a sneering, arrogant young man with nothing but contempt for the world and everyone in it. But when he is reprogrammed you start feeling sorry for him! Also in the cast are Warren Clarke as fellow Droog 'Dim' and Michael Bates as a 'Prison Guard'. The recently deceased Miriam Karlin is a cat lover whom Alex beats to death with a huge plastic phallus! Kubrick himself wrote the script and did a fair job, but alas changed the ending. In the book, Alex renounces his violent past, choosing to settle down and have a family. But the film creates the impression he will revert back to his bad old ways.The film attracted controversy on its release for its explicit violence and sex ( Alex beds a couple of young girls at one point, and a joke is made out of it by the sex being sped up to music ). Kubrick withdrew it after copy-cat crimes were reported. Even now it is disturbing to watch, yet impossible to ignore. Yes, it is extremely violent, but the storyline demands it to be. Once seen it can never be forgotten.",10,1,3,23 August 2011
Carrie," Death by Telekinesis
","I was too young to see 'Carrie' in 1976, so had to make do with the New English Library paperback of Stephen King's novel ( his first major bestseller ). The cover had a picture of a startled young woman with a bloody face. I saw the film some years later and found it to be remarkably faithful to its source. Sissy Spacek is 'Carrie White', a shy, sexually repressed student who is the butt of her classmates' childish jokes, in particular 'Chris Hargenson' ( Nancy Allen ), a bitch of the first magnitude. Following a volleyball game, Carrie is in the shower room when her menstrual cycle begins. As her religious fanatic mother ( Piper Laurie ) never bothered to inform her daughter about such things, she panics, only to be laughed at by her class. Along with the arrival of womanhood Carrie begins to develop telekinesis - the ability to move objects just by thinking.Sue Snell ( Amy Irving ) persuades her boyfriend Tommy ( William Katt ) to ask Carrie to be his Prom Night date. Against her mother's advice, she accepts. Carrie and Tommy win a rigged vote to become 'King' and 'Queen', but her moment of glory is to be cruelly shattered. Chris and boyfriend Billy ( John Travolta ) have placed a bucket of pig's blood in the rafters. As soon as Carrie is standing under it, they cause the bucket to fall. At first, the assemblage is shocked, but then laughter rings out. Angered, she unleashes the full force of her power against those mocking her...This was Brian De Palma's first major hit following the cult smashes 'Sisters' ( 1973 ) and 'Phantom Of The Paradise' ( 1974 ). He was touted as 'the heir to Hitchcock' and from this you can see why. Listen out for the 'Psycho'-like stings whenever Carrie uses her powers. He employs slow motion and split-screen to good effect. Of course it helps that the book and script ( by Lawrence D.Cohen ) are first-rate too. Dominating the movie though is a superb central performance from freckle-faced Spacek. You want to weep for her. When I read the book, I imagined her mother to be some toothless crone, but the movie 'Margaret' is surprisingly attractive, strangely emphasising her insanity. This was Laurie's first film in 15 years, and she was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Margaret's madness began when she was raped by her husband years before ( 'I could smell the whisky on his breath!' ). The scene in which she stalks Carrie, knife in hand and a demented smile on her face, has got to be one of the most chilling cinematic moments ever.The rest of the cast also impresses, particularly Nancy Allen and Amy Irving. De Palma retained the latter for his next picture, the underrated 'The Fury' ( 1977 ). It is interesting now to see Travolta in his pre-'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Grease' days.'Carrie' might not have as much gore as say 'The Exorcist' but it definitely ranks as one of the '70's best horror pictures, certainly the best ever King adaptation.There was a stage musical ( believe it or not! ) and a T.V. sequel ( 'Carrie 2: The Rage' ) but they are best forgotten. Watch the original and be prepared to fly out of your chair during the final scene. 'Carrie' boasts one of the first examples of the 'trick ending' ( later copied by, amongst others, 1985's 'Nightmare On Elm Street' ).",10,2,3,28 February 2011
Casino Royale," 007 puts his cards on the table
","It had long been a source of frustration to 007 admirers that 'Casino Royale', the first Ian Fleming 'James Bond' thriller, lacked the film adaptation it so richly deserved. There was an American television version in the '50's, starring Barry Nelson and Peter Lorre, and the infamous 1967 Peter Sellers/David Niven spoof, but neither did justice to the book. In 2005, Eon Productions acquired the rights, and felt that after the excesses of 'Die Another Day', a rebooting of the 44-year old franchise was in order. It effectively ruled out the popular 52-year old Pierce Brosnan from playing the role again.Daniel Craig's casting was denounced by a small but vocal minority of fans, and a section of the British tabloid press decided he was wrong for the role before a single frame of the film had been shot. Too short, too blonde, too craggy-faced, were some of the complaints. Yet at the end of 2006, 'Casino Royale' opened to glowing reviews and excellent box office grosses. This was the first Bond film since 'O.H.M.S.S.' in 1969 to adhere closely to its source material, yet at the same time avoid seeming dated. Bond's mission is to beat a villain called 'LeChiffre' at cards at the Casino Royale. LeChiffre has embezzled funds from the terrorist organisation of which he is paymaster, hence he must replace the money quickly or face execution. The book was more character-driven than some of the later entries, set against a Cold War background. Neal Purvis & Robert Wade & Paul Haggis' script is marvellous. Bond even gets to say the famous last line: 'The bitch is dead!'.Some were miffed at the jettisoning of old favourites such as 'Q' and 'Miss Moneypenny', as well as what they perceived to be a curt dismissal of the series' past. The one carryover from the Brosnan era was Judi Dench's 'M', which contradicted 'Goldeneye' in which Bond and M have not known each other long.'Royale' is played dead straight, with little humour, none of the extravagance for which Bond is renowned, and an emphasis on violence. Rightly so. Bond is, after all, an assassin. It would not be the first time that 007 was 'toughened' up this way; 'For Your Eyes Only' and 'Licence To Kill' did as much, but not to the same extent as 'Royale'. I was gratified to see the poker game allowed to take its time, and not sped up for the benefit of impatient audiences. Bond's brutal torture at LeChiffre's hands transfers well to the big screen.At the film's core is Craig's superb performance as 007. He is nothing like his predecessors, but at times evokes Connery, at others the late Richard Harris. He might not be 'tall, dark and handsome' but is completely believable as Bond. The scene where he dons his tuxedo for the first time is memorable, as is Bond having a drug-induced heart attack. I hope Craig sticks around for a long time. Martin Campbell, who launched the Brosnan era in fine style with 'Goldeneye', was brought back to direct, and pulled off the same trick all over again with Craig.As 'LeChiffre', Mads Mikkelsen is the best 007 villain in literally years, able to project menace simply by using an asthma inhaler! Eva Green makes a beautiful 'Vesper Lynd', and one understands why Bond is prepared to resign to be with her. So while it might not be to everyone's taste, The theme song 'You Know My Name' was written and performed by Chris Cornell. 'Royale' is the most courageous and daring Bond made in many years. No gadgets? Who cares? With our mobile phones and iPods, we are all James Bonds now. It was great to see Craig confounding his critics and earning a BAFTA nomination for 'Best Actor'. Good work, 007!",10,2,4,18 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Long, Long Wait For A Movie Far, Far Away
","This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.I first learnt of 'Star Wars' thanks to Granada's 'The Krypton Factor', a long-running game show designed to test contestants' intelligence, physical fitness, powers of observation and so on. I liked the latter round as it often gave one a chance to catch a sneak preview of a new movie. One week, they ran a clip of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, R2D2 and C2PO escaping The Death Star in The Millennium Falcon, and being shot at by pursuing T.I.E. fighters. I fell off my chair. What was this? 1970's sci-fi movies were mostly depressing affairs, predicting gloomy futures for Mankind, now here was something fast, colourful, and lively, with lasers zapping about outer space and explosions. Right up my street.I had to see it. But the film was not yet on release here. There was no Internet then so I got my movie information from the local paper. I kept checking for news of an impending screening at my local cinema, but no - there was nothing. I began to wonder if the movie actually existed or not. Had Granada pulled off the greatest hoax of all time? I read the Sphere book voraciously until I knew the story backwards. I played the Meco disco single at every opportunity. When Marvel's comic adaptation went on sale, I was almost thrown out of the newsagent for jumping up and down for sheer joy.At my school, 'Star Wars' was a dirty word to sci-fi fans, mainly because it was not 'Close Encounters'. The Spielberg picture was regarded as 'adult' and 'intelligent', while the Lucas movie was deemed 'kiddie stuff' starring weirdos in fancy dress running around with a bloke dressed as a big teddy bear.The wait dragged on and on. In an episode of 'Coronation Street', Gail ( Helen Worth ) asked her then-boyfriend, Steve Fisher: 'When's 'Star Wars' coming round here?' to which he replied: 'It'll be some time I expect.'. His words encapsulated the sheer frustration and impatience felt by all us U.K. fans. The highest grossing film of all time and we can't see it? What is the hold up? Are they redoing bits for the benefit of British audiences? Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness are in it so this cannot be right.In desperation, I told a blatant lie to my best friend. 'I have seen 'Star Wars'', I proclaimed. He looked about as shocked as if I'd said I'd spent the night with Carrie Fisher. I claimed that my uncle Eric worked for Twentieth Century-Fox ( another lie. He drove taxi cabs for a living ) as an assistant editor and George Lucas had been so impressed with his work on the film, he had generously given him a print. To back up my claim, I reeled off a long list of plot details and scene descriptions. I got a few things wrong, such as Jabba The Hut and Biggs Darklighter, both of whom were excised from the final cut. But by the time my friend saw the film he had forgotten these. He did beg me to ask my uncle to run the film specially for him on Sunday afternoon, but I deflected this by stating that Uncle Eric's projector had broken down. He never asked again.Being about fifteen, I was too old for the toys, hence on Christmas Day 1977 I was denied the pleasure of reenacting the assault on The Death Star in my garden shed, with the aid of elastic bands, old Subbuteo figures and the John Williams soundtrack thumping out of my Hitachi tape recorder.After what felt like an eternity, the movie finally opened here and suddenly it became fashionable to denounce it as 'overrated'. 'It was childish when they were playing trumpets in the Cantina' was my best friend's verdict. That was all he had to say on the subject ( he would have made a great film critic! ). Many people felt that the film had not been worth the six month wait. I was one of the few to speak in its defence. I was glad that sci-fi movies were fun again. Nobody left the theatre with a spring in their step after seeing Milo The Baby Chimp's parents brutally murdered by the U.S. Government at the end of 'Escape From The Planet Of The Apes'.'Star Wars' spawned two sequels, neither as good, and inspired the likes of 'Alien', 'The Black Hole', 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and countless others. Without Lucas, these would simply not have been made.I am not a big fan of the prequels, but then I'm not young anymore, so can't enjoy that kind of movie in the same way. 'Star Wars' brought 'A New Hope' to those of us wanting old fashioned escapism on the Silver Screen again. I envy kids today for not having to wait until winter for the latest summer blockbuster.",10,6,7,9 May 2008
Fantastic Four," 'Flame On!'
","When I heard Chris Evans had been cast as 'The Human Torch' in a movie of 'The Fantastic Four', I fell off my chair. Fortunately, it turned out not to be the annoying ex-Radio One D.J., but an American actor of that name.Following the successful 'Spider-Man' and 'X-Men' movies, it seemed inevitable Hollywood would get round to doing the F.F. - Marvel's first smash-hit comic, launched in 1961.Four people risk their lives flying into outer space - scientist Reed Richards, his best friend Ben Grimm, girlfriend Sue Storm, and her headstrong brother Johnny Storm - where they are exposed to cosmic radiation. Back on Earth, they find they have each been blessed with super powers - Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band, Sue becomes invisible, Johnny bursts into flame without getting burnt himself, and poor Ben changes into a grotesque orange monster that resembles an unfinished statue. They become media darlings; Reed is nicknamed 'Mr.Fantastic', Ben 'The Thing', Johnny 'The Human Torch' and Sue 'The Invisible Woman'.The movie sticks to this origin story but with one major difference - arrogant industrialist Victor Von Doom goes along for the ride. He becomes progressively insane, his skin peeling away to expose metal. He dons a mask to become 'Doctor Doom'.When I saw this originally my first reaction was that it would have made a decent pilot for a television series. As a cinema movie it was a bit of a let-down, boasting little by way of spectacular action ( apart from an extended scene on a bridge and the climactic battle in a street ). Doom did not have any major plots to conquer the world up his sleeve, other than a determination to defeat the F.F.The special effects were fine, and the cast portrayed the characters well ( Michael Chiklis being an outstanding 'Thing' ), but the lack of action sequences proved a handicap. Fortunately, the movie performed well enough at the box office to warrant a superior sequel; 2007's 'Rise Of The Silver Surfer'.The other thing ( no pun intended ) I liked about the picture was that it eschewed the dark, angst-ridden approach favoured by the likes of other superhero movies such as 'Batman Begins'. 'Fantastic Four' was bright, colourful, fun to watch, which is just how it should be.And Stan Lee's 'Willie Lumpkin' cameo was his best to date!",7,1,2,12 January 2009
