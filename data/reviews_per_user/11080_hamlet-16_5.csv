First Man," Intense
",This is an unexpectedly dark film. Not hagiography but rather a look at the men and women that were part of the great adventure to land a man on the moon.They are not saints. This is not an episode of StarTrekâ„¢.This is an intimate portrait of a man renowned for his skill as a pilot and engineer. But whose taciturn nature meant he did not seek fame nor openly display emotion easily.This makes making a film far from simple.The reviews here talk of the film's length and that is 'boring'. I disagree. The film's length gives it a chance to reveal Armstrong to us and to explore the huge gamble that was the Apollo.Gosling's performance is stoic but underneath you sense a raw intense level of emotion in his Armstrong. It is a truly stellar performance.Ignore the naysayers. Do not expect a boy's own adventure. This is a human drama not a sci fi fantasy. It is ultimately very powerful and I suspect will grow in reputation.,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Barry Lyndon," Truly stunning ....
","Barry Lyndon, which I recently saw for the first time in nearly twenty years, remains one of the most extraordinary films I have ever seen.I clearly remember seeing the film on it release and being quite literally overwhelmed.No other film distills Kubrick's visual and directorial style so completely as Barry Lyndon.Much of the film's brilliance lies in the stunning cinematography, which is not only a technical tour-de-force but also captures some of the most beautiful images ever created for film.And few films have so successfully combined music and image, even though the soundtrack is in mono. (It proves all the modern multichannel wizardry is of no use if thought behind a film's sound scheme is lacking).The much discussed central performance by Ryan O'Neal is in fact almost flawless. O'Neal's Lyndon remains a cypher and in some ways distant from the viewer but irresistible at the same time, buffeted by fate and the consequences of his own failings.Indeed all the performances, from Sir Micheal Hordern, who narrates the film and the rest of the cast are excellent.Whilst the story is episodic and the plot straightforward it serves as the essential backdrop for both Thackeray and Kubrick's biting wit.It also contains some of the most trenchant anti-war sentiment you are likely to hear.This is a great film.",10,2,3,19 July 2000
Good Will Hunting," still a great film ..
","It is interesting to watch 'Good Will Hunting' again, nearly three years after its release. It remains as fresh on second or third or subsequent viewings as on its first.What stands out is not the plot, which is straightforward and really only a device to provide a backdrop to explore the central characters, but brilliance of Affleck and Damon's dialogue.The combination of wit, naturalness and directness combine to engage the viewer.Even more amazing is that the film is driven by a series of dialogue sequences and each sequence builds on it predecessor pushing the plot forward.Rarely has  a film been so dialogue driven and yet not been 'talky'. This is due entirely to Matt and Ben's extraordinary way with dialogue and Gus Van Sant's simple  and very effective direction which places no barriers between the characters and the viewer.I am sure that this, not the plotting, is what impressed the Oscar voters.'Good Will Hunting' remains one of the finest American films of the decade.",7,0,1,6 August 2000
Casino Royale," wow...
",It has been a while since I saw a Bond at the movies...or more correctly could be bothered going to see a Bond at the movies but the new Bond may be Blond but he sure packs a punch! Daniel Craig is a fine actor and it shows. His moments with Dame Judy Dench are wonderful and for once the characters (even the baddies) are more interesting than the gadgets!I thoroughly enjoyed Casino Royale. As did the packed cinema audience I saw it with.It has been a while since I sat in a full cinema...says something about the drawing power of Bond ...and Mr Craig!,9,4,8,9 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," it remains a classic of its genre...
","Star Wars, despite the butchering of the film in the late 90s remains a classic example of what Hollywood does best....great entertainment.Although highly derivative of just about every fairytale and comic serial, the film is so well put together that once you are on board for the ride it doesn't matter.Lucas has a very grand vision and the visual effects, whilst not quite up to 21st century digital effects certainly are effective.This film ushered in the modern era of use of sound which had languished since the early days of stereo soundtracks in the 1950s.Who can deny the impact of the opening sequence, especially in the cinema, of the starship zooming over the audience. It is one of the most brilliant beginnings to a film ever.(Even if the film unions despised not having opening titles!)It is a pity that DVD release does not have the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy. The bastardised digital updates from the late 1990s are simply not as good. Sorry Mr Lucas you are wrong to think they are better. The few extra special effects don't work and are very obvious.The new Star Wars movies simply do not have the magic of this film and its companion originals. The overuse of digital effects and the annoying JarJar simply emphasise this.But Star Wars is THE original and it is a must have in any film buff collection.",4,0,0,19 September 2004
