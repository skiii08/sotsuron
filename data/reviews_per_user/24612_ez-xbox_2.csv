Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A fantastic brought-out revenge story
","All the tags we needed to know that it would be great watching this was: Quentin Tarantino, Katana fights, Uma Thurman, and Michael Madsen. Never has a movie with so much brutality and cruelty made me look away. In this movie, the violence is very mild and unseen compared to the last one, but in ways I liked that more. It allowed for more character development, conflict, and backstory, and it revealed such sentimental things, such as Beatrix seeing her - not aware that that she was alive- daughter.And you all know the challenged woman who was with quentin Tarantino on the air and talking about his supposedly 'SOULESS' movie.Um, yeah no. It actually has a soul. A lot of it. The soul in many religions, philosophical and mythological traditions, is the incorporeal and immortal essence of a living being. According to Abrahamic religions, only human beings have immortal souls. This describes most the characters perfectly. We see that they have souls even if they caused Uma Thurman to be in a coma. *cough Pulp Fiction overdose scene*.And the fact that is is directed by one of the most stylistic and thought provoking director makes it the more beautiful. This movie also had an amazing soundtrack that fit the movie so well. Every scene that had a soundtrack was amazing. The final scenes soundtrack was probably the best. Which brings me the only issues, the scene was stretched a little to much.So in the end, this film was successful in almost every way. And was an amazing Quentie film.9/10 Oscar Worthy",10,3,5,15 March 2016
Snowden," A well acted but slowly paced drama
","JGL is great and performed the voice and characteristics in Snowden extremely well. Certain subtleties in his performance added another diverse performance to his track list and one to mine. Unfortunately for most the movie, not a lot, or not enough happens. There are a solid amount of clichéd elements and scenes that took away from what could have been a more immersive and tension filled scene/experience. The soundtrack, while mainly absent throughout the film, was great and was able to evoke character and audience emotion(s) when one of the scores swells up, mainly when a scene of tension is done correctly. Shailene Woodly was surprisingly good, and was able to pull of her character extremely well. That ended up making it where her character was able to play of of JGL character. This movie is a great character study, but an OK, clichéd, and kind of boring Spy/Espionage movie. But i cant say i wasn't extremely immersed at some points and I think its worth a watch at matinée price. 6/10",5,5,14,22 September 2016
