The King's Speech," I strongly recommend 'The King's Speech'.
","A great movie. Beautifully filmed. Greatly shows the mood of England in the 1930's. The performances by Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffrey Rush are great. Colin Firth is terrific as King George II. Wonderfully portrays the king with a stammer. Does the pauses perfectly. I cared a lot about him. Funny. In one scene King George's wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), says to Lionel, the speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush), 'My husband's job requires to speak in public.'. Lionel retorts 'Perhaps he should get another job.'. Great ending. A great movie. Beautifully filmed. Greatly shows the mood of England in the 1930's.

Midnight in Paris," I recommend 'Midnight in Paris'
","Midnight in Paris is a beautiful looking movie. The scenes in Paris are great. Marion Cotillard is beautiful. Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams are bland. The characters from the 1920's (Earnest Hemingway, F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, and Salvator Dali) could have been more interesting. It could have been more funnier. The ending was good. It was well paced. Not too long. Midnight in Paris is a beautiful looking movie. The scenes in Paris are great. Marion Cotillard is beautiful.

Bridesmaids," I recommend 'Bridesmaids'.
","Has some funny scenes. Airplane scene is good. Has some overly dramatic scenes that don't fit in. A vulgar scene at the bridal shop wasn't funny. Wiig's character is unlikable at times. She's upset too much. Wiig goes over the top a lot.She fights with her friends and throws tantrums that were uncomfortable. Movie is too long. Should have been 90 min instead of 2 hours. A lot of scenes don't work. Not a great movie. Final scene was nice. Melissa McCarty is funny. Chris O'Dowd is good. Sad to see the late Jill Clayburgh in her final role. If you and your wife or girlfriend need to go out and do something, you won't regret it. Thank you.",6,2,5,18 May 2011
