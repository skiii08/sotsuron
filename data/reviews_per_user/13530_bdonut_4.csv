Minority Report," ruuuuuuun!
","What minorities? No Asians, no Jews (OK, the director was a Jewish dude), no Hispanics, no handicapped lesbians. I only saw one black dude in the whole flick (and he was a good cop!). I mean, there was drug dealing and no black dudes. Has the future really gone to hell? The NAACP should get on this.Oh, OK a half a point for Cruise's new eyes being of Japanese descent. And a possible point for the doc and nurse sounded vaguely Croatian. Also, apparently cops are stupider in the future as Tom Cruise saves his eyes to get back in to the high security pre-crime building. Uh, bad cop on the run still has access to the building despite being a fugitive? Ever heard of the DENY ACCESS list/button? Why would he still be in the computer's system?Oh, and his wife can waltz in with a gun and just demand he be released from his Han Solo (in the Jabba the Hut one) kind of frozen-like cell.Let's not forget this brilliant cop decides to take the pre-cog (what is the deal with the 'pre-' prefix in this flick?) to his pre-wife's place. Oh, that's a good idea. No one would ever think to look for them there.And, in the future, the crime-ridden area of DC will be the sprawl? Uh, isn't the sprawl like Tysons Corner, Fairfax Co., Arlington, etc., the suburbs where the white flocks live and DC's inner city the drug- infested areas. Why would this drastically be reversed in 2054?
Then a mole on the nurse! Sorry, mole has been done already in Austin 3. Plus she has the hots for Cruiser yet leaves once his eyes are bandaged up. She could have covered him in chocolate sauce and had him for dessert six ways from Sunday as what is he going to do--call the cops on her?And at the end Cruisey's wife is pregnant? Implausible given his sperm.And why in the future are pre-cog visions so Fritz Lang M 1930s kinescopey? Has technology gotten worse that we must see things in black and white. Forget androids dreaming of electric sheep, are we destined to dream in black and white? Forget missile defense shields, I want scientists working on getting color into our dreams.Why are the pre-cogs in water with electrodes plugged in? Wouldn't they get electrocuted as they are human after all.And what is with the unwieldy Soviet-looking giant helicopters? The Lexuses are cool but the copters look like something out of sci-fi comic books of the Jules Verne variety.Still two big thumbs up! Super story, great twists and Max Von Sydow whom I half expected to exorcise someone along the way. Highly entertaining and when is the next Dick novel coming out on fillum!?Even more entertaining is a preview program I saw on TV interviewing the futurists who they consulted on this movie. I'm sure that'll show up on the DVD and it's just as entertaining.",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
Cars," definitely not up to snuff
","Pixar was on a roll but this one seems too focused on one group--NASCAR fans. It's cute and clever and all but the first 5 mins of cars going round and round a track lost me despite the comic asides.The flick only really takes off when McQueen gets off the beaten path and ends up in Radiator Springs. The characters come to life then but I kept thinking the Hudson Hornet was really Paul Newman reprising Judge Roy Bean. The whole small town everyone knows each other thing has been done to death and it does work. The whole 'Route 66' nostalgia was fine but, let's be honest, folks, Route 66 as a concept is pretty hokey and there is a reason that it died. It's not just due to the Interstate passing these towns by.Anyway, the flick is fun but it's no Toy Story or Monsters, Inc. It's more in the Bug's Life vein as a great looking concept but the story lacks a lot. Pixar can't always hit a home run with every release.",7,0,1,1 December 2006
The Football Factory," entertaining but wanted a bit more
","Haven't read the book but read many similar on same topic so... Thought a few incidents a bit contrived like the Stoke hooligans just happening to show up at the rest stop. Too much focus on the so-called 'second in command' of the Chelsea firm.Even so I thought it got inside the head of the lead guy on why hooliganism grips him but, yeah, could have focused more on the adrenaline rush of violence these guys get off on. Don't really get why granddads were there as the whole WWII vet analogy is just not relevant really. The fact none of these guys would last two seconds on the mean streets of any inner US ghetto makes what they do seem laughable. I mean, if Millwall and Chelsea supporters want to have a ruck outside of police eyes, why not arrange it any day of the week? Why wait to be drawn in an FA Cup tie and then the police show up and they are all 'fraidy cats, all of a sudden? I don't get it. But that's an aside. It's worth watching just to hear the dialog alone and how they operate on match day which is fairly accurate (cell phones, spotters, CS gas, attacking pubs, etc.).",7,1,5,23 December 2005
Donnie Darko," The Bunnies tune to start--brilliant!
","Really do not want to give anything away but see this film for the 'oh, wow, that guy' and 'man, that fits' music moments. Definitely weird but watchable. Filmmaking almost as creative as Memento and Following. Great cast and Jake Gyllenhaal is again as good as he was in October Sky.",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
