Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest adventure movie of all time.
","This Indiana Jones movie is by far the best.  The best part is that he will do anything for the Ark including;  fending of venomous snakes, fighting a Nazi that is twice his size while avoiding airplane propellers, getting dragged by a truck, and swimming from a ship to a submarine; What a guy.",Null,0,0,8 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A movie that taught me about a whole new world... imagination.
","Star Wars is perhaps the greatest story written ever.  It combines myth and legend with science-fiction, war and action. It also launched Harrison Ford's career, (the highest grossing actor of all time).  It also created the largest money-making phenomenon in entertainment ever.  Titanic will never beat that.  Star Wars and its sequels have changed my life. There is not a minute that goes by in my life where I don't think about Star Wars. Call me strange, but when a movie can do all that Star Wars has done, it is more than a movie.",10,0,0,8 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My Favorite Movie
","Although The Empire Strikes Back is the darkest of the trilogy, it encompasses a lot more emotion.  It combines passion, fear, immaturity, betrayal, hatred, growth and love.  The score, I believe is the best ever written, ever piece of music tells a story and the music alone can make my cry or give me chills.  In the Empire Strikes Back Luke has a coming of age, Leia accepts her Love of Han, and even Yoda and Ben learn from Luke.  My favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back is Han Solo.  My favorite line is 'Laugh it up Fuzzball.' and my favorite part is the final scene between Vader and Luke.  When Luke lets go of the structure and falls into the abyss I get tears of joy everytime.  Watch it, you learn about love, friendship, growing and you just might learn something about yourself.",10,0,0,8 December 1998
