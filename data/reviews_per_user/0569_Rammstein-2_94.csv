The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino IS the devil
","Somewhat overlong and pretentious, this modern Faust story is however quite gripping, and even Keanu Reeves performed fairly well in it. And who is better to cast as the devil than Al Pacino?Ultimately, it might not be the kind of film I'd watch more than twice, or maybe even once. But it is entertaining almost all the way.",6,2,4,12 August 2000
Alien 3," The best of the lot
","I'm going against the tide when saying this is the best of the Alien movies. But think again. The clautrophobic sensation is extremely present, the dirt and the grime almost in your face and the alien itself is omnipresent since the prisoners, effectively, can't leave. They have to fight it. And the only weapons they have at their disposal are their brains and fire. Chilling and esthetically perfect, this IS the best of the lot. And please do not mention the 4th in the series. It's an abomination.",9,1,4,11 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could easily be made better
","Just remove Jar-Jar Binks, and already you're up running against the original trilogy. But there is more to it than that. Isn't it weird how the technology seems to have developed about a hundred or so years, when in fact the story takes place some 30 years BEFORE episode 4? And how clean and shiny everything is compared to the great ruggedness of the original series? And how terrifyingly bad Pernilla August's acting is? Well...it's just a film. Nothing really special. But I can understand if the kids love it - it is really not a film for Star Wars lovers. It's a film for the new generation of Star Wars lovers, who never got to see and hear the legend growing...",5,0,1,12 January 2000
G.I. Jane," Scott makes it float
","If this film hadn't been directed by Ridley Scott or someone his caliber, it would have been a complete disaster. Luckily, he has some tricks up his sleeve that makes it worthwhile and actually kind of entertaining. The film is well shot, for example, with camera angles, mud and scenery to make up for the bad dialogue and sometimes average acting. Actually, this film could have made it fairly well without any dialogue...But it's just an average movie, no more, no less. Looking at some of Ridley Scott's other work, it doesn't stand a chance. But Demi Moore isn't so bad, for once.",5,1,5,7 November 2000
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Still wondering about that spaceship
","If the 'Holy Grail' is their funniest movie, 'Life of Brian' is the most well-made. And here it is easier to sort through the sketches and jokes scattered around the film, because it does tend to get boring at some times. British humor is the best, though, and this film is a clear and vivid example of the finest the Python gang had to offer.The single most hilarious moment is when Brian shouts to the crowd that they're all individuals. They answer in unison: 'yes, yes, we are all individuals' - and then this bearded fellow pokes his head out and calmly states: 'I'm not.' That is just brilliant.Blasphemous? Yes, somewhat, but you'd have to be a really thick-headed Christian not to laugh at this harmless little film. After all, you are prompted to sing along: 'always look on the bright side of life'...What I really can't figure out is that sequence with the spaceship. I know you're not supposed to ask questions when watching Python humor - I just want to know what went through their minds when they added it...",7,8,18,13 January 2000
Erin Brockovich," It makes you happy
","I love it when you leave the movie theater and feel, not elated, but nonetheless happy. This film is a perfect example, and there is one very good reason to feel that way: it's based on a true story. I know that some parts have been hollywood-ized (they're fairly obvious, I think), but the main thing is that this in-your-face and highly irritating woman actually came trough in a big way - she helped people in a way that most of us really can't, or won't, and she couldn't have done it if it weren't for that attitude.This film is funny, irritating, tragic and almost toxically ironic (yeah, I know, that joke was kinda lame in this context). Go see it, and please don't mind all the people trying to throw dirt on the real Erin Brockovitch's work by calling her a hostile loudmouth. They're just jealous...",9,0,0,9 April 2000
Meet the Parents," A seen-it-before
","Nothing new here, except that it's de Niro who plays the hard-ass father, and that, it seems, would make it enough for this film to be better than others of exactly the same kind. No, it's not. It's just a way to get to retell some old jokes and some stupid situations, and in the end it sorts itself out (and don't insult your own intelligence and call that a spoiler).It's funny, of course. Some things are actually quite clever (I like it when he spray-paints a cat to make it look like the family cat), but there's nothing new to the basic idea. Even de Niro was a bit dull to watch. The worst part of it is that Stiller seems to be in so many of those movies...",4,1,2,2 January 2001
Se7en," Wonderful darkness
","Dark, evil tale of a killer using the 7 deadly sins as grounds. The cops on his tail are always one step behind and get to witness the unbelievable cruelty that the murderer has inflicted upon his victims. No compromise: this is the most evocative film to appear in recent years, and I bet the ending had Andrew Kevin Walker bouncing up and down shouting: 'I'm the king of the world' too. Fantastic.",10,1,1,10 January 2000
The Big Lebowski," Few are funnier
","I'm just going to give one example that will explain why I think this film is so extremely funny. At this point in the film, my friend and I watching it had to back the tape and watch it again about ten times before we were through laughing. I had sore cheeks after that.My example is: The story of the guy who licks his bowling ball.",8,0,1,11 February 2000
Unbreakable," The first 30 minutes of a movie
","If one made a better movie out of this one, this film would be the first 30 minutes of it. As it is, Shyamalan stretches a good short story to almost 2 hrs and makes it worthwhile only with his excellent direction, a well-written script and memorable characters.Just as in his previous film, 'The 6th Sense', Shyamalan demonstrates his ability to power-up his scenes with almost nothing at all - no crying, no shouting, no running around. Some sequences in this film are very powerful, and the most powerful of them all is the one left out altogether: the train crash. Calm moments are the most disconcerting. The characters seem pretty dull at first, Willis just seems to stand around looking really confused most of the time. But the awakening to the fact that he is unbreakable, who wouldn't be? Jackson's frail comics collector is strange and esoteric, bordering on crazy. Shyamalan is a talented director and writer, and this movie is good. But I get the feeling that he rushed to make this film, and that the haste has crippled it somewhat. First of all, like I mentioned above, the entire movie felt like the first 30 minutes of something bigger, longer, better. Maybe a part one in a trilogy or something. Second, the nifty little details that were so abundant in '6th Sense' are almost completely forgotten or overlooked here. It's as though Shyamalan decided to shorten the process and cut some character development and some trivia. And the film suffers from it - it is not anywhere near as interesting as '6th Sense'.There's a twist, too, but this one is not very surprising (especially if one has read ANY kind of super-hero comic at some point in life), and seems a bit desperate. But what really sinks the ending are the completely unnecessary explanatory texts that appear, revealing what happened after the story ended for the viewer. I don't understand the need for that kind of self-mockery. It doesn't help the story, it doesn't add anything interesting to the flow of the plot and it certainly feels like a desperate move or some unimaginable sort. I'm not just talking about 'Unbreakable' here, I don't understand the need for this in any film (except maybe true stories).I really don't think that Shyamalan 'did it again', since the contrasts between '6th Sense' and 'Unbreakable' are very stark, and the quality of the former is far beyond that of the latter. But Shyamalan is clearly a talent to be reckoned with. He just has to top his debut, which will be very, very difficult. A challenge, you might say.",6,0,0,2 January 2001
Fight Club," What great movies are all about
","This is the 3rd best film I've ever seen. Fast-moving, energetic beyond belief and with a rock-solid attitude that just isn't found elsewhere, this flick is just too great to miss. Unsettling, graphic, violent like no else, made in typical Fincher-style: dark, gritty, dirty and a bucketful of sweat. Excellent performances by Pitt and Norton (the IKEA touch is a bonus for us Swedes), great lines ('Run, Forrest, run!' is my favorite) and some really, REALLY wicked jokes. I recommend this film to anyone, except that you have to bear watching people slug it out some - and even beating each others' faces to bloody pulp. But the violence is not the point of this film, and if you can stand it, there are quite a few interesting issues that are brought to attention. And what more can one ask for?",10,0,2,12 January 2000
As Good as It Gets," The title says it all
","Indeed, this is as good as it gets. It couldn't get much better, because this film makes you glad. Glad that you're not HIM, glad that SHE's there to strike with her brilliant acting and beautiful face. Compulsive and endearing drama about a wicked and lonely man duking it out with a dog and his gay keepers, a young woman who he clearly fancies and her little son whose illness keeps her in constant fear of losing him. Strange behaviours all around, but Nicholson really takes the price: his best role ever, and the Academy Award he won for it is well deserved.",9,0,0,11 January 2000
Amistad," Great drama of failing accuracy
","This is a very good film that has been largely overlooked for some reason. 'Amistad' twists the truth a bit for better drama, but the main reason to see this film is the amazing dialogue, at times very, very funny and very well imagined. The group of Mende tribe members make swift, down-to-earth judgments about their surroundings and the people that try to interact with them, and the inability to communicate results in another very clever touch: Joadson and Baldwin learn to count from 1 to 10 in Mende, and then walk around the docks trying to find former Mende tribe members. The dialogue of 'Amistad' is very special and interesting indeed, one of the best I've had to good fortune to encounter. Another part that impressed me was the horrifying testimony that Cinque gives in the court room - as reported in the goofs section of this film, this testimony was in reality given after the Judge rendered his verdict and did not change the outcome. Either way, it's a extremely heavy part of the film, sickening and a very well portrayed depiction of the disgusting slave trade business.The performances are stunning. Especially Hopkins and Hounsou are very convincing - Hounsou's confused anger and Hopkins' final speech are great to watch. Seeing Anna Paquin as Queen Isabella was very funny, but her character was almost too silly - I doubt that the queen of Spain was so childish at 11. Parts of the drama replaces truth, which is hard to forgive in this matter. After all, the real events of this story are dramatic enough for a film, there was no real need to dramatize further. But it is a very good film nonetheless.",6,3,7,11 January 2001
Shakespeare in Love," For the love of the game
","The guys who made this film, loved making it. They love Shakespeare and they love the British language. It is only natural that the audience loves it.I count this film as one of the best of the 1990s. The humor, the sensational emotions and the utterly superb performances are just wonderful to watch.But there is a lady that really makes this film enjoyable, and that is Judi Dench. She is so...extremely well cast as the queen, I wanted to see much more of her. Her voice, her grace and her way of delivering a line is beyond criticism. She made this film happen, and it is her I remember most.",9,0,0,15 February 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Stupid, stupid, STUPID!!!
","Oh boy. They must have paid Sigourney Weaver a HUGE sum of money to cast her, because I refuse to believe her actually liking this script - in fact, the entire idea. Yeah, yeah, cloning is a great way of making sequels, its not that. It's just that the notion of the alien creature is virtually MURDERED. They kill it, you see. It's no longer this wonderfully evil and perfect creature - and that hideous monster at the end makes me sick. I will never include this as an Alien film. It's a spoof, a parody, with bad acting, bad scenery and an idiotic script to back it all up.",1,7,14,11 January 2000
12 Monkeys," Weird and esoteric
","This movie could easily have been made a disaster. The first key is the cast. It is excellently cast, and the performances in this film are stunning. Particularly Brad Pitt performs so excellently, one might actually believe that he flails his arms like that for real.The weirdness of this movie was too much for some - I know a whole bunch of friends who really hated it - mainly because they didn't understand any of it. And it is a very esoteric film. One almost has to go inside Gilliam's head to understand what is going on. To ask why would be a mistake, however. Nothing really happens for a reason in this film. It just happens.I relate a lot to 'Fisher King' when I see this one - mostly because the main character (Willis) doesn't understand much of what is going on, which is very similar to Bridge's character. It's not until the very end he understands.The circular plot is a touch of genius. In fact, this film is one of the 50 films on my top-10-list.",10,0,0,7 February 2000
The Fifth Element," Entertainment? You bet. Brains? Forget it.
","That's the best way to summarize this film. Its stupidity is only surpassed by its entertainment value, and as such, it survives.This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen, and along with Starship Troopers probably the dumbest film that I truly loved.As always, I find Gary Oldman capable of the most astonishing characters. In this film he manages to be a parody of the most evil Hitler-type person one could imagine complete with childish outbursts and awesome firepower - and yet he makes him ridiculous enough to fit into some kid matinÃ© or a cartoon. He is the main reason why I liked this film so much.",8,0,1,2 August 2000
Blade," The very definition of bad adaptations
","I have always found movies that are made from graphic novels interesting. Some of them are very successful in the attempt to copy the stylized world of comics. The very best example yet is Matrix - I've never seen anything like that film.But Blade is much like the Batman movies: nice tries that won't work. Both Batman and Blade are quiet, angry people who never smile (except for Clooney, who seems unable to wipe that stupid grin of his face). They walk around, do their thing dressed in the most indiscreet clothes you can possibly wear and then get out again.Yeah, Batman is just kind of a parody - but Blade tries to be more serious. Which doesn't work, or course. It's about as serious and profound as a puddle of water on the street. The action is nice, yes, but it is obvious that the budget for Blade wasn't half as big as for Matrix, because it is too rapid and shaky. Some gestures, such as the REALLY corny Maculay Culkin 'yes-I-just-nailed-the-bad-guy'-gesture in the vampire disco or the completely unnecessary pauses he makes with his sword, are probably a token of the original comics.As for the acting qualities of Snipes, well... I'd like to see him in a normal movie, one where he doesn't act like someone completely improbable. Like Howard's End or The Bridges of Madison County. Or then again...maybe not.",4,1,5,24 January 2000
The Mummy," Back to the fifties
","I'm surprised. I'm wondering how such a silly and inane film, with so much butchering of Egyptology, can be so entertaining. But it's all about the characters, you see.There should be a hero. A level-headed, strong and fearless hero who uses his brains only when it comes to trouble. There should be a woman with whom he could be smitten. And there should be one or more funny guys doing stupid things. And, of course, there should be a bad guy, a monster or, as in this case, a mummy.The trick is to make it work. You have to have the right state of mind. It's impossible to make this movie and be serious about it. It's supposed to be fun. And this one is.",5,0,0,28 January 2000
Chicken Run," Well crafted ingenuity
","Some voices here have taken on the art critic nasal voice and are trying to downgrade the hard work and great result of this film. Fancy words don't apply here, snobs.The fantastic engineering of the movie is absolutely beyond all praise - the details, the scenery, the characters. I couldn't care less about the formulaic plot; Chicken Run is and is supposed to be, a feast for the eyes.A great film, and a truly remarkable work.",9,0,0,29 August 2000
L.A. Confidential," A grand cop story
","(spoiler alert)'L.A. Confidential', stylish and sleek, sure is one of the most entertaining films of the '90s. With a great cast, perfected characters, atmospheric setting and a classic cops-against-cops story, it's hard to miss, but this film does more than revive the '50s - it uses the clichés and stereotypes in a very clever way, especially the mysterious blonde bomb-shell Lynn (Basinger), who is in every way the very embodiment of the classic gangster story lady. Almost film noir, the movie centers around the theme of corruption, and gives a very dark and pessimistic view of the world and of the police force: even the do-right, straight-forward Ed Exley becomes hardened by the impossibility of doing everything by the book in the face of a corrupted police force.The dialogue is excellent, ranging from the most habitual conversations to the stylish, Dick Tracy-like dialogue between Bud White and Lynn Bracken when they first meet. The audience is constantly dodged between comic book adventure and reality, which is a very exciting experience. The film ends in the typical gunfight, bringing to life yet another cliché with great verve.I'm trying to think of the bad things about this film, but there just doesn't seem to be any. The story is air tight, the acting is impeccable, the required mood is set. What great, stylish cop stories are all about.",8,0,1,13 February 2001
X-Men," Best super hero flick ever
","It's a growing genre, super hero movies. And this one is by far the best I have seen. Complete with the graphic novel feeling and scenery and with a wonderfully relieving sense of humor, X-Men reaches far beyond the fans of the comic - I have never read one single panel of the X-Men comic.Comedy is essential when making movies of this kind. Without it, there would only be a dumb plot with geeky super hero personalities ('Mystique' smells nerdy male fantasies a long way), but by taking itself not too seriously, this film is irrestistible. I was so amazed by the interaction between the good guys ('What do they call you? Wheels?'), the smart humor (giving the finger in an entirely new way) and the not-too-violent action makes up very well for the, to put it mildly, oddball science and the somewhat brainless plot.Also, it's refreshing to see a sci-fi flick that has almost no 'gadgets' in it. Apart from the aircraft (if that qualifies as 'gadget') and Cyclops' weird glasses, it's all man versus man (or whatever).Another clever touch is showing how Magneto once was sent to a concentration camp during WW2 - symbolizing the future fate that he and his mutant brothers and sisters are about to suffer: the mutants become modern day jews, and the ordinary humans become their Third Reich torturers. It also explains the strong hatred that he feels towards the human race - he is being reminded of his traumatic childhood.Wow...I never thought I would be able to analyze a super hero movie in that way...The bottom line is: go see it, even if you haven't read the comic and, like I did, had very low expectations. If you have any sense of humor and adventure, you might be surprised.",9,0,0,3 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," This is art
","Man, this film is beautiful! The visuals are just fantastic, Tim Burton has achieved another masterpiece. The film is a bit pointless, actually, but the beauty of it really makes up for everything. The only word I can come up with to match is ART.And Depp and Ricci are just the kind of actors you'd like to find in a film as aesthetic as this one. Insanity, fear and superstition play a heavy part in this the 2nd most accomplished of Burton's movies (the first one being 'Ed Wood').If you want something breathtakingly beautiful - see this. The colors! The tree! The faces! Holy sh*t, I have to see it again.",8,0,0,8 August 2000
Snatch," Seen it before - but it's ok
","'Snatch' is almost exactly the same movie as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. The similarities are so great that it's almost like watching the same film with a different cast. But it's ok, because this one is just as equally funny.The two leads scheme to get their hands on fat wads of money, but as the plot thickens, they just want to get out of it alive. In 'Lock, Stock...' there's a bunch of young, witty blokes who want to earn big money but in the end just want to live through it all. There's a criminal leader of a spectacularly brutal kind who just wants everything his way and has underlings that carry out his wishes to the fullest. In 'Lock, Stock...' too. A couple of smart but completely worthless small-time crooks are put into the plot to add a pivotal but seemingly meaningless (and funny) part in the whole criss-cross of events. That's almost exactly like in 'Lock, Stock...', with the notable difference that the crooks in the latter are seriously stupid. The plot is advanced by a series of coincidences and strange twists that accelerate into a blur of weird events and finally comes to a halt just when it can't get much more insane. That is also exactly like in 'Lock, Stock...'. And then there's Vinnie Jones, who is not merely exactly like his character in 'Lock, Stock...', he _is_ that guy, he just has a different name and a bigger gun.But, like I said, I don't really care. Both movies are very, very funny, and extremely entertaining to watch. It is excellently filmed and cut (or should I say 'mixed'?), and some shots are just breathtaking. The details, like the dog swallowing the squeaky toy or 'the fact that I have 'Desert Eagle point five-oh' written on mine', are just so insanely funny, it doesn't really matter that Ritchie seems a bit stuck in a loop. Why change a concept that works? But let's hope that he can do something about it to the next time, or it _will_ get repetitive.",9,0,1,2 January 2001
The Beach," A bit toned down, I guess
","This film isn't really all it could be. The premises are very good; a secret island, a map and a 'Lord of the Flies'-like community living there. The actors do a fine job, and the setting is just as beautiful it can be.But the film lack the depth and weight it should've had - the only moment in the film when you really feel weighed down by the life and choices these people live every day, is when the (swedish) fishermen gets shark bitten. That felt like a soft punch in the solar plexus when it should've felt like a truck hitting you.As or the end, well...there really were no surprises there, it was obvious that it would turn out the way it did.I'm always happy when one puts Swedish in a film, like in this one or 'Titanic'. But what I really wonder is why Sweden is mentioned so often in American films?",7,0,1,31 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The climax
","(spoiler for those who against all odds haven't seen it)Best of all three in the 'Star Wars' saga, episode VI is very special. It continues the wonderful adventure of all the great characters, and at least the beginning is as wham-bam as the two other movies. But 'Return of the Jedi' has something special that rises over the prequels and makes it feel very different - it's not as dark as episode V, but the characters have evolved since the first and second movie: they are more experienced, they are more committed and more determined to win the battle. So determined that even Darth Vader can be turned to the good side.Marvelous, and a great ending (?) to the greatest film saga ever.",9,0,1,12 January 2001
Forrest Gump," A classic
","Goodness gracious, I discovered that I hadn't commented on this movie yet! Well, it's to be rectified.Forrest Gump was an absolute favorite of mine for several years, it still ranks among the top ten movies of all time. It is brilliant, a true gem that will undoubtedly become a classic. It already IS a classic, actually. At least in my book.Though it differs from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name Forrest Gump and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: it's the kind of epic and insane saga one can find in one. The life and adventures of Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time around, the liar tells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human being, a bit on the slow side, I'll admit - but he is honest, he is righteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, it's politics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets between the events and actually understanding them is the kind of distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His ability to walk away unscathed from any happening is one I sure would like to have.I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life.",10,1,4,20 July 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Funny stuff
","A movie that gets the amount of attention that 'Bridget Jone's Diary' has received is thought to have some deeper point to it, but pretty much like 'Notting Hill' or 'Four Weddings...', this one is very, very enjoyable without actually having one. I'm not saying that it is completely pointless - I'm saying that the diary of Bridget Jones really doesn't reveal anything revolutionary or cast any new light on men vs. women. Some men are a**holes, most are not. Some women are degraded gold diggers, most are not. Most people are just like Bridget Jones - willing, kind and really low in the confidence department. Therefore, all the fuss about this being such an 'insight' is bull. In the end Bridget Jones just wants stability, love and calm and shies away, quite rightly, from sleazy s.o.b. men like her boss (Grant)It is a very funny movie though - not quite in the caliber of 'Notting Hill', but still a good laugh. The acting is impeccable (with that cast it would be impossible to miss), Zellweger, Grant and Firth are all enjoying their respective roles so clearly, some of their good mood spills over the brim.Good fun.",7,0,0,1 August 2001
Fargo," Is this fun or what?
","To even imagine that this one is based on a true story seems really weird. But it apparently is.The performances in this film are truly excellent. The atmosphere and the characters fill me with awe. The Cohen brothers have managed to add a sense of disbelief to the film - the events are bizarre and the plot is really strange.A very good film, overwhelmingly funny.",8,0,0,11 February 2000
Notting Hill," Nothing like a British comedy
","No one can match the British comedy. Take 'Notting Hill', and compare it with any American counterpart, like 'You've Got Mail'. That is a great movie, and I loved it. But 'Notting Hill' is just over-the-top.British comedy has a special ingredient that Hollywood has yet to appreciate: tragedy. There is often a tragic background to the funny events and characters - just have a look at 'The Full Monty', one of the best films of the 90's. It's basically tragic. The seriousness of the situation and the grief involved makes it sting - and that's what makes it so good. I really can't see any tragedy in 'You've Got Mail'...Anyway, 'Notting Hill' is not very tragic. The situation between Thacker and Scott, however, seems to be doomed. Also, the woman in the wheelchair adds a sad note to the music. But the characters lift themselves up from the mess of their lives and make something funny and worthwhile from it. It's uplifting not only to see the harmless behavior of Thacker or the incredibly dumb-ass Spike - but the entire set of people that Thacker trust and love provides additions to the story that are just as valuable.This film was probably the best one, bar 'The Matrix' to appear in 1999. And I just want to say that I'd like a T-shirt like the one Spike wears to his date.",9,0,0,27 January 2000
Léon: The Professional," Once again a Besson Special
","Luc Besson has an ability to make bad guys seem weak and good. One even feels sorry for the Bad Guy in Fifth Element. Leon is another 'bad guy' who, from the POV of the film, isn't bad. He is just brainwashed from so many years of professional killing. So when Portman adds herself to his bizarre and spartan household (milk and that little flower is all he ever cares for), his world is naturally turned upside-down.Portman is one of those actors who will become really big, because very early she showed signs of talent that some adult actors still lack (read Christian Slater and Keanu Reeves). And Jean Reno - well...we know him, don't we?But the big hand goes to Oldman. Oldman performs so excellently in this (most of his films) film that he almost outshines Reno. His odd, evil and cruel character is really something to look forward to.",Null,0,1,16 January 2000
American Pie," Finally an American movie with a TRUTHFUL depiction of adolescent sex life and thoughts!
","If you don't like this film, you most likely don't like sincerity. This film is by far the most open-minded film on sex ever made in the US.Sex in movies instilled moral panic in Sweden in the 50's, and I must say that the nudity in this one is about as lame as any Swedish film from that era. The talk isn't much more revolutionary.I laughed my ass off at this movie. It was funny, heart-felt and is probably a lot more akin to the truth about what's going on inside a high-school guy's head.What bothers me most is that people tend to think this film actually wants kids to go on and do it, the quicker the better - don't you get it! It's irony: I-r-o-n-y, look it up. With that kind of understanding of movies, one could as well say that every movie about concentration camps tells us to commit large-scale murder. Strange thinking, or what?",8,0,0,15 June 2000
Cast Away," Not bad at all
","(Spoilers)With very mixed reviews, 'Cast Away' is a good and entertaining film, but it is not very thorough and it is somewhat flawed in the timeline department. I was actually very satisfied with the film - I had expected nothing more, and nothing less, so for once, my expectations were met almost exactly.So what's wrong with this film? In hindsight, I can easily spot the flaws, but sitting in the theater I didn't mind them much. First and foremost, that which most negative reviews and comments focus on, is the 4-year leap. We get to see Noland surviving, adapting and realizing that he will not be found. Suddenly, the action jumps 4 years ahead, to the point where Noland finally gets a chance to leave. It wasn't very frustrating to me - Zemeckis and his crew obviously wanted to focus on the difference between Noland the survivor and Noland the Robinson. I find the stark contrast rather refreshing - because seriously: what should they have filled the intervening time with? More injuries? More reinventing the primitive tools of the caveman? I don't think so. It would have lengthened a film that in the end is not about the life of a Robinson, but about adaptability, strength and resolve. And to that end, the abrupt jump in time is not only acceptable, but necessary.What I do think is a great flaw, and the only one that actually bothered me while watching, was the carefree way with which the movie deals with his homecoming. Sadly overlooked, the reactions of people around him and the massive amount of attention that he undoubtedly would receive, would have been valuable to the movie in terms of entertainment and clarification: just how did the world go on without him? Then again, the focus is not the world, but Noland. It's his sentiments, his life that has altered so profoundly, and the gap in time between his rescue and meeting with his former girlfriend is also a gap that is functional: how mindblowing mustn't it be to be rescued after 4 years alone on a tiny island with just a volleyball to talk to? How blank would his mind get after finally being brought back to civilization? The 4 weeks after his rescue would be filled with a weak, sleepy Noland without much to say or do. What Zemeckis could have added without much effort, is a sort of media commentary on Noland's story. The 4-week gap feels too much like a loss.Zemeckis has an eye for human emotions and facial expressions that say more than words and music would. We get to see Hanks perform stunningly (as usual), regardless if he is a crowd-pleaser or not, and his time on the island is void of music and almost void of words. The film is superbly shot, some sequences almost taking the breath away. Some details weight heavily on the viewer - the removal of a bad tooth by way of an ice skating shoe that had the entire audience cringing in their seats, and the realistic and frightening scene where he tries to escape with the rubber raft and injures himself.All in all, I think the negative reviews on this film are unfair and inconsiderate. I would like to know what should have been done instead. I just have a hard time seeing this film made different without losing focus: Noland and his life before, during and after his stay as a Robinson.",7,0,0,15 January 2001
The Thing," Interesting...but not brilliant
","This is an interesting film, mainly because it is one filled with some of the most disgusting special effects I have ever seen - though I admit that I am fairly new to horror flicks of this kind.What's good about it? For one thing, it is a very clever touch not to reveal who has been infected and who hasn't until it is absolutely necessary. It is completely impossible to tell who is who, and the suspense raises sky-high because of that.Also, the performances are actually pretty good, considering the cramped confinement of the set and the sparse and somewhat lame dialogue. These are ordinary men talking, though most of them seem to be more or less criminal in some way.The beginning is very clever, and it takes quite a while before one gets the hang of why these crazy Norwegian are so eager to hunt the dog with machine guns and hand grenades (!) that they injure one of the Americans in the process. Of course, the first time I saw it, I knew what was coming, but it makes it better nonetheless.I have a favorite scene in this movie, it is one I will remember forever: when the doctor is trying to resuscitate one of the team members, who has been infected, he gets his hands caught in some weird mouth that opens right in the guy's chest. That is awful. It doesn't matter much that the doc's hands seem to break off by themselves...What else? Well...it's a cult classic, and deserves it. Like many of those, it's very far from brilliant, but are nonetheless very good and entertaining to watch.",6,6,11,7 November 2000
Armageddon," Well...it's entertainment
","It sure is entertainment. When the story, the characters and the logic are left behind like this, the filmmakers go for broke on the entertainment. And they succeeded in making this film enjoyable against all odds.The slam-bang action and the wild rides that one is offered work pretty fine with me - there are many things to overlook to enjoy it, but it is actually possible, for once. What I don't like is Stormare's role as the crazed Russian fellow, who is not in th least believable. But hey - nothin' else is either...",6,3,5,11 February 2000
Pitch Black," Starts out great, then mellows
","It starts out really great, and the first part of the film is VERY nice. The light in this film is just superb, irritating and stinging, and you can really feel the heat and the thirst. Well done, considering it's all done with light.But the second half feels much like a distant echo of the Alien Trilogy (I won't dignify the god-awful Alien Resurrection as a fourth in a series), far from being as innovative and chilling as those great films. And there are some lines in this film that don't rate much higher than they would in a Seagal-flick...",5,0,0,16 May 2000
American Psycho," My mind goes blank (spoiler warning!)
","I didn't feel anything when I saw this film. The book made me disgusted, furious, had me laughing and nodding in consent with the clever insights into the idiotic life of Patrick Bateman. This film had nothing of it, and it although it was a good movie, it's far from being anything more than average.I won't say that I miss the endless torture-scenes of the book, it was clear right away that those were not possible to show to ANY extent. The mere suggestion of them and the notebook that Jean flips through near the end are enough to make one understand just how sick this person is. And Bates' performance is just excellent, perfect - he masters this role like none other. Just look at him phoning his lawyer: 'I just have to kill a lot of people!' Brilliant.But the blandness of this film is on another level: the director just fails to convey the sentiment of total detachment that Bateman feels. He interacts with people, talks to them and even feels something for them, as in the case of his girlfriend, whom he dumps so that he won't harm her. All this is okay, for he wouldn't pass for a normal human being if he didn't. He leads two lives. His 'normal' life is okay, well portrayed, and the moments where his second life, that of the blood-thirsty maniac, tries to grab hold of his sanity, are well made.But there is still something missing. And I can't really tell what. All I can say is that this film didn't make me feel what I thought I would feel: these people exist. There are people like Bateman, surely - but the film makes him unique.So go see it, for all that it matters. But I'd much rather read the book.",5,2,3,30 May 2000
U-571," Stealing heroics from the English
","It is pretty easy to forgive Hollywood for stealing the heroism from the British in this film, since 'U-571' is very entertaining and a worthy submarine-drama. What is surprising is that the impressive cast is pretty toned-down and insignificant, mostly because all (except for a VERY miscast Harvey Keitel) perform fairly well. It's fairly predictable and the somewhat overlong 'Splashes!' scenes feel extremely second-hand. The claustrophobic environment of WW2 subs is very well captured. I've been aboard an old sub for about a half hour and felt almost suffocated by the cramped confines, and all that is very well captured. On the whole, an entertaining but a little bit insignificant movie.",5,1,3,26 March 2001
American Beauty," Number one, all of a sudden
","I surprised myself walking out of the theater, realizing that this movie was the best I have seen to date, inching Heat and Seven a notch down the ladder. It that takes great force, because they have been steady as rocks.There are many many reasons for me liking this film so much. It is beautifully shot, with some great camera work - both in the film and the film itself! The actors perform extremely well, with Kevin Spacey at the front - but he has never performed badly, so... The situation that the people in this film have become entangled in is a poignant look at what may come if you lose your lust for life. Trivial, boring and numb. The film has captured that very well.There are depths to this film that I had no idea of before I went to see it. The final minute in this film is probably one of the most beautiful, serene and meaningful piece of film I have ever seen.Another point about this film is how meaningless change becomes to some people if you let your boring, suburban life get the better of you; it doesn't matter to Lester's daughter whether he changes or not, she still thinks he's an idiot. And to his wife - well, she is just appalled at his ego trip.And the way Lester drags the events with him as he goes on to rearrange his life and become more laid back and cool - he even becomes so cool about life that he in the end turns down the very reason for his want to change.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film, and I am going to see it again very soon. It didn't change my life because I'm nowhere near being there yet. But it knocked the wind out of me nonetheless.",10,0,0,6 March 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Unbelievable!!!
","Can you believe it? A serious action movie that actually works and doesn't get pathetic? And, to top it, with Arnold Schwarzenegger? It's hard to grasp... The heaviest, toughest and most cruelly gripping action film ever, T2 turned a new leaf in action movies. It's probably the only clear-cut action film ever to actually make a lasting and impenetrable impression on me - otherwise I tend to think that this genre is taking itself way too seriously. I have seen this film about 20 times, and I could still watch it tonight if I had the time. Stylish, dark and utterly cruel, this film will be remembered. Let's just hope that Cameron, that money-spending schoolboy, keeps his head on for the sequel...",10,2,2,12 January 2000
The Patriot," Main characters? Sappy and Cheesy.
","Sorry folks. A clearer case of 'bummer' I have never seen. This film takes on an unbelievable air of self-righteousness, and the cheesy staring, the sappy one-liners and the awfully narcissistic view of the world is just barely contained. It is not an awful film, but it's very far from good. It reaches an embarrassing 3 on my scale.The problem is not the actors. I can't stress that enough. They all do very well in their respective roles. Mel Gibson is, as always, beyond any criticism - his range of furious anger all the way down to heart broken sorrow is impressive. There is simply no one who cries like he on screen. And his mad gaze would give even Clint Eastwood a real scare.Neither is it the story itself, although it seems a bit empty to me. It works well, and is believable, despite the fact that this movie suffers from not being true.It is the abundant sorrow, the dropping of awfully cheesy comments and the depiction of the patriots as the only good guys, when in fact they behave almost as badly as do the British. That they wave American flags I have no problem with, it is after all the war for American independence. There were probably a lot more flag waving going on than shown here. But why oh why does Hollywood see the need to emphasize so much on the lone hero, his sorrows, his strong beliefs and his almost unsurpassed cleverness? It's cheesy. I'm sorry, but I really feel it is.The theme is so abundant in the Hollywood movie business, it's almost scary. There are literally hundreds of movies with almost the exact same plot, same feeling and the same heroics. I for one am getting tired, so maybe I should stop seeing movies that are clearly of the same breed.Well...I guess it works well with Americans. But as a European, I must say that this angle is getting tiresome. There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing that hasn't been done before, dozens of times. In fact, both the plot and some scenes are very reminiscent of 'Braveheart'. And that film was a LOT better. Maybe because Gibson himself directed it, instead of 'Mr. Independence Day' - the director most prone to American cheesiness. Hmm...maybe that's why he was picked?",3,1,3,7 August 2000
Edward Scissorhands," A strange sense of wonder
","It took me quite a while to appreciate this film - mostly because I wasn't familiar with Burton's fabulous, overblown proportions and great vision. 'Edward Scissorhands' was just too weird for me. I am happy to say that it has grown on me - though being far from Burton's later work, such as 'Ed Wood' or 'Sleepy Hollow', it is still strikingly original and is a very interesting experience.The tidy, perfect and very unreal suburb in contrast to the dracula-style castle that has somehow been left standing right in the middle of it is just the sort of dreamy juxtaposition that one could expect from Burton. It is a treat to be surprised by it and it feels very novel. The nosy, in-your-face housewives who center their absurd lives around what's going on in the neighborhood are a vital part of this juxtaposition. It makes you wonder which part of this weird place is for real and which isn't. And Edward himself, a bizarre freak whose life is turned upside down by kind and unkind (and just plain dumb) suburban dwellers - Edward must be one of the most haunting and sad characters I have ever seen, and Depp is absolutely perfect for the part.In many respects the characters are pretty normal - they have been tweaked somewhat to allow for their extravagant behavior and their calculating meanness, but other than that, they are just people. But put in these awful, cheerily colorful surroundings, they seem even more twisted than they already are. And Edward, apart from his appearance, is more normal than any of them. A film full of wonders. It's inspiring to think that Tim Burton thought this movie up as a kid.",7,0,0,24 January 2001
Face_Off," The most overrated film of '97.
","How is it possible that a film containing one of the most incredibly STUPID plot holes, logic leap, dumb trick - call it what you like - can be so popular? I don't get it. Just how can Cage and Travolta can switch faces and no one notices that they did? More to the point, how can they switch faces at all? I don't buy it. And then this film becomes really lousy.Yeah yeah, great action - I've seen better. Great performance? NOOOOOO, just have a look at the scene where Cage says 'I'm going to take his face ... off', that's AWFUL!There is only one part that I fully enjoyed. That's when Cage's character discovers just what the prison he is placed in is... That's great. I just wish I had seen it in another movie. This one is clearly overrated.",4,7,13,17 January 2000
American History X," Important movie
","This film is one of the most frightening I have ever seen. It may be weak in some points, but it is still an incredibly important movie. This is not for the US to watch, it feel just as important anywhere else.Edward Norton is just excellent, but lets not forget Edward Furlong, who does a VERY good job too.So what's important about it? Well, apart from showing that anyone can change, we get an accurate look into the minds of the people who have submitted to this insanity called racism. How one leader is enough to brainwash and put ideas in gullible people's mind and make them believe it so much they'd kill for it. It happens everyday.This movie should be shown to young racists in the way they show films to the main character in 'Clockwork Orange' - by way of force.",10,0,0,8 February 2000
Pearl Harbor," Ambitious but so-so
","Critics have been eager to berate this film, which is understandable. Filmmakers have to be very careful when taking on a historic event of this magnitude. The reason for the success of 'Titanic' was that, beyond a somewhat lowbrow script and mushy love story, great care was taken to depict in detail just what the great ship Titanic was all about. The legend of Titanic was treated with respect (if not augmented). 'Pearl Harbor' lacks a great deal of historic insight and care for details.There are two major flaws with this film. The first, and most important one, is the love story itself. Dizzy with the immense success of 'Titanic' amongst the young communities, the makers saw their chance to make big money in a grand love story set in an event of legendary proportions. The story feels really added-on, though, the attack and the ensuing retaliation effort (I will get to THAT part later) suddenly strip the story of its heart and soul. Furthermore, the characters are one-dimensional - despite fine acting by all parties - and one is never really given a chance to connect to them in any way.The second major flaw is the entire last hour of the film. It seems to be (and probably was) added to the script just to educate the world that the USA always wins, no matter what. The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most astounding military successes of all time is downgraded by the need to emphasize on US greatness. A suicide mission to drop a few pathetic bombs on a factory in Tokyo didn't really deter the Japanese from continuing their massive offensive in South East Asia. It is an unnecessary part, and the movie becomes terribly overlong.What, then, makes it okay? Well, obviously the attack itself is depicted with incredible force and with a great feeling for drama and action (which Bruckheimer-Bay team is no stranger to), some of the scenes are just awesome. The aerial battles are also very well envisioned - even though no American planes took to the sky during the battle. The acting is pretty good, not bringing a lame script to life like DiCaprio and Winslet did in 'Titanic', but nonetheless helps keeping it afloat. I also appreciate the fact that the Japanese were not depicted as cruel, insane killers who just attacked for fun. From their perspective, the attack on Pearl Harbor was the only sensible thing to do in order to keep their aggressive expansionist politics intact. I'm not defending it in any way - I'm just stating the facts.So quite why the critics have to massively downgrade this movie, I don't really understand. It's very far from being the grand historic spectacle it could have been - it is merely entertaining - and it doesn't bring any new light to the actual event. Ultimately, it isn't the kind of film that I will remember with any clarity. It's just fiction. As such, it works pretty well.",5,0,0,15 July 2001
Die Hard 2," Thank God for Bruce Willis
","If it weren't for Bruce Willis, this film would have been disastrously bad. It's not the action or the story - it's a pretty good one, with great action and with gunfights to spare.It's the plot holes, mostly made up of extremely stupid factual mistakes - see the goofs section on this film. I for one is interested in aircraft, and I can tell you; the flaws in this one are almost too great and too many to be acceptable.However, Willis has his charms, and he truly saves this film from going under.",5,4,8,8 February 2000
Independence Day," WOW, KABOOM, SWOOSH!!!
","Never mind the stereotypical characters. Never mind the non-existant logic. Never mind that the dialogue is inane and bordering on idiotic. THIS IS GREAT ACTION! And there's no point in denying it.First of all: I love to watch destruction. Preferably in larger scales. You get fed an enormous amount of it here. Second: I love alien starships the size of New York. And you sure get that too. And third: I love dogfights. You get that too. Forth: I don't take it seriously.This films is one of the best of the decade, not simply because it works so well in an all-over scheme, but it provides some kicks that no other film had up to then (1996). Aliens arrive in gigantic spaceships and blow up a bunch of major cities. That's all I need.How to grapple with the fact that logic takes a backseat - please spare me. There are worse films than this one.",10,288,483,21 January 2000
Man on the Moon," Amazing!
","(Spoiler warning? Maybe.)An amazing film, straight out of the heart. A loving and deliberately difficult movie about one of the most original comic characters ever, Andy Kaufman. Brilliantly played and with a way of telling the story that really made me go 'Wow!'. Jim Carrey performs so stunningly, it's hard to understand it's actually him. I kept seeing him as the real thing, the real Andy Kaufman (which is both weird and extraordinary), and that boosted the film to become really great.Nothing is sure in the world of Andy Kaufman. Had he been a rebellious politician instead of comedian, there would still be people trying to find him alive. The movie portrays this with excellence - it is very hard to keep track of the truth, and in the end, one is left with the number one question: did he fake his own death too, just like he did with the old lady?Believing in the idea that there is NOTHING we can't make fun of, I think Andy Kaufman embodies one of the most important concepts there is on this planet: we must not take ourself so seriously.",9,0,0,9 September 2000
Saving Private Ryan," What with the American flags?
","This film is excellent. Except for one respect. The toning in of the Stars and Stripes at the beginning and the end. Unnecessary, egocentric and downgrading. Most people who fought and died in WW2 were Europeans...The thing that really made this film, is the opening sequence. The first 30 minutes are brilliant, horrifying and historical. Never, ever has war been depicted in such a realistic manner. It's genuine and true - not John Wayne waltzing out from the landing craft with the bullets whipping past him and his brave men. This is what it was like.Other than that, this film is not too original. Most of the Germans are anonymous and disgusting, and even though the poor sod who gets to dig his own grave turns out to be a real b****rd. And there is one part I REALLY don't like: why on Earth does the guy they're looking for want to stay? It's irrational and unthinkable.But all in all - this is a great movie. Not all too believable - but nonetheless, a realistic war movie. Just get rid of those flags, you guys!",9,0,1,13 January 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Surprise, surprise
","(spoiler alert)This has to be one of the lousiest sequels ever made. It's running uphill against Under Siege 2, Speed 2 and Alien 4, but it's almost at pace with those awful movies.There is one thing I do like in this film - it's the part where the T-rexes push the camping-lab-van-whatever over the cliff. Despite the fact that the back part of the trailer, the one hanging down from the ledge, is upside-down, and despite the horrifyingly stupid attempt to drag the entire 20-ton trailer back up again with a 1,5 ton mercedes jeep (good luck), it's the one enjoyable moment of the film. Oh, and I like the dino that punches the car door straight through the car with its head.Actually, there is a scene that really sums up all the lousiness of this cheap we-want-more-money-sequel: it's a hyperbole, something I am convinced movies can do without. In the beginning, Malcolm's daughter sulks over her not managing to qualify for some gymnastic competition (or something like that) - and near the end this little kid performs a 'stunning' move as she swings around and kicks a Raptor trough the wall. Yeah, right. Much like the merc pulling that trailer up.Well... I certainly have no hopes at all for the third Jurassic Park, which, I hope, will come too late to inspire yet another buying frenzy, which is really why they make the movies number two and three at all.",3,2,9,6 July 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," True magic
","I don't know where to start. Should I begin by telling you about the beauty and sadness of the story? Or by describing what went through my head while watching? Impossible. Should I analyze and interpret the details or the movie on the whole? Or should I make a statement about the absolute poetry and love that has been put into every single frame of the film? Maybe then can I explain how this movie moved me, touched me and raised a storm in my head  and became the best movie (all categories) I have ever seen, after 6 years finally pushing `Heat' down the ladder to a venerable second. I want to savor this moment. I almost want to resist. But how can one resist `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?Set in China some time in the middle ages, two warriors, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai (Yeoh and Yun-Fat) battle an elusive enemy called the `Jade Fox' and are surprised to almost meet their match in a disciple, led astray and onto the wrong path by the Jade Fox (the Anakin-Skywalker-syndrome). The adventure revolves much around a sword that the Master warrior Li Mu Bai gives away as a gift, after deciding to give his warrior life up. But before he can give it up completely, he must face his Master's nemesis. The film is filled with stunning scenery and photography, violent and riveting martial art, a dialogue so poetic and justified it made my head spin. Refreshing and wondrous in the art of storytelling, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has made a profound impression on me.I am relatively new to the Hong Kong movies, and movies where martial arts play a considerable role. Therefore, I don't know how far Lee and his crew has pushed the ideas and the filming  but to me, this film was so deeply compelling and spellbinding, I have a hard time imagining anything like it. It's not a `martial arts movie'  it's much more of a drama, a love story and a retelling of Chinese lore. Magic is the essence, the aerial ballet of the fight scenes and the absolute control over every move in close combat, trigger and inspire a sense of wonder and adds beauty to the art of killing that Li Mu Bai is tired of. I understand that Ang Lee must have borrowed a great deal of material from Hong Kong movies, but like I said, to someone unfamiliar with those, this film appears quite revolutionary. There's poetry in every single detail: the story, the dialogue, the characters and their every trait, the scenery, the camera work and, of course, the fighting  violent and almost feverish. Colors, sound, the language, the trees, the desert and the warrior code. It all nailed me to seat and kept me on the edge of it until the very end. This is the kind of experience I so often want but seldom get. When the awkward position I had doubts that I could take for 2 hrs has been completely forgotten, then there's something great afoot.I say if the film feels absolutely spotless, if there are no flaws that appear on the first viewing (be it goofs or serious flaws in the storytelling), then the makers have achieved something extraordinary. Those films are few and far between. `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is of that special brand that not only appears flawless, but entirely perfect. I'm not saying that it is perfect  I'm saying that the depth and scope of the film makes it seem so. And that is not something that happens very often, not to me anyway. I think the last one must have been `Heat' or maybe `Se7en'. Before that...who knows.A clearer case of 10 out of 10 I have yet to see.",10,0,0,9 January 2001
JFK," Riveting, chilling and brilliant
","This film is a landmark movie, not insomuch as it is very interesting and makes one wonder, but more so for its ability to absolutely rivet the spectator for three hours, despite being almost nothing but talk, talk, talk. It is full of amazing acting and brilliant filming, surprises and very, very interesting points of discussion. It grabs you and holds you until the very last minute, and if one doesn't walk out of the theater with at least a thoughtful mind, then one is simply not very interested in this bit of American history at all.",8,1,12,8 October 2001
Moulin Rouge!," A massive storm of music
","If you don't like movie musicals, don't make the mistake of dismissing 'Moulin Rouge'. For it is no ordinary musical. It's more of a massive storm of music, visuals and emotions, resplendent with all the decadence of turn-of-the-century cultural life in Paris, loaded with musical anachronisms ranging from Nirvana to 'Sound of Music', all with a rapid music video style. Compelling, spellbinding and very, very funny. The story, otherwise crippled by sentimentality and awful cheesiness, is brought to its feet by this enormous mass of motion. Ol' Paris anno 1899 is brought to scandalous life and the drinking of Absinthe is glorified by the absinthe fairy, Kylie Minogue. This is the very definition of entertainment.10/10 for an outrageous, insane monster movie musical. I'm off to buy the soundtrack.",10,1,3,18 October 2001

Hopkins and Pitt act like they've never done anything else - they are brilliant. If you doubt my words, watch the first 15 minutes and tell me: don't you get goose bumps when Hopkins hears Death whisper in his ear? I sure did.

Mission: Impossible II," Worthless
","I have tried to comment on this film, but for some reason the comments were never accepted. This time I'll be brief.It saddens me that what could have been a great series of movies, starting out with de Palmas excellent first a few years ago, has quickly been spoiled by being handed to the least suitable director. John Woo has, if nothing else, proven that with a child's mind, anything can be made cheap, lousy and lame action of the kind one hoped never would rise above talents like van Damne and Lundgren. There is nothing special or original in this movie, just remakes (or rather parodies) of the ol' classic action themes. But what is worse is that Woo manages to add an incredible amount of cheesiness to his 2-hour slow-motion action ballets. White doves appear out of nowhere and some parts of the dialogue could be used as doormats at a kindergarten.Lousy, awful, tragic. That's all I have to say.",1,2,4,2 January 2001
The Insider," Brilliantly filmed and acted
","This film was breathtaking. Michael Mann is responsible for my favorite movie of all time, 'Heat', and there are some similarities in the 'poetic visual language' that he has mastered fully.The performances are amazing, both Crowe and Pacino are immersed in their characters and make them so real and alive that one hardly thinks of them as actors in a movie.But what really makes this film excellent is the filming. It is beautiful, alive and vibrant. The images convey the sadness, fear, frustration and anger that the leads are experiencing. Fantastic. I can't wait for Mann's next masterpiece.By the way, the music one hears when Wigand discovers the agents in and around the house (that later reveals themselves as his bodyguards), and rushes towards his house is music from 'Heat'. In that movie, it is played when Shiherlis (Kilmer) drives away from his wife, presumably forever.",10,0,0,13 November 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Winona's best performance
","I find it hard to comment on this film, since it didn't leave any lasting impression on me. This true story has some good points about life and how to live it, but the movie is often pretty bland and not very engaging. Winona Ryder performs like she's never have before, though, and I for one think she outshines Jolie by several lux. I imagined the hospital to be a lot crueler and 'Cuckoo's Nest'-like, with a Ratched to act as villain, so I was surprised when it turned out actually pretty nice.

It is a good film, yes, but there is one detail that I just can't get by: it is so horrendously SLOW.Other than that, it's a special film all right. Weird, esoteric and bizarre at some points, but nevertheless it manages to keep all the yo-ho Star Trek out - it's almost scientific in itself.

There are no real surprises, though - except for Rachel Weisz who has somehow acquired some sort of ancient Egyptian (?) martial art.

I never expected anything intelligent anyway.",6,0,0,31 May 2001
Mission: Impossible," I like this film!
","I really liked this one. Not very much in common with the TV-series, and I can see why so many dislike it that way. But there are some REALLY good sequences here, and there is even one that I consider to be one of the very best and most suspenseful parts of any movie - the part where Cruise is in the vault. Beautiful and nerve-racking.Not much else to say, though - it's an action movie, and it's a good one.",8,15,17,11 February 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Extravaganza!
","An excellent movie, especially being a debut. It comes nowhere near 'Pulp Fiction' in excellence, but is still very good. The characters, the story and the robbery gone wrong that one never gets to see - it adds up to one of the very best crime flicks of the past century.Tarantino has a way with characters, style and dialogue that few others have. The dialogues in particular has become a trademark of his (not to mention the blood and violence), and in 'Pulp Fiction' he got to show off the best dialogue ever written. This is the fore-runner. Great movie with a bunch of great actors that all seem to have been born into their respective roles. I like Tim Roth's acting, before and after getting shot.",8,1,3,13 December 2000
Total Recall," Schwartzenegger IS the King
","Like most of Arnie's movies, this one is extremely entertaining. It's a brainless film, with logic leaps that defy imagination, and with Arnie's usual No-I'm-not-a-300-pound-austrian-at-all-acting and with glitches and goofs that only exist in action movies. But it is oh so enjoyable, mostly because the special effects are quite nice - especially the one involving Arnie's nose - and because of the Martian scenery.It's also good to see some actors come out of the darkness for a bit. Especially Michael Ironside, who I have had a fondness for ever since the days of 'V'. Sharon Stone wasn't all too known back then, so she gets to show some of her charms as well.There is nothing like a mindless sci-fi-action flick to highten your mood one soggy evening. This one in particular is a great personal ice breaker.",7,0,1,17 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Not all that
","Terribly overlong and somewhat pretentious, this film does have some qualities that made me like it. The performances of Cruise and Kidman are above criticism, and the strangeness of the plot makes it worth watching - if only it weren't so long and tiresome.I hated the music. There are better ways to point something out with music in a film. As it is, it just gets on my nerves (and maybe that's Kubrick's idea, too).Overall, this film was probably over-hyped, but I don't think Kubrick could have left us in a better way.",7,0,1,11 February 2000
Pulp Fiction," One of the best films ever made
","I remember when I first went to see this film. I had seen 'Reservoir Dogs' fairly recently, and was expecting the same type of criminals, the same twisted but very funny dialogue and the same kind of realistic and disturbing violence. And boy, did I get it.It doesn't get much better than this. In it's genre (gangster-comedy-parody-action-whatever), it is the undisputed number one, its greatness not remotely threatened by anything. I can't even remotely discern what will top this.The characters are stunning, and the actors play them so well it was hard to imagine Travolta as anything else for a while (especially since he has yet to make a single decent film after this one). The cast list is impressive, and it is great to see Tarantino crediting their fantastic acting skills by giving each and every one a pivotal role in the plot (Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and so on). The dialogue is the best I have ever heard. The funny, weird and obtuse topics of discussion are handled with excellent care, making what seems like a really dumb discussion very realistic. Not to mention hilarious. Quotes from this film still haunts every day of my life. I have a friend who can't stop saying 'I'm ON the mother*****r' whenever he's set to do something. 'Hezekiel 25:17' is forever burned into my memory. The music is excellent. Tarantino continues to give the music a prominent role by using radios, stereos and the famous dance sequence - the music is constantly on somewhere in the background, in the story, in the plot.As far as the story goes, it couldn't be much better. It's fairly simple, but the timeline is sewn together in a very special and extravagant way (one that made my father totally hate this film), giving the viewer something to think about until the question is resolved. Excellent and, I imagine, something difficult to pull off so well. The sad part is that I don't think Tarantino will ever top this himself. I know it's a bad thing to say and think, but I just can't imagine anything in this genre that will come close to puzzling a story, a dialogue and characters together like this film does. Reaches a honorable number 5 on my cross-genre scale of the best movies ever made.",10,0,1,13 December 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Absolutely brilliant
","Comparing Guy Ritchie to Quentin Tarantino may have its perks, but I'd prefer not to. The only similarity between them is that they depict the lives and times of low-life criminals in a humorous way, and that they both have a real skill in writing plots with many twists and turns. However alike their writing is, there is nothing similar in their directing. While Tarantino is sometimes painfully slow and contemplative, Ritchie is fast, violent, witty and music video influenced. And there's a time for both. But for sheer fun I'd go with Ritchie.'Lock, Stock...' is insane. At some points, the story is almost believable but don't hang on to that - it quickly becomes a twisted, weird, fast-moving and funny, FUNNY mess of a plot where the casual and unintentional interactions between the different gangs and individuals almost become hard to follow. There are some scenes that alone make this movie worth watching - the sequence when the cannabis-harvesting loons shoot at the gangsters trapped in the steel cage with a soft air gun, or when the OD-chick suddenly comes alive with the machine gun. Hilarious, stupid, insane and fast-paced. Humor or the best kind. The cast couldn't be better, even Sting is pretty good the few moments he appears. But Vinnie Jones really tops it - not so much for is acting skills, but more for his character. Brutal and by far the smartest of the lot, he drags his little son around the messes that he makes, careful not to let the boy hear any profanity.A great film, and one that I certainly will watch again and again.",9,1,2,2 January 2001
Titanic," A few notes only
","I'm pretty sure that most people who strongly argue that this film sucks are merely determined to not liking it. Not that I don't see their points. The dialogue is fairly stupid, and the characters are pretty stereotypical. But that doesn't alter the fact that it's probably one of the grandest films of all time, and to spite you non-believers, I might add that it will become a classic, much like Gone with the Wind - and there's nothing you can do about it...The performance of Winslet and DiCaprio lifts the dialogue, and the entire scenery is so magnificent there's none to match it. As for detail and Cameron's eye for excesses, I don't think there was one single penny lost to this film. All of it bears a sensation of reality that is just WAY above anything else I've encountered.I've enjoyed Cameron's films for several years, and it saddens me to think that this man had to make a drama (albeit the best of dramas) to be recognized as the great director he is. I long for his next project.And to those few who hasn't seen it yet: please don't listen to your friends who didn't like it: think for yourselves!",10,1,2,24 January 2000
Die Hard," Setting the standards
","Die Hard and its sequels set some kind of standard for good action with minimum logical leaps. The first one is very good, better than the second but not quite as good as the third.I've always found Willis amusing, but these movies are the only ones where the explanation is readily at hand. Most other movies he has made are a drop down.",7,0,2,8 February 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Could be a different film
","I would have liked this film even more if it wasn't a sequel. It's a great sequel, it's actually better than the first and second Die Hard, but it kind of bugs me that it's John McClane again and not some other character. Then again, it would just be dumb to rename a character that is obviously McClane.I like the timing of this film. It never really stops, and I just loved the gag in the beginning, with McClane having to stand in Harlem with that sign. The interaction between Zeus and McClane is also a very good dynamic, they bounce off each other all the time.It works well. And I just loved the car chase...",8,0,0,8 February 2000
Con Air," Brainless and fun
","The idea is actually fairly original, I must say, but the imagination it takes to make a brainless but highly entertaining big buck movie out of it - well...I think anyone could have done the job correctly. This film is as fun as it is stupid, and does have some great moments: 'Why couldn't you put the bunny down?'With this dumb a script, directors always go for broke on great actors and wham-bang action. It's a well-known Hollywood recipe. They rarely work, but the past decade has seen a few fairly entertaining flicks that have no brains whatsoever. 'Armageddon' is one, 'Con Air' is definitely another.Do not watch of you don't like pointless violence and things blowing up. If you do, you might wanna watch this.",6,1,1,15 October 2000
The Green Mile," Three hours? I didn't notice
","Probably the best 3 hrs anyone can spend in a movie theater. There is not a moment in this film where I wasn't either on the brink of crying, laughing or laughing outright.The story is fairly simple and could easily have been made shorter. But it doesn't feel overlong in any way, much less boring or uninteresting. On the contrary. This is an Oscar film, worth at least four or five for best performances and for best picture and best script.I envy Stephen King for being able to think these stories up. I envy director Darabont for making them 'happen', and I sure as hell envy the cast for their fantastic portraits of the prison guards and the prisoners.Go see this film. I don't understand what you're made of if you don't like it.",10,1,2,13 February 2000
The Lion King," Disney's best ever.
","The 'Lion King' is the best animated film ever. There's simply no film to match it - beautifully made with details that just makes me shiver, especially the sequence where Mofasa is pushed from the cliff by Scar. Or when Simba sees the horde of wildebeest rushing towards him. Or the hilarious hyaenas- by far the funniest characters in a Disney film, along with Timon and Pumbaa.I have seen both the English and the Swedish version of 'The Lion King', and both work out fine. The voices are very good, and to 'cast' Jeremy Irons as Scar is just pure genius.I usually have a problem with Disney movies, mainly because they often twist and bend old stories and destroy them - 'Hercules' must be one of the worst films ever - but this one is way beyond that. It's original, it's gripping and maybe, just maybe, will there be another one like this...",10,0,0,27 January 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," In search of excellence
","The Shawshank Redemption never made it to the big screen in Sweden, at least not what I heard of. And I really can't understand why. It is excellent. It's a calm and unsettling story of a man's (Robbins) life in jail, of the friendship between him and his fellow lifer, Red (Freeman) and the disgusting life in a corrupt prison in the 50's and 60's. Excellent performances, great camera angles and one of the very best endings of any film.Stephen King wrote the story. Why should I be surprised? His novels and short stories make for great films - but most are turned into crap, like It. This one, however, is one of the best movies there is.",9,0,0,23 January 2000
Any Given Sunday," Grinding and powerful - why doesn't it quite work?
","'Any Given Sunday' is worthless to watch outside a movie theater. Don't rent it. The loud, continuous brawl of the movie is essential to the experience. The movie is great to watch because it is very powerful thanks to the clever, never-ending motion of the story, the characters and the very blended pictures, sounds and music. But the story isn't catching enough and the film is terribly overlong and over ambitious. A film of epic proportions like this one should have something more important to say. As an insight into the world of elite sports it's pretty interesting. But it just feels a bit unnecessarily over-wrought.",5,0,0,13 May 2001
Blade Runner," Director's Cut, please
","I voted only for the director's cut version. The original release is not half as good with the completely unnecessary narrative and the insipid happy-go-lucky ending. Set well into the 3rd millennium, a bunch of robots, Replicants return to Earth, where they're not allowed under penalty of death. Ford plays a tired, worn Blade Runner, a person who hunts the replicants down and kills them. Brilliant, dark with a calm that almost makes it a sci-fi drama rather than action. The question that drives the film is: is Deckard (Ford) a Replicant himself? The upcoming sequel with tell...",7,2,4,11 January 2000
Trainspotting," Scotland's most disgusting bunch
","If I were to elect one and only one film that truly deserves and lives up to the extreme hype that surrounded it, this is it. There is not a dull instant in this movie. The characters, the pounding music, the clever touches and the stupid, STUPID frame of mind that completely saturate every gesture and word, makes it one of the most entertaining films of the 90's.Forever classic is the baby in the ceiling, the incredible half-wit Spud and his glasses, Begbie and his erratic, violent behavior and the smart and classy Diane.I have never seen a better anti-drug flick: these guys are so awfully disgusting!Brilliant. Just brilliant.",9,0,2,6 August 2000
Speed," That's the way to do it
","Speed is a top-notch action movie, energetic like few and incredibly fast-paced, funny at some points and with a fairly original plot. Stealing the show, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper are really the main characters here, Keanu Reeves merely adds juice to the action - but he still performs very well, his usual wood-like appearance is eradicated by a clever story, quick turns and great visuals. 'Speed' does a great job of adding something new to the abundant flora of action flicks. Too bad that its reputation had to bee tainted by the rock-bottom sequel.",7,0,0,25 January 2001
The Sixth Sense," Not as wonderful as I had expected
","Sixth Sense is great. It gives you psychological thrills on a level that ordinary thrillers never reach up to. Goosebumps is the best single word to describe the sensation when a child tells his shrink that he sees dead people, walking around like regular people. Chilling. But I think something is missing. Once you get to realize that the kid actually sees dead people, when the fun is supposed to start - it abruptly ends. But the end is horrifying and quickly reinstates the position of this film as #2 film of the year 1999. #1 is of course The Matrix...",7,0,0,11 January 2000
Final Destination," Good idea gone wrong
","The basic plot is a very good and scary one, but the film is so-so. Which is sad, because I can imagine great dialogues, great scenes and a better ending with, for example, M. Night Shyamalan or someone else better suited for this type of film at the wheel. As it is, what is a very novel and good idea is turned into a shake 'n' bake teen horror popcorn flick, good for a 14' screen on a slow Saturday night. It wears itself out pretty quickly and the point of the film, which could have been very imaginative, is focused on killing off the kids as quickly and as haphazardly as possible. The funniest thing is that the story has perfect logic and sense, but the makers have overlooked it and done a slipshod job. I'm sorry they did. It could have been great.",4,5,9,22 January 2001
The Truman Show," Wonderful and funny
","'Truman Show' belongs to a breed of movies that are different, imaginative and funny. It's most famous cousin, 'Forrest Gump', was just as great to watch.Never liked Jim Carrey much. I just thought of him as an overrated clown whose movies were only rented and enjoyed by boyfriends who actually thought 'Cable Guy' would be entertaining for his girlfriend too. But he is perfect as Truman, the ultimate TV-series hero. I don't think anyone could have played the role better.The setup is fantastic, the idea soars high and will be hard to duplicate, and I hope we will be spared any sequels. In any event, the originality and sense of wonder that prevails here is hard to achieve - but 'Truman Show' really makes it.By the way, I think Ed Harris should be given greater roles. He's awesome.",10,0,0,7 February 2000
The Matrix," Brilliant aggressive spark of a movie
","Brilliant comic-book-style adventure action with extremely violent and estethically beautiful action sequences. Hacker Neo is pulled out from the Matrix, a computer program used by monstrous machines to control the human race and supply power, in order to save the world. Stylish gunfighting and martial arts in abundance - but with a story that bears and with an eye for NOT making it ridiculous. One of the best modern films ever.",10,1,2,10 January 2000
Heat," Epic saga with grandiose portraits
","This is probably the best film I have ever seen. The tale of big-time crooks and a lone, obsessed police officer in pursuit, wears a mask of calm and quiet, with some striking portraits. When all hell breaks lose in downtown L.A., the characters get to show just what they are all about - obsessiveness, weariness and plain old doggedness. Beautiful and brilliant.",10,1,2,10 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A true legend
","What more can be said about a film that has never released its grip on its audience, and that has become one of the most legendary films ever? Not much, but as a sci-fi fan, I have to voice my utter thankfulness that this film was realized. It has given millions of people two hours of the very best in space adventure drama. The classic theme of good versus evil in a wonderful movie filled with details and characters to set every sci-fi buff humming. It's magic. It's wondrous. And it's probably one of the most entertaining movies ever made, along with it's sequels. The 'Star Wars' saga is really a genre of it's own, it's hard to imagine how to compare it to anything else - it stands out from all the rest in an impressive way - no one has ever tried to make anything like it, and if they would, they wouldn't succeed.The stuff that dreams are made of...",8,2,3,12 January 2001
Thirteen Days," Gripping and fascinating
","A fascinating and very exciting dramatization of the events in the crisis that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Truth and drama are splendidly mixed and filmed with harsh straightforwardness. Artistic freedom is sure to have been taken, but it's hard to know where and to what degree - at any rate, the political advisor Kenny O'Donnell sure is one major hero in this film and I have heard some voices stating that he never played that pivotal a role. It doesn't really matter though. The Cuba crisis remains a great example of how potentially lethal (and global) conflicts can be resolved with the pen rather than the sword, and someone is sure to be a great hero. It is also interesting to note that the president of the USA is not always so in control of the might at his disposal. After all, he's only human.",7,0,0,8 October 2001
Tarzan," Best since The Lion King

Apollo 13," This is really some movie
","I can watch this film over and over. Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!Just the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.The performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.As Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.You can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable. Good job.",9,69,77,11 February 2000
The Thin Red Line," A painfully slow film
","I'm deeply disappointed. This film was said to contend with Saving Private Ryan - but it's nowhere near it when it comes to narration technique and flow. The Thin Red Line is excruciatingly slow-moving, like syrup. Few movies are duller than this one. Yes, the more poetic moments are nice and the cast perform very well - but when a film lacks momentum like this one, it just never takes off. It feels like six hours instead of almost three.And what's the point. Yeah, I see it, it's about the horrors of war and the meaninglessness of killing each other. But The Thin Red Line rather observes rather than points out, and this just adds to the dullness. I sure hope I won't have to see it again.",4,4,6,16 January 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The funniest ever made
","If I would have to elect the one single funniest movie ever, I wouldn't hesitate for a second. The answer would appear like a mirage in front of me and shine like the beacon on the castle Anthrax. It would be this film. And here's why:It is insane. There isn't a tale or a legend that isn't butchered in this mindless mess of a film - the poor b*****ds seeking the grail get to experience some pretty weird adventures on their quest.It is impossible to tell which scene is the funniest, as there is actually only one that goes on for just a tad too long (the one with the peasants gathering filth and explaining to king Arthur the fundamentals of anarchy), but even that scene is funny in some instances ('You can't become king just because some watery tart throws a sword at you!'). If I still should name something, it would have to be the French knights and their taunting....Excellent - if you can handle jokes with no intentions or explanations. Even the idiotic ending is somewhat funny.",10,0,0,13 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Second best in the saga
","With as much magic and inspiration as 'Star Wars', the sequel continues the wonderful saga. With the same effort, the same fascinating characters and the same fantastic vision, it's hard to fail. This one is even better than episode IV, but feels very much like a wait for episode VI, the very best in the saga. Still - it's inspiring, enlightening and entertaining to watch...over and over again.",9,0,0,12 January 2001
Gladiator," Ridley Scott is back
","There are several context to this movie: the art of war, the struggle for power in an impossibly large empire and the visual grandeur of the ancient Rome. Ridley Scott has put the emphasis on the visual and on the use of power and the use of the masses to sustain and control this power. Very clever, and 'Gladiator' is an exceptionally powerful film, albeit a bit overlong and even slow at some points.The visuals are fantastic, I couldn't really see anything that revealed the ancient Rome to be a model or a computer simulation. The war scene and the fighting scenes are amazing, my guess is that the brutality shown here is a bit meeker than what the real thing must have been - the Romans were the worst kind of barbarians, civilized and advanced and yet thirsty for blood. But then again, maybe that was Rome's way of keeping their enormous population in check? Give them spectacles, give them something to shout at, to focus their frustration and anger at - and be sure to point that away from the emperor's palace.'Gladiator' goes to considerable lengths to show how a weak emperor loses control over the crowds and how his vision of the empire crumbles before his eyes - this is all very well portrayed.",8,0,0,23 July 2000
Contact," Science kicks **s!
","To actually envision this idea was really incredible. But making it into a film of this magnitude is astounding. Scientific (despite some self-proclaimed scientist's boring yarns among the comments - I think Carl Sagan knew what he was doing when he acted as advisor while making the film) and a visual wonder.I love this film, partly because I love science fiction that is truly scientific and true to the world that we can see and envision today, and partly because the answer to the question of intelligent life will raise serious religous issues. This film works very well in both respects.A truly wonderful film, it carries information and thought better than most.",10,0,1,18 April 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best of the lot
","They don't make films like this anymore. It feels genuine, it feels solid and it feels adventurous in a way that no other film has been able to copy. I love the third Indiana Jones for several reasons - but the main one is: the feeling it evokes.The adventure film is a dying concept. The last one to date to really fit into the adventure-genre, 'Cutthroat Island', didn't work out very well. It had the right feeling, and I kind of liked it. But adventure doesn't really work these days.But with Indiana Jones, it's different. Indiana Jones is set in the perfect time (what other villains are better than nazis, evil Indians or just plain crooks?), has great timing and takes great care to assure that the adventure - i.e. traveling, meeting people, solving tricky problems and gaining something in the end - feels real. To do so, one needs humor (supplied by the animosity between Jones and his father, aptly played by Connery), magic (good ole Christian legends of eternal life) and a villain.The very best part of this film is when Jones faces Hitler and gets his autograph in his fathers notebook - at a book burning fest in Berlin... Great fun.",8,3,5,12 January 2000
Jurassic Park," Entertainment at its best
","Jurassic Park is an extremely entertaining film; it's fun, it's about dinosaurs and the special effects are very convincing. Apart from some major scientific faults (not Crichton's first, I assure you), this film is well worth the time.There is something of a saga over it, with the bombastic scenery and animals, and the sensitive music parading throughout the film. It's a fairly simple film, too, there being no real antagonists or protagonists - the animals just do what they do, no malice aforethought involved.After seeing it the first time, I was slightly angry with what has to be one of the most obvious sequel-teasers ever, but I guess there was no chance they weren't going to make a sequel (or two, as it is) - money corrupts artistry.",8,0,2,6 July 2000
High Fidelity," Fairly good
","'High Fidelity' is just the kind of film that gets haussed but is a bit disappointing - the problem is not the story, the humor, the actors or anything like that. The problem is identification. I cannot identify with the main character, and I wouldn't want to, because he is so slow-witted that he doesn't understand anything that doesn't have anything to do with himself. He is a pretty pathetic guy. But for entertainment, it's a pretty good film, with some amusing incidents and moments - but hardly worth all the fuzz.",5,0,1,6 March 2001
