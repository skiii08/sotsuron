The Blair Witch Project," If it's not a joke, it's a ripoff!
","This is a first rate scam and a classic example of using the internet to hype junk. The best thing about this whole deal is that it shows how easy it is for unethical advertising to influence people to part with their money. It's not scary and it's not funny. There is no acting, directing nor camera talent involved. Someone once noted that the character of a horror movie can be judged by how much you see of the monster. In this joke of a movie you never see the cause of (what passes for) the fright. The primary method used to instill tension is to bounce around with a hand held camera. Gosh, wish I'd thought of that technique! If you paid to see this, you've been had. At least I waited until it was on TV. I'm rating it a '1' because there is no '0'.Go see 'The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'. It's better.",1,3,8,8 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Not bad at all
","This is certainly more interesting than 'Predator II' or the final (?) 'Alien' resurrection. There are several plot holes (like the minutes thing noted above, and the absurd connection of the Julian/Gregorian calender to the Aztec -- 2004 just doesn't translate), but the basic plot makes sense. There is occasional plot weirdness, as when Stafford and his buds suddenly pull out their automatic weapons as soon as the hunter's armament appears in the crypt -- and why were they kept there, anyway instead of being carried in. But, in the main it plays.Lex (very well done by Ms. Lathan) might well be a lot irritated at the winners, having lost her entire team, and not all to the Big Slobber. I can't really see her explaining this to the cops when she gets back home: ('You ain't gonna believe this, guys.' 'Well, try us anyway, miss.') I thought there was going to be the same problem with 'Cursed' and that headless corpse on the kitchen floor, but they cleaned that right up. Too bad they could not have done something equitable here as well.There is some considerable difference between 'bad guys' and 'evil doers' and certainly the outcome is predictable. Getting there had to be more fun for the audience than for the characters.",6,1,2,10 February 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," What was this movie about?
","Yes, Ms. Jolie is hot. Maybe Pitt is as well, if you're tuned that way. But what else was it about? Two unnamed government agencies with elaborate murder squads? They don't exist. Marriage is hard if both lie a lot? Duh, yeah. The special effects guys get to blow sxxt up? Well, what's new about that? Humor/comedy? Not very. Pitt is not Cary Grant -- not even close.If he had 50-60 kills and she had 314 they must have kept the ammo manufacturers flush, given what lousy shots they were. And how did they get off the hook in the end? Did the sweepers just give up? The (non) ending totally destroyed whatever minimal credibility to which the plot might have aspired.I didn't like the movie a lot.",2,1,4,10 February 2006
