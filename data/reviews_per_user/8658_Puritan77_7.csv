The Benchwarmers," What a disasterpiece
","David Spade...what are you thinking! Here's a note: get new material. This movie wouldn't even of been funny with another script. John Heder was terrible, he did the same dorky crap as seen on Napolean Dynamite. And Rob...Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob...get a job or something. You're not funny! It's as if Hollywood put 3 actors in a room with nothing better to do, give them no motif what-so-ever and 15 minutes later, they had a movie. I know a lot of people liked Napolean Dynamite, but taking that character out of context into another film that had nothing to do with him, and have Heder play the exact same character is really lame.The Benchwarmers is one of the worst movies I've seen this year.",1,7,14,11 April 2006
Gravity," There Is No Wind In Space
","I finally got the chance to see Gravity the other night and I just wanted to share my thoughts on the movie and hopefully shed some light on the physics, CGI, plot and acting throughout.The opening scene of the film, George Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is seen rapidly moving all over the ISS (International Space Station) un-tethered while suited in an MMU (Manned Maneuvering Unit). He begins to make formal talk with Sandra Bullock's character (Ryan Stone) and then proceeds to talk about a party he went to in Mardi Gras. Now, I'm not astronaut, but I highly doubt one would feel obligated to reflect on a night out on the town while on a space walk, un-tethered. Sanrda Bullock's character was nothing but a klutz. NASA would never have chosen her as a mission specialist given her unrelenting emotional behavior. She was constantly messing things up (mind you her character only had 6 months training) and constantly needed Clooney to help her out. Clooney was nothing but a smartass full of clichés and bad acting all around. It's almost as if his mind was still in the green screen room and not in space. He's an actor, he's been in many films. Acting would have been nice here.All of the sudden, debris hits the robotic arm and spins Bullock out of control. She eventually gets flung off into space, at a rapid speed. There's one small problem here, that is impossible. NASA procedure during an EVA (Extra-vehicular Activity) requires the astronaut to have a SAFER, which is a small self-contained propulsive backpack system used in case of emergency only. If the astronaut would drift off, it provides free-flying mobility, adjusts roll, pitch and yaw, making possible for the astronaut to return to the spaceship safely. She didn't have one.Lets talk a little about the physics in Gravity, shall we? At one point in the film, a chute opens on the capsule while in orbit and spreads all over the ISS causing a chain reaction of disaster. This is also impossible. The chute, in reality, would not have opened, It would have stayed in tact. You know why? There is NO WIND IN SPACE.Sandra Bullock then begins to run out of Oxygen, and breathes on nothing but carbon dioxide for over 5 minutes. She would have been dead and the movie would have ended (which is what I was hoping). Sandra Bullock's character manages to get inside the ISS after releasing Clooney's character, who eventually dies. The were holding onto each others' hands, what invisible force pushed Clooney away from the rest of everything in that orbit? Oh yea, nothing did because there was no force. At all. After she gets inside the capsule, a fire starts and ignites on...nothing. It spreads as if the entire capsule was emerged in WD-40. This couldn't happen either, because OXYGEN IS NOT A FUEL HENCE IT IS NOT FLAMMABLE.Bullock manages to get on the Chinese station, where she begins to read an instruction manual for re-entry the size of a DVD instruction booklet. Using only pictures. Thank God during her 6 months of training she manages to squeeze a little Soyez training in there as well. She is seen frantically pushing random buttons while actually saying out loud 'eenie, meenie, miney, ...mo!'. She is supposed to be a mission specialist, not a clumsy emotional nitwit with the brain capacity of a mentally retarded monkey with cerebral palsy. Then, over the radio, she hears the sound of someone talking, then the voice starts to play around with her and you can hear barking, so she starts howling and barking like a dog back at whoever was on the radio. She re-enters the atmosphere unfastened and barefoot. The re-entry capsule had a 60 second countdown. This is also false because almost everything during a EVA has an override in the event of a de-orbit emergency. Apparently not in Gravity.So, lets talk about how this movie made almost $300,000,000 in a few months. Apparently there are either a lot of idiots out there or someone hacked the IMDb database and gave it high ratings. It's very sad to see such mediocrity being praised and tainting our collective unconscious with garbage. If you want to see a good space flick, I recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey and/or Apollo 13. 2001 came out in 1968 and it's still light years ahead of Gravity. The acting in Apollo 13 is as good as it gets. I happen to think Gravity is the worst movie ever made, of all time in any genre anywhere. I used to have Troll 2 reigning at the #1 spot for worst movie of all time, but I think I just made an exception with Gravity to take it over.If you don't believe me, see it for yourself if you haven't already.Thanks to nysalesman on IMDb for a really good review as well.",1,64,115,29 December 2013
Blades of Glory," How hard can acting be?
","Two skaters, Two bad actors, and 1 terrible script = Blades Of Glory. I have thought a LOT of times when I see a terrible movie, that it is definitely the worst movie ever made...well, after watching this, I now have a new #1. Will Ferrell's character does something out of the ordinary in this film, he likes to get drunk...wow who would have thought? Chazz Michael Michaels???, wow I'm thinking Will Ferrell came up with that all by himself. Everything he said was pure idiocy and far from funny, same goes for Heder. John, listen man, YOU ARE NOT FUNNY! Most of the people in the theater left before it was half over, leaving only a handful of people who were mostly sleeping or passed out from boredom. I fell asleep once and had a nightmare that someone was throwing shards of glass in my eyes, then I woke up and the movie was still going, then I silently started weeping to myself because it wasn't a nightmare at all, it was a comforting dream, the real nightmare was on the screen in front of us. I don't see how people involved in something like this can make large amounts of cash, and just like this movie, it's pointless. To save everyone time and money DON'T SEE THIS! Or, you can have the same affect at home like you just watched it. Go to the corner and stare at the wall for 2 hours, then take $10 out of your wallet and use it for toilet paper.",1,30,62,10 April 2007
Empire of the Sun," You'll never see another film like this again...
","What can I say? I first saw this film In 1988, I was 11 years old. I don't know what it was about the movie that intrigued me so much at that age, but it was my favorite movie to watch and still is to this very day. Empire of the Sun is probably Spielberg's best film, without a doubt. The cinematography in this film is astounding. Everything is real, no CGI to throw the reality off in the mind which makes this movie so moving. I don't know how Spielberg filmed half of this movie, all I can say is 'a LOT of time!'.Empire of the Sun is a very emotional film, and all aspects of being a prisoner of war are very detailed. John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano had outstanding performances in this film, not to mention Christian Bale's performance was just uncanny for his age. Spielberg captured extremely graceful frames in this film, and we will probably never see that ever again in a movie. Empire of the Sun is an extraordinary film and is a definite must see.",10,6,13,6 April 2006
The Dark Knight," Growling...really?
","Cons: Since when did Batman talk like Cookie Monster? I couldn't even understand what Bale was saying half of the time. Seriously, there's a difference between hiding your real voice and Cannibal Corpse try-outs. The plot was terrible, and they 'modernized' Gotham City. Sonar and Cell Phones, now he can see like a BAT! Really? They didn't even show how and why he could see in the dark using the 'pre-made' sonar capable bat mask. You've GOT to be kidding! Then there's the ending, which seemed to me like a huge rush of different movie clips they had saved for outtakes and random lines that, absolutely, had no real meaning, just sentence fragments of what has happened and what will happen. Batman isn't supposed to be looked at like a cop killer, which is what the ending basically insinuated. They ruined Batman, and our culture is eating this crap movie up like imported chocolate.Pros: I did, on the other hand, love how Christopher Nolan hardly used any CGI in the film, which brought realism to the action sequences. CGI is ruining films and it's great to finally watch one with 'real' objects being destroyed. The only great thing this movie had going for it was Heath Ledger by a long shot, he carried and stole the show in every aspect. At times, he reminded me of Brandon Lee. Truly Epic.R.I.P.",1,3,12,22 July 2008
Grindhouse," Grindhouse - Hit and Miss
","This could easily be the movie of the year in itself with no advertisements, yet it will be hard to get a crowd that doesn't leave the theater when Planet Terror is over thinking the movie was over...which is what happened at the theater I went to. Almost half of the people got up and left, which is probably going to hurt the films income in the theater due to many people thinking it was a short film,  Or maybe they've seen the movie already and just came for Planet Terror! Who knows, both features were excellent, including screenplay, plot outline and both acting and directing. I can safely say I liked Planet Terror a lot more than Death Proof in many ways.Planet Terror: This feature had everything you would ever want in a fast paced, up-to-date, horror film. Blood, Guts, Missing Brains, Bubbling Flesh, and Bruce Willis being in control, as usual, all make it a perfect Saturday night at the movies. Rose McGowan scorches the screen and Freddy Rodriguez went flawless in every scene he was in. Marley Shelton's best role by far, as she was stunning and I can't forget Michael Biehn, who I've been a fan of ever since Aliens. His character was the highlight of Planet Terror, he fit his role perfectly. The acting all in all was so good and the directing was so precise in this feature, I didn't want it to end at all. There were many little 'quirks' that kept the audience laughing and on edge off and on the entire film, at perfect times. Plenty of excitement, great one-liners and insane special effects make this feature worth seeing by itself. This was a definite Hit!Death Proof: This feature starts off decent, but slowly loses the audience due to many minutes of pointless dialog with absolutely nothing happening to take interest to. Death Proof itself would be a great movie to watch and just that, but I think that the audience still wanted more excitement after watching Planet Terror, that we didn't expect it to slow down as much as it did. But at any rate, it picks up at the end and the chase scenes were spectacular alone, well worth the 45 minutes of boredom for the end to finally take place, and it does with a bang. Zoe was the highlight of this feature hands down, she is an amazing actress and an even better stunt devil. Some of the things she was doing were kind of pointless but it's WHAT she was doing that was exciting to watch, and that goes without saying Kurt Russell's performance was great, as usual, very good acting and he played his part perfectly. I can't think of anyone that could have played that role better. Although there were some parts in this feature that were incredible, most of it was pointless, and sadly enough, I thought that Death Proof could have gone a lot better, so it was a Miss.I recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of gore, action, comedy, hot chicks, explosions, zombies and pure adrenaline. It was a spectacular film and worth the 2 hour drive we took to go see it and I aim to see it again next week when it comes to my town.",10,4,8,9 April 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The End Of The World
","This movie is a perfect example of how the end of the world is near. I would rather stare at tree bark for 2 hours than to ever watch this worthless movie ever again. I can't believe how many people actually found this movie decent let alone label Will Ferrell a genius. Come to think of it, I don't think he's ever made me laugh. 'HELP ME BABY Jesus!' <-- That's funny how? His acting is terrible and he acts like an idiot and other people love it. Brace yourself when you watch this movie, because you will think of all the other older funny movies that you love so much that will never be made ever again because crap like this keeps emerging to idiots all over the planet. It just goes to show you don't have to be talented, smart, or funny to be successful in Hollywood.",1,38,75,6 January 2007
