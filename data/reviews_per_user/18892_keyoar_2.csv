The Blair Witch Project," Interesting trip into the psyche of the young film makers and their meeting with the unknown.
","I think this movie is way over hyped. Yes, it is a brand new spin on the horrow genre and yes the idea is unique, but that doesn't necessarily make this a great movie. Out of the 87 minutes, about 15 are just downright creepy, and the other 72 minutes kind of leave you asking for more, or atleast what the trailers and the website promises. It is very refreshing though to see a good movie actually scaring you without using gory effects or grotesque computer imagery. This one lets your imagination do the work, and work it does! But after I was done watching, I really felt like there was something missing in this otherwise wonderfully put together film.",7,1,2,25 July 1999
Toy Story 2," A great sequel
","This has to be by far one of the cleanest and most well-designed movie to come from any studio for a while now. The plot is trim and concise and this film is not just for kids, there are plenty of grown-up themes to satisfy even critical viewers. The animation is tremendous, especially if you pay attention to the details, and the cameo from Geri and the underlying Star Wars spoofs are just great. All in all, one of the best films I've seen to date. Just one disappointment, no outtakes during the credits. But still, I don't think I'll forget this one for a while, if you get a chance to see it in the cinemas don't miss it...",10,77,92,24 November 1999
