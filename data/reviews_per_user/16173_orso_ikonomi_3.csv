E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Commercial and Overrated
","I have seen this movie twice.The first time was when I was a kid and it was a lot of fun. The second time as an adult it merely irritates me with its clich√©s and cheesy sentimentalism. Movies like this seem to rely on the stereotypes we have about aliens. A flying disc,a creature with big head,2 eyes ,long neck . The score of J.Williams is awful. If not for the camera work and some effects this movie would have been a B-movie. Its ridiculous how this movie is so highly regarded by so many people! I doubt if todays kids will find this movie entertaining or funny. Its dated and brainless.even for kids. I find this the worst movie that S.Spielberg have ever made.",2,8,22,27 December 2007
Evil Dead II," Those who rate this above 5 are seriously lobotomised
","The first Evil Dead was a good film but this one they ruined it with the slapstick unfunny humour.not scary
not funny
pointless gimmicks
a truly low IQ effortSam Raimi is a retarded child.",1,1,17,2 March 2019
V for Vendetta," not so great
",its particularly odd that so many people have rated so highly this movie. and most remarkably is disappointing to see how so many people consider this movie has a profound message. Although it doesn't suffer from a technical point of view .most of the scenes are well shot etc.where it completely fails is on the political and philosophical ideas on which the heroes stands for.You can kill and eliminate as many cops and other state officials you want as long as you are convinced that your ideas are the right ones.(and only those).Obviously the government thinks the same about their ideals . so each side legitimates their atrocities by claiming the right of their deeds.although obviously the herd is on the side of V in the end(because the director and the producer decided so - and because they know that most of the spectators are adherent to a good vs evil mentality -they make it easier for them to pick a side.,5,4,9,13 July 2008
