The Equalizer," Let me give you an accurate review (Somewhat of a Spoiler)
","Denzel is by far my favorite actor, so my rating is a tad biased in that regard. Even so, I thought this movie was awesome, but a slightly above average compared to such Denzel movies as Remember the Titans, Malcolm X, Antwone Fisher, & Training Day. The majority of Denzel movies are action thrillers, and this was no exception. There are generally 2 main complaints with this movie: 1). Too violent and 2). The supporting actress did not have enough air-time. A milder 3rd complaint is lack of story.I might agree with the supporting actress having lack of airtime, as she was pivotal and crucial to the story, and pretty much went away after 30 minutes. The problem was that this was an old man rescuing a young woman, and I'm sorry but we can't have 60-year old Denzel falling in love with a 20-year old - it just doesn't work; so the only route is protecting her as a father would. When that role is played, it becomes more like Taken, where we don't really see the supporting actress though she is pivotal to the story.So, how about violence? Well, it is violent, but there were certainly moments where it could have gone to the extreme. It isn't anything new to Denzel, but you have to understand that the whole theme of Bob McCall is someone trained as a killer, so he will do things to survive and make him seem ridiculously violent, so as to send the message that he is not to be messed with. It is violent, but necessary for the portrayal of his character.The story complaint I sort of agree with. I started out fantastic, but towards the middle it just felt like it jumped to a completely new story. If they had given us a little more explanation of the bad guys, maybe their story or something, even a small snippet, it might have been OK, but all the stories seemed like they were supposed to be connected, but they did not come across that way in the end product.The dialog between Bob McCall and Alena, as well as McCall and the french gang leader are clearly the high spots of the movie. Denzel still gives a great performance throughout and is as captivating as any other Denzel movie.It is not the best Denzel movie ever, and probably not the best Denzel action movie ever, but it is intense & suspenseful, and i was glued to my seat for the entire movie.",7,1,5,27 September 2014
Shakespeare in Love," Not exactly Shakespearean, but entertaining
","The movie is highly entertaining for the first hour, but there a few problems in the 2nd: Colin Firth sounds like Colin Firth always does--basically Mr. Darcy 2.0--His character and tone had never changed in 10 years until he was cast in the King's Speech. Here is where my biggest problem lies: Joseph Fiennes sounds like a Shakespearean play, even when he is not meant to be performing the play in the movie. Gwyneth Paltrow is boring, and her Shakespearean performance at the end is not dramatic at all, and very poorly done--clearly ruined the ending of what could have been spectacular. I know we do Shakespeare a certain way now; but who knows if that is how Shakespeare wanted it done back then. Many records indicated he went by Bill, not Will.Great Script, film had great acting for the first half, and felt like everyone got lazy for the second half of the film.",7,1,2,11 March 2015
Interstellar," Have you ever wanted to watch a movie, take a nap in the middle of it, and wake up towards the end, and not really miss anything? If so, this is the movie for you!!
","Some people are giving this poor reviews based on the fact that it's fiction. That itself is preposterous. A movie can be fiction and still be great. However, this movie is not a case of great fiction. In short, brilliant concept, poorly directed, poorly executed, poorly acted; The father and daughter had a couple decent acting moments, but that's it. I thought the first hour really set up the end and displayed the emotion. The next hour and a half was a complete waste of time, that made no sense plot-wise, and had absolutely nothing to do with the story. I got reeled back in towards the end with a nice idea, the problem is they didn't explain the how of the ending at all, and spent 30 minutes setting up what looked like an unnecessary sequel that I do not want to watch, and didn't answer the questions I wanted answered in the first place.",4,3,7,16 November 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Best movie of year, snubbed at Oscars
","This is hands-down one of the best movies I have ever watched. Leto's amazing, McConaughey's amazing. A wonderful story that drags you through personal emotion and conflicts that resonate with today's society. Beautifully directed, brings up controversial subjects in regards to law-making authorities as well as gender issues. I don't have any more words to describe this movie, it really sells itself. The setting remains true to the theme of the movie. My only concern is the validity/truthfulness of the story in terms of how he accomplished his requested task. I believe this should have won over 12 Years a Slave because 12 years was supposed to be emotionally gripping, and I didn't sense that from those actors; but I did with DBC.",10,1,1,12 September 2014
Prisoners," A suspense thriller that keeps you watching
","Film was brilliantly directed. A little on the violent side, but not as sickening as the Saw movies. A great story, but the only complaint you might see is that the story has been done before in some regards - it is a kidnapping story. That said, I'm OK as long as it's not direct plagiarism, isn't the same characters (i.e. Taken, Taken 2), and is well-directed and well-acted, which is certainly true in this case. I think Jackman somewhat underplayed his role, while Gyllenhall played the part perfectly. It left you with some questions at the end, and some parts were nostalgic clich√© moments that just felt out of place. Outside of these minor problems, the story is insanely suspenseful and has you glued to your seat, so this is a great movie.",8,0,1,12 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Brilliant film, but was not best movie of year
","Well-directed, well-narrated, well-acted, awesome story, keeps you watching throughout; I only have one problem: too much sex. Movies nowadays have become one of the few places that are OK to show off nudity outside of porn; but there is a level that takes it from artistic to uncomfortable, and that was my feeling here. Some may say it degrades women, but the truth is that rich Wall Street execs do attract women who do actually do that. Not all women are like that, but some are, in particular gold diggers. Nonetheless, they could have portrayed this without so much explicit content (although I guess I'd have to say I have seen more explicit). Overall feeling, is if you have kids, even under 18, don't watch it with them around; but otherwise if you're a mature adult and want a quality movie, then I would recommend.",9,1,3,12 September 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Philosophically Confusing
","This movie basically comes right out and tells you it is a philosophical movie. the only problem? Nobody understands any of the metaphors or other philosophical musings. The movie is intense and aided by intense performances by Ed Norton & Michael Keaton, and we kind of got the gist that Keaton & Norton were theater performers; Keaton was formerly a star of a highly successful hero movie. The One takeaway I got was that the human race is highly susceptible to stupid story lines as long as the movie has cool special effects, and that actors can always return to that role if they are down on their luck. I'm not really sure where they were going with that, because they could have easily portrayed that without a philosophically jumbled confusing movie. Emma Stone was a good fit for the role of Keaton's daughter-- but had no place being the love interest of a twice-her-age Ed Norton. It was OK for Norton to be the creep hitting on her, but not OK for her to be willing and ready--that just doesn't make sense. Somehow, the actors still captivated my attention at times, but the movie is so hard to follow, I still don't know if I know what it's about. Basically, this is a horrible script that happened to get good actors along the way.",6,1,4,11 March 2015
