Deja Vu," Incredible !!!
","This film was incredbile . To be honest -I missed the first 10 min,but was enough 5 minutes to be captive from Denzel's acting mastery.The movie was quite interesting,so new genre ,it has many elements that other 'time playing' movies don't have.The acting was quite nice,my mother was crying on some scenes.Many laughs while serious crime investigation.I think in the end i was about to mourn ,but I know every Denzel's movie is great-i was expecting something similar from him,but not from movie - at once action,crime,drama,sci-fi,thriller.I'm not sci-fi fan ,but Denzel was the reason to came in the cinema .I think everyone has to watch it.For me there this is the best since Lord of War last year.I'm gonna buy them both for the collection. Highly recommend ,my vote is 9",9,0,1,7 January 2007
