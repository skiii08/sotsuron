Sucker Punch," WTF is this movie about?
","Can anybody tell me what was this movie about? And how it's possible it has 6/10? I've lost 2 hours of my life seeing one of the most pointless movie I've ever seen. It's a chaotic mix of multiple genres and bad cgi effect and there is no story at all. It's like a ugly cake with an awful inside, or better with nothing inside. The plot is comparable to nothing, if a friend will ask me to quickly tell him what is this movie I'd have some serious problems describing. Do a favor to yourself and skip this movie, it's a total waste of time. The other movies this director made were good just because he followed exactly the steps of the original story, like 300 and Watchmen. I hope he understood he made a great mistake with this one",1,5,13,23 December 2013
Alexander," so bad
","How can you make a movie about Alexander the great with such a bad outcome, when Stone had simply to follow the books of Manfredi. Of course the first mistake was to do one movie, with so much to tell they had to rush.Too bad, such a wasted opportunity",1,1,2,28 May 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," give it a try
","I can't understand why such low rating and bad review, compared to a lot of movies of the Marvel-DC bunch I found this much more interesting. But I suggest to who haven't watch it cause of the bad reviews to see the ultimete edition, because in the cinema version a lot of important scene had been cut off to shorten the movie",10,13,18,19 January 2018
