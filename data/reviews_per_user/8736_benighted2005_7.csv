Insidious: Chapter 2," Sequel to the best horror film I have seen
","The Insidious Series has something not a lot of horror films have had and that is a creative curiosity arousing storyline. The first Insidious was one of the most riveting films I have seen. It shook the very foundation of my understanding of my senses and truly showed me what my body is to do and how it is to react to FEAR. Maybe I have never known Fear the way i did after watching Insidious. Insidious 2 takes off from where the first one left but the overall effect is short of being called overwhelming. Yes, it is definitely scary and more or less in the same prose but I couldn't help feel this isn't James Wan at his best. Having said that, the rating on IMDb is perfect right now for the film. It is still many notches more scary than anything else I have seen released recently.The Conjuring and Insidious remain his best films with this at third. James Wan has opened up the horror genre for me the way Walking Dead opened up the zombie genre. So this is what the world has come to :)",7,0,1,9 December 2013
Don Jon," BRILLIANT?
","I have seen it three times. One of my personal favourites.
Entertaining, real and overall it has a narrative of its own.",8,1,1,31 December 2019
Forrest Gump," Larger than comprehension allows..
","I've written over two hundred reviews, I never wrote one for this film. I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role. I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.Forrest Gump is special. In a weird way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldn't want anybody rushing to see me.The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is comparable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.My favorite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny 'Cause you're my girl' , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says 'I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now', Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too. This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen. I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much.",10,1,5,20 August 2006
Hugo," Quite an ordinary plot blown way outta proportion in a boring manner.
","I expected a lot before watching this film but was a bit shocked that I found it sincerely boring. To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and very selective.Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.I have a sinking feeling that Martin Scorsese thinks he nailed crime/drama films after 'The Departed' and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - Shutter Island for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)",6,1,3,19 February 2012
Man on the Moon," Brilliant Humor
","The first half an hour of this film shocked me cause I was in tears laughing because of how untamed the humor content is. I couldn't believe this kind of humor was unleashed at an unsuspecting audience watching this film. Jim Carrey is the most underrated actor in the world and No, I didn't like Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind because it is the opposite of what Man On The Moon is all for.You see, Eternal Sunshine just might be the most conscious semi dark heartful effort ever. All in all, it's consciousness is what makes it 'everything that is wrong with our world'. Man On The Moon is not for one second taking itself too seriously. I've always been a fan of Carrey but it is Man On The Moon that made me realise that there is no higher level of acting than this. THIS IS EASILY HIS BEST PERFORMANCE.Man On The Moon has the most extraordinary of beginnings and the story relation is different yet captivating and it doesn't make you wanna be anywhere else for one second. Based on the life of Andy Kaufman, this film manages to recreate the life of an extraordinary man. Many people felt Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman. The level and kind of humor this film contains is not meant to be understood by an average movie go'er. Between the 41st minute and 91st minute the film goes into an enjoyable dull period where most actions by Andy have no explanation.I hate Bongo drums but I cannot believe anyone can possibly sound better on them than Andy in the film. The reason the casting of this film is perfect is because Jim Carrey has one big heart for a comedian. Andy's funeral was the most touching scene in the film and almost a tearjerker.I'm trying really hard to explain what it was about this film that touched my heart but I cannot quite get there because my comprehension fails me. Watch this film to know what I'm experiencing.",10,1,2,29 August 2006
Midsommar," WHAT A PRIVILEGE TO WATCH SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNTIUDE.
","I saw the trailer for 30 seconds and it was all I needed to know that I should watch this film. It however is nowhere indicative of the might of this film. It is a journey like no other, a complete departure from our lives. The colours, sets, humans, sunsets, plants, trees, dances are dazzling to watch. Midsommar is nourishing to the soul. I expected to see a horror film with ghosts but what I saw a completely alien rendition delivered with such disconnectedness, it was absolutely beguiling. I have not read interpretations of the end. An hour into this film, I realised the next country I will travel to will be..",9,7,10,7 October 2019
Joker," Painful.
","This is a painfully drawn out film about a person suffering from severe emotional trauma. It is difficult to watch - unmoving and overall trifling. In simple terms, my wife dragged me for it. I would never have watched. I am surprised people loved it. Maybe they are paying homage to the lineage of films and so on.JP is a great actor. He takes his roles seriously. But I won't mind never seeing another film featuring him. He should be a stage actor in 1882. Bye.",5,6,25,14 October 2019
