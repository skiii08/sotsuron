Insidious: Chapter 2," Steaming Pile Of Turd
","Just got back from the cinema and I have to say I was completely disappointed with Insidious 2. I really enjoyed the first chapter so was looking forward to the sequel as it had all the same cast and crew. All I can say is more of the same, they used exactly the same scare tactics and even used some of the same jump moments (without giving away spoilers) it doesn't work the 2nd time round.I strongly recommend not watching this as the story is rubbish, the acting just about bearable and the jumps didn't work for me. just not at all scary.1/10 (only because i couldn't rate it lower)",1,17,32,1 October 2013
