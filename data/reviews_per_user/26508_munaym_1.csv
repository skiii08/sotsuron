It," A must-see for all horror lovers!
","I barely rarely see movies the night they come out but I had to see IT. IT was amazing. I wouldn't call it terrifying but I don't feel it needed to be now that I have watched the movie. The only way I can describe this movie is smash mouth in your face no holds barred clown terror with an absurd amount of humour. Great movie, great acting, great feel. Don't assume that if it doesn't scare you then it won't be good because it is good.. It is really good!",10,7,18,7 September 2017
