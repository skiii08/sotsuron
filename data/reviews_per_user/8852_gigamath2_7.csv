Source Code," Fun movie written by screenwriter who flunked physics
","I give this movie a seven because I must admit it kept my attention and was well acted/edited. However, although I realize this is just escapist lore, I think the 'science' behind the time loop could have been better explained. One thing I noticed that, although he is cascading from one parallel universe to another, with each one being slightly different, the identity of the villain never changes. Also, how does the controller know that the returning controllee is the same entity that originally went on the mission? Nevertheless, as pure entertainment, and if one allows oneself to release everything learned in Physics 101, it's worth seeing.",7,1,2,10 April 2011
The Natural," A classic masterpiece in film
",I am not going to sit here and write witty prose about The Natural.  I'm just going to write that this film is one of the finest I have seen in any genre.  I have seen this film perhaps 60 billion times. I just finished watching it again. It strikes a chord as fresh today as in 1984.  An uplifting and wholesome film with a strong but simple message about the backbone of America.  Redford's best film.  A brilliant American film masterpiece.,10,0,1,28 February 2003
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Magical Cinematic Masterpiece
","I lost the perception that I was sitting in a chair in a theater, riveted to the screen. 10 out of 10. A rarity...in which state of the art special effects are actually complemented with solid effortless acting. No wonder...the cream of unmatched British thespians are in control of this franchise, which in any other case would have simply been a sterile FX romp. What a once in a lifetime opportunity for the film industry to pull of a success like this. It doesn't matter if the screenplay leaves out significant parts of the original book. The film stands firmly on its own merit. And what a feather in Warner's cap to have this one in its vaults. What creativity and film magic. It makes me want to drop everything and go to film school. There has been nothing remotely like this film. A masterpiece right out of the blue...like magic.",10,2,4,19 November 2010
2012," Another Predictable Film (SPOILERS)
","A screenwriter friend of mine once told me that there are only five basic plot lines that are recycled from film to film. This one uses all five but still falls flat in the thespian department. Danny Glover needs to return to acting school as does the rest of the caricatures and stereotypes that cast this special effects festival. I think that I found myself laughing more than not, expecting to be awestruck but actually left with thoughts about going back to the snack bar for a hot dog. I was however entertained by the stupendous special effects. If it were not for them, this film would be classified a comedy. I especially howled at the look on the face of the chicken nearing decapitation. Nevertheless, the technology kept this soon-to-be-an-amusement park ride from being a total loss. I give it a 10 for technology and a 0 for plot and acting, which averages to a 5. There will be of course the obligatory action figure toys for sale at Christmass.",5,0,3,15 November 2009
Paranormal Activity," Sleeper of the year-A brilliantly executed ghost horror masterpiece yielding gasps from the packed theater.
","I was in the packed theater after driving more than my usual distance for a movie. The distribution was mystifyingly limited but I found a venue nevertheless. Psychologically, the movie is extremely intense and children should not be allowed. I was impressed with the use of deep, loud, low frequency sound in the soundtrack as a tool to reinforce a feeling of dread in the audience. Brillian and simple. Gasps and shrieks from the audience during the creepiest scenes. It instilled a tingling sensation in the spine. I just cannot explain it. If you like horror, go see this film. It will be copied. See it on a dark rainy night but don't go alone. Huge.",10,3,8,11 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An historical achievement in cinematic history. A visual tsunami.
","A spectacular visual tsunami. Magical. Magnificent. Breathtaking. Overwhelming. Riveting. Unforgettable. Amazing. Canonical. A new level. In a class by itself. The audience went wild, completely absorbed with the events transpiring on the screen. Just showing up at the theater was an event. Just standing in line to get into the theater was as entertaining as most films. I never saw so many people focused on one thing.Multiple Oscar nominations are deserved: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, visual effects, sound, editing, acting. The storyline combined with the state of the art visuals combined with the stirring John Williams musical score makes this picture something to be seen and heard. This film will make hundreds of millions of dollars. The double trilogy ends with fireworks. I am sad that its over.",10,1,7,22 May 2005
Signs," Creepy
","I would watch this film all over again just to re-experience the feeling I had in the pit of my stomach.  This was the creepiest sci-fi/thriller film (with the possible exception of Se7en) I have ever seen and I have been watching them for 45 years.  There are a number of creepy scenes:  (1) the claustrophobic scene which takes place in the closet of the Hess home, with the Hess family hunched over the television watching news footage of an alien invader - tres creepy, (2) the scene in which a dark form appears suddenly on the roof of the Hess barn in the camera's peripheral vison -- very creepy, (3) the sheer isolation of the Hess farmhouse -- creepy, (4) the isolation of Father Hess in the vet's home with an alien locked in the pantry -- stomach churning creepy, (5) the alien radio transmission on the baby monitor -- baby-stealing creepy.  This film relies upon one device to maintain the thrill:  an isolated person surrounded by an unseen dark force that doesn't reveal itself.  The trick in making an effective monster/thriller flick - don't show the monster much and keep the special effects to a minimum becuase they're not needed and can be counter-productive.  Just compare the original The Haunting to its remake to see this fact. Super super film.",10,0,3,12 August 2002
