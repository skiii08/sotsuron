The Blair Witch Project," The sociology of IMDb user comments
","I've looked at reviews for lots of movies on IMDb, but this one appears to take the cake as far as polarising people's opinions. It's either complete crap or complete genius. And there are 3066 user comments, so it seems to force people to say something about it! I wonder which movies have more user comments than that? Anyway, I watched this on DVD at night alone, so I guess I set it up that it would scare me. And that fact that I had to go to IMDb the day after to see what other people thought about it is testimony to the fact that it stayed with me. It helped having the filmmakers' commentary track on it to put it back into perspective, though. Clever idea. I wonder how much the actors knew about in the final scene though, 'cause the commentary says the actors didn't know they were going to the house and then the crew decks them when they get to the basement - we don't see them on film/video, so we have to assume the actors didn't either. The actors must have really trusted those guys!",Null,1,2,26 February 2005
The Favourite," The Talented Mr Ripley in period costume
","Contrary a lot of reviews here, I found this film strangely familiar. At the end, which - also contrary to a lot of reviews here I found to be perfectly satisfactory - I realised I had the same feeling I had at the end of The Talented Mr Ripley and indeed I felt like I'd just watched pretty much the same story with the same feel at the same moments, with the same kind of sour after-taste. Finally, also contrary to a lot of reviews here, did not find this film particularly 'weird'; it seemed merely to set out to shock on occasion, but within its own parameters. Have none of these reviewers ever seen a movie by David Lynch or Darren Aronofsky? Kudos to the costumes and acting though, particularly Olivia Colman.",6,1,3,12 January 2019
