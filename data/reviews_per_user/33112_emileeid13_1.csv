Changeling," About the movie
",One of Angelina's best performances and one of the best movies I've ever seen and the music was so movie but what i actually liked the most in this film was Angelina's performance she made me cry . i give it a 10 * and if you liked this movie you should watch GIA . Well when i finished the movie and got back home i gave my mom a big hug . Anyway the directing was a masterpiece and thank to Angelina the movie was brilliant and absolutely strangely moving i would watch it over and over .And Jolie deserved the Oscar for this role that was really a gorgeous and attractive way to see how much a mother loves her sun i wanted to see the movie the minute i saw the trailer,10,6,8,18 April 2009
