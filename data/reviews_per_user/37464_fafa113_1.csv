Requiem for a Dream," worth the 400 mile drive
","On October 27, 'Requiem' was still only playing in 3 cities nationwide, but a friend and I really, really wanted to see it.  The nearest city was Santa Monica, so around 3 that Friday afternoon we left from Cupertino, drove fast, got there at about 8, caught the 9:15 showing, left at around midnight, and got back home around 6 Saturday morning.  A long drive for a film, but it was worth every second.  There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said; just that pretty much everything you've heard is probably true, including that it's definitely more style and substance, but also that it was one of the most incredible films I've ever seen.  I could rave for hours about it (and I have), so I won't let myself get started.  It's a harrowing experience but if you can take it, SEE IT.  Easily the best film of 2000.",Null,0,0,14 January 2001
