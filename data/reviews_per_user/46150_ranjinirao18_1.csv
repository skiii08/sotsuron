Mission: Impossible III," Last in the MI series for me
","I felt this 3rd in the MI series left a lot to be desired as compared to the previous 2. I love movies where the plot and the story line challenges the intellect and makes you think about the movie for a long time after you have left the cinema. MI 3 begins with a scene that shocks you and sets your expectation for a great plot, but somewhere between Tom Cruise reluctantly accepting this new impossible task and the tour of Shangai at the end, the plot definitely takes a backseat and the movie ends with more questions than revelations - might be in preparation for a MI4, but not in a way depicted in other movies like 'back to the future'. However, the movie does good on many of the action scenes (albiet unbelievable, but hell this is Mission Impossible, so I'll give JJ Abrams the benefit of doubt on that). J J Abrams clearly looses his midas touch, which made him famous with his 'Lost' and 'Alias' fans. The end clearly leaves you hanging like 'Cirque de Soleil' performer, stuck in mid air, with no immediate future of a landing.",3,6,12,7 May 2006
