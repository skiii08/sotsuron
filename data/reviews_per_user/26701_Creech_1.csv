Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More than one time movie
","Believe me people, I thought that Star Wars was good the opening night that I saw it but I have gone back to see it two more times and it gets better every time.  It is one of those movies that when you watch it gets better everytime.  I recommend that you take my advice and see it more than once in the theater because it will grow on you rapidly like no other.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
