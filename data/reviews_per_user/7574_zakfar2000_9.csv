Ali," Watchable
","I'm a sports junkie, and I normally watch all the movies that are based on any kind of sports. For me, Muhammad Ali is one of the greatest sportsman of all time. You can call me his fan (even though I'm not much of a boxing guy).I liked this movie. Ali's character is handled greatly by Will Smith. But I feel something odd here. I believe the movie could have lot more than it actually had. I know, the movie was long (longer than 2 hrs). I think the script could have adjusted. I don't know why, but I didn't like this movie as much as I did 'Rocky'. I know someone would say that Rocky is a classical masterpiece. But I don't understand what stopped 'Ali' to be one? Why isn't it handled in the sense? It's understandable when a 'True Story' is being made on the real life hero, there are lots of limitations. But one thing is there though. In the life of Ali, there were many real ups and downs, and they could have been utilized more properly to bring bring better twists and climax.Well, the movie is good, and I will recommend it to all the fans of Muhammad Ali, or other fans of Sports Movies.",8,0,0,29 July 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Good for Prince of Persia Fans!
","Good Movie! Then why 6/10? Well, I'm one of great lovers of Prince of Persia Game Series. I have even played the original Trilogy (Mainly the first one of 1989), then the next 3 by Ubisoft (and mainly The Two Thrones). It is natural for me to enjoy this movie. But from a general point of view, it lacks many things.First of all, Prince of Persia is about Magic + Persia. Ubisoft in later versions attached this with Time Traveling and Mystical Creatures. This movie seems to try to explain things in realistic way, which was a bad idea. If you have to use a Fantasy World, let them stay as fantasy. Sometimes, I will say ridiculously, the scenarios are changed to make them appear DIFFERENT.It always happens when you make a movie based on games. Normally, the games lack much story but focus more on the game-play. In the movies, we need a story. And this movie really lacked a good one. For the Non-PoP fans, it is all like going nowhere. And for PoP fans, it's way too simple. OK! Everyone is saying that it is made on 'Sands of Time' game, but this movie has nothing to do with any of the game franchise. Only the concept of 'Dagger of Time' is here. The original 'Sands of Time' concept of the game has been revised as well. None of the characters in the movie are based on the game. But yes, the appeal is similar, and it feels good.The best thing is Stunt Aerobic. This is what the game is all about. So, if you have played the game, you enjoy those moments. In fact, I wanted to see even more. They really handled it very well. There is just one thing that the developers need to realize. If they make the movie based on the games, they need to understand that most of the audience would be the game players themselves. They would love to see those actions... in action.Overall, I will recommend you to watch this movie. Although not great, it will give you a good time.",8,1,3,20 August 2010
Unknown," Entertaining!
","I don't understand why so many people are complaining and giving it so less rating. I mean, this is true that the movie had so many flaws and many concepts were implausible. Still, it had many plus points.The best thing about the movie is that it is fast paced, and it keeps your interest intact. While watching it, you are always attached with the mystery the movie is creating. Even the climax is good.Now, the problem happens is when you finish the movie. After the climax is revealed, many viewers start asking lots of questions to themselves, joining the puzzles (many of which don't make much sense). They start having negative impressions. Come on! I don't get why people get so negatively. I'm sure that you might have enjoyed it while watching it. Doesn't it matter? I will highly recommend this movie to anyone who like fast-paced Action-Thriller. The movie handles it very well, and will provide you lot of entertaining stuff.",7,2,4,29 July 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Watch the movie!
","OK! I agree with many comments here. The movie lacks lots of explanations and it attempts to confuse some of the religious believes and philosophical concepts related with 'Free Will'. But what to expect from a science fiction movie? People need to learn how to watch and like such genres. You don't need all the 'Explanations' to be accurate and correct. You just watch them for the pace and creativity, and yes, this movie has that pretty good.I won't tell much about the movie that can spoil someone's interest to watch the movie. I will say that the movie is more of adding Sci-Fi and Thriller concepts into Romance. If you watch it with this concept, you are indeed going to like this movie. The movie is fast, and keeps your interest intact. One thing there though. The movie being into Romance, it needed little more Character building and love chemistry. From Sci-Fi and Thriller point of view it is good.7/10 is very good rating from my side (best rating every given is 9). Must watch it if you like Sci-Fiction movies.",8,0,1,29 July 2011
The Insider," Good for those, and only those, who have the taste.
","Overall, it's a good movie, but only those people will enjoy it who will have interest in slow paced works bringing critical thinking with some sets of twists and dramas. However, many people will see 7 Oscar nominations and quickly grab the movie, and will feel disappointed in the end. This movie is not for those who only enjoy fast pace action movies.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are as good as they are expected. In fact, the whole cast was good, and if you are acting lovers, watch it. You will enjoy the movie.There were some flaws in the movie too, mainly with the script. After all, it was a long movie and was slow paced. The climax seemed to start much early, but the real one was very short. When there are so many characters in a single movie, it is indeed difficult to manage them. But what does the director think? If you haven't introduced a character, and haven't even declared their names once or twice, would the viewer still get the true impression and their purpose in the storyline? Many characters were there, playing there roles in the story, who were helping the story to go forward, but their roles failed to create the instant reaction, and when they did, it seemed to be almost too late. After watching the movie, I feel like I will enjoy it more if I watch for the second time. But what about the first time? Many people will feel trouble to follow the storyline and dialogues, as they were intended to create. Many people will feel bored in the middle of the movie, trying to keep track of the twists, which are not that hard to understand, but very difficult to concentrate. No one likes to memorize every name in the movie by himself, and trying to figure out what that character is doing in the movie. I have given it 7/10, because it could be lot better than it was. Still, I will highly recommend it to everyone, mainly because of it's cast and the topic. Although I'm a smoker myself, I do feel the importance of 'Consent'. People have every right to learn the bad consequences of Tobacco products.",7,0,1,1 September 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Not Bad! But not as good as previous Tim Burton's movies.
","Well, overall the film is good to watch. It will give you a NEW EXPERIENCE if you have already been through 'Alice in Wonderland' stories/movies. Helena Carter and Johnny Depp are as good as they always are, especially when they are teamed together to work in a Tim Burton movie. The only thing upsetting is Mia Wasikowska, and that's the thing that messed up everything. I mean, she is 'Alice', the main character of the movie. It's not that she is all a bad actress, but looks like the role didn't suite her perfectly well. I'm a great fan of Tim, Johnny and Helena, and I'm sad to know that I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did their previous efforts.About the story I will say it started good. But it would have been more fun if this was not about WAR OF SISTER QUEENS. I mean, it could bring more emotion to the story if that was about freedom. In fact, looks like they missed the main spot where viewers were supposed to be emotionally connected to the story of battle. They did it rather quickly and did not show much to bring the right connection. Through watching the movie, I was more interested to see the environment and new characters, and did not care much about the War and the Battle. It was already exposed more than enough that Alice is going to slay the Jabberwock, which seemed to bring the concept of why Alice was brought down to Underland. I think there is serious trouble with Linda Woolverton's Writing. With such a marvelous Direction, Graphics and great bunch of actors, there could have been much more to this movie.Call me a strict Judge for giving it 5/10. Somewhat might enjoy this movie greatly to give it 7+, but it could have been a lot better than this. And for me, Tim Burton's efforts has gone to vein because of Linda's script and Mia's bad role.",10,3,4,20 August 2010
Centurion," Not Bad!
","Indeed not a bad movie! Good Storyline and Impressive Action scenes. It's entertaining. However, there is something seriously wrong with the movie, which becomes the fun-spoiler.The movie about Hunting. It was supposed to bring thrill, but it indeed failed in that. The characters were not so freighting as they were supposed to be. I don't really understand why Etain was tried to be utilized for that purpose. I mean, I don't mind if she had to be the leading villain. But it would have been a lot better if she was utilized as an extra-ordinary scout, led by another leader who could be indeed strong and frightening. Especially when around 14 members (I don't have the real count though, but it seemed somewhat like that) of hunters team are chasing 7 trained warriors, it is expected from the beginning that sooner or later they are going to entangle in a direct fight. And it was in their favor, as they also knew that guerrilla tactics could be in their favor (hide and attack, even if they were not particularly trained for those), but they never really tried to do that (but only once, and not even with actually a plan as well). With such gruesome movie, a great opportunity was indeed lost to bring terror.Overall, the film is good, and I'll recommend you to watch it. However, you will agree with the aspect that I've mentioned here. 5/10 for good story and action.",5,1,4,20 September 2010
Any Given Sunday," Good for Acting Dramas rather than Sports Lovers.
","Before watching it, I had dropped the idea many times, as I'm not into American Football, and in fact, I only knew the basics of the game, and not much details. But then I decided to go for it, as I like watching sports movies, and I love Al Pacino. And I'm happy to make that decision. It's a good movie, but not the best.Overall, Casting and Acting is good. But the sports scenes of the movie are handled with much carelessness. The viewer needed to watch the scenes with more concentration then they should be, and still get lost sometimes. This is a game about ball, and most of the time, you don't even know where is the ball. The movie intends to bring some emotions to the gameplay, but it fails in that as well, as we don't even know who is striking whom before it is shown that someone is hurt. Only one good scene for that, and even that did not create much emotion due to the fact that the character was not emotionally developed in the movie. We needed to have some secondary characters build, who played vital roles during the game, but there were none. Only one major character (of Jamie Foxx), and he never loses. OK! This movie is about the storyline. I can understand that. But what about the viewers who watched it for the sport? Looks like the director missed a simple point. The ones who want to watch the story drama, many of them avoid to watch the movie with Sports title, as it is not their taste. And the Sports Frenzy who will watch it, will get disappointed with the fact that there is not really interesting sport in the movie.Well, 6/10. Why? Personally, I liked the movie because of the characters. The climax is indeed good and the best thing of the movie, and I really like the character of Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx overall did good, along with many other characters in the movie. Cameron Diaz also played her role well enough to create some emotion in the storyline. Though, some characters could be improved to create better emotional attachments and adjustments with the storyline. However, it is not a mistake of those actors. Script could be improved a lot as well, as the general storyline was good.",6,0,0,1 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Disappointing!
","I'm really surprised with all the good reviews for this movie. It doesn't even deserve 5 out of 10. In fact it's shocking for me how can someone make such an idiotic piece of work. I don't care what was in the Book. All I know is that when I watched this movie, I wanted it to end as soon as possible. Many times I hold myself from turning down this boring movie. There were only Blah... blah... blahs. Not much action. We all know since the second movie that this is about a Vampire and a Human Girl's love story, with a Werewolf getting in between them to make it a love triangle. Now what? Nothing New? There is not much in the storyline. Same Victoria, and same 'No Turning into Vampire' Ending. Damn! Sorry to you if you liked this movie, but I really felt like lost. Time Wasting!",1,8,12,20 August 2010
