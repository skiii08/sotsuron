Skyfall," The franchise lives
","I only review movies that had some sort of effect on me. This movie did.James Bond is back, and, instead letting Daniel Craig hunting the gang from the last flicks in another action firework, he hunts ghosts from the past: his. And 'M's.Sam Mendes was a slightly controversial selection. MGM had no choice. They had to deliver something fresh to the table of modern agent flicks.He did more than service to the franchise. Brilliantly shot, in much 'closer' view then any of the films before. He showed depth, he delivered a more human Bond, who is showing his age - and the knowledge, that there is no simple exit plan for people like him. With the sharp writing of Purvis and Wade, this movie adds another layer to the question: why is 007 needed? Why does he exists? And who controls the chessboard with pawns like him? Is there even a political context? Some of these questions are answered, but it opens a box of new questions even someone like James Bond can't run away from.This brings us to the 'insanity' that is played by Javier Bardem. What ever people thought about him, this is 'his' Dark Knight moment. Like Ledgers legendary Joker, he breathes Silva, the ghost from the past, a worthy adversary. Not because another doomsday-device, but because he knows Bonds fears. Because Money, Guns, Computers, People...are only tools in his lunacy, in his quest to make everybody 'understand' what he has to say.Some shots with him are pure cinematic gold, comical, frighting, absurd. He is even channeling some of Bonds old adversaries like Scaramanga or Max Zorin. Mendes gives the actors room to breathe and reaps the benefits ten times.People will continue to talk about this movie for ages. Everybody was stunned by the performance. When I left the cinema, many popcorn bags were left, half full. There was something else to do. Experiencing a well refreshed franchise, with a old Bond with lots of new wounds. Who still has a job to do. And one or two stories to tell. My best movie of 2012.",8,2,12,28 November 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," Bullet Ballet at its finest
","When I saw the first movie, I thought: this is something new. Someone took the real hardcore action movies from the past, where people use handguns like extension of their hands, kill and keep dropping bodies like nothing. Usually, those movies end up to be campy, unbelievable and quite bad, especially on the story and sfx side.John Wick was the exception in a long time. A tortured soul, who has to do what he has to do, because other force him. And he does it with style and determination. The second chapter takes the setting from the first one and adds more on everything. Brilliant shot, gorgeously lighted, nice locations. And intense and insane action, where the bullets fly and the main actor performs a ballet of (gun) raw fight sequences you simply have to see. And there is, by all means, even humorous moments where you would least expect it.In the seemingly endless barrel that is replaceable, cutout superhero action, John Wick is a class of its own. I saw many groups of women without male dates in my packed cinema. Which means that this series delivers more than just action. It delivers an fresh experience, and the second film fixes probably all problems the first had. This is not ordinary.For quite some time, action fans had troubles to agree 'whats a good action movie?' if asked. Look at the reviews. This one is easy. Its relentless, its beautiful in its own way - and has an Keanu Reeves, who simply owns the role of an legendary assassin and never lets it go. 9/10. Must see for action fans.",9,2,5,22 February 2017
