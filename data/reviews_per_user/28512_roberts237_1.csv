The Ring," If this movie doesn't frighten you, you're already dead!
","Well, I've finally seen the movie my mother warned me about years ago. Remember the motherly advice, 'You don't need to see that, it will keep you up all night,'?  I didn't listen to her then because nothing could be that frightening.  Well, 'The Ring' is!  I don't pretend to be a movie critic (many are wrong) and I'm not a horror fanatic, either--but, if you want to be truly frightened to the point your hair pretty much stands on end the length of the movie, go see 'The Ring'.The only thing I've seen in a movie that I really remember 'creeping me out', and I don't mean in a 'someone jumping out and yelling boo' kind of way, but in just a deep in the mind 'woaahh' was the scene in 'The Sixth Sense' in the 'fort' HJO built in his house when the dead girl appeared all the sudden.  If you remember that part in 'Sixth,' this movie is packed with moments that made me feel like this!DON'T believe any of the comments that say this movie is 'too complicated' or 'just another thinking movie that doesn't get it's point across', etc., etc.  Yes, there are some things left undiscovered but who cares!  GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF AND REMEMBER TO TURN OFF YOUR TV BEFORE YOU LEAVE HOME AND KEEP ALL THE LIGHTS ON!",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
