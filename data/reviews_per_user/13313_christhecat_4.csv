Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Painfully Funny, It mocks the whole of the Human Race, and We Deserve it
","Yes, it's offensive. Yes, it belittles Jews, Gypsies/Roma, Kazaks, Uzbeks, Eastern Europe in general, and Americans. Yes there is lots of juvenile toilet humor.And yes, it raked in huge box office receipts the first week, and rave reviews.On one level 'Borat' is mo more offensive than the old Candid Camera TV show-- it has just taken it to a new level (nobody ever complained about the gags on Candid camera being 'staged'-- they were OBVIOUSLY staged). To enjoy the movie you have to relax, put your ego in check, and give a little willful ignorance to what is being presented; if you can read Cyrillic alphabet you know that about half of the 'Russian/Kazak' text presented is complete gibberish, but I didn't let that bother me.On another level 'Borat' is deliberately offensive, tricking Americans into saying things they probably wouldn't say in other public forums (the rodeo organizer clearly stating how he'd like to kill all the homosexuals, or the entire scene with the frat-boys)-- are we offended by what Borat says, or by what WE say when he goads us? The Americans who come off the best are the ones who are easy going and not offended: the driving instructor being the best example. I got a kick out of the New Yorkers threatening to punch Borat -- I laugh, and yet I would probably act exactly the same.Possibly the only thing that truly offended me was the extra-movie information on the Romanian village they used for the Kazak scenes, knowing that they are desperately poor and received little in compensation made me disappointed in the producers. They were mocked no more than the Americans in the film, but kicking someone when they're down isn't something I approve of.",9,0,0,1 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," The Key to the Movie is. . .
","So, you saw the film, and you didn't get it, or maybe you thought 'there was nothing TO get!' Well, I too love a good action movie with lots of unbelievable chase scenes and explosions and nice clean ending that wraps everything up neatly, and you can watch this movie and enjoy the action and the thrill of the hunt/chase which is really well filmed/edited (although there's not nearly enough to call this an 'action' movie), but THAT is not what this film is really about.And I'm not sure I should really tell you what it's about, but I will direct you how to get there.The key is Tommy Lee Jones' dialog throughout the film, especially his voice-over at the very beginning (that you forget all about once the movie is going), but also his various interactions with his co-workers and friends. If you can watch the movie on DVD you should NOT tune out his dialog, you should pay very close attention to it. There are certain key phrases that come up that are deep and true and ring out like a Bible verse or a haiku. The movie is not about two men fighting over money, the movie is about Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; the rest of the action is a musical counterpoint to him. I suspect a lot of people get it backwards and come away confused.There are some other themes in the movie (chance, fate, justice) that I find less important, but certainly they are there and shouldn't be ignored.I have watched this film over and over the last few weeks, and come away every time with a strange feeling inside, a kind of 'existential spiritualism' that I can't quite put a finger on. The movie is that deep if you give it the chance.",9,4,7,23 November 2008
The Departed," Good, Entertaining, but NOT Scorsese's Best.
","A good movie, entertaining crime thriller, well filmed as are nearly all Scorsese films, but something was missing and I can't say just what.That said, the performances from Damon, Farmiga, Winstone, and O'hara were superb, while the others (mostly big-name actors) were 'OK', not incredibly convincing but good.I hate to bad-mouth Scorsese, and I DO think this is an enjoyable movie, but I guess I expect more from him. It's ironic that this is his first Oscar win; compare this to Raging Bull or even his remake of Cape Fear (which adds a lot to the original version, as opposed to this remake of Internal Affairs which adds little). This almost seems like a tossed-off quickie of a movie for Scorsese.",6,0,1,1 November 2008
Blade Runner," Future Noir
","When I see pages upon pages of comments I feel I should refrain from adding anything (what more can possibly be said?) But this film is probably the only modern noir film that keeps to the true spirit of the original 'film noir' genre; you could take away most of the future-dystopia setting and it would still be a respectable gumshoe mystery thriller. Weirdly darker than the original noir feel, and yet somehow uplifting at the end too. Oddly, the original noir films were shot with very minimal settings; they made the most of simple city scenes and sets, and yet here the city has been dolled-up like some compu-TV-robot-whore, and it still works. The scenery is like another character in the film, similar to 'nature' being a character in some wilderness films.",9,1,2,28 May 2006
