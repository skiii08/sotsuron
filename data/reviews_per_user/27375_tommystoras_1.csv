It," So disappointing
","First time I saw the trailer I was really hoping for something creepy, psychological scare. I did get none of that. Jumpscares and CGI. Loved the book, liked the original IT mini series and then This comes along. The acting by the kids is good but too much joking around for my liking. Not really ever you feel like they are in serious trouble. And the people around these kids feel so futile. You don't really ever care about anyone or what happens to them in this movie. The first 15 minutes was really nice. But after that it's all downhill. One thing I don't get how people praise the performance by Bill Skarsg√•rd as Pennywise. What did he actually do? Eyes moving in different directions, that's it? It was so obvious that his lines was ADR or post-sync (what ever you call it). Surely by himself, I don't deny that. But otherwise he just stood there and made some faces and the rest was CGI. Wow, surely an Oscar performance there. Really overrated. Hardly any remake comes close to the original and this is far from that. Avoid this movie, you won't miss anything.",4,11,20,13 September 2017
