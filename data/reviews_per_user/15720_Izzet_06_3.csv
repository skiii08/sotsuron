Alien 3," One of the most under-rated movies ever...
","If only Fox knew what David Fincher would turn out to be, director of the critically acclaimed Seven and Fight Club. Yet what he churned out under the enormous pressure that was mounted on him, is close to stunning.What i love about Alien 3 is that it's completely different from the previous Alien movies and almost unlike anything in it's genre. It's so moody, downbeat and violent and treats the audience with intelligence and a sense of maturity, say, missing from Resurrection and AVP.The special edition does well to cover up most loose ends and is much closer to Fincher's original vision. Alien 3 is visually stunning, still to this day, one of a few flaws is the awful mo-motion that is incredibly dated, but bar that, the Alien looks really cool.Highly recommended.",10,14,20,27 February 2005
Alien: Resurrection," The series weak link.
","It was billed as Alien crossed with Aliens when it was released in '97, but unlike Alien 3, time hasn't been kind to Alien resurrection. I would have rated this a 7 a couple of years ago, but i'd struggle to give it a 5 out of 10 at this point in time.It's visually stunning, much like the films that have gone before it, but unlike the films that have went before it, it's utterly uninteresting. The set-pieces are mildly boring, the Aliens look awful and despite it's difference (almost like a french black comedy), nothing goes right for Resurrection.If i wasn't an Alien fan and cared what is said about these movies, i would tell everyone to avoid it, but, it does have it's moments (Ripley destroying her clones was touching).5.5/10",6,1,2,27 February 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Actually very good...
","I eagerly anticipated this movie long before i can remember, being a big Alien fan. And though my expectations of the movie must of helped (being incredibly low), i really enjoyed it. I think the first three quarters of the movie are superb, the plot is functional, the look and feel of the film is awesome, despite the lack of development i liked the characters, and, the action is mostly superb.I'm not a big fan of the certificate the movie received though, it's almost liked it's been dumbed down for kids and despite Paul Anderson saying it isn't bloodless, it certainly isn't as bloody as the previous films. I thought the team-up was a b*llocks idea, and could potentially have destroyed the movie, yet it is done pretty well despite being annoying.I've gotta congratulate Harold Kloser on delivering one of the best scores throughout the seven films, it's both elegant and rousing. Overall, it's flawed entertainment yet more care and a bigger budget from Fox really would have propelled this above the average.",6,0,2,27 February 2005
