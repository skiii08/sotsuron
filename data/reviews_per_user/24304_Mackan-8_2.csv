The Blair Witch Project," A story with the most horrifying ending of all times...
","As a horror movie, 'The Blair Witch Project' isn't very scary. There is only one time it felt really intense... and that is in the final shot. Still I can't explain the feeling I got. That scene was completely horrifying. It changed the whole movie. I must confess it was boring at times and I waited for the scary stuff to come.. but it never did, except in the final shot. A final shot that raised the grade quite a bit.I don't love it and I don't hate it. I just like it a little. But I have only seen it ones... with a very negative audience, so I don't think I really can give the proper judgment at the time. I will see it again and hope I will like it more then.",Null,0,1,17 January 2000
American Beauty," Beautiful
",In 1990 there was a TV-show that changed everything for me. It was called 'Twin Peaks' and ever since then I have felt that there was a time before 'Twin Peaks' and after 'Twin Peaks'.Now I feel that same way the second time in my life. There was a time before 'American Beauty' and after 'American Beauty'. This masterpiece is so beautiful that I can't believe it has been made and that I have been given the permission to see it. It's worthy every Oscar Award it can get.If you should see one movie this year... there is no question about it... you have to see 'American Beauty'... the most beautiful movie ever made.,10,0,0,18 March 2000
