The Incredible Hulk," Much better than the 2003 flop
","This is an enjoyable movie, but you must have some patience and you are going to have to forgive a few flaws.Having said that, this has way less flaws than the ridiculous 2003 version. The acting here is good, the story is good, the action is good. None of them are great, however.My biggest complaint is the CGI. I have no idea why it is so bad. It is better than 2003 Hulk, but nowhere near what it should be. Iron Man came out the same year and the CGI is leagues above. I like Hulk's insanely shredded design, but he always looks fake. He is too shiny, rarely does he blend in and look real. The helicopters look like something from a video game, incredibly under-detailed.This movie has the worst CGI of the entire MCU.I give it a C",7,1,3,17 April 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent
","I enjoy this movie more every time I watch it. I love claustrophobic horror/thriller movies. This movie does that very well. It tells a great story and keeps you interested with only three characters in a very tight space. The acting is all spot on, especially from MEW and Goodman. Goodman plays a creepy survivalist and does it well. MEW shows a great range of emotion and plays a very strong survivor. I am not sure how much this movie actually connects to Cloverfield, but as a stand alone movie it is excellent. The music is great in this movie also, it leads the mood and emotion of the film. Most movies these days don't have music that stands out at all..it is just there, that's it. The music here sticks with you and is creepy. This is an underrated movie that you should definitely check out. Don't let the Cloverfield name fool you, it is a very different type of movie from Cloverfield.",9,0,0,6 February 2018
Captain Marvel," Not good, not terrible
","I thought this was going to be much worse, but it was mildly entertaining.
I just think Brie was miscast, she seemed out of place for the character to me. The rest of the cast was good.I think she needed more challenge and a better villain in the movie and it would have been better.This could have been great, but stands as the worst MCU movie so far IMO. Hopefully Brie settles in to the character and does a better job in Endgame, I love seeing a strong female character but this one needs some work I'm afraid.IMDB deleted my other review and so did RT, maybe this one will stay up.",4,37,70,12 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Not great
","This movie could have been awesome. I just think Brie was miscast. She can act, that's not the problem. I just don't think this part was right for her.The plot was OK, but CM needed more vulnerability, it would make her feats more exciting. She also needed a much better villain.",4,4,7,10 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Better than I expected
","I am happy to say that I enjoyed this more than I expected to.After a certain cast member's racist and sexist comments leading up to this, I was afraid the MCU would let politics seep into the movie.I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't get that feeling at all.I love movies about strong female characters when they are well done without pushing politics. See wonder woman for the perfect example of how to properly do that... This movie was no wonder woman, but it tried and I never felt like I was being fed any kind of identity politics, which many of us were afraid of due to the lead-up to this movie. You don't need that, just show a well-written female character overcoming hardship, kicking butt, and people will get behind them. It's simple, but some movies just can't resist getting political these days. Luckily this one didn't.Brie wasn't great...it took the first half of the movie to 'get used to her' is the best way I can explain it. I don't let her actions IRL impact how I feel about the movie or character, or I wouldn't have paid to see it. But I just don't think she was a good casting choice for this character. But, she tried... It wasn't terrible, it just didn't fit for some reason. I have really enjoyed her in other movies so I know she can act. The mix of seriousness and humor with her character just felt off, or forced at times.I enjoyed the second half and was on board to root for her all the way by the finale. There were zero stakes for her in the movie though, except for a few refugees she was fighting for. She's so overpowered and takes nearly zero damage, you never felt like she was in real danger. I don't mind her being OP like crazy, but they should have balanced it a little better with a better villain. She needed more of a challenge IMO. Not a huge deal, just something I noticed.The rest of the cast was good. The de-aging was well done. I liked the 90's member berries they fed us. Some good tunes, too... I didn't have any issue with the CGI as some others said...maybe once or twice it was a little rough.This could have been amazing and it could have been a real 'woke' mess. It was neither.I was entertained and don't regret spending the money to see it. 6/10",4,7,25,8 March 2019
The Babadook," Good movie, some great acting as well
","*May contain minor spoilers if you are a picky brat who likes to complain about everything*I recently watched this and enjoyed it very much. For me, there were only a couple moments that I would actually call 'scary', but the movie was very effective in what it was meant to do. They did a great job at building up the absolute frustration of the mother. If you have suffered from Insomnia, you can understand just how hard that is. Now, add on top of that a clingy child with behavioral issues, and that would just be too much. The mother did a great job acting, I was very impressed. So did the child. The Babadook was pretty creepy, and effective. They didn't rely on a bunch of jump scares or the face going back and forth super fast deal that too many movies have these days. There were some typical things about it, but they added some new elements to it that I enjoyed. The 'creature' combined with the book was pretty cool... I have seen this compared to the movie: The Canal. I have seen both, but they are VERY different movies IMO. I enjoyed both movies, but got a totally different vibe from each. I could feel the Mother's frustration in this movie, but also her love for her child, how lonely she was, etc. That was done extremely well. So, I give this an 8/10. I was excited to see it when I saw the trailer, and I was not let down. I was glued to my screen the whole movie. And while it wasn't exactly scary to me, it still triggered quite an emotional response.",8,9,20,1 November 2014
Us," Not bad
","This movie is pretty freaky, and the acting is really well done.I have a hard time getting scared at these types of movies, as someone who takes steps to protect my family and not have to wait on cops or use blunt objects and empty threats, it just seems silly that a parent would be so careless about what they have available to protect loved ones if bad people come knocking. This story would be over quick at my house....",7,1,3,23 May 2019
Aquaman," Great job DC!
","It's not easy to write a story with a character like Aquaman and be able to make it look good, not be a silly mess, and to be serious enough to engage people.DC really came back and did a great job with this movie. They didn't inject any political junk, it was well-paced and acted, the story was good, the effects were great.I'm a MARVEL fan mostly, but I love the DC characters as well and it made me happy to see DC put out something so entertaining. I really hope they can keep it up because they have so many awesome characters that need movies that do them justice.Amber Heard did great, even she would have been a better choice for Captain Marvel IMO.I give this a solid 7.5/10 with no real complaints.",7,2,4,18 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Excellent
","This movie was great. Every bit as funny as the first but with everything dialed up to 11.Brolin was great as Cable. Zazie as Domino was beautiful and just an awesome character. She stole the show as far as the supporting cast went IMO.They gave us a raunchy comedy that is very welcome in the current climate where everyone has to tiptoe around worried of offending someone. The action was better in this one, some pretty big scenes with a lot going on.Tons of Easter Eggs and references from Marvel, DC, the music industry, you name it.There's a few cameos that might surprise you.Stay until the credits are over, you won't regret it.I really hope we get a third installment with some of the new characters we saw in this one. This shouldn't be the last.8/10, yet another hit for Marvel (no surprise there). My theater was even more crowded than Infinity War opening night. I will say my biggest complaint is the lack of character development for Cable and Domino. It wasn't a big deal for me, but I definitely noticed.",9,4,8,18 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An awful mess
","This movie was slapped together after several reshoots trying to undo the horrible direction RJ took in TLJ. Without a clear direction through the 3 movies there was no way this was going to end well, and it didn't.The movie looked and sounded good, but the story was bad. The Palpatine angle was stupid, the attempted arc for Rey and Kylo didn't work.I hope Disney learns from this experience as they see how quickly those who loved TLJ are now turning on them for going 'less woke' with ROS.GW GB",2,27,50,20 December 2019
Bird Box," Good movie!
","If you are impatient and looking for a movie with big scary CGI monsters and jump scares, watch something else.If you can pay attention and enjoy a good story about people coming together during an interesting crisis, with a good pace, good characters, and suspense that will keep you watching: This is a pretty decent movie. Much better than most of the theatrical horror/suspense movies that come out these days.It has some similarities to The Happening, but very minor and those reviews are people who went in wanting a popcorn monster movie. There are some similarities to A Quiet Place, but just that it's a family trying to survive and hiding from something.So, if you actually have an attention span, you might want to check this out. Otherwise, there's always movies like The Nun for mindless jump scares.",7,14,35,16 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Great movie
","This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.Besides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.And the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM.",9,3,7,27 May 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Exceeds Expectations!
","WOW. I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was blown away.I am 30 years old, and am a huge fan of the original series. I've seen them all many, many times. After seeing the preview for this, I wanted to see it, but did not expect it to be more than an entertaining movie with apes smashing stuff up. I didn't expect it to hold a candle to the originals. I was dead wrong. The Tim Burton remake doesn't deserve to carry the series' name IMO. This movie was great from start to finish. The story is very well done, the acting is great, the characters are nicely done as well. The special effects were amazing. I have NEVER seen a believable life- sized ape in a movie before that was done with CGI. I think King Kong was well done by Peter Jackson, but this was a life-sized ape interacting with it's environment, with other animals and apes, with humans, etc. Andy Serkis and WETA both deserve much praise for this movie. The scene where the ape goes nuts in the lab just blew me away and I was hooked from then on. If this doesn't win best special effects this year, it will be a travesty. This movie deserved to carry the Planet of the Apes name in every way. I think most people who are a fan of the originals will agree. They mixed in a few 'shout-outs' to the original series and most of them fit quite well. One or two felt a bit out of place, but not enough to take you away from this great movie. I want to see it again, and almost paid to watch it immediately after finishing the first viewing. 9/10",Null,1,2,7 August 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," As close to a 10 as I've seen
","I knew from past Marvel movies and the trailers that this would be a good movie, but it exceeded my expectations in every way.One big problem with the excellent MCU is their weak villains and the lack of consequences for the good guys.This movie brought us excellent and very strong villains, as well as plenty of consequences for the good guys. There was lots of well-placed humor. Unlike the new Star Wars movies which can't place a good joke to save their lives, the MCU really gets that aspect of these movies. I was wondering how they could make this movie without considerable violence...not our usual fights, but true violence. They didn't pull any punches. This movie is the most violent of the MCU by far. They didn't sugar coat this movie for the kiddies. Thanos is amazing. Not just a mindless bad guy, but someone with a fleshed out character and clear motivation. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you can still relate to him because our own history has seen similar ideas from the Communists and Nazis. 'Genocide for the greater good' as monsters from our past have declared it.If you are a fan of the MCU, this movie has everything you love from the previous films and everything you have wanted but haven't seen. I give this a 10/10 after two viewings (now five two weeks later). I find very few flaws.Edit: A couple weeks later and I have to laugh at all the recent 1/10 reviews. The DC fangirls are waging a unified rating war from their Mom's basement in an attempt to drag the rating down to that of movies like Justice League. All the while, Infinity War races to 2 BILLION dollars and is already #5 top grossing of all time. Keep hoping for a good movie, DC fans. Nothing will touch this, though. Over half of the people who have seen this rate it 10/10 while 1/10 is less than 2%.",10,4,10,27 April 2018
Room," Emotional, great movie.
","This movie hits you with a lot of emotions. One of the largest I got is sadness and frustration knowing that there are people out there right now, locked up, used and abused. Disgusting that such a thing still exists, and sad that it always will. I hope this movie will help people understand the mental effects from all kinds of abuse, and to have patience and understanding for anyone they may encounter in life who has been through something so horrible. The strength of the mother and the child was an impressive thing to see. Instead of giving up, she did her best to turn a small shack into the world for her boy. It would be incredibly difficult to raise a child in that situation, and especially one who is happy and loving. The acting was amazing by Brie and Jacob. Jacob especially did such a great job for someone so young. This must have been a difficult job for him but he handled it perfectly. Brie had to show such a large range of emotion, and earned her awards for sure. You believe every bit of it. I can't say much about the actual story without giving things away. I suggest if you haven't seen this, go watch it now. Don't watch a trailer, don't read any more reviews. That's how I went into it, and I think that is the best way to see it. This movie deserves every bit of a 9/10. A difficult subject, but one that needs to be seen and felt.",9,0,1,28 January 2018
A Quiet Place," Slow start, into a great horror/suspense
","This movie is a slow burn for the majority of it. If you can't sit still and get bored easily, you might have issues with the first 30-40 minutes. There is very little dialogue, most of their communication is with sign language that is subtitled. No big deal for me, but some people will hate that. Having said that, once the movie gets going, it is quite entertaining and very suspenseful. There are 2 or 3 well placed jump scares, but it doesn't rely on that for the only strong reaction from the audience. There is VERY tiny amounts of exposition in this movie. You only get glimpses of old newspapers to see why and how they are in this predicament. I felt like I could have used a tad more with the ear pieces, I didn't really know what the plan was or purpose was for those, but I get the general idea. I have no clue how they work, and would have liked to have some more explanation on that. Otherwise, you really don't need any exposition and it is all right in front of you. You get a real sense of dread and what a miserable existence these people have due to the situation they are in. Everything they do must be as quiet as possible. Just dropping something on the floor could mean the death of the ENTIRE family. Thinking of having a baby in this situation is horrifying. Horror movies seem to have WAY more misses than hits these days. I thought this was a fresh idea, the antagonists were well thought-out and original. The effects are good, and they did awesome with an idea that could have fallen on its face due to the pace and complete lack of dialogue. People are impatient these days, many want everything explained and don't like subtitles. They want the story to be in your face from the start. But. this movie really pays you back for the smoldering beginning. I give this an 8/10. If you are a patient person who likes a slow burn that ends in a bang, you might really enjoy this as well. I would compare the pace and payoff to 10 Cloverfield Lane in a way...I would suspect that the vast majority of negative reviews are from people with short attention spans.",8,2,3,10 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Total junk
","This movie not only ignored the interesting questions posed in Force Awakens, it totally spat on characters we have loved for decades. This is what happens when the people who make these movies aren't even fans of the originals, and are more concerned with social justice than staying faithful to the source material and making an entertaining movie. Holdo's motivations were.....well, we never learn them except that it seems she just wanted to talk down to Poe. The entire Canto Byte storyline was 100% useless and made no impact on the story except to bash capitalism and virtue signal about animal rights. Luke's entire character was nothing like we knew of him from the OT, and we were given no real reason for his drastic change into a winy, grumpy old man. This movie was horrible. Force Awakens was enjoyable and fans spent two years guessing about a few key issues and what would come of them. This movie totally tossed those questions and subjects aside to go off on useless tangents that were neither entertaining nor relevant to the outcome of the story. Disney Star Wars needs new leadership, some true fans of the source material. Look how Marvel is going about things...not only having competent directors who are also FANS of the comics, but listening to the average fan and applying that to how they handle the characters and stories. If Disney Star Wars took that approach instead of worrying about how many virtue signal points they can gain, they would make way better movies and much more money.",1,24,35,25 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great fun with a few flaws
","I just got back from watching this movie and I really enjoyed this one. I had goosebumps through several scenes and thought it was better than Force Awakens for sure. There were some great fight/battle scenes, plenty of action, good characters, and it tried much harder at being it's own movie instead of being 'Member berries' like Force Awakens did. I didn't like Kylo much upon first watch of Force Awakens, but he is amazing in this movie. I like where they went with all the characters, really. The thing that got me the most as a negative was a few JarJar-level silly scenes thrown in that totally kill the mood of the film. This is a darker movie, more serious with some typical 'Star Wars' light hearted moments. Then there are some totally silly scenes it looks like a third grader threw in. Overall I loved it and can't wait to see it again. Hopefully someone makes a cut with a few of those comical scenes left out so the movie can keep the mood it deserves throughout.This is the best Star Wars film outside of the original trilogy.",1,14,35,16 December 2017
Godzilla," Loved it
","I'm a huge Godzilla fan since I was around 5 years old. I was a fan back in the day when you couldn't find the original movies. You would see a few of the same ones at random movie rental places, but some were never to be found anywhere. I remember finally finding some mail order place that had them all, and I would save up and order a new one every time I had enough money. The first US Godzilla wasn't Godzilla. I enjoyed it at the time, I think I was 14, but it just wasn't Godzilla!I had been waiting for years to see the real Godzilla in modern special effects on the big screen, with a gritty story to match the original movie. I think this hit the mark. I hear so many people complain that Godzilla wasn't plastered on the screen the entire movie. The way they minimally showed him really worked for me. The only time it bothered me is when they cut away during one fight with the MUTO. The CGI, audio, size, and character of this Godzilla made such an impact when he was on screen, I didn't notice his lack of screen time. I really liked the story, I liked the MUTO's, I loved the backstory of Godzilla with the nuke 'testing'. It wasn't perfect. I would say a strong B+. With how much I also enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, I am really excited for King of the Monsters, and eventually seeing a serious take on King Kong vs Godzilla. The Japanese version is camp, although fun for what it is. As a fan of Godzilla for the last 32 years, this movie was great.",8,1,1,29 January 2018
