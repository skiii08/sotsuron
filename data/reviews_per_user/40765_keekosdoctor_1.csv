Skyfall," One of the greats! A must see for Bond fans and new viewers alike.
","I meant that for me by the way. This was my first experience with seeing a Bond movie in theaters,and dude, it was totally awesome! After therather strange and cluttered bit of...stuff, that was Quantam of Solace, Skyfall feels very much like the continuation of Casino Royale. For those not in the know, Skyfall represents the 50th anniversary of 007 as a film franchise, and boy does it do a better job of celebrating the films of old than the OTHER 'celebratory' film Die Another Day (made for the 40th anniversary).Too start with, Daniel Craig cements himself (for me anyway) as the definitive James Bond with this performance. Craig's Bond has just the right mix of humor, suave, and brutality, making endearing but by no means the prototypical 'good guy'. Craig could have easily carried the whole film on his own, but he also has a fleshed out and intriguing supporting cast. Judi Dench returns as M, who's much more of a key player this time around, being the target of the villainous Silva (played by Javier Bardem). Several other supporting characters get to play key roles throughout the film, but Skyfall's story is a deeply personal one for the three main characters, something that, along with the several little references (and re-establishing) of Bond film staples, makes Skfall a great jumping on point for new fans. The plot is well constructed, and what few little niggles the story has do nothing to detract from how great it was put together. Action setpieces aren't over used and over saturated like they were in Quantam of Solace or Die Another Day, and not one scene in the movie feels unnecessary.To talk too much about the film would spoil a lot of surprises, but safe to say it easily ranks among the best of the Bond films, and climbs to my personal #1 spot. It's obvious Skyfall was made by people with nothing but love for 007, and the film serves as a nice merger of all of the previous eras of Bond with the more gritty and modern Bond. In short it's a good movie. Go watch it. Now. Do it.",7,9,22,11 November 2012
