E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Amazing.
","I discovered this movie in our VHS cabinet about a year ago, and I was excited because I heard all the hype and wanted to check it out. I started to get it out, and I put it in our VHS at around midnight. From that moment on, this movie has been one of my favorites of all time (It's even tied for my favorite movie of all time). The story talks about a alien who is stranded on earth, who then meets a young outcast, who he quickly befriends, and forms a special relationship with. I just have to say that a movie that can make cry, smile, cheer for joy, and rejoice all at the same time must be amazing ... especially when E.T. dies, and comes back to life. Also, the part where Elliot and E.T. go into the forest at night, and then they fly against the moon, is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. I mean, the part where they ride through, and then suddenly drop then fly away, gave me goosebumps the first time I saw it. And that scene will stay with me for the rest of my life. I just can't express my love for this film any other way: I love it so much, and it's just so beautiful. I can watch it over and over again, yet it keeps getting better. It's one of those films that just makes you wonder, and imagine. The direction is just so brilliant, and the story is so heartwarming and touching.This movie gets a 10/10 ... It actually should get a 100/10. One of the greatest movies of our time. I also, highly suggest you get this movie on the 2-Disc Collector's Edition. Because, all you can find in the stores today is the 2002 version.",10,0,1,13 August 2008
Lost in Translation," Beautiful.
","The title of this review is beautiful. That is as simple a definition I can say for this film. It truly is beautiful, and one of my favorite, and most like favorite of all time, films. I am in love with every aspect of this film.The characters are amazing, and incredibly deep. What drew me to this film, and the reason it is my favorite, is that I connect to the characters. I feel the loneliness, the friendship, the happiness and joy. Not only do I connect to the characters, but to the situations. I rejoice when they find each other; when Bob tells her he's leading a prison break. I get angry when Bob sleeps with the red-headed singer. I cry when Bob is leaving, and doesn't really have a good-bye with Charlotte... yet, when they meet, I am overcome with joy. Also, a part that deeply affects me, is whenever bob's wife calls... especially when Bob is in the tub. It hurts me when she doesn't even care about him, nor takes the time to listen to what he wants.Another aspect, that I am head-over-heels in love with, is the cinematography. There are so many beautiful shots. namely, the opening, where Bob is in the car, and you are watching the neon signs of Tokyo, with beautiful ambient music in the background.Thirdly, you have the dialogue. There are so many brilliant lines and dialogue. Especially when Bob invites Charlotte to his room, and they talk. This film is funny, sad, and deep... All throughout.Lastly, the scenes are what I truly love the most. There are too many scenes, that I love. The karaoke scene, the hospital scene, the first few times they meet and talk... But my favorite, is a short one ... in which they are running trough an arcade. it is so short, but it deeply affects me so. I am happy.I could go on and on. However, just know that every scene in here is beautiful. Every shot is beautiful. The soundtrack is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. Everything is beautiful.Please, watch this movie. You will not regret it.A true 10/10.",10,1,2,5 July 2011
Jurassic Park," Absolutely breathtaking!
","When I first saw this movie, it was like no other movie I had ever seen. It completely changed my perspective on movies, is one of my favorite films of all time, and most importantly was the gateway to other films (Mainly Spielberg)I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time for many reasons. The plot is spectacular, adding tons of suspense and action to the story. But what I most highly praise about this film is the visual aspects of it. Not just the special effects, but every single frame of it. I just love looking at the props (the tour cars, computers/programs running, the fences & signs, etc), the location, and main sets (The visitor lodge, the lab, the dinosaur paddocks). In my opinion, the most iconic scene in movie history, is when the cars enter the gate and you see the gate close as they enter the park ... It truly makes me say wow. The island setting is breathtaking, the art direction and sets are amazing, but overall, the most amazing aspect are the dinosaurs ... who look incredibly real! The CGI in JP opened up a whole new door for films, yet the effects in JP are even more appealing to the eye than 60% of the CGI in films today. And that's huge for a movie made in '93! And another thing, why I love this movie, is that unlike the other 2 JP movies, this one is set in an island theme park. Everything is new, the dinosaurs are in their paddocks like at the zoo. It's cool, like they're going to a theme park!But what I most enjoy about the movie, are the action sequences. I've seen hundreds of movies, yet my favorite scene of all time is the scene where the Tyrannosaur escapes and attack the cars. It's just so amazing. The rain just adds a certain tone that draws you in, adding tons of tension; And when I see the Rex exit the fence and roar ... I'm blown away! That scene truly is the most thrilling and intense action sequence in movie history. The next scene is when the tour car falls down the tree. Man, that scene is intense, and also one of the best. Another (Well, not quite a scene) scene that's really tense, is when Ian is sitting in the jeep and he sees the footprint's water shake. The music, along with the tremors is really exciting. Lastly, The Raptors in the kitchen is another great scene which can be really suspenseful.Next, the acting ... Which I like. Goldblum is absolutely brilliant as Malcolm, and his acting gives this movie a twist. Neill, the 2 kids, and Attenborough really give this movie a heartwarming feel. And I love Samuel L. Jackson's performance. Also the director is a real strong backbone to this film. Kudos to Spielberg.Another part I truly love about this movie ... aside from the action ... is the look. And what I mean by it, is the setting and the props. I'll explain it. OK, this movie is just so brilliantly shot, with beautiful settings, props, and stages. I'll give some examples. One good example is when you see the visitor lodge for the first time. One of the best looking scenes is when you see the tour cars coming our of the tunnel, and the mountains have mist overhanging them, and then you see the fence in the background ... Brilliantly shot! Another great scene, is when they're waiting in the cars, and Tim takes out the binoculars and looks out the back window. I love that scene! It's just so 'cool looking'. I mean, it pans out and you see the rain running down the window, and the green glow of the binoculars in the dark night. Wow!After you have seen this, you'll want to experience this over and over. I have seen this so many times, I even saw it last night, yet I want to watch it again right now.I know I've gone on and on, and I hope I didn't bore you. It's just I love this film so much.This is truly an amazing film. 10 out of 10 for everything I have listed.",10,7,10,7 July 2008
