The Lobster," Watch it if you want something different and interesting
","One of the weirdest movies I have ever watched! Weird in a good way! It tells us a lot about our society, and how relationships work in our society. Colin Farrell was great as David and Rachel Weisz was also great as the short-sighted woman. It was weird and interesting, it is set in a world, you do not want to be a part of! But you wanna know about it more. Also, let me make this clear, this is not a movie for everyone, it is a very different kind of movie and doesn't follow any of the cliches set by Hollywood.",8,0,1,9 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," A great Ride
","BlackkKlansman is one of Spike Lee's best movies in years, and I would say up there with Eighth Grade as one of the best movies of the summer of 2018. John David Washington and Adam Driver carry this movie. This movie is immaculately and creatively shot. The script is all at once funny, tense, romantic, sobering, and it ends on a great call to action.",10,6,11,11 November 2018
