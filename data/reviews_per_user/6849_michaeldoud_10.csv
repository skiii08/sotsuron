Ford v Ferrari," First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.
","First Hit: I love good car movies, and this one qualifies as one of the best.It's been a while since I've been to a night showing of a film. In picking this evening time and this film, it was both pleasing and irritating to be in a nearly full theater. The fun part is that I often see films where there are less than 15 people in the theater, and seeing an almost full theater gave me hope that others will continue to support going to movie theaters.The irritation part is the noise that people make during the film presentation. Why someone thinks their remembrances of the period, or what they think about what their seeing on the screen is essential to spout out while the film is playing, is beyond me. The gentleman sitting next to me turned around just as I did the same thing and together we asked them to be quiet. It took us doing this twice for them to get that they weren't at home watching cable TV.
Despite the noise interruptions, this film unfolded in a fun way. Remembrances of the 1960s abounded with cars from the era on the streets. Yes, they were perfectly restored vehicles, but it was easy to gloss over the prettiness to enjoy the beauty of those old cars reflecting their time and place in my life. There were Shelby Cobras, Porsches, Ford Falcons, Mini, woody (fake wood) wagons, Ferraris, and Ford GT 40s.The film is about how Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) turned down Henry Ford II's (Tracy Letts) offer to buy 90% of Ferrari's car production company. In turning down Ford's offer and partnering with Fiat, Enzo made unflattering remarks about Ford and his cars to the Ford negotiation team. Angered by the personal comments, Ford vowed to beat perennial 24 Hours Le Mans race winner, Ferrari.Chief Ford negotiator, Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), was then tasked with finding a car builder who will build a Ford-based car to beat Ferrari. Finding Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), the one-time winning driver of the 24 Le Mans, to make the car, Ford believes they found their man. Henry Ford gives Shelby carte blanche to build this car.Shelby, in turn, hires his friend and race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), to be his test driver and co-builder. The main reason is that he can trust Miles as he knows cars and feels their abilities and problems as he drives them. Miles is also creative when figuring out how to make cars work better. The downside of Miles is that he's a maverick in his thinking and hates to conform to rules and being told what to do.Miles is married Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), who's amused by her husband's friendship with Shelby. There are couple scenes that this loving amusement shows up. One thing the film makes clear is that Ken is a loving devoted father who loved showing his son Peter (Noah Jupe) the ins and outs of racing.The film spends time showing Miles and Shelby developing the GT40 to race in Le Mans, but when it comes time to ship the car off to the race, Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) Senior VP at Ford, chooses another driver to drive the vehicle at the Le Mans race.Shelby is pissed, Miles is severely disappointed, and of course, the new driver doesn't feel the car like Miles would have and ends up blowing it apart during the race.Ford wants to fire Shelby for the failure, but the meeting between Ford and Shelby is fantastic because Shelby convinces Ford that he, Ford, has Ferrari where he wants him, scared. Scared because Shelby's car, with another driver, was faster than the Ferrari, especially on the straightaway at Le Mans. This was a great scene. It's reflecting Shelby's legendary ability to sell anyone on anything.Ford tells Shelby to fix the car and get it ready for the next Le Mans and that Shelby has control over the driver.The rest of the movie shows how they develop a stronger, lighter, faster GT40 car. But when Beebe intercedes again about Miles being the driver at Le Mans, Shelby takes Ford out in the GT40 and scares the crap out of him, literally.
Then at that moment negotiates with Ford to let Miles drive. As part of the deal he offers Ford his Shelby American company if Miles races and loses.It's scenes like this that are fun to watch and reminded me of the time that a friend of a friend, gave me a ride in a Lamborghini Miura, and scared the crap out of me while racing around a sizeable empty factory parking lot at a very high speed.There were sections of this 152-minute film that could have been trimmed, but I was engaged enough to not care about the lulls of uninteresting or engaging material. Other characters added to this story and made better. One such person was Chief Mechanic Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon). His ideas about creating a way to change the brake assembly were brilliant.Bale was intensely and independently outstanding in this role as race car driver Ken Miles. His ability to show tenderness and love towards his family and aggressively focused on making the car faster was terrific. Damon was wonderful as Carroll Shelby. The scene with Ford after the first loss and his fight with Miles in front of Mile's home reflected the off-told stories about the legend of Carroll Shelby. Bernthal was good as the famed Iacocca. Balfe was convincing as Ken's wife. Her support and understanding of her husband were excellently portrayed. My favorite scene shows Balfe driving Ken home while pressing him on his whereabouts. Her focused intensity was sublime. Letts was priceless as Ford II. The bullying ways he used around his staff and factory followed by his being humbled by the spin in the GT40 were terrific. McKinnon was excellent as devoted Chief Mechanic for Shelby. Beebe was appropriately arrogant, self-serving, and sharp as a foil to Shelby's vision. Girone was satisfyingly perfect as Enzo Ferrari. Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote an expansive script that could have been shortened and made crisper. However, there are some outstanding scenes in the film. James Mangold directed this film. To his credit, racing scenes can get old quick, but the excellent editing and cinematography made these scenes come alive.Overall: I liked seeing this film for multiple reasons, including that the subsequent Ford built Shelby Mustang GT-350 and GT-500 had parts made by my father's company in the late 1960s.",8,4,9,17 November 2019
Knives Out," First Hit: An enjoyable investigative romp with a group of very capable actors in an old fashion story.
","First Hit: An enjoyable investigative romp with a group of very capable actors in an old fashion story.This film reminded me of an old fashion crime drama, sort of like a 'Clue' game. What makes this movie work is the way these capable actors tell this tale of crime and deceit in both a comedic and dramatic way.Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) is an in-home nurse who has also befriended her only client, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Harlan is very wealthy from writing eighty successful mystery novels. His health is failing, hence the need for Marta. Marta has become his only true confidant because the rest of the family, except his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), totally lives off his generosity.Linda and her husband Richard (Don Johnson) live in Harlan's home and don't fully escape from Harlan's largeness because he funded Linda's successful real estate business. They have a son Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), who is arrogant, flippant, and smart while living off an allowance from Harlan.Harlan's home is large and his mother, Great Nana (K Callan) lives with him. She doesn't talk and sits in a wheelchair throughout the film but plays an important role in the story. Other family members who are living off Harlan's wealth and success include; Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), his wife Donna (Riki Lindhome) who run Harlan's publishing company. Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) who is Harlan's deceased son Neil's wife, and their daughter Meg (Katherine Langford), who receive an allowance from Harlan for Meg's schooling. Each of them are taking advantage of Harlan and during the film's story, each of these ways are explored more fully.The family has gathered to celebrate Harlan's 85th birthday. During this party, most of the family, we learn, have discussions with Harlan about his largeness towards them.The next morning, after the party, the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds Harlan dead in his study with his throat slit, it appears to be a suicide.However, someone has anonymously hired Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) a famous southern investigator to find out if it was murder or suicide. Blanc, working with the police, begin to unravel the mystery as to why Blanc was hired to be involved.The police are convinced it was suicide, but the extraordinary questioning skills of Blanc and his inquisitive mind of solving puzzles begins to shed a different light on Harlan's death. Slowly, and methodically, his interviews begin to piece a different story together.One of the funnier parts of the interviewing process by Blanc, we learn that Marta cannot lie. If she lies, she throws up. There are a couple hilarious, slightly gross, scenes of this.When the lawyer comes and the Will is read, everyone gathers to find out that Harlan has left everything, I mean everything, to Marta. The family doesn't know what to do, or how they will survive, or do they?Craig is hilariously fantastic as the investigator Benoit Blanc. His slow southern drawl and idiosyncrasies, during the interviews using the piano, are spot on funny and pointed. Evans is perfect as the conniving Ransom. His ability to be both charming and evil are perfect. Armas is sublime as Marta. Her expressions of the fear of doing something wrong, her caution because having a mother who is illegally in the country, and also wanting to do the right thing for Harlan are excellent. Curtis is outstanding as the daughter who wants more. Shannon is terrific as the son who thinks he's in charge of Harlan's business but really is just a pawn. Collette is perfectly flighty and conniving as the social influencer and thief in the name of her daughter Meg. The rest of the cast is equally good in making this a wonderful romp. Rian Johnson wrote and directed this fun filled mystery and got the best out of everyone for their roles.Overall: This was a perfect, fun filled, and enjoyable movie to sit through.",8,0,2,10 December 2019
The Irishman," First Hit: An in-depth, introspective, and a sliver of a story into the mob world's connection to Jimmy Hoffa.
","First Hit: An in-depth, introspective, and a sliver of a story into the mob world's connection to Jimmy Hoffa.This was a historical storytelling film of the life of 'The Irishman' Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). To make this happen, we begin and end this movie with Frank sitting in an old folks home telling the story of his life.The young Frank begins with his being back from his WWII stint in Italy, and now a truck driver delivering meat. He finds that he can skim some of the carcasses off and sell them for extra side money. In doing so, he slowly begins to sell to mobsters who appreciate a good deal. A chance meeting, followed by a more formal introduction with rising mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) begins a lifelong friendship. Russell gets Frank odd jobs including painting houses (which is a mob euphemism for murder) as needed by the mob.Getting caught arriving at a store, that purchased the meat, with an empty truck, the trucking company wants to convict him for theft. What happened to the meat? Frank sold it to gangsters but acts as if he's no idea what happened to the beef in the truck. It is one of the few amusing scenes in the film.Frank knows the value of keeping his mouth shut, and this trait along with his support of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters run by Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), Frank gets a new job being Hoffa's chief bodyguard.The movie generously uses CGI to move these characters back and forth through at least 50 years of life. From young men in their 20s and 30s to old men in their 70s and 80s. For the most part, it worked well.We follow these three gentlemen through their lives, including mob family wars for power.We watch them fight with the government about expanding to Cuba and the Castro regime. We watch them struggle with John F. Kennedy's election and subsequent assassination. We see how Bobby Kennedy tried to bust up the unions and Hoffa in particular, because of how Jimmy loaned the mob millions of dollars, interest-free, in union pension funds. In fact, the film makes a point of indicating that union pension funds built Las Vegas by the mob.There are softer moments in the film like how Frank's daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin as the older Peggy) visibly disliked Russell but liked Hoffa. The story also has a few tender moments of Frank and his second wife, Irene (Stephanie Kurtzuba).The scenes are shot with an authentic and matter of fact feel to them, not splashy. One-shot that stuck with me was when Russell takes Frank to a small airport to get on a plane to meet Hoffa in Detroit; the camera looks out the tiny private plane window to see Bufalino sitting in the Lincoln. Russell will wait in the car until Sheeran returns after meeting Hoffa. There was something about this shot that brought the craft of even the small things matter to the forefront.De Niro was excellent as the Irishman turned mob strong arm and Bufalino confident. The scenes with the priest towards the end were powerful as De Niro showed a lot of skill in his refusal to deeply go into making amends. Pesci was terrific as mobster Bufalino. The scene when he and Frank are just getting to know each other and speaking Italian with Russell asking him how he learned to speak Italian was very engaging. Pacino as Hoffa was convincing. I've no idea of who Hoffa was privately, but the way Pacino portrayed him here made it feel real. Paquin as Peggy was perfect. She knew deep inside who her father was and what he did, and her way of keeping her distance and her looks of disapproval were excellent. Harvey Keitel was sublime in his brief scenes as mobster kingpin, Angelo Bruno. Steven Zaillian wrote a strong and in-depth screenplay from the book 'I Heard You Paint Houses.' Martin Scorsese showed his strength in using actors he knows and trusts to bring another compelling Italian mob film story to the screen.Overall: Although very informational, it was a long film.",8,3,6,14 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," First Hit: In the end, it was satisfying and that's all that mattered.
","First Hit: In the end, it was satisfying and that's all that mattered.I was one of those guys standing in line the first day that the original 'Star Wars' film, later subtitled 'Episode IV - A New Hope,' was released (1977). The moment the words 'Star Wars' came on the screen, followed by the storyline scrolling up and fading into deep space, and lastly, the cruiser coming in overhead, I was hooked.I liked some of the subsequent films. The prequels were a mixed bag, as were the sequels. Yesterday the final movie, number nine, was viewed, and I was happy I saw the ending to the film that started it all some forty-two years ago.This film brought in many of the old characters in different scenes signaling this saga of stories' conclusion. Most of these scenes worked well, but some did not.The highlights included how they intertwined Leia's (Carrie Fisher) stored archival footage quite effectively into this story. Because of Fisher's passing, she had a more significant part than I would have imagined. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), was terrific and became the Jedi teacher, just like his teacher Obi-Wan, was to him. Luke gave Rey (Daisy Ridley) her final lessons to become a true Jedi Knight and with that lesson, the sword (OK, lightsaber) was passed to her.Her rival and representing the dark side, as Darth Vader once did to Luke, was a continuation of the previous film and well played by Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. The story also included small scenes with Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who once owned the Millennium Falcon before he lost it in a poker match to Hans Solo (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Chewbacca.However, it was Harrison Ford's addition that didn't work as well. His talk with Kylo seemed odd because of his casual GQ casual attire look didn't seem to fit the Hans of the past. Despite this, I appreciated the closure these additions provided.The goal of this story was the defeat of the dark side still headed up by Emperor Palpatine. Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who was secretly managing the demise of the Resistance with the rest of the Siths from their planet Exegol. One of the twists isn't their always twists in a Star Wars film, was that Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter. Palpatine was hoping to turn Rey to the dark side and together with Kylo, they would rule the universe and everything in it.Heading up the Resistance's battle against the dark side was Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who had inherited the Millennium Falcon and Chewbacca after Hans death in the previous story. Together they pulled all the outliers of the resistance to do one final battle against the dark side.The scenes were well done, and the photography and special effects were A-1. The first 2/3rds of the film was a mishmash of battles and strategy sessions attempting to set up the final 1/3rd. The last section built up in a predictable yet effective way.We know who's going to win this battle of light and dark, but there was enough there to make one wonder along the way. It's enough to keep you in your seat when the full-screen cinematography throws up images that touch your joy, curiosity, and memories of days gone by.Ridley is strong in this role. I never warmed up to her in the previous film, but as this film moved along, I started to accept her as the Jedi Knight savior and leader of the Resistance. Driver was excellent as Kylo. He had immediately picked up where Vader left off and even with his helmet off, Kylo's face scar says it all. Isaac isn't Ford. And to create a new captain of the Falcon is a significant role to jump into. Ford had his way, and eventually, I bought into Isaac's version of the Millennium Falcon's captain. Boyega's part was good but his overall role seemed to be minor in the scope of things. Williams was okay as Lando, and there was one scene that his charm was at the level it was when we were first introduced to him. Ford's role seemed just a bit out of place and almost like an add-on. Hamill's character was well done and I liked the inclusion. Chris Terrio and J.J. Abrams wrote a satisfying finale to this nine-film saga. J.J. Abrams also directed this effort and was able to put a final period at the end of this well-intentioned set of stories.Overall: I'm more glad than sad that this series of stories is over because at least it ended strong.",7,5,9,26 December 2019
Dunkirk," First Hit: Although many of the camera angles and shots were engaging, the flaws in the storyline kept me out of entirely falling into this movie.
","First Hit: Although many of the camera angles and shots were engaging, the flaws in the storyline kept me out of entirely falling into this movie.I do my best to ignore hoopla, reviews, and articles about films before seeing them. It causes and creates preconceived ideas that are rarely met along with providing filters that have to be ignored.Such was the case with this movie. So much noise about how great this film is.Granted the effect given by the one camera one-shot concept was good, however, it wasn't shot with one camera and it wasn't one long shot and therefore I found myself guessing what was included in the one-shot and moments when they edited to make it look like one shot one camera.If I'm watching a movie and my mind is dancing with these questions, it just means I'm not fully ensconced in the story and presentation and that isn't good.Besides the camera stuff, the other aspects that didn't work for me were: A scene when Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) he gets shot at from the German sniper soldier in a building after he crossed a destroyed bridge. Why did they simultaneously shoot each other and Schofield fall back downstairs, as if he were hit, and end up with no injuries? The German, as we expected, was hit and died. Then, how did Schofield not get hit as he was chased through the burning buildings being chased by multiple German soldiers shooting at him? How did the wounds he did received appear and disappear, yet the bandage on his right hand from a barbed wire wound early in the story consistently appear in later shots? How did Schofield and Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) not hear any of the trucks or men marching near the farmhouse where the plane crashed. One moment, the stillness and quiet of the farm is interrupted by a plane crash. Then Blake fights with the surviving German pilot, then within minutes, a whole battery of trucks and men are swarming on the same farm. Noise from the vehicles made in 1917 and the men of the advancing regiment, would have been heard long before the plane crash and certainly after it. However, here they are not, they just appear like ants scurrying around the farm.When there are this many questions running through my mind as I watch the scenes unfold, It's hard for me to be a fully engaged fan of the film.The movie's story about two men, Schofield and Blake, being ordered to locate and warn an English regiment that is pursuing the German Army that the Germans have set this pursuit up as a trap to destroy the following regiment. Specifically, Blake was given this assignment because General Erinmore (Colin Firth) has learned Blake's brother is a lieutenant in the pursuing regiment. To me, this was a questionable motivational strategy by the General. Blake was asked to select another soldier to be his companion and he chose Schofield because they were close friends. However, the overall goal and motivation to save some 1,600 men was not in question.The difficulties that Schofield and Blake endured as they cross the previous battle lines were, for the most part, engaging. However, none of the scenes were pointedly unique when compared to scenes in other films, like Peter Jackson's 'They Shall Not Grow Old,' or Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan,' or Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk.' In fact, the section where they pass through the destroyed German Artillery appeared too staged, with each piece being perfectly placed.MacKay was excellent as Blake's reluctant partner. As we know he would, he showed up with strength and compassion when needed. Chapman was perfect as Blake who was going to save his brother's regiment no matter what happened. His scene after being stabbed by the German pilot he saved, was excellent. Sam Mendes and Kristy Wilson-Cairns wrote this interesting screenplay. Mendes did a terrific job of giving the feel of a single camera single-tracked view of this story.Overall: Thought that I've seen better films are telling this sort of story.",7,0,2,11 January 2020
Joker," First Hit: Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is powerfully twisted in overt and subtle ways.
","First Hit: Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is powerfully twisted in overt and subtle ways.Arthur Fleck (Phoenix, aka Joker) works as a clown. Living with his mom Penny (Frances Conroy) in a dark Gotham low rent slum apartment, he's very thoughtful of his mother's inability to take care of herself. He has a semi-secret wish to become a standup comedian and bring smiles and joy to everyone.
While watching his favorite program, The Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) Show, he fantasizes about appearing on the show and becoming famous.In an opening scene, Fleck standing and dancing in front of a going out of business shoe store twirling a sign to entice people to visit the store. He's got his clown outfit on, face painted, and seems to enjoy what he's doing. This is the first sign of the subtle way Phoenix shares the depth of his character. There is a glint in the facial expressions that give the audience a notion that all is not right with him. He gets mugged by some kids who take his sign and, in the chase, ends up being beaten.He gets reprimanded by the company (HaHa) he works for because the sign was broken, and the shoe company wants it back.Beaten by the young thugs, a fellow clown employee, Randall (Glenn Fleshler), gives Fleck a gun for protection.We learn that Fleck has an inappropriate behavior of laughing at the wrong times when he's feeling tense. He carries a card that he hands people stating his illness.The film digs a little into his mental state with scheduled visits to a city-run social worker who can and does, prescribe a litany of drugs. The social worker, at one of their meetings, tells him the city is stopping this program, and he won't be able to get his drugs through them any longer. He plows into a dialogue about how the social worker never listens to him, askes him the same questions each and every meeting. Here again, the audience knows he's right, but we also are seeing ways that he's slipping through the cracks.This is one of the points of the film. Society in this story is one of the struggles between the haves and have-nots. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), father of the young Bruce Wayne, and a wealthy man believes that people that don't have anything need to pull themselves up from their bootstraps. He's also running for mayor. It is here and in other places this film touches on today and our current societal state of affairs where the top 1% of the people own 90% of the wealth.This point runs through this film. The story is filled with moments that reflect how society has become lawless, and there is an uncaring towards our fellow man.A turning point in the film is when Fleck, after being fired for bringing a gun to a clown gig in a children's ward of a hospital, he starts laughing while watching a tense encounter between three young drunk well-to-do businessmen who are harassing a young woman on a subway train.His inappropriate laughing causes the men to start picking on him, and during the resulting fight, he shoots and kills all three. Poignantly this attack becomes a rallying cry for the poor and disenfranchised in Gotham. All they see are the headlines that a man with a clown face (mask or makeup) stood up to three of the 'haves' and now there is a slow movement of people having protest marches and rioting with many of the participants wearing clown masks.This story is complicated, just like Fleck is complex. Being hunted by the police for the killings, learning about his past through his mother, then through records at a mental hospital, and being off his medication creates a man who is acting out of anger, loss, and desperation.When Murray shows and then posts on social media, a hilarious video of him attempting to do a standup routine, he becomes a laughingstock across the country. However, the viralness of the post, Murray decides to have Fleck on his program.The depth and complexity of the film, the character, and the way it puts a realness to the 'Joker' (DC Comics' character) was profound. It's almost a perfect layup to Heath Ledger's version of the Joker in 'The Dark Knight,' with Christian Bale being Bruce Wayne. The scenes and sets in this film are wonderfully shot. The mental hospital, the social worker's office, Flecks apartment, and the street scenes all carried the sense of a troubled world.Phoenix absolutely became this character. The overt and subtle shifts in his eyes and mouth said so much throughout the film. As someone who was disregarded by society, he ended up being the man of the moment. He kept me on the edge of wondering what he will in each scene. De Niro was oddly a curious character and excellent as an aging talk show host. He, partially, reminded me of his role as Rupert Pupkin, a wanna be talk show host, in 'The King of Comedy.' Zazie Beetz, as Sophie Dumond, Fleck's neighbor, and short-term lover was outstanding. The way she saw Fleck as someone who could relate to her was powerfully displayed when they went out, and she saw his comedy routine. Conroy, as Arthur's mother, was good in this subtle, yet pivotal role. Cullen as Wayne was a perfect reflection of a have's arrogance. Fleshler, as a manipulative friend and co-worker of Fleck, was excellent in this protective backstabbing role. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver wrote a power-packed script and screenplay. Phillips directed this story with absolute clarity of delivering the story he wanted to make.Overall: I fell into this story from the very beginning, and it worked.",9,1,1,6 October 2019
Parasite," First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.
","First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture.",10,22,35,12 October 2019
Marriage Story," First Hit: Well-acted story about a challenging process that many people go through - divorce.
","First Hit: Well-acted story about a challenging process that many people go through - divorce.This is a story about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), who met in Los Angeles and moved to New York City, where Charlie was living. Then they got married, worked together in Charlie's theater company, and had a young child, a boy named Henry (Azhy Robertson).Over time, the story has Nicole becoming lost in Charlie's shadow. Although she is the star of all his stage productions, she feels overshadowed. She's also a long way from her LA family and her family home. Her mother and father were in show business, and before meeting Charlie, Nicole had received some fame for one of her television appearances.As they contemplate the divorce, there seems to be an unspoken agreement that they will do this amicably. It is spoken that they both want the best for Henry and that both want to be involved in raising Henry.During the opening scenes showing each of them in brief scenes while a voiceover has each of them stating what they like, love, or struggle with the other person. As the scene unfolds into a current moment, they are both sitting in front of a marriage counselor mediator. Each of them has been asked to read these statements about the other. Charlie is ready willing and able; Nicole is not and storms out of the office.This made me wonder about some other underlying cause of her wanting to end the marriage. We do learn later that Charlie had a one-time affair with one of the people in his theater company.The film takes a journey across the US from New York City to Los Angeles, where Nicole and Henry visit her mother. She has decided to stay there, despite her acting in the couples' latest play heading to Broadway.Charlie travels out to visit Henry. While in LA, he learns that Nicole has seen an aggressive attorney Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), who is pushing to make this divorce contentious. When he's served with divorce papers, he feels blindsided. To protect his interests, Charlie engages a Los Angeles lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta), who wants a $25K retainer to come up with a plan to make sure Charlie gets his son Harry in New York.However, the aggressiveness of the whole thing turns Charlie off, so he engages a new, more passive attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda). During a discussion with Nicole and Nora, Charlie realizes things are out of control for him.The film then moves to tell what happens to Charlie and Nicole as they go through the divorce court process and the subsequent fallout. A touching scene towards the end shows Henry reading Nicole's list of traits to Charlie, and Nicole is standing near the door listening in. Very touching.Driver is excellent as Charlie. The scene in the bar when he's singing to his theater company employees was wonderfully staged and felt very real. Johansson was terrific as Nicole. I felt as though she captured questioning being swallowed up in Charlie's life well. Robertson, as Henry, was enjoyable as Charlie and Nicole's child. Dern was strong as an attorney who wanted her client to win on all counts. Alda was okay as the passive attorney who tried to weave the least obstructive way through the divorce. Liotta was powerful as Charlie's aggressive attorney. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this sensitive and sophisticated look at divorce.Overall: This film touched many divorce subjects and implications both sensitively and effectively.",8,3,4,12 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," First Hit: A fantastic black comedy that digs deep at the idiocy of the Nazi movement.
","First Hit: A fantastic black comedy that digs deep at the idiocy of the Nazi movement.Good black comedies are difficult to come by. In recent years 'The Death of Stalin' was one such film. As I wrote the previous sentence, I realized that both films are about corrupt leaders of countries. However, I digress.In this film, Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a lonely young boy who idolizes Adolf Hitler and his movement. He lives with his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while his dad is supposedly off fighting for the Germans in Italy.To support his belief in the Nazi movement, he's created an imaginary Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who visits him in his make-believe world. His version of Hitler is off the charts hilarious. Hitler struts around making outlandish statements and sings young Jojo's praises for admiring Hitler and what he stands for.Jojo and Rosie live in a small German town. All the young boys, like him, are signed up to be part of Hitler's youth corps. His only friend Yorki (Archie Yates), is a slightly rotund young boy with glasses, and together they are heading off to a Hitler youth camp experience.The boys and girls all gathered together at the camp are dressed up in their Nazi uniforms. They are led through hilarious drills by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a drunken Nazi Youth Camp Leader, and his counterpart, Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), for the young girls.One day while in his home alone, he hears noises upstairs and discovers a young woman Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) living in a secret compartment in the walls of a room upstairs. Elsa is Jewish and is being hidden there by Rosie. Why is his mother hiding a Jew in her home? Then we learn that maybe Elsa may also be a stand-in, of sorts, for his dead sister.Although Jojo is supposed to dislike and want to kill Jews like Elsa, he discovers that she's not a bad person and that he's falling for her in his own 11-year-old boy way.Discussing all this with his imaginary Hitler is hilarious at times. The absurd statements and thoughts about what Jojo should or should not do about his captive Jew make pointed jabs at Hitler's insane ideology.As the film moves along, we sense the end of the war is near, and the German Army is starting to lose the battle against the Russians, Europeans, and US forces. They are closing in which makes Jojo's Hitler even funnier.The film is quick-paced and moves rapidly from scene to scene. The quick-paced moments are exemplified when the boys at camp and when the war comes to their little town. However, this film knows when to linger. Scenes like when Jojo and Rosie are walking along the river, or when Jojo and Elsa are writing his book about Jews. The film is also deeply touching as shown when Jojo and Yorkie are shown hugging each other several times throughout the film. It was even moving when Captain Klenzendorf saves Jojo from being imprisoned by the allies. Later, when Jojo dances with Elsa, recalling an earlier time when Jojo danced with Rosie. In these moments the film glows.
I thought the sets and costumes were fantastic and really captured the heart of the film.Davis was extraordinary as Jojo. He carried this story with a wide range of feelings, emotions, and actions. Waititi is superb as the innovative imagination of Jojo's Adolf Hitler. He uses sarcasm, expressive physical movement, and whit to define and make this character come alive. McKenzie was sublime as Elsa. Her strength and compassion while attempting to stay alive in a country that reviled her kind was, at times, riveting. Johansson was excellent as Jojo's mother. She embodied someone straddling the line of life and death along with survival and what's right wonderfully. Rockwell was over-the-top perfect for this role. When he carefully validated Elsa's papers, you knew of his heart. Wilson was well cast as Fraulein Rahm, a woman who got away with saying outlandish things. Waititi also wrote and directed this film, and it was clear he knew what he wanted, and he got it, a fun-filled touching black comedy.Overall: This was an excellent film that also reflected the struggles of the current day.",8,30,75,12 October 2019
Midway," First Hit: Besides being too long, I didn't like and couldn't engage with the main character Dick Best (Ed Skrein).
","First Hit: Besides being too long, I didn't like and couldn't engage with the main character Dick Best (Ed Skrein).As portrayed here, Best was a pilot that liked breaking the rules, thought highly of himself and his skills, and eventually, his arrogance, depicted as bravery, helped to win the war over Japan at Midway.I don't know what it was, but if another actor played Best, I might have engaged more with this character. Actors from another time who would have made this role work would be Steve McQueen or Paul Newman. These guys had a way of being edgy but likable.There are other issues with this film that stood out as well. There were whole sections that were supposed to color the background but seemed needless. Additionally, the strategic planning of the attack on Midway became muddled.On a positive note, many of the action scenes were well choreographed and exciting to watch.This film is about how the battle of Midway became the turning point of the Pacific War between the United States and Japan. Early on, we see Pearl Harbor being bombed. This was particularly effective and was well depicted with the surprise and the panic that set in after the attack.The US goal was to hit back at Japan in a way that would have them rethink their choice to attach the United States.The key players in this story are Best, Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson), who was an intelligence officer, and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson). Layton had developed data, with a team of intelligence analysts, that gave him a hunch that the Pearl Harbor attack was coming. Nimitz had heard about Layton's ideas and after his assignment to head the Pacific Fleet, he told Layton to bring him information that would allow his decimated fleet to execute a surprise counterattack.Midway was that surprise attack. In addition to this story, there were side stories. One was about Vice Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey (Dennis Quaid), who was the on-boat commander of the aircraft carrier leading the fleet. He had a horrible case of shingles, which eventually put him out of commission. There was also a story about Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) who first bombed Japan, and because the way the mission worked out, he and his entire squadron had to ditch their planes because they ran out of fuel.There are also sweet scenes with Best and his wife Anne (Mandy Moore), one of the few who understood and embraced her husband's erratic intensity. There are also depictions of Japanese ship commanders and Admirals, which are brief and attempt to show the ignorance of and blind devotion to the war effort as commanded by their emperor.Skrein was not likable as Best. What I don't know was it Skrein or his character I didn't like or want to champion. Eckart, in the bombing of Japan side story, was solid as Doolittle. Wilson was excellent as the intelligence officer Layton. The scene where he is pressed for the details on the theory of a Midway attack by the Japanese was powerful. Harrelson gave a strong performance as Nimitz. His belief in his team, especially Layton, was well executed. Quaid was good as Halsey, a 'bull' of a man. Moore was excellent as the trusting and understanding wife of the film's wildcard character. Wes Tooke wrote a meandering script that seemed to take in too many stories. Roland Emmerich had an excellent eye for many of the action scenes, but the story seemed to take too large a bite.Overall: Because I couldn't get into the main character, the film fell flat.",3,6,13,16 November 2019
