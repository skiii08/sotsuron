It," Loved this adaptation
","I loved the book and I loved this adaptation. I don't understand the flippant negative reviews of this film because it was very well thought out and wonderfully acted. I've been a fan of Stephen King since I read the Dead Zone 30 years ago, and this version of It is among the very best cinematic adaptations of his work, right up there with Stand By Me and Carrie. i think it speaks volumes that King himself was not prepared for how good the film would be and saw it twice when it was first released. Yes, there are major differences from the book and this is the first of two films, but it captures well the feel of the original novel, and the relationships between the young characters are nicely developed. The film is terrifying at times, but many of the scary scenes have an underlying sadness that gives them extra depth. One of my favourite scary movies, without a doubt.",9,7,13,23 September 2017
