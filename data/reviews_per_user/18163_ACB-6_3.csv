The Blair Witch Project," Can you say boring?
","Alright, so this movie did wonders for the independent film industry; it showed a low-budget film could do just as well as a multi-million dollar film, but it does not mean the movie was good. I viewed this movie based on the great reviews it was getting, but I left the theater wishing I had waited for someone to rent the video so I could watch it.  Maybe it is because I live in a heavy wooded area, but I found nothing bone-chilling about the movie.  It got a little boring watching people scream at each other for an hour.  The ending was kind of neat, but the story until this point left me checking my watch to see how much longer until the end. People raved about the camera work in the film.  I appreciate artistic film work, but an hour and a half of shaky camera work, and many shots of pitch darkness is not a movie, it is a bad home video.  Yes this camera style functioned well in scenes, but it became an annoyance several times. Maybe I am old fashioned, but The Blair Witch Project will not be my favorite terror movie.  As far as I am concerned Hitchcock will always be the master of terror and suspense (and masterful camera work).",1,1,3,11 February 2000
Chinatown," A classic mystery of murder, politics, and love
","Chinatown is a classic mystery full of twists and turns.  Jack Nicholson is a private investegator who becomes part of an elaborate plot to kill the head of the Los Angeles water department.  From the start Nicholson knows something is up, and begins to discover a huge scandal.This movie often receives unfavorable comments because the plot can be difficult to follow.  The first time I saw the movie, I was very confused. However, after watching it again the movie made more sense.  The script is so well written, if you miss one little part of the dialogue you could be lost for the rest of the movie.The movie marks a highlight for Roman Polanski (this is my favorite movie by Polanski), and Jerry Goldsmith (this is my favorite musical score by Goldsmith).  If it had not been for The Godfather II coming out the same year, Chinatown may have run off with an incredible number of Oscars.The best part of the movie is how well the movie flows into the final scene.  After watching the movie several times, I continually pick out more and more of the symbolism and foreshadowing throughout the storyline.This movie is incredible.  Great acting from Jack Nicholson, John Huston, and Faye Dunaway.  Great directing from Roman Polanski.  Great screenwriting by Robert Towne, and great music provided by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you have not seen this movie, put it high on your must see list.  If you have seen the movie, I urge you to watch it more than once.",10,0,1,27 April 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," My #1 movie
","So, what makes this movie my favorite?  Simple, every aspect of the film is perfect.  The acting is incredible, Alec Guinness won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Colonel Nicholson.  The Cinematography, which also won an Academy Award, is beautiful (If you purchase this video, buy the widescreen. The formatted version does not capture the Cinematography as well.)  The musical score by Malcolm Arnold is great (Malcolm Arnold received an Oscar for his score).  The Screenplay is wonderful, and an amazing achievement considering two blacklisted writers were responsible for it.  Both Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson won an Academy Award for their screenplay.OK, so much for awards, but the little things make this movie great.  There are so many great lines and scenes throughout the movie.  The movie never tries to show the Japanese as the bad guys (just the enemy in war), but shows their constant fight to maintain their code of honor.  This is the ultimate struggle of the movie, can honor exist in war?  The British fight to maintain their honor, and the Japanese try to force their code of honor onto the British prisoners.  The movie has a message that should last through the ages.The final scene of the movie must be one of the greatest of all time.  I will not give it away if anybody has not seen it, but when you do the final scene will blow you away, as will the movie.",10,0,1,13 April 1999
