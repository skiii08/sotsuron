The Legend of Bagger Vance," Oh christ.
","Robert Redford couldn't direct warm water into a sink of soapy dishes.  This cast, this story, this script should have sung.  The failure of harmony and melody rest entirely with the skill of the man at the con.  Unless Redford's direction was a metaphor for Junuh's lost golf swing, this movie sucked and it was all his fault.",2,3,7,31 August 2003
Scarface," Overrated
","This movie can't hide behind the 'dated' excuse, since it's an '80s adaptation of a '30s success.The tone, the pacing, the acting (Pacino's Tony Montana is a cartoon), the editing, all point to one thing: A director who couldn't put a good film in the can if he accidentally took one of Scorsese's home from the printer.The script is one of Oliver Stone's best efforts, and the theme was over-the-top topical. Given real production values and someone willing to spend time cutting it together properly it could have been a great movie. But Brian de Palma is like Tony Montana, ignoring his lack of talent or judgment and completing the job on balls alone, and everyone in his vicinity dies out of negligence, association, or misapprehension.",4,3,4,27 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Only just barely better than Ep. I
","Still suffers from Lucas' inability to write, and difficulty in directing actors.  Reminiscent of Empire in that it's less of a complete story than a connection between the one before and the one after, and in the division of the plot with protagonists separating.  Beyond that, it fails to evoke the wonder and inner beauty of the galaxy, settling for heartless, brainless action and a matte-painting, picture-postcard substitute for beauty.",1,0,2,29 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lacked a central plot.
","Pardon my lack of prejudice as I've not read the books.  Where's the story? This reminds me of The Empire Strikes Back.  It ends with no resolution. It's beautiful, sure, but for all the chapters, it has no compelling, self-contained plot of its own.  The fellowship? Seemed to be formed late and suspended in convenience for some future arc.  Bilbo's independence? Perhaps, but it too was forged in the fires of setup.  Aragorn and Boromir? Rather subjugated.  Many things begun, none of great power completed.  I want to see the payoff for Arwen's pledge; that'll be something; there is one, right?  It's beautiful, sure, but some scenes rather overdid the ethereality that didn't need it, though those that needed it did it very well.  On anticipation that the trilogy will play in three wonderous acts, I've given it an 8, but I'd like to have seen this part have a quality that stands it on its own.",8,0,0,14 August 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Not even very good chop-socky
","This was the 'wall of sound' episode of The Matrix, and had no real ending.Certainly none that made more sense than 'see you next time we need a hundred million bucks.'....",1,0,1,24 April 2004
